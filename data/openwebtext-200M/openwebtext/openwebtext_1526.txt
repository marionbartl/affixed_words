Do n’t get used to it , but here ’s another unfinished comic that would have gone stale if I waited to publish it in newspapers .

Cable cars , also known as ropeways or aerial tramways , do n’t get much respect .
These types of transportation systems , in which a cabin or other conveyance is suspended from a fixed cable and pulled by another cable , are often thought of as tourist - movers .
But cable cars can have some practical applications in urban settings .
They are especially useful where inclines are too steep for conventional mass transit and where they can serve as feeders to bus and metro systems .
They have been successfully applied in growing cities of the developing world , where slums are often clustered on precipitous hills surrounding urban centers .
Doppelmayr / Garaventa Group , a ropeway engineering company , published a brochure , “ Aerial Ropeways as an Innovation Solution for Urban Transport , ” that outlines many of the benefits of cable car systems , including the following :
They are a low - emissions form of transportation , as their motion generates less resistance than land - bound transport , so less electrical power is required to drive the ropes .
Additionally , less energy is required for start - up because they move continuously .
Their aerial position means they can be readily integrated into the cityscape and combined with other elements of the public transit network without encountering obstacles on the ground .
They do n’t compete with traffic .
They provide no -wait service , moving continuously without interruption .
Service frequency can be adjusted to suit demand by varying the speed of the circulating rope , eliminating empty runs in off - peak times and waiting times during peak periods .
They require little space .
They are accessible to passengers with impaired mobility and wheelchair users because the cabin floor is level with the platform .
They can be equipped with wireless connection allowing direct audio / CCTV communication between cabins and stations .
Critics note the potential safety issues presented by cable car systems .
In the case of an emergency , such as a power outage , passengers will be stranded in the cabins .
The Medellín system is addressing this issue by providing a communication system in every cabin should an emergency occur .
Below we describe several examples of cable car systems .
Medellín Metrocable
Medellín , Colombia ’s gondola lift system , called Metrocable , provides a complementary transit service to Medellín ’s Metro .
In fact , Metrocable is a branch of Metro , and both are managed by the same corporation and can be used for a single fare .
Metrocable was designed to reach some of the least developed suburban areas of Medellín , poor barrios on the hills surrounding the city that cannot be reached by conventional public transit .
Opened in 2006 , Metrocable was intended to connect the inhabitants of these barrios to the rest of the city .
It has succeeded in easing their commutes and has also helped revitalize some of the areas it passes through .
“ People in Santo Domingo [ one of the barrios ] used to say that they were n’t part of Medellin , ” says a cable car engineer .
“ They had to take three separate buses to get to it .
But now they feel that they are involved in the city . ”
Metrocable has also become popular among tourists because of its spectacular views of the valley .
The newest line was inaugurated in February to connect tourists and locals to Park Arvi , a nature reserve just outside Medellín .
The new line is expected to improve security in the area , reducing the presence of paramilitaries and guerrillas .
It will also provide residents access to open space , something they do n’t always get much of .
Algiers Telepherique
In Algiers , Algeria , a cable car facilitates travel between the modern part of the city built on the level ground by the seashore and the ancient city on a steep hill .
It serves as a connection to other mass transit modes , and brings tourists to Notre Dame d’Afrique ( Our Lady of Africa ) , a Roman Catholic church on a cliff overlooking the Bay of Algiers .
Caracas Teleférico
Like Medellín , Caracas , Venezuela is in a valley surrounded by hills .
Many residents live in the poor barrios in the hills and work in the valley .
In its heyday in the mid-1900s , the city ’s cable car connected Caracas with the Caribbean coast on the other side of the mountains .
But the system was closed in 1988 , and it was not until a few years ago that the Caracas side reopened .
( For a more detailed history , see this travelogue in the Economist ) .
Today , the teleférico carries passengers to Avila Mountain , a national park , and as it ’s integrated with the Metro system , eases the commutes of barrio residents .
Taipei Maokong Gondola
The Maokong Gondola in Taipei , Taiwan opened in 2007 to connect passengers from Maokong , a popular tea-tasting destination , and the Taipei Municipal Zoo , located high up in the city ’s surrounding hillsides .
The system was designed to ease traffic over the mountains and shorten travel time .
But the system has been controversial .
The cable cars were suspended for more than a year following damage to the support pillars caused by typhoon - related mudslides in 2008 .
The temporary closing affected local small business owners , whose revenues dropped nearly 90 percent over the past 18 months , according to one news report .
Other problems have included lightning strikes , noise pollution , poor ventilation , and other technical glitches .
Critics of the system cite weak management and government inefficiency .
“ What should have been a good thing has become a mess , ” wrote Ko Cheng - en in an op - ed piece .
The system finally re-opened at the end of March 2010 , attracting large crowds with free rides and a cable car with a glass floor , suggesting that the system has become less of an everyday mobility solution and more of a tourist attraction .
Nonetheless , there ’s no doubt that the Maokong Gondola has improved accessibility to some of the city ’s previously hard - to - reach destinations .
Cigarettes into lollipops , guns into water guns , wine into water .
These are n't religious miracles , but rather , something else entirely .
Hooray !

アニメ『ワンピース』、日本版とアメリカ版ではこんなに違う [ へち ま ]
[ Remedy animation programmer Henrik Enqvist takes a look at how the team created a believable tweed cloth simulation on the title character 's jacket in the Microsoft - published Xbox 360 exclusive horror - thriller Alan Wake . ]
The main character in our action thriller is Alan Wake , a writer who gets trapped in a nightmarish scenario where he is forced to fight dark forces while trying to solve the mystery of his missing wife .
He is not a well - trained action hero , but rather an everyday guy .
To establish his character our art director wanted him to wear an old tweed jacket with arm patches .
As the game takes place in a real - world setting , the tools for giving characters personality are limited , compared to a fantasy game or a space shooter .
Therefore the clothes that our characters wear become far more important .
Alan Wake 's jacket had to be as believable as possible to maintain the illusion of a thriller atmosphere to the player .
The jacket needs to move in the wind and add a nice secondary motion to the character as he rushes through the forest .
As a programmer , you immediately start to think about a cloth simulation .
A lot of games before us had already shipped with cloth simulation , but often those methods gave the impression of either silk or rubber -- something that we did n't want .
Just recently , some very good third party solutions for cloth simulation have shipped , but at the point when we needed to have a stable solution such tools did n't exist , or did n't serve our needs .
This article will take a look at the challenges we encountered and present the solutions for rolling our own cloth simulation .
Even if you are familiar with the methods described here , the way we put things together should make for some interesting reading .
The Jacket Rig
The jacket was modeled together with the rest of the character as a regular skinned mesh .
The bones driving the jacket mesh are a separate layer on top of the normal skeleton .
The sleeves of the jacket use the normal upper and lower arm setup .
Both upper and lower arms are split into one main bone and one twist bone .
The upper jacket is driven by look - at constraints and a Verlet simulation drives the lower jacket .
Figure 1 .
The jacket rig on top of the regular game skeleton .
The Upper Jacket
The jacket bones are parented top - down so that when the upper bones move the lower bones will follow .
We were tempted to parent the lower bones straight to the thorax , but that would have caused us to lose motion -- especially the vertical motion in the jacket when the character raises his shoulders .
In the upper jacket , we mimic the motion of real shoulder pads by driving the shoulder bones with look - at constraints towards spots on the upper arms .
This way the shoulder pad will follow the upper arm and when the arm is raised the shoulder pad will lift the rest of the bones -- just as a real jacket .
The following bones in the chain are a layer between the upper jacket and the simulated lower jacket .
These bones are driven by look - at constraints straight down so that they compensate for the rotation that the shoulders cause .
We also added position constraints between the left and the right bone to compensate for the stretching that occurs when the shoulder pads move .
Figure 2 .
The bones move when character raises his arm .
It might have been a good enough solution to implement the constraints in the animation exporter and bake the results into the animation data , but we still opted for driving the bones in real - time inside the game engine .
This way we could save a few bytes in the animation data and we were also able to easily share animations between characters regardless whether they were wearing jackets or not .
Also the shoulder movement generated by in - game IK ( e.g. when aiming ) became correctly applied when solving the constraints in real - time .
The Lower Jacket
After the upper jacket is solved we take a look at simulating the lower part of the jacket .
Most cloth simulations in games have a one - to - one mapping between the vertices in a cloth simulation and the vertices in the rendered mesh .
In our case we wanted to preserve the fidelity of the jacket mesh and not have it held back by any coder - dictated constraints .
For example , the silhouette of the pockets and the front part of the jacket would have been lost if we would have settled for a having the same mesh for simulation as for rendering .
Normal maps could have been utilized to give shape to the jacket but we felt that this was n't enough .
Instead we wanted our artists to freely shape the jacket anyway they wanted and then allow them to use the normal maps to add wrinkles or other detail instead of making up for lost geometry .
Our solution to this was to have a low - resolution cloth mesh used for simulating the jacket and then map that to the bones in the skeleton that was used for driving the skinned mesh .

R.J. Umberger of the Columbus Blue Jackets turned from a hockey player to a hockey analyst on Saturday night following his teams ' game against the Washington Capitals .
He outraged a lot of people in D.C. with the following post - game quote , via the Columbus Dispatch .
â† µ “ I do n’t think any team in the West would be overmatched by them .
Because they play the wrong way .
They want to be moving all the time .
They float in their zone looking for breakaways and odd - man rushes .
A good defensive team is going to beat them ( in the playoffs ) .
If you eliminate your turnovers and keep them off the power play , they ’re going to get frustrated because they ’re in their zone a lot . ” â† µ

Off with their heads !
France brings back the guillotine - but just in a museum as it's put on display for the first time
A guillotine has gone on show in France for the first time since the deadly contraption was made redundant three decades ago .
The device – complete with its razor sharp blade uniquely designed for separating heads from bodies – forms the centrepiece of a new ‘ Crime and Punishment ’ exhibition at the Orsay Museum in central Paris .
It was put there following requests from those who campaigned to abolish it prior to capital punishment being outlawed across the Channel in 1981 .
A quick death ?
A 14ft tall guillotine has gone on show in the Crime and Punishment exhibition at the Orsay Museum in central Paris
There had been concerted efforts to get rid of the infamous ‘ Madame Guillotine ’ since the height of the French Revolution of the 1790s when it started its work killing thousands , from the former queen , Marie Antoinette , to post - war murderers .
Robert Badinter , the former justice minister who saw it outlawed , said : ‘ The guillotine , this instrument of death , has become the object of a museum .
What a symbol - what a victory for the supporters of abolition !’
In 1972 Badinter was an up - and - coming barrister when he witnessed his ‘ old enemy slicing through the neck ’ of Roger Bontems , a 27 - year - old client , who had been sentenced to death .
Bloody retribution : Eugen Weidmann , a German who confessed to six murders , is executed by the guillotine outside of St Pierre Prison in Paris in the early morning of 17th June 1939 .
As the blade falls down , one of the executioners holds Weidmann 's legs
The last victim : Convicted murderer Hamida Djandoubi was beheaded at Baumettes prison in Marseille in 1977
Created by a harpsichord maker and favoured tool of the Nazis :
How the guillotine created terror for 200 years
The first machine was created by Tobias Schmidt , a German engineer and harpsichord maker employed for the purpose by Louis XVI .
The first execution by guillotine was performed on French highwayman Nicolas Jacques Pelletier on April 5 , 1792 .
It was named after Dr Guillotin , the Deputy of Paris , who made the original proposal that all condemned criminals be beheaded on the grounds of humanity and equality .
Since then , the guillotine has been the only legal execution method in France until the abolition of the death penalty in 1981 – apart from certain crimes against the security of the state , which resulted in execution by firing squad .
During the 13 - month ‘ Reign of Terror ’ , 1,225 people were executed in Paris and virtually the whole French aristocracy were sent to the guillotine during the French Revolution – including Queen Marie Antoinette .
The oldest guillotine victims during the French Revolution were two 92 - year - old women .
The youngest was just 14 .
The guillotine was also used in Algeria , Belgium , Germany , Greece , Italy , Switzerland , Sweden , Tunisia and Vietnam .
The last guillotining in France took place as recently as 1977 when Hamida Djandoubi , a convicted murderer who had tortured and raped his victims , was beheaded at Baumettes prison in Marseille .
The method had not changed since the Revolution , when crowds including young children and old hags known as ‘ tricoteuses ’ because they were always knitting , used to build up in Paris squares to cheer and shout at the spectacle .
During the so - called ‘ Reign of Terror ’ lists would be published of all those due to die .
The blood - thirsty events became so frequent that they became part of Gallic popular culture .
While Djanboubi was killed behind close doors , the last public guillotining took place in 1939 when Eugen Weidmann , who had been convicted of six murders , was cheered to his grisly end at a prison in Versailles , close to Paris .
Members of the crowd revelled in the slaughter , with one even filming the bloody event – prompting the authorities to review their execution methods .
They were also concerned that the guillotine used was not in perfect working order – ensuring a lingering , painful death rather than clinical , swift one .
Joseph - Ignace Guillotin , an anatomy professor from Paris medical school , had designed the device in 1791 as one which could end life without inflicting pain .
A unique mechanism involving a huge , slanted blade , pulleys and a hinged neck harness was effectively meant to cause instant death .
But this ‘ humane ’ approach was often called into question , with fears that the swift impact actually caused pain and suffering .
Decapitation was so swift , that the brain might take a few seconds to register decapitation , medics argued .
Post - mortems often revealed eyelids moving up and down , and that faces quivered .
It was not surprising , therefore , that some of the worst mass murderers in history went on to embrace the device , including Adolf Hitler .
His Nazi henchman ordered 20 from France in the 1930s , and went on to kill no less than 17,000 people with them up until the end of the Second World War .
The contraption on show at the Orsay is an 1872 model designed by Leon Alphonse Berger , and the last working model in mainland France .
Queen Marie Antoinette lost her head to the guillotine during the French Revolution - as did virtually the whole French aristocracy
House Minority Leader John Boehner is dismissing a Democratic push for immigration reform as a ploy to drum up midterm election votes , saying that ' no one believes ' it will pass in Congress .
Boehner backs Ariz . law , rips Dems
House Minority Leader John Boehner is dismissing a Democratic push for immigration reform as a “ cynical ploy ” to drum up midterm election votes , saying that “ no one believes ” it will pass in Congress .
Boehner made the comments in a closed meeting with the House Republican Conference , GOP sources said .

Senate Democrats have accelerated a push for comprehensive immigration reform in the wake of a tough anti-immigrant law signed last week by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer ( R ) .
The Arizona law requires police to stop people if they have “ reasonable suspicion ” that the person might be an undocumented immigrant .
If the person ca n’t produce valid identification , they can be fined and jailed for up to six months .
Boehner told reporters that Arizona was within its constitutional rights in passing the law .
“ It has a 70 percent approval in Arizona and I think that we ought to respect the people of Arizona in their right to make their own decisions , ” Boehner said .
The Arizona law has drawn fire from a number of civil rights groups and religious organizations , some of which have compared Arizona ’s law to Jim Crow , Nazi Germany or apartheid South Africa .
Rep. Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) , the only Jewish Republican and his party ’s no. 2 in the House , ripped a fellow Jewish lawmaker for comparing the Arizona law to Nazi Germany before World War II .
“ I think that that kind of analogy is something that is inappropriate in this discussion , ” Cantor said .
Referencing Nazi Germany has “ no place in this debate , ” Cantor said .
Rep. Jared Polis ( D - Colo. ) told POLITICO
Monday that the new Arizona law is “ absolutely reminiscent ” of Nazi Germany before World War II .
“ I fear that Arizona is headed for a police state and it really underscores the need for immigration reform at the federal level to fix our system , ” he said .
HONG KONG — Google , fresh off a dispute with China over censorship and intrusion from hackers , says it has identified cyber - attacks aimed at silencing critics of a controversial , Chinese - backed bauxite mining project in Vietnam .
In attacks it described as similar to but less sophisticated than those at the core of its spat with China , Google said malicious software was used to infect “ potentially tens of thousands of computers , ” broadly targeting Vietnamese speaking computer users around the world .
Infected machines had been used to spy on their owners and to attack blogs containing messages of political dissent , wrote Neel Mehta of the company ’s security team in a post late Tuesday on Google ’s online security blog .
McAfee , the computer security firm , said in a separate blog posting that it believed “ the perpetrators may have political motivations and may have some allegiance to the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam . ”
Evolution education is under attack in Weston , Connecticut , but not from the usual direction .
Nobody is promoting intelligent design in the curriculum , or asking schools to teach evolution 's " strengths and weaknesses . "
There 's just an administration afraid that teaching third graders too much about Charles Darwin will cause trouble .
" They might have just been looking to avoid controversy , but that has the same effect , " said Steve Newton , programs and policy director at the National Center for Science Education . "
If you 're not looking to teach children the best science , that harms their education . "
At issue is a class section proposed in 2008 by Mark Tangarone , teacher of the third , fourth and fifth grade Talented and Gifted program at the Weston Intermediate School .
Tangarone wanted his third graders to study and compare the accomplishments of Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin .
To learn about Darwin , students would have retraced the path of the HMS Beagle , the expedition that inspired a young Darwin 's theory of evolution .
Each student would study a stop in the voyage , reporting on the animals and adaptations that Darwin observed .
When Tangarone ran his class plan by then - principal Mark Ribbens , he was denied .
In an email obtained by the Weston Forum , Ribbens explained that his objections had nothing to do with the soundness of the theory of evolution .
Instead , he was worried about parent reaction .
“ While evolution is a robust scientific theory , it is a philosophically unsatisfactory explanation for the diversity of life .
I could anticipate that a number of our parents might object to this topic , " wrote Ribbens .
" It is not appropriate to have [ Darwin's ] work or the theory part of the TAG program since the topic is not age appropriate . "
Ribbens explained further , " Evolution touches on a core belief – Do we share common ancestry with other living organisms ?
What does it mean to be a human being ?
I do n’t believe that this core belief is one in which you want to debate with children or their parents , and I know personally that I would be challenged in leading a 10 - year - old through this sort of discussion while maintaining the appropriate sensitivity to a family ’s religious beliefs or traditions . ”
However , the class was n't out of step with official state science standards [ .doc ] .
At the time , these instructed teachers to impart to third graders the ability to " describe how different plants and animals are adapted to obtain air , water , food and protection in specific land habitats . "
That section of the standards was subtitled , " Heredity and Evolution – What processes are responsible for life ’s unity and diversity ? "
Ribbens left the school this year , and Tangarone asked to teach his Darwin program again .
The request was rejected , and Tangarone submitted a letter of resignation on February 12 , the date of Darwin 's birthday .
" I feel that Weston has become anti-science and no longer a place I feel comfortable teaching in , " said Tangarone , who will retire two years early .
" I never dreamed this would be an issue in Weston , " he said .
It 's a highly educated community .
Many parents work in New York .
There are authors , artists and scientists .
They 're committed to education for their children . "
Weston Public Schools superintendent Jerry Belair did not respond to requests for an interview .
According to Newton , the motives of school administrators are not in doubt .
" They just wanted to avoid controversy , " he said .

This past Saturday afternoon I was channel surfing and stopped at LTV ( Lighthouse Television – the local TBN affiliate ) .
I do n’t recall the name of the show , but it was one of those shows where there is a host who interviews a different guest for each episode of the show for them to discuss their Christian experiences .
The guest that day was a guy called Godwin Bategeka who works with a ministry called Above the Waters .
He was narrating an ordeal he had experienced while undergoing an operation a while back .
I will paraphrase what he said from what I can recall .
Basically he had been seriously ill for a while , and he had not been responding to treatment he had been undergoing .
At some point an operation was required to save him .
On the day of his operation , he was told by his doctors that they would be administering Ketamine to him .
They made sure to inform him of what the side effects of Ketamine would be .
According to Bategeka ’s account , the doctors informed him that Ketamine was hallucinogenic , and warned him he might have hallucinations while he was undergoing the medical procedure .
After being taken into the theatre , Bategeka said he felt himself leaving his body , and rising above the operating table .
Then , he felt himself passing through the ceiling in a sensation he described to be like ‘ breaking through ice ’ .
As Bategeka narrated his ordeal , the host of the show kept interjecting with amen , praise him and other common Christian declarations of faith in the appropriate places as might be expected on a Christian TV show when someone is offering a testimony .
Once he had ‘ broken through ’ the ice , he said he found himself in a place flooded with bright light .
In this place he said he saw Jesus who embraced him and welcomed him into heaven .
Bategeka , however , felt that his ‘ time ’ really had n’t come , so pleaded with Jesus to send him back to earth .
Jesus apparently honoured this request , and sent him back .
When he came to , he was informed by his doctors that during his operation he had been moving about and could be heard mumbling .
Once Bategeka was done telling the story , he and the host both marvelled at the power and love of ‘ God ’ .
Bategeka then said he felt fortunate to have had the experience of meeting Jesus personally .
He was also glad that Jesus had ‘ sent him back ’ .
WHAT ???
At this point I began laughing hysterically .
For goodness ’ sake , THE DOCTORS TOLD HIM HE WOULD HAVE HALLUCINATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE MEDICATION !!!
Did this guy forget what he had just told the audience only moments ago ?
Afterwards I did a little research on Ketamine and found the following information :
Ketamine produces a dissociative state , characterised by a sense of detachment from one ’s physical body and the external world which is known as depersonalization and derealization .
At sufficiently high doses ( e.g. 150 mg intramuscular ) , users may experience what is coined the " K - hole " , a state of dissociation whose effects are thought to mimic the phenomenology of schizophrenia .
Users may experience worlds or dimensions that are ineffable , all the while being completely unaware of their individual identities or the external world .
Users have reported intense hallucinations including visual hallucinations , perceptions of falling , fast and gradual movement and flying , ‘ seeing God ’ , feeling connected to other users , objects and the cosmos , experiencing psychotic reactions , and shared hallucinations , and thoughts with adjacent users .

Hallucinogenic substances make people see a lot of strange things .

I ’ve spent the past few weeks here at work researching and playing with NoSQL databases ( and especially MongoDB ) for a new feature we ’re developing that does n’t easily fit into a relational model .
And so far , I really like what I see .
The profoundness of the shift away from the relational model and the implications that has just blow my mind .
You no longer have to fragment your data to persist it .
You just store it .
That ’s it .
No more hours toiling over the design your table schema and how to break apart the data you put together just to fit it into a relational model .
You can now store your data exactly how you use it in your application , with no other special needs or impedance mismatches .
Going back to an RDBMS system now just seems illogical – it ’s like breaking apart a camera tripod just to fit it in the same standard size case you ’ve been using for years instead of just collapsing it and finding a different case that fits it better .
All that effort you go though tearing down your tripod and putting it back together every time you use it is wasted and unnecessary .
It ’s a symptom of the larger problem that your case does n’t fit your tripod .
more
Once you fully get the NoSQL viewpoint and the implications it has on the future of data storage , you have one of those “ why did n’t anyone think of this sooner ? ” moments .
And yes , I know key / value stores like memcached existed long before this whole new “ NoSQL ” movement , but it ’s not quite the same thing .
Object Databases
Object databases are an interesting case .
They are in the “ NoSQL ” category and solve the same problem other NoSQL databases do – creating a storage mechanism that fits your data instead of making your data fit a predefined rigid storage mechanism .
So why did n’t they catch on ?
What gives ?
It ’s anyone ’s guess why object databases did n’t catch on and achieve widespread adoption , but one thing is for sure – object databases really missed the boat while other NoSQL database technologies are running rings around them .
The primary problem is that most object databases are designed for a specific language , like Java or .NET .
Some have more language support than others , but the problem is still the same – by integrating in directly with a language ’s object model they depend on specific language implementations , which severely limits adoption .
They solve the impedance mismatch problem that RDBMSes present , but fail to provide language - agnostic data persistence and access , effectively tying their use to specific technology stacks and platforms .
The Best of Both Worlds
NoSQL databases are gaining traction like no other database technology has in over 30 years .
The reason is that good NoSQL databases solve both key data storage problems : impedance mismatches AND language - agnosticism .
By storing the data in an intermediary format like JSON ( or BSON ) and allowing custom file content types , the focus is on the actual data itself instead of specific technologies or data models .
The technology stack becomes irrelevant , and the walls to gaining user adoption crumble .
The bottom line is that NoSQL databases are not just the latest fad .
They represent a fundamental paradigm shift in data storage and are an entirely new way of thinking about how to store and access your data in a way that makes sense for your actual usage .
NoSQL databases are absolutely something you should be paying attention to and following closely – they are a strong contender to the RDBMS model and will likely become the de-facto data storage choice for most new web applications within a decade and a solid alternate choice .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Our yearlong health care debate has exposed some truths that have provided one more reason to conclude that the federal government ’s finances are out of control .
There is too much debt ; taxes and spending are too high ; and there is no projected end to budget deficits .
In addition , politicians of both parties , over many decades , have made entitlement promises - such as Social Security and Medicare - that can not be honored .
They have borrowed so much from foreign creditors that heretofore sovereign decisions may be influenced by such creditors .
Their entitlement promises will burden us with ever - increasing payroll taxes .
They have added new tax rules and levies that make the tax code unintelligible .
And they have created federal programs that the 10th Amendment to the Constitution ( “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people ” ) intended to prohibit .
If America wishes to change this trajectory , it needs new and bold thinking .
Here is one candidate : Repeal the 16th Amendment to the Constitution ( ratified Feb. 3 , 1913 ) which gives Congress the power to lay and collect taxes , and replace it with an amendment that requires each state to remit to the federal government a certain percent of its tax revenue .
This would change the game .
Here ’s why :
Let ’s assume that each state would have to transfer one - third ( it could be a different ratio ) of its tax - and - fee revenue to the federal government .
The federal government would have to constrain its spending , for it would not control its source of revenue .
New programs would be severely limited because there would be no authority to finance them .
This dynamic would force the creation of new programs by the states because they would still have the authority to tax .
The federal government could still issue debt , but given the discipline of markets , this would be self - limiting because the government would not be able to tax in order to pay principal and interest when due .
New entitlements would be limited for the same reason .
Federal spending ultimately would be limited to the necessities of government .
Other spending and programs would now be the states ’ purview .
But here , too , the dynamic would change .
Under the assumption that one - third of state revenue goes to Washington , each state would have to raise taxes equal to 150 percent of any program ’s cost .
This premium would compete in the open market , which could provide the same service for one - third less .
States would find it difficult to persuade their residents to pay such a premium .
This would be true even if our country had only one state .
But with 50 states , each would be constrained not only by the price premium but by the competition from the other 49 states .
More goods and services would be provided by the market because the costs would be less .
State governments would be priced out because of the one - third transfer , and the federal government would be constrained because it would have no taxing authority , even though it would have tax revenue .
Goods and services would be provided by markets through the free decisions of producers and consumers , and at a fraction of government costs .
There would be a temporary martial tax in the case of war , as well as a temporary tax to finance the transition costs of existing entitlements .
I am not aware of any country that has such a system .
Perhaps the closest was the United States before 1913 , when it had little constitutional authority to levy taxes .
But even then , the state tax transfer and its benefits did not exist .
Today ’s response to our fiscal concerns is primarily political .
It is manifested by the Tea Party movement , unusually spirited town meetings , the Massachusetts election of Republican Scott Brown to the Senate and , to some extent , the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections .
There is grass - roots angst , perhaps outrage , but few new ideas that would counter the federal government ’s unquenchable appetite for ever - greater power , its constriction of individual liberties and its demand for control of the economy .
One may argue that this idea has little chance of becoming law .
But every law starts as a creative thought .
The Tea Party movement , a political form of spontaneous combustion , should consider this idea if for no other reason than the almost certain fact that entrenched politicians would not .
It may be that the health care debate was useful , after all .

I 'm in my third decade of following politics and media and I thought I had seen it all , but I must say that I was taken aback by the national reaction to SB 1070 - - how could the reaction to the bill have been so widespread while the information about the bill was so utterly wrong ?
The two are obviously connected .
The media portrayal of the bill made it sound like Kristallnacht and naturally the rest of the country reacted when they thought that Arizona was implementing a bill that violated the constitution on several fronts .
I 've been trying to figure out the exact point at which incorrect information went national and I think I found it here . *
E.J. Dionne -- arguably the most influential political reporter in Washington -- used his " Post Partisan " column to decry Arizona 's " Shameful " immigration bill .
It is nothing short of astonishing that Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer Friday signed a bill that could make it dangerous just to look Hispanic .
Based on what he knew , Dionne had the right to be astonished and the national media soon descended on Arizona .
Later President Obama himself would blast Arizona's " irresponsible " actions .
However , most of the factual information that E.J. Dionne used in his analysis was simply wrong .
What was the source of these errors ?
Dionne made it clear that he got his information from an April 22nd Arizona Republic editorial -- Dionne included a link as well as a large block quote from the editorial .
Unfortunately , ALL of the facts about the bill that Dionne used as the basis of his column -- a column that lit a national fire and ended with the President singling out Arizona for ridicule - - were wrong .
I 've copied the block quote ( in blue ) that Dionne used and will analyze the statements line by line , but rather than just trusting my analysis of the bill , please refer to the sidebar in the article in today 's paper that the Republic itself used to describe the bill .
It seems that once the Republic had time to analyze what the bill actually did , they described the bill in dramatically different terms than the editorial .
Here 's the first " fact " that E.J. Dionne picked up from the Republic
The broad anti-immigrant bill passed by the Legislature this week makes it a crime to be in the country illegally
Wrong .
It 's already a crime to be in the country illegally .
SB 1070 made it a STATE crime by copying the federal language .
This makes a huge difference because opponents used Dionne 's quote to say that Arizona was adopting its own immigration policy as well as criminalizing being in the country illegally .
Both of those assumptions are wrong .
Sunday 's article got it right by emphasizing that the bill made it a " state crime . "
and gives local cops the job of demanding documentation if they have reasonable suspicion someone lacks it .
Wrong .
Local cops have the job of asking for documentation only if they believe it's " practicable " and even that requirement is eliminated if they believe that asking for documentation " may hinder or obstruct an investigation . "
The essence of this provision is that it prohibits cities or police departments from adopting a policy that stops the police from checking immigration status .
Again Sunday 's explanation of the bill 's provisions got this point right .
Back to the editorial upon which Dionne relied ...
The need to carry proper ‘ papers ’ falls squarely on Arizona 's Latino population -- including those born and raised in the Grand Canyon State .
Wrong -- and frankly outrageous .
Federal law already requires resident aliens to carry registration documents .
SB 1070 makes it a state crime to violate the federal law .
The law does n't apply to " those born and raised in the Grand Canyon State " because they are obviously citizens .
The law also lists documents that provide a presumption of citizenship one of which is a Driver 's License .
There is no need for citizens to carry their birth certificate or passport .
Once again , if you read the explanation in Sunday 's Republic , you will see how incorrect the editorial is .
The bill invites racial profiling and ignores the fact that Latinos are an intrinsic part of Arizona 's history and its future .
Wrong .
Actually , the bill prohibits racial profiling by saying that race can only be considered to the " extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution . "
And under no circumstances can the officer " solely " consider race , color or national origin .
( He can " consider " race as a factor just like he can under federal and Arizona law now . )
Sunday 's version does n't even address this point because the bill makes it so clear that racial profiling is NOT allowed that it was n't even worth a mention -- that 's because there 's no change in the law .
Racial profiling was not allowed before the bill and it's not allowed after the bill .
The bill . . . is bringing thundering bad publicity that will echo for years to come .
It will lead to lost economic - development opportunities , lost tourism and lost opportunities to expand our trade and commercial ties with Mexico .
Well , this part is actually true .
The bill really is bringing bad publicity that will echo for years to come .
It 's too bad that the bad publicity is based on a factually inaccurate editorial that received national exposure .
So what 's the Republic going to do about it ?
Obviously simply correcting the editorial on A2 is inadequate .
Randy Lovely needs to tell us who wrote the editorial and what went wrong .
After all , the faulty reporting has had nation wide implications and may cost Arizona billions of dollars .
It 's not possible to un-ring this bell .
But I for one would like to hear how the Republic is going to ensure that it does n't get rung again .
Footnote : Dionne 's post could n't have been part of the first wave in which the wrong information went national , because the post was written after Governor Brewer had already signed the bill .
But I think it was likely responsible for the second wave -- the one that included the President -- and I think that the first wave probably also relied on the Republic editorial .
I used Dionne as an example because he CLEARLY relied on the editorial .
My guess is that the editorial was widely read beforehand and was responsible for the initial wave as well .
In newly released papers from his presidency , Richard Nixon directs a purge of Kennedy - era modern art — “ these little uglies ” — orders hostile journalists to be frozen out and fusses over White House guest lists to make sure political opponents do n’t make it in .
As his lieutenants built an ambitious political espionage operation that tapped scribes as spies , Nixon is shown preoccupying himself with the finest details of dividing friend and foe .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Nixon Library , run by the National Archives , released some 280,000 pages of records Monday from his years in office , many touching on the early days of political spycraft and manipulation that would culminate in a presidency destroyed by the Watergate scandal .
The latest collection sheds more light on the long - familiar determination of Nixon ’s men to find dirt on Democrats however they could .
Memos attempt to track amorous movements of Sen .
Ted Kennedy , the Massachusetts Democrat whom Nixon ’s operatives apparently feared the most .
Journalists secretly hired by Nixon ’s men reported on infighting among Democratic presidential contenders .
In 1971 , keeping tabs on Kennedy was a prominent feature of the growing political intelligence operation .
Nixon ordered aides to recruit Secret Service agents to watch the senator and spill secrets , previous disclosures show .
After the Chappaquiddick scandal , when Kennedy drove off a bridge in an accident that drowned his female companion , Nixon hoped to derail the married senator ’s presidential hopes by catching him with more women .
The new collection includes daily notes by Gordon Strachan , assistant to White House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman , touching on this effort .
“ We need tail on EMK , ” he wrote from one meeting , referring to Kennedy by his initials .
The idea : “ get caught w( ith ) compromising evidence .
… Bits and pieces now need hard evi( dence ) . ”
Several prominent women are named as being involved with the senator .
ADVERTISEMENT
Not long after the June 1972 break - in at Democratic headquarters by burglars tied to Nixon ’s re-election committee , his people worried that Democrats would pull similar dirty tricks on them .
In a memo from that summer , Steven King , security chief for the Committee to Re-elect the President , reported on his sweep for eavesdropping equipment in the premises and advised Nixon ’s operatives how to avoid being bugged themselves .
“ We realize that some of your Committee members probably have a particular fondness for such items as flowers in large flower pots and artificial birds , ” he wrote , but “ such items nevertheless present a serious menace because they are so excellently suited to serve as hiding places for ‘ bugs . ’
ADVERTISEMENT
By today ’s Republican standards , Nixon was liberal on some aspects of domestic policy , including health care and the environment .
But Nixon and his advisers were also sticklers for social conservative traditions .
When an aide wrote a memo suggesting a woman be found to fill a senior slot at the Labor Department , Charles W. Colson , Nixon ’s special counsel , quickly protested .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ No ! No ! ” Colson scribbled by hand on the memo .
“ She could n’t possibly handle the ‘ hardhats ’ — get a good tough Political man — Please , please . ”
( This was almost 40 years after Frances Perkins became the first female labor secretary , under Franklin Roosevelt . )
And Nixon despised the cultural influences of the Kennedys and their liberal circles .
In a Jan. 26 , 1970 , memo to Haldeman and secretary Rose Mary Woods , the president demanded that the administration “ turn away from the policy of forcing our embassies abroad or those who receive assistance from the United States at home to move in the direction of off - beat art , music and literature . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
He called the Lincoln Center in New York a “ horrible monstrosity ” that shows “ how decadent the modern art and architecture have become , ” and declared modern art in embassies “ incredibly atrocious . ”
“ This is what the Kennedy - Shriver crowd believed in and they had every right to encourage this kind of stuff when they were in , ” he wrote .
“ But I have no intention whatever of continuing to encourage it now .
If this forces a show - down and even some resignations it ’s all right with me . ”
More than Nixon ’s artistic sensibilities were at play here .
He made the political calculation that “ those who are on the modern art and music kick are 95 percent against us anyway . ”
He put aside his own tastes when he saw political advantage , however , as in a January 1970 memo about TV talk - show hosts .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I would like to invite , even though I do n’t like most of these people , Johnny Carson , Merv Griffin and Mike Douglas , ” Nixon wrote .
“ This could payoff in great measure to us . ”
In a similar vein , Colson proposed the “ seduction of Frank Sinatra , ” namely inviting the singer to have private time and drinks with Nixon .
Colson described the entertainer as controlling a great number of celebrities and public figures , and as a conduit to “ massive financial resources . ”
“ These resources could conceivably come our way based on the successful establishment of a personal relationship between the President and Frank Sinatra , ” Colson wrote to Haldeman in October 1971 .
Nixon historians have known for years about “ Chapman ’s Friend , ” code name for a working journalist who doubled as a paid informant , reporting to the president ’s political operatives about campaigning Democrats .
ADVERTISEMENT
Seymour K. Freidin was the first source , succeeded by Lucianne Goldberg .
Years later she became known as the literary agent who encouraged Linda Tripp to tape conversations she had with Monica Lewinsky about the intern ’s relationship with President Bill Clinton .
Although Nixon and his aides were hungry for titillating gossip from the Democratic presidential campaign , it appears doubtful they found out much .
A November 1971 White House memo on a Chapman ’s Friend report expresses the view that “ all of this material is manufactured . ”
Still , the payments and reports continued through the campaign .
The European Parliament today voted on a resolution that demands transparency in the ACTA negotiations , and that the Commission puts all papers on the table .
The resolution was carried by 633 votes in favour , 13 against , and 16 abstentions .
Epic win ! 🙂
At last , the elected representatives in the parliament have sent a strong message .
We have shown that we do not accept secrecy .
We have shown that we are prepared to stand up for a free internet open to everybody .
And we have shown that the European Parliament is not a door mat .
But this is just the beginning .
This is a resolution by a virtually unanimous parliament , but it is not formally binding for the Commission .
If they want to ignore us , they technically can .
Then we will have to fight on .
And once we do get access to the documents , the fight over the content of the agreement will begin in earnest .
This was a big win , but it was only a battle .
Most of the war remains .
But today , we have every reason to be happy .

I was never able to figure this out .
I ended up moving the data to the ZFS pool .
The idea was this drive was going to be used for frequent I/ O to keep me from spinning up the ZFS pool or leaving it running all of the time .
I have no clue what is causing it , odds are it is an issue with the way FreeNAS handles I/O .
Since it runs the stock FreeBSD 7.2 Kernel I do n't know what changes would have been made that could affect I /O that badly .
I 've tried FreeBSD on the same box and it has 20 - 30 MB / s transfer but as soon as I switch to FreeNAS the speed drops to 3 - 5MB / s
It has to be a problem with FreeNAS but I have n't been able to find anyone having the same problem till now .
To clearify , what hardware is your FreeNAS box running , mobo , ram , cpu , and such .
My guess is there is a common factor in the hardware that may be triggering a timing problem in the kernel causing it to take forever to complete an I /O process .
However , this does n't make sense either because the I / O Wait would not increase from 0 .
Which indicates that the kernel is n't getting backed up with data requests .
I am at a loss for what would cause that amount of performance degradation .
A 19 - year - old
man who authorities said died Friday while filling his car with
fell victim to a freak accident that has resulted in only one other known fatality nationwide , according to a fuel expert .
L. David Byers , 19 , was filling up his Toyota Yaris at a BP station in Lower Allen at 2:45 a.m. when vapor fumes caught fire .
He was killed after inhaling superheated gases from the flash fire , Cumberland County Coroner Todd Eckenrode said .
A static electric discharge sparked the flames , a state police fire marshal said .
Byers ’ youth might have been a factor — many times younger people get out of a car without touching the door , which would act as a ground to discharge static electricity , said Bill Renkes , an attorney with the Petroleum Equipment Institute in Oklahoma .
Renkes , who described himself as the only expert in the United States on fuel pump fires , said older , less spry people usually lean on the door as they exit .
Exactly what happened to Byers , an avid bowler who wanted to be a police officer , is n’t certain .
Upper Allen Township police Chief Frank Williamson said the station 's surveillance video is not of good quality and it is hard to see if Byers got in and out of the car .
Police said Byers was not smoking and his car was not running .
Renkes said he has studied the issue of fires at gas pumps for 12 years and in that time there have been nearly 200 fires which appear to have been caused by static electricity .
“ There are 11 billion fill - ups a year , ” he said .
“ This is the second fatality we know of .
That makes the chances of dying this way , what , two in tens of billions , ” he said .
Renkes has compiled a list of several dozen fires that caused injuries , most of them fairly minor , such as singed hair .
Only a half dozen caused serious burns , and only one other case , in Oklahoma , caused a death .
It takes a very specific set of circumstances to set off a static electric fire at a fuel pump , he said .
It sometimes happens when people get out of their cars , leaving the doors open , to begin fueling .
They then get back in the cars , possibly sliding on nylon seats , combing their hair , putting on jackets , or doing something else to create static electricity .
They then get out of the car without touching the door or the car and reach for the nozzle .
Seventy - eight percent of the victims have been women , perhaps because they are more likely reach back into their cars to reach their purses , apply make - up or escape the cold , according to Renkes .
The fires usually happen in the winter months when the air is cold and dry , he said .
The incidents reached their peak between 1999 and 2002 and have dropped since , possibly because public relations campaigns such as those shown on the television program " Mythbusters " have alerted more people to the danger .
Incidentally , Renkes said , the idea that cell phone use has anything to do with such fires is an urban legend .
Byers ’ teacher at the Cumberland - Perry Area Vocational Technical School last year said his former student was quiet and helped mentor others .
He had “ a good heart ” and would have made a fine officer , said Bill Page , instructor in the criminal justice program .
Byers had been working as a package handler at FedEx in Lewisberry and was a member , along with his twin brother , Michael , of a Saturday morning bowling league at Trindle Bowl in Mechanicsburg .
The bowling alley was planning a benefit for him to help the family defray funeral expenses , according to owner Karl Schweitzer .
Byers was a 2009 graduate of Cedar Cliff High School and the Cumberland - Perry Area Vo-Tech and had attended the Pittsburgh Technical Institute , according to the Parthemore Funeral Home .
Lower Allen police Corp. Jeff Huff taught Byers in the fifth - grade DARE program and again in middle school .
Byers had recently accompanied one of the officers on his rounds , something the department sometimes offers to young people interested in law enforcement .
“ It ’s just crazy to think these things can happen , ” Huff said .
He has since talked to his family about being careful to discharge static electricity , he said .

Much Ado About Nothing
In a radio interview on 2SER a Dr Christopher Ferguson has criticised the moral panic that is currently surrounding video games in Australia .
( The interview can be listened to below . )
Last week Psychologist Dr Wayne Warburton was seen on Channel Ten claiming the link between video games and violent behavior is stronger than the link between smoking and lung cancer .
According to the news report psychologists are claiming an “ explosion in youth crime is inextricably linked to violent video games and other media . ”
Earlier the same week the Australian Christian Lobby ( ACL ) posted a media release on their website with the heading “ Gaming industry mirrors ‘ big tobacco ’ in denial of violent gaming effects . ”
The ACL media release quotes a paper titled : Video game effects confirmed , suspected and speculative : A review of the evidence .
One of the contributors to that paper is Craig Anderson who has often been criticised by his peers ( notably Ferguson ) for his methods .
Dr Christopher Ferguson has a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of Central Florida and is the co-author of : Much Ado About Nothing : The Misestimation and Overinterpretation of Violent Vido Game Effects in Eastern and Western Nations : Comment on Anderson et al. ( 2010 )
The Channel Ten news report can be viewed here .
You can thank Chris Horner of CEI for making this happen .
In August 2007 , I submitted two Freedom of Information Act requests to NASA and its Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) , headed by long - time Gore advisor James Hansen and his right - hand man Gavin Schmidt ( and RealClimate.org co-founder ) .
I did this because Canadian businessman Steve McIntyre — a man with professional experience investigating suspect statistical claims in the mining industry and elsewhere , including his exposure of the now - infamous “ hockey stick ” graph — noticed something unusual with NASA ’s claims of an ever - warming first decade of this century .
NASA appeared to have inflated its U.S. temperatures beginning in the year 2000 .
My FOIA request asked NASA about their internal discussions regarding whether and how to correct the temperature error caught by McIntyre .
NASA stonewalled my request for more than two years , until Climategate prompted me to offer notice of intent to sue if NASA did not comply immediately .
On New Year ’s Eve , NASA finally provided the Competitive Enterprise Institute ( CEI ) with the documents I requested in August 2007 .
…
Regarding U.S. temperatures , Ruedy confessed to Hansen on August 23 , 2007 to say :
I got a copy from a journalist in Brazil , we do n’t save the data .
— — — — — — — — — — —— ——
–
The Ruedy relationship with a Brazilian journalist raises the matter of the incestuous relationship between NASA ’s GISS and like - minded environmental reporters .
One ca n’t help but recall how , recently , the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) claim of glacier shrinkage in the Himalayas was discredited when found to be the work of a single speculative journalist at a popular magazine , and not strict peer - reviewed scientific data .
The emails we obtained include several instances of very close ties and sympathetic relationships with journalists covering them .
…
In an August 15 , 2007 , email from Ruedy to Brazilian journalist Leticia Francisco Sorg , responding to Sorg ’s request for Ruedy to say if warming is accelerating , Ruedy replied :
“ To observe that the warming accelerates would take even longer observation times ” than the past 25 years .
In fact , it would take “ another 50 - 100 years . ”
This is a damning admission that NASA has been complicit in UN alarmism .
This is not science .
It is debunked advocacy .
The impropriety of such policy advocacy , let alone allowing unsubstantial scientific claims to become part of a media campaign , is self - evident .

NASA appeared to have inflated its U.S. temperatures beginning in the year 2000 .
The FOIA request asked NASA about their internal discussions regarding whether and how to correct the temperature error caught by McIntyre .
NASA stonewalled for more than two years .
Quietly — on New Year ’s Eve 2009 — NASA finally provided the documents :

Pakistani police deliberately failed to properly probe the 2007 murder of ex-premier Benazir Bhutto which could have been averted if there had been adequate security , a UN - appointed independent panel said Thursday .
“ Ms Bhutto ’s assassination could have been prevented if adequate security measures had been taken , ” said the report by a three - member panel headed by Chile ’s UN ambassador Heraldo Munoz .

The panel said responsibility for Bhutto ’s security on the day of her assassination rested with “ the federal government , the government of Punjab and the Rawalpindi district police . ”
“ None of these entities took the necessary measures to respond to the extraordinary , fresh , urgent security risks that they knew she faced , ” it added .
The panel said it believed that Pakistani police ’s failure to probe the slaying effectively “ was deliberate . ”
“ These officials , in part fearing intelligence agencies ’ involvement , were unsure of how vigorously they ought to pursue actions , which they knew , as professionals , they should have taken , ” it added .
The panel said the Pakistani probe “ lacked direction , was ineffective and suffered from a lack of commitment to identify and bring all of the perpetrators to justice . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
It added it was up to Pakistani authorities to carry out a “ serious , credible criminal investigation that determines who conceived , ordered and executed this heinous crime … and brings those responsible to justice . ”
The Munoz - led panel was tasked with establishing the facts and circumstances of the slaying and was not empowered to identify culprits .
Bhutto , the first woman to become prime minister of a Muslim country , was killed on December 27 , 2007 in a gun and suicide attack after addressing an election rally in Rawalpindi , a garrison city near the capital Islamabad .

Bhutto ’s supporters have cast doubt on an initial Pakistani probe into her death , questioning whether she was killed by a gunshot or the blast and criticizing authorities for hosing down the scene of the attack within minutes .
Munoz earlier Thursday turned over the report to UN chief Ban Ki-moon .

Pakistan ’s UN Ambassador Abdullah Hussain Haroon , who was to have addressed the press after receiving a copy of the report , canceled the press encounter and was to take the report back to Islamabad .
The panel unwrapped the long - awaited , sensitive report after complying with Islamabad ’s request for a two - week delay .
Pakistan said last week it had asked that the release , initially scheduled for March 30 , be delayed so that input from Afghanistan , the United States and Saudi Arabia could be included .
ADVERTISEMENT
Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said he had asked the UN - appointed , three - member panel to include input from former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice , Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Saudi Arabia in its report .
He did not elaborate further on what information he wanted to be included .
QUOTE OF THE DAY ….
I appreciate the role a nuclear arsenal can play in serving as a deterrent against adversaries .
But Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota may not appreciate the notion of a proportionate response .
“ If in fact there is a nation who is compliant with all of the rules ahead of time and they ’ve complied with the United Nations on nuclear proliferation , if they fire against the United States a biological weapon , a chemical weapon or maybe a cyber attack , well then we are n’t going to be firing back with nuclear weapons , ” Bachmann said .
“ Does n’t that make us all feel safe ? ” “ No ! ” shouted the crowd of thousands in Minneapolis .
There are obviously a lot of errors of fact and judgment in that quote , but that “ maybe a cyber attack ” is the part that stands out .
To be sure , attacks on a country ’s computer networks can be severely damaging .
But even Bachmann , as confused as she is , has to realize that responding to a cyber attack with a nuclear bomb would be the most insane act in the history of humanity .
Does she understand what a nuclear bomb does ?
So to answer Bachmann ’s question , no , the United States will not use a nuclear arsenal to respond to a cyber attack .
That does n’t mean we ’d welcome a cyber attack ; it does n’t mean we ’d let a cyber attack slide ; it does n’t mean our conventional weapons could n’t serve as a sufficient deterrent .
The right really is getting worse .
In a move sure to set off a tirade from Joe Romm , we have this story from the BBC :
French government backs down on carbon tax plan
The French government has signalled that it is dropping a plan for a tax on domestic carbon dioxide emissions .
Jean - Francois Cope , parliamentary leader of the governing UMP party , was quoted as saying the tax “ would be Europe - wide or not ( exist ) at all ” .
Prime Minister Francois Fillon told parliament that the government should focus on policies that increased France ’s economic competitiveness .
France had been rethinking the tax after a court rejected it last year .
The Constitutional Council said there were too many exemptions for polluters in the tax plan , and that a minority of consumers would bear the burden .
But President Nicolas Sarkozy ’s government had still been planning to push through a revised version of the measure later this year .

From The Mainstream To The Fringe : Part Two
It ’s not easy to typecast actor Joshua Jackson .
Known for three major roles — hotshot skater Charlie Conway in The Mighty Ducks movie trilogy , lovable underachiever Pacey Witter in Dawson ’s Creek and enigmatic FBI consultant Peter Bishop on Fringe — he is equally comfortable in indie and studio films , and on the small and silver screens .
When Jackson spoke recently to ADD , the focus was on his sci- fi , horror and comic book interests , and the conversation proved to be quite illuminating as it also shifted to the concept of being an artist , the adaptive nature of storytelling and the future of television .
( You can read Part One here . )
The father of your Fringe alter ego , Walter Bishop , is this wonderfully bizarre character .
How hard is it for you to keep a straight face when he ’s doing something like performing an autopsy and directing Astrid to make custard , or investigating a death in a restaurant and commenting on the seemingly delicious soup where the victim ’s head landed ?
How hard is it for you not burst out laughing ?
The great news is you do n’t have to .
When Walter is having these delusions or these inappropriate moments , you do n’t have to keep a straight face .
The story allows for us to react as humans would , and particularly Peter a lot of times is in the position of being the audience member .
To an extent he ’s still the skeptic .
I do n’t think there ’s a reason for us as actors playing these characters to react exactly as you would [ in real life ] .
Even if you knew Walter , some of the things he says are funny and are just so absurd .
Part of what is funny about that is the reaction that he elicits from people around them .
This guy has no concept of the world .
You might say about scientists what people say about artists , that we have to be a little bit tweaked to do what we do .
That there ’s something about us that ’s a little bit off .
I do n’t why that is , but in a way it ’s true about many artists .
That comes to light particularly when you date someone who ’s not involved in the business or your art and does n’t really get it .
I think to do anything that has any pretense of being an artist , you have to be passionate , and occasionally that requires being obsessed .
If you ’re trying to have a relationship with somebody who does n’t understand or appreciate obsession , it ’s going to be very difficult to explain .
Is your fiancée understanding of everything that you do ?
Diane [ Kruger ] is also an actress , so we have the opposite problem , where we both get obsessed and do n’t leave the house for a couple of days .
It has to be engrossing .
It just has to be .
There ’s too much good and too much fun and too much interest to be mined out of what I do for a living or what she does for a living to not be obsessed with it .
There are just a lot of people who do n’t enjoy themselves period .
I find that people who have that type of baggage , it does n’t matter .
They can be flipping burgers or running companies — if you ’re a naturally dyspeptic person nothing is going to make you happy .
If you were n’t an actor , what do you think you would be doing ?
I have no idea at this point .
I ’ve been doing this job for 20 years .
That ’s two thirds of my existence .
Getting back to Fringe , Fox believed in it at the outset because they gave you longer episodes , meaning fewer commercials , during the first season .
This season you ’re not getting that , so you have to cut back on the content every week .
But you were given a good edict at the beginning by receiving extended episodes .
There ’s movement afoot , whether or not it happens fast enough , but the television business that existed when you and I were growing up is over .
It ’s finished .
There ’s a bit of the chicken little feeling in our world of , “ Oh my God , it ’s the end of storytelling . ”
That ’s not true .
People still want to have engaging stories told .
It ’s just that either the format or the media through which they are distributed , or perhaps just the distribution method , are going to change , and right now my show exists in the in - between time .
I actually applaud Fox for doing what they did [ in 2008 ] with “ Remote Free TV ” .
They ’re trying out new things .
I do n’t know that the advertising model works anymore .
The audience is broken up amongst a bunch of different things , and truthfully the Standards and Practices for network television are extremely silly and also limiting .
Just quality wise you look at cable shows , and they just beat the pants off of network television ; also because we do 22 episodes and most cable shows do 13 , so you take more time in crafting each one .
So things are changing , but storytelling is not going to go anywhere .
Amazon.com Widgets
One of the problems with the network television format is that you have to have little cliffhangers at the end of every act , which can be as short as a few minutes .
Cable television shows are allowed to grow and expand a little more easily because many of them do n’t have all of those commercial breaks .
That ’s an interesting thing that you ’re touching on because it does n’t work great for straight drama because we no longer have faith in audiences to be able to pay attention through a two - minute break .
Truthfully .
If you go back and watch Columbo , that ’s a procedural show , but it did n’t have a cliffhanger before the end [ of every act ] .
They ran to the end of the scene , it faded to black , cut to Pepsodent commercial , cut back , the scene goes on .
We live in an era where we feel like we have to pander pander pander to the audience , but something like Breaking Bad or Mad Men is the answer to that .
We have to do our job and make the stories good and the characters compelling , but if you make something on the assumption that people are plenty smart to figure something out , you ’ll find an engaged audience .
Mad Men does not have a huge audience .
It has a very loyal , small audience .
Breaking Bad is the same thing .
It is a great show .
It does not have a gigantic audience , but it has an incredibly passionate , small audience who trusts and believes in those stories .
I think Fringe is on the way to having that really passionate audience that just wants to watch it because they believe that these storytellers satisfy their desire for a well told story .
That ’s what we ’re aiming for on our show .
There are a lot of idiots out there , and people tend to call television the “ Idiot Box ” …
That ’s bullshit .
That ’s terrified people who do n’t have a better answer — the people who make decisions like that [ think ] , “ Make it for the masses because people are dumb . ” Bullshit .
The masses are not dumb .
Not even my generation , but the generation that came behind me are so media savvy they smell a rat in a second .
They ’re not stupid at all about storytelling or about the complexities of storytelling because they ’ve grown up saturated in media .
They know all the tricks and know how it ’s done .
So if anything the people making the shows are stupid , not the people watching the shows .
It is a copout to say that I made something too smart , people are too dumb to get it .
You know what ?
If you ’re not a good enough storyteller to explain your story , then it ’s not a good story .
Sometimes there are shows like Hack that have what seems a hokey premise — in that case , a disgraced former cop turned cab driver who helps people in need — and make it compelling thanks to a great lead and smart stories .
That ’s a talent .
That ’s a huge talent .
That is the P.T. Barnum skill .
That is why people like J.J. [ Abrams ] are so richly rewarded for what they ’re capable of doing .
They take stories that are hokey by their very nature — or popular , however you want to term it — and Star Trek is the first example of this .
I watched it in France , and within the first ten minutes most everybody was sniffling , if not outright crying , because you introduce these characters in the most intense , heartstring - pulling moment you can possibly imagine .
A father , in the moment when his son is being born , sacrifices himself to save his wife and child for the greater good of all mankind .
You ca n’t go any bigger in terms of scope than that .
And he takes Star Trek — which is a wonderful sci - fi show but by its very nature hokey — and this futuristic ideal that died in the Sixties , then recapitulates it into something that a broad audience can understand and tells the story in such a compelling way that lots of people who would n’t naturally be able to enjoy that , enjoy it .
And that ’s what a popular storyteller does .
By the way , did you learn to skate for the Mighty Ducks , and can you still do the deke ?
The triple deke , my signature move ?
Of course I can !
It might ’ve been a couple of years since I broke that particular one out , but I ’m sure I could still pull it off .
It ’s not really all that technical .
I learned how to skate better for the movie .
I went to a hockey camp , so I was a much better skater when I came out .
Would you ever consider doing a Dawson ’s Creek reunion ?
[ laughs ]
The children of Pacey ?
Or the love children of Pacey ?
You never know !
How long has that show been off the air ?
Six years ?
In five or six more years you could get away with it .
I could have teenage children .
Would you find that interesting ?
We ca n’t do a reunion show with the original cast because we killed Michelle .
So that ’s off the table .
[ But ] if they created the next generation , I would love to come back and play a broken down , fat , drunk version of Pacey .
Joey left him .
Her life was going places , and his restaurant failed , so he had to move back home and is working as a line order cook .
[ laughs ]
I ’d like to believe that everything worked out for them because at the end of the series they left him off on such good stead .
I think times got tough for Pacey after the show went off the air .
Rules are expedient in life and business .
In a business environment , there can be no place for any unethical business practice .
There exist a business code of conduct that anyone operating in that niche must adhere to , meaning you must follow some basic guidelines which are ;
to be fair at all times always give honest opinions etc .
These guidelines are there to guide you against any unethical business practices that can ruin your business and future .
If you have doubt about your way of doing business or engaged in any unethical business practices that have become a burden and a risk , then it is time to correct the situation because ignoring them does not mean they are not there .
But what does unethical business practices really mean ?
Who creates the business rules or code of conducts , that every so called businessman must follow ?
In any case , what an individual or organization does determine what is ethical or unethical .
Business or professional ethics stems from the moral and socially acceptable behavior .
Whether we like it or not , society can somehow dictate what is right and wrong .
In business it is the same , the rules and regulations of the land can determine what is ethically wrong or right .
Moreover , these norms of socially acceptable behavior are not just based on the laws but sometimes on the morality of the person as well .
So for example , if you are scheming or somehow manipulating the market prices or not paying the right taxes to your government by doctoring the records , then you are not just breaking the law but also engaging in unethical business practices , which may affect you in future , if you are eventually caught .
Bear in mind , the code of conduct is created for a reason and that is to protect you and other people .
It is also a way to help you grow and monitor your progress , and the most vital thing is to maintain a balance in everything you do in business .
In fact , if there are no laws or regulations that will keep us in check , then how in the world can anyone accomplish anything ethically ?
So what is your take on unethical business practices and behaviour ?
Here 's a video that was shot at TED in 2007 , and has just now surfaced .
In it , James Randi takes an overdose of homeopathy sleeping pills -- do n't worry he 's fine since he took an overdose of fake medicine , not stuff that actually could hurt or help him .
He makes some pretty good points though ; it really is depraved to sell your claimed " psychic " powers to the grieving and heartbroken who are still coping with the loss of a loved one .
Even to a heartless
Atheist that seems just a little too predatory and disingenuous .
The jury , which included at least three members with Blue Cross medical coverage , voted 10 to 2 that the company breached its contract with Nehme .
It voted 9 to 3 that the health insurer acted in bad faith by refusing to pay for the out - of - state operation .
The panel deliberated for less than two days .
" The message here is that you can't take people 's money , promise to protect them , and then leave them to die in their time of need , " said Nehme 's lawyer , Scott Glovsky .
Anthem was spinning hard after the verdict , saying they were pleased that they were not found responsible for acting with malice .
Bad faith was n't enough ?
They also implicitly accused Nehme of wasting court time by not taking the settlement they had offered .
Of course , this loss is much worse for Anthem than it would have been if they had managed a settlement for more .
They could have just paid the bill , too , and not had this problem .
Sometimes it 's good to see stubborn people who wo n't be bought off .
The insurer will now be paying the cost of the transplant and all legal bills and is facing the possibility of an order that they allow transplants anywhere the parent company does business .
Must be fun working PR for these guys .

Medical marketing executive John Dougal conspired to channel bribes of more than £ 4.5 m to Greek surgeons
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The first British executive convicted of corrupting foreign officials to land contracts was today jailed for a year .
John Dougall , 44 , a senior marketing executive for a medical products firm , pleaded guilty to conspiring to channel bribes of more than £ 4.5 m to Greek surgeons .
Mr Justice Bean jailed Dougall even though prosecutors from the Serious Fraud Office ( SFO ) argued he deserved a lighter sentence as he had been a valuable witness in the case , the first of its kind in an overseas corruption prosecution .
Dougall turned over many documents to the SFO prosecutors to help break open the case , and promised to testify in any future trials against other individuals .
The judge said that the public would expect an individual involved in " substantial and long - term " corruption to be jailed immediately rather than be given a suspended sentence , as the SFO and his defence had recommended .
He noted that former UN secretary general Kofi Annan has said corruption was an " insidious plague " and " evil phenomenon " , that was an " element in economic underperformance " .
The conviction of an individual breaks new ground , as the SFO seeks to show it is cracking down on the payment of bribes to politicians and officials overseas by British companies , in the pursuit of export orders .
Britain has been accused for years of ignoring this kind of corruption .
The SFO has also begun prosecuting corporate entities recently .
Today , Southwark crown court heard executives at the Leeds - based firm , DePuy , paid the bribes to Greek surgeons as inducements to land contacts worth nearly £ 20 m , between 2002 and 2005 .
John Kelsey - Fry , QC for the SFO , said DePuy executives funnelled the bribes through a Greek middleman , via an Isle of Man company .
The surgeons had substantial influence in choosing which firms ' products should be bought .
The payments , through the middleman – named in court as Nikolaos Karagiannis and his company Medec – were referred to as payments for " professional education " , he said .
But in effect , the money went into a " black hole " and was used for corrupt cash incentives to doctors and to send them on " vanity meetings " , including a holiday to South Africa .
He added that the bribes were concealed by inflating the value of the sales by 20 % .
The prices of the products in Greece were twice the European average .
" There is no doubt one of the reasons why the prices were so high in Greece is that the market was corrupt .
The losers therefore were the Greek taxpayers " .
Dougall , who earned nearly £ 100,000 a year , told investigators he considered the payments " distasteful " but felt he did not have any choice .
Kelsey - Fry said : " It was his seniors who were clearly consenting and driving the activity . "
Following representations from the media , the judge lifted a ban proposed by the SFO , on reporting the names of two DePuy executives who were alleged to have also conspired to make the corrupt payments .
They are Michael Dormer and Gary Fitzpatrick .
Dougall , of Wynyard , Billingham , was given permission to appeal against the sentence .
The SFO has encouraged those involved in corruption to co-operate with their investigations , in return for more lenient sentences .

Judicial Immunity Is NOT Absolute !
The chink in the armor - Absence Of All Jurisdiction
Additional Reads :
Also see article on How To Sue A Judge
always remember , case law is ALWAYS changing .
Here is a selection of case / reference citations regarding judicial immunity when personally suing a Judge for money damages , from the collection of former Phoenix , AZ Attorney Robert A. Hirschfeld , JD .
( Warning : Study and shepardize the cited case for consistency with your situation , before citing it in your own brief .
Links to tools on shepardizing a case are on The Pro se Way )
When a judge knows that he lacks jurisdiction , or acts in the face of clearly valid statutes expressly depriving him of jurisdiction , judicial immunity is lost .
Rankin v. Howard , ( 1980 ) 633 F.2d 844 , cert den .
Zeller v. Rankin , 101 S.Ct. 2020 , 451 U.S. 939 , 68 L.Ed 2d 326 .
In Rankin v. Howard , 633 F.2d 844 ( 1980 ) the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed an Arizona District Court dismissal based upon absolute judicial immunity , finding that both necessary immunity prongs were absent ; later , in Ashelman v. Pope , 793 F.2d 1072 ( 1986 ) , the Ninth Circuit , en banc , criticized the " judicial nature " analysis it had published in Rankin as unnecessarily restrictive .
But Rankin 's ultimate result was not changed , because Judge Howard had been independently divested of absolute judicial immunity by his complete lack of jurisdiction .
Some Defendants urge that any act " of a judicial nature " entitles the Judge to absolute judicial immunity .
But in a jurisdictional vacuum , ( that is , absence of all jurisdiction ) the second prong necessary to absolute judicial immunity is missing .
Stump v. Sparkman , id. , 435 U.S. 349 .
" Where there is no jurisdiction , there can be no discretion , for discretion is incident to jurisdiction . "

A judge must be acting within his jurisdiction as to subject matter and person , to be entitled to immunity from civil action for his acts .

Generally , judges are immune from suit for judicial acts within or in excess of their jurisdiction even if those acts have been done maliciously or corruptly ; the only exception being for acts done in the clear absence of all jurisdiction .

Hoffsomer v. Hayes , 92 Okla 32 , 227 F 417 .
Justice Field in Bradley v. Fisher . ( 13 Wall ) 353 ( 1871 ) stated : " ... judges of courts of superior or general jurisdiction are not liable to civil actions for their judicial acts , even when such acts are in excess of their jurisdiction . "
" The doctrine of judicial immunity originated in early seventeenth - century England in the jurisprudence of Sir Edward Coke .
In two decisions , Floyd & Barker and the Case of the Marshalsea , Lord Coke laid the foundation for the doctrine of judicial immunity . "
Floyd & Barker , 77 Eng. Rep. 1305 ( 1607 ; The Case of the Marshalsea , 77 Eng. Rep. 1027 ( 1612 ) were both cases right out of the Star Chamber .
Coke 's reasoning for judicial immunity was presented in four public policy grounds :
1. Finality of judgment ;
2. Maintenance of judicial independence ;
3. Freedom from continual calumniations ; and ,
4. Respect and confidence in the judiciary .
The Marshalsea presents a case where Coke denied a judge immunity for presiding over a case in assumpsit .
Assumpsit is a common - law action for recovery of damages for breach of contract .
Coke then explained the operation of jurisdiction requirement for immunity :
. " [ W ] hen a Court has
( a ) jurisdiction of the cause , and proceeds iverso ordine or erroneously , there the party who sues , or the officer or minister of the Court who executes the precept or process of the Court , no action lies against them .
But
( b ) when the Court has not jurisdiction of the cause , there the whole proceeding is [ before a person who is not a judge ] , and actions will lie against them without any regard of the precept or process ... "
Although narrowing the availability of judicial immunity , especially in courts of limited jurisdiction , Coke suggested that there was a presumption of jurisdiction and that the judge must have been aware that jurisdiction was lacking .
Thus , questions of personam , rem and res jurisdiction are always a proper issue before the court to obviate the defense that the court had no way to know they lacked jurisdiction .
" Stump v Sparkman Revisited " continues to show it was Chief Justice Kent ( circa 1810 ) that was instrumental in establishing the " doctrine " of JI in America , in Yates v. Lansing , 5 Johns 282 .
Thereafter Justice incorporated the " doctrine " in two cases : Randall v. Brigham , 74 U.S. ( 7 Wall. ) 523 , and Bradley v. Fisher , 80 U.S. ( 13 Wall . ) 335 ( 1871 ) .
Both Yates and Randall dealt with officers of the court .
" The belief that Bradley narrowed the scope of the doctrine represents a serious misunderstanding of the decision .
First , Bradley provides no authority for the belief that a judge of general jurisdiction may be liable for acts taken in absence of subject matter jurisdiction .
The distinction between excess of jurisdiction and absence of jurisdiction in the opinion is simply explanatory .
Because a court of general jurisdiction has jurisdiction over all causes of action , a judge of such a court will always be immune for his judicial acts , even if he exceeds his authority .
See Bradley , 80 U.S. at 351-52 . "
CASE NOTE : " Federal tort law : judges cannot invoke judicial immunity for acts that violate litigants civil rights ; Robert Craig Waters .
Tort & Insurance Law Journal , Spr. 1986 21 n3 , p509 -516 "
A Superior Court Judge is broadly vested with " general jurisdiction . "
Evidently , this means that even if a case involving a particular attorney is not assigned to him , he may reach out into the hallway , having his deputy use " excessive force " to haul the attorney into the courtroom for chastisement or even incarceration .
Mireles v. Waco , 112 S.Ct. 286 at 288 ( 1991 ) .
Arguably , anything goes , in a Superior Court Judge 's exercise of his " general jurisdiction " , with the judge enjoying " absolute judicial immunity " against tort consequences provided he is not divested of all jurisdiction .
A Judge is not immune for tortious acts committed in a purely Administrative , non-judicial capacity .
Forrester v. White , 484 U.S. at 227-229 , 108 S.Ct. at 544-545 ; Stump v. Sparkman , 435 U.S. at 380 , 98 S.Ct. at 1106 .
Mireles v. Waco , 112 S.Ct. 286 at 288 ( 1991 ) .
Administrative - capacity torts by a judge do not involve the " performance of the function of resolving disputes between parties , or of authoritatively adjudicating private rights , " and therefore do not have the judicial immunity of judicial acts .
See : Forrester v. White , 484 U.S. 219 , 98 L.Ed.2d 555 , 108 S.Ct. 538 ( 1988 ) ; Atkinson - Baker & Assoc. v. Kolts , 7 F.3d 1452 at 1454 , ( 9th Cir. 1993 ) .
A Judge as a State Actor is not vested with the sovereign immunity granted to the State itself .
See : Rolfe v. State of Arizona , 578 F.Supp. 987 ( D.C. Ariz. 1983 ) ; Rutledge v. Arizona Bd. of Regents , 660 F.2d 1345 , ( 9th Cir , 1981 ) cert .
granted Kush v. Rutledge , 458 U.S. 1120 , 102 S.Ct. 3508,73 L.Ed.2d 1382 , affirmed 460 U.S. 719 , 103 S.Ct. 1483 , 75 L.Ed.2d. 413 , appeal after remand 859 F.2d 732 , Ziegler v. Kirschner , 781 P.2d 54 , 162 Ariz. 77 ( Ariz. App. , 1989 ) .
It is said that absolute judicial immunity is favored as public policy , so that judges may fearlessly , and safe from retribution , adjudicate matters before them .
True .
But equally important , is the public expectation that judicial authority will only be wielded by those lawfully vested with such authority .
The history of Arizona 's admission to the Union reveals at least one reason why historic public policy in Arizona would favor ARCP Rule 42 ( f ) ( 1 ) 's complete and expeditious divestiture of jurisdiction , and its concurrent divestiture of absolute judicial immunity in the event a renegade judge persists in wielding the tools of his office after having been affirmatively stripped of them .
Arizona Rule 42 ( f ) ( 1 ) states :
Change as a Matter of Right - Nature of Proceedings .
In any action pending in superior court , except an action pending in the Arizona Tax Court , each side is entitled as a matter of right to a change of one judge and of one court commissioner .
Each action , whether single or consolidated , shall be treated as having only two sides .
Whenever two or more parties on a side have adverse or hostile interests , the presiding judge or that judge 's designee may allow additional changes of judge as a matter of right but each side shall have the right to the same number of such changes .
A party wishing to exercise that party 's right to change of judge shall file a " Notice of Change of Judge . "
The notice may be signed by an attorney ; it shall state the name of the judge to be changed ; and it shall neither specify grounds nor be accompanied by an affidavit , such as required by subsection ( f ) ( 2 ) of this rule , but it shall contain a certification by the party filing the notice or by the attorney that ( i ) the notice is timely , ( ii ) the party has not waived the right under subsection ( f ) ( 1 ) ( D ) of the rule , and ( iii ) the party has not previously been granted a change of judge as a matter of right in the case .
A judge may honor an informal request for change of judge .
When a judge does so , the judge shall enter upon the record the date of the request and the name of the party requesting change of judge .
Such action shall constitute an exercise of the requesting party 's right to change of judge .
In 1912 , the U.S. Congress refused to admit Arizona to the Union for the stated reason that Arizona 's proposed Constitution provided the public with a mechanism for removing sitting judges from office .
Joint Res. No. 8 , 8/21/11 , 37 U.S. Stat. 39 , cited in Vol. 1 , Ariz . Rev. Stats. , p.130 .
To facilitate admission to the Union , the judge - removal mechanism was excised from the State Constitution , allowing Arizona to become a State on 2/14 / 12 .
Soon afterward , on 11/5/12 , Arizona voters restored the mechanism by amendment .
Ariz .
Constitution , Art. VIII " Removal from Office " , section 1 ; A.R.S. Vol. 1 , p. 178 .
So strong was the citizens ' distrust of sitting State Court Judges in Arizona , that after Arizona copied the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , it added the present Rule 42 ( f ) ( 1 ) to provide a mechanism for a litigant to permanently remove the assigned judge from the case .
The difference between selectively disabling a judge in various aspects of adjudication ( such as during the appellate period ) and the permanent extinguishment of his jurisdiction in a given case , has a logical relevance to a Judge 's expectation of enjoying absolute judicial immunity in that case .
In examining entitlement to immunity , the U.S. Supreme Court focused upon the nature of the act : is it an act ordinarily performed by a Judge ?
Unfortunately , judges sometimes exceed their jurisdiction in a particular case .
But an act done in complete absence of all jurisdiction cannot be a judicial act .
Piper v. Pearson , id. , 2 Gray 120 .
It is no more than the act of a private citizen , pretending to have judicial power which does not exist at all .
In such circumstances , to grant absolute judicial immunity is contrary to the public policy expectation that there shall be a Rule of Law .
Body scanners were introduced after an alleged attempt to blow up a plane
The use of airport body scanners in the UK may be unlawful , the Equality and Human Rights Commission has warned .
Scanners already in place at Heathrow and Manchester Airports may be breaking discrimination law as well as breaching passengers ' rights to privacy , it said .
It has now written a letter to Transport Secretary Lord Adonis .
The government said security concerns meant scanners had been needed immediately , but it was carrying out an equalities impact assessment .
The scanners are being introduced in response to the alleged attempt to blow up an American plane on 25 December .
But the commission said it had " serious doubts " that the decision to roll them out in UK airports was legal .
It said one of its chief concerns was over how people would be selected for the scans .
' Vulnerable groups '
Its chairman , Trevor Phillips , said : " The right to life is the ultimate human right and we support the government 's review of security policies .
Given the current security threat level , we believe it was essential to start introducing scanners immediately
Department for Transport spokesperson
" State action like border checks , stop - and - search and full body scanning are undertaken for good reasons .
" But , without proper care , such policies can end up being applied in ways which do discriminate against vulnerable groups or harm good community relations . "
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne MP agreed .
He said : " The government seems intent on pressing ahead with the use of body scanners without addressing any of the privacy concerns and safeguard issues raised by the Liberal Democrats and others .
" The commission is right to suggest that security measures cannot simply be introduced without due respect for the rule of law . "
Code of practice
The commission has previously said scanners could breach an individual 's right to privacy under the Human Rights Act .
It has also previously written to the home secretary to ask that he set out in detail the justification for bringing in the scanners , and clarify what safeguards will be put in place .
They produce " naked " images of passengers , and the commission then said it was concerned especially for the privacy of certain groups such as disabled people , the elderly , children and the transgendered community .
The Department for Transport said it had published a staff code of practice for the scanners .
A spokesperson said passengers who were randomly selected for screening would not be chosen because of any personal characteristics .
" Given the current security threat level , we believe it was essential to start introducing scanners immediately .
" We are currently carrying out a full equalities impact assessment on the code of practice , which will be published shortly when we begin a public consultation on these issues . "

“ While lockdowns , job losses and uncertainty are roiling property markets from the U.K. to Australia to Hong Kong , Canada ’s situation is more precarious than most .
As its oil sector shriveled in recent years , Canada ’s economy became ever more driven by real estate , an industry now in a state of paralysis .
Nearly one in three workers has applied for income support .
What ’s more , its households are among the world ’s most indebted , poorly placed to weather the storm .
“ I think it is the Great Reckoning , ” says Douglas Hoyes , a bankruptcy trustee in Kitchener , Ontario .
“ We ’ve been in a period for so long where it did n’t matter what property you bought or how highly leveraged you were .
Well , guess what ?
Now it matters . ”
Since the economy began shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of coronavirus , policy makers have raced to buttress the property market .
Banks are offering mortgage holidays , including to landlords with multiple loans on investment properties .
That has raised eyebrows even within the real estate industry .
“ Should someone with four properties really be granted financial assistance ? ” asks Steve Saretsky , a Vancouver realtor .
“ Where exactly do we draw the line ? ”
The country may not have much of a choice but to prop up housing .
Real estate has become Canada ’s largest sector .
Including residential construction , it accounted for 15 % of economic output last year ; energy accounted for 9 % .
If it collapses , there ’s not much that can pick up the slack — certainly not oil nor the seemingly unflappable consumer .
Canadians have been on a two decade spending spree since a downward shift in mortgage rates began in the 1990s .
Toronto and Vancouver , the two biggest housing markets , have n’t had a major correction during that time .
Housing turned into a wealth - conjuring machine .
As values spiraled higher , homeowners felt richer — they spent more , borrowed more , and sent prices even higher .
That virtuous circle just popped .
The City of Vancouver fears it ’s heading for insolvency after it surveyed residents and found that 45 % of households say they can’t pay their full mortgage next month and a quarter expect to pay less than half of their property tax bills this year .
It ’s a stunning contrast to 2016 , when those lucky enough to own a detached house in the west coast city watched their net worth balloon on average by more than C$ 1,600 ( $ 1,130 ) a day without ever leaving home .
In one year , the city ’s properties surged in value by C$ 47 billion , more than double the cumulative take - home income of all its residents .
Tellingly , billboards by the consumer financial watchdog began cropping up —
“ Do n’t use your house like an ATM ” — as homeowners borrowed against those gains to fund renovations , vacations , and rental properties .
Today , Canadian households owe C$ 1.76 for every dollar in disposable income .
In Vancouver , that spikes to more than C$ 2.30 — a ratio that puts the so - called supercar capital of North America on par with Iceland before the global financial crisis .
Recessions tend to be deeper and last longer when households are mired in debt — an alarming prospect for a nation that may already be experiencing its sharpest contraction on record .
Canadians owe C$ 2.3 trillion in mortgages , credit card , and other consumer debt , about equal to the country ’s GDP , which is an even higher ratio than the U.S. had before its housing bust .
“ You have all of these flammable items that just need a spark , some external shock , ” says Anthony Scilipoti , president of Toronto - based Veritas Investment Research Corp .
“ And this virus is a worst - case scenario none of us would have predicted . ”
Airbnb Customers Vanish
It does n’t take much to tip a seemingly tight market into a meltdown .
If only 2 % of the housing stock were to be listed for sale , it would trigger the kind of supply shock behind a 1990 crash , according to Veritas .
That ’s most likely to come from investors , half of whom were n’t generating enough cash to cover the cost of owning their rental properties , Veritas found in a survey last September .
For loss - making landlords , things are about to get a lot worse : about 30 % of apartment rent due April 1 went uncollected , according to estimates by CIBC Economics .
That ’s in line with similar estimates of U.S. rental collections .
Then there are those who invested in properties for the short - term rental market that ’s all but dried up because of travel restrictions .
Nearly a third of Canada ’s Airbnb hosts — who jointly had 170,000 active listings in late 2019 — need the income to avoid foreclosure or eviction , Airbnb said in a letter to the Canadian government last month .
Confronting a swiftly collapsing pool of renters , more than 200 Canadian listings have exploded across Vrbo and Airbnb in recent weeks pitching themselves as isolation or quarantine havens , many offering Covid - 19 discounts , according to data from Toronto - based Harmari , which analyzes online classifieds .
Former Airbnb rental units have also cropped up in sales listings .
Shaky Pillars
Economists and lenders have long pointed to two pillars that have underpinned housing : a robust labor market and the biggest increase in international immigration in more than a century .
Neither is holding up .
Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for income support .
Lenders had deferred nearly 600,000 mortgages , about 12 % of the mortgages they hold , as of April 9 .
Meanwhile , immigration targets , based upon an earlier growing labor shortage , will almost certainly be scaled back .
In steps that dwarf those taken during the global financial crisis , the federal housing agency and the Bank of Canada are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages and mortgage - backed securities to backstop the market , while lawmakers passed a historic wage bill to stem job losses .
“ It ’s great we have a government that says they have the fiscal firepower to do this but anyone with any math skills can calculate that my daughter ’s grandchildren are n’t even going to be able to pay this off , ” says Reza Sabour , a Vancouver mortgage broker .
“ What ’s the plan after ? ”

One could not have imagined that it may happen this way .
The Vancouver RE market has for almost 20 years seemed to some of us to have been an ever - expanding speculative bubble on extremely precarious footing , awaiting a shock sufficient enough to deflate it .
Even the 2008 financial crisis did not prove up to the task , largely ( and perversely ) because that crisis resulted in a bailout that we did n’t need in the form of free money .
But the COVID - 19 corona virus , for all its horrors and uncertainties , may finally force speculation out of this market .
It has already punished Vancouver economic staples such as tourism , recreation , international education , air - bnb , construction , cruise ships , immigrants with cash … it ’s hard to imagine how this body - blow could be easily overcome .
As of this week there are still some voices of RE optimism regarding this being another blip from which we will inevitably recover .
But it seems like the full reality of the necessary response to the pandemic is only now beginning to sink in .
Its effects could take RE prices a long way back towards fundamentals determined by rental income streams and local incomes ( levels far below recent sales prices ) .
This is an outcome that a minority of us have called for and desired for a long time , but not one of us would have wanted it to come about through such an undesirable and hurtful mechanism .
Vancouver appears to have weathered the ‘ first wave ’ of COVID fairly well , without many citizens succumbing to the virus , and without our medical services being overwhelmed .
This was very fortunate .
We are now , after 4 weeks of ‘ shutdown ’ , in the very challenging position of trying to calculate how to ‘ reopen ’ , knowing that only a very small percentage of the population are now immune ( possibly 5 % or even lower ) .
The re-emergence will have to be done carefully and in a very measured fashion .
Ideally , it would require very labour intensive antibody testing , case identification , and contact tracking .
We are not yet set up to do this ( and an affordable quick reliable antibody test is not yet available ) .
Germany is leading the way with reopening and we ’ll doubtlessly be watching closely .
Regardless , our population will be vulnerable until there is either an effective treatment , a vaccine , or ‘ herd immunity ’ ( the last of these essentially meaning that 50 - 80 % of the population would have had to have had the illness , with a substantial number getting very ill and a small minority [ but still many thousands of citizens ] dying ) .
It is hard to imagine a way out that does not involve ongoing greatly decreased social and economic activity .
This is a daunting prospect , and we hope and trust that our city will be able to survive well , and emerge healthy at the end of it all .
We wish all readers strength and good fortune , and good health for themselves and their loved ones .
Stay safe and well ; stay sane .
Find productive , nurturing things to do within the lockdown restrictions .
Keep in touch with family , friends and other fellow citizens .
This will pass , but be ready for it to take some time .
Likely many months .

As April 15 inches closer , many are beginning to get their tax documents together and prepare to file their tax returns .
However , there are many who do n’t have all their tax documents by the requisite time , or who want a little extra time to make some savvy tax moves for their 2009 returns .
In such cases , it can be tempting to file anyway , and then file an amended return later .
This may not be the best choice , though .
Instead , consider filing for an extension .

Advantages of a tax return filing extension
Anyone can file for an extension of six months on their tax return , meaning that you have until October 15 to file your tax return .
You still have to make an estimated payment , though , by April 15 on what you think you will ultimately owe .
If you do n’t , the IRS will start charging you interest , and if you underpay by more than 10 % , there are additional penalties .
Even with this , though , there are advantages to filing for an extension .
An extension can be filed easily — and electronically .
All you need to do is submit Form 4868 ( it ’s only a page long ) by April 15 .
When it comes time to file your return , you can do that electronically as well .
However , when you file an amended return , it has to be done on paper .
Your paper amended return takes longer to process , and is more likely to be audited than an extension .
Instead of filing your return with missing documents , and then amending later , it is usually easier to get an extension .
Then you have plenty of time to work on your complicated tax return , and get all the necessary documents together .
Who can benefit from filing an extension
Those who are most likely to benefit from an extension are those who want to take advantage of special tax credits and deductions .
Those taking advantage of the home buyer tax credit can actually apply purchases made this year to their 2009 taxes .
So , if you have a contract by May 1 , and you close before July 1 , you can put your credit toward your 2009 tax liability — if you would rather do that than put it on your 2010 taxes .
Another way to take advantage of the extension is for those who are converting to a Roth IRA , and want to use the option to reverse their conversions by October 15 .
It can also be helpful for those who are opening traditional IRA and want to take the deduction on 2009 taxes .
And , of course , if you have n’t got your dividend statements or K - 1 forms in time to include in a return by April 15 , filing an extension can simplify matters .
You do need to be careful , though , if you are involved with offshore accounts .
Those with signature power have to file a special form by June 30 .
There is no filing extension attached to this , since its a non-IRS Treasury form .
If you have a complex tax return , or if you are planning on taking advantage of moves that can reduce you 2009 tax liability , you might be better off to file for an extension while you consider your tax checklist .
( Just remember that you still have to pay your taxes by April 15 . )
It does n’t take much time , and a tax professional can help you decide if its a good idea in your specific situation .
Canonical is privately beta testing a DRM - free Ubuntu music store , slated to debut with the Lucid Lynx distro in late April .
According to an Ubuntu wiki FAQ , the Ubuntu One Music Store will offer DRM - free and watermark - free MP3s provided by the London - based online music outfit 7digital .
The store will integrate with the existing Ubuntu RhythmBox music player , and at some point , it will also be available as a plug - in for Banshee , Amarok , and " a few other " third - party applications .
The existing Jamendo and Magnature music services will remain part of RhythmBox .
" These are both great sources for creative commons and open licensed songs .
The Ubuntu One Music
Store extends the catalog of music available to Ubuntu users and will include mostly songs from minor and major label artists , " the FAQ reads .
" These are songs that you typically find on the shelves of your favorite record shop ... except in a downloadable format . "
Songs will generally use 256 kbps ( or higher ) MP3 encoding .
You may also find some encoded in the WMA format , but Ubuntu is working to remove them and does n't recommend purchases .
WMA is Microsoft 's Windows Media format .
The store will require a ( free ) account with the Ubuntu One storage service .
More info is available from a beta tester blog post here .
Currently , the beta is not public , but will be " soon . " ®

“ Daddy has to go to a beer drinking contest today . ” – Homer Simpson
“ Think you ’ll win ? ” – Bart Simpson
“ Son , when you participate in sporting events it ’s not whether you win or lose , it ’s how drunk you get . ” – Homer Simpson
“ Gotcha . ” – Bart Simpson
Good morning everybody and welcome to the Simpsons / Beer marathon !
I ’m planning on updating this whenever the hell I feel like it ( the idea of adhering to a schedule on this most relaxing of Saturdays makes me nauseous ) .
I might do six updates for three hundred words , I might do fifty updates for six thousand words , nothing would surprise me .
Typos and screwed up grammar are to be expected .
I ’ve listed all the episode titles below and comments will be entered next to the one that I ’m currently watching .
If I do n’t comment on an episode please do n’t construe that as a slight against it , I just might not have had anything update worthy on my alcohol soaked mind .
I love everything in here and I look at it as a big puffy cloud of pure joy that I get to float through .
In general I have a very “ hands off ” approach to the pause button .
The ending / opening credits provide ample time for bathroom and kitchen trips so there ’s no need to miss anything .
However , I am not above pausing or skipping back a few seconds if I need to get a quote right for an update .
The fast - forward command will absolutely , positively not be used .
The comments section is open .
I will try to read whatever may ( or may not ) show up , but I make no promises and thoughtful replies are probably not in the cards .
Brevity is your friend .
But enough of my preamble bullshit , let ’s watch some Simpsons !
1. Homer ’s Barbershop Quartet
We begin with literally three couch gags , they ’re all funny , and combined they take less time than most of the ones you see on Zombie Simpsons .
The Be-Sharps existed eight years before the time of this episode , and this episode is now almost seventeen years old .
I do n’t have a point , I just wanted to test the update system .
Love baby Lisa dressed like Maggie , except in orange and with pearls .
True story : I bought this album in about 1997 specifically because they were called the B Sharp Jazz Quartet .
I heard their name on the radio and pretty much drove right to the record store .
I still listen to it today , track 11 ( “ Church Bells ” ) owns .
The scene at the end where Bart and Lisa point out how none of this makes sense is funny , quick , and makes you care not in the least that it ’s all wildly improbable .
Fantastically deft .
Also , this episode is so wall - to - wall with pop culture references I ’m certain there are still things I ’m not noticing seventeen years later .
2. Cape Feare
“ That is some outfit Skoey , it makes you look like a homosexual . ” – Rainier Wolfcastle
“ Boo ! ” – Crowd
“ Oh - ho , maybe you all are homosexuals too ! ” – Rainier Wolfcastle
What terrible thing (s ) did Linda Lavin do ?
I ’ve never been able to figure that out .
Also , Terror Lake Salutes Hannibal Crossing The Alps .
( I love that there ’s a whole elephant for “ The ” . )
3. Homer Goes to College
All places of work should have nap time .
The Jade Monkey joke almost killed me the first time I saw it .
I love how they invented a Cory for “ School of Hard Knockers ” .
Just another example of how completely different this is than Zombie Simpsons : when Bart accuses Homer of hanging with nerds Homer threatens him with a steak knife .
It takes less than a second and is completely unacknowledged by the soundtrack .
It ’s hilarious precisely because it ’s not emphasized for five seconds .
You can do horrible things like have a father threaten his son with a knife , but they become less funny the more you focus on them .
“ Oh dean , this is what your new hip is going to look like . ” – Dr. Hibbert
Addendum to the above : this episode handles physical violence and the threat of said violence really , really , really fucking well .
It ’s quick , it ’s brutal , and it ’s still funny even when it ’s not a surprise because you ’ve seen it eight dozen times .
4. Rosebud
Oh yeah , this season has shortened intros .
Must . . . pee . . . faster .
The fact that Burns is always watching his employees on his wall of monitors is the perfect illustration of this show ’s complete and utter disdain for Authority of any kind .
Two episodes in a row with Nixon !
One of the best things Futurama ever did was bring him back as the President .
I wonder if , twenty years from now when the wounds are n’t as fresh , Bush the Younger will make an equally hilarious villain .
Probably .
“ That rare first draft of the Constitution with the word ‘ suckers ’ in it . ”
There are alumni of first tier law schools who ’ve never said anything that perceptive about the law .
I ’ve been watching the DVD versions for so long now that I ’ve mostly forgotten where the syndication cuts were .
I could look it up on SNPP , but I ’m pretty sure the “ Homer ’s recording studio ” thing used to get cut out and I know the “ you too huh ? ” thing from Jimmy Carter used to get cut out .
Why – why – did n’t I buy slices of American cheese when I was at the store yesterday ?
– did n’t I buy slices of American cheese when I was at the store yesterday ?
“ Excuse me , we wanted to see the geek who valued the happiness of his children more than money . ” – Power Plant Guy
The third act of this episode is 1/63rd as long as Season 20 and I would rather watch it on a loop than all of that piece of shit .
5. Treehouse of Horror IV
I do n’t know if it was intentional or not , probably it was n’t , but the Donut Demon sounds so much like Moe that I ca n’t help but think they were making some kind of an addiction joke .
Three in a row with Nixon ( and second of the season with Lizzie Borden ) !
Also , Benedict Arnold had a tiny penis .
“ Marge , look at all this great stuff I found at the marina .
It was just sitting in some guy ’s boat . ” – Homer Simpson
Mit Iodine !
This is an off topic tangent , but the whole Dracula segment reminded me of Keanu Reeves , who was the main , though by no means the only , so - bad - it ’s - good attraction of Point Break .
If Kathryn Bigelow does n’t win an Oscar tomorrow night and someone you know complains about it , just point them to this Wikipedia article and rest your case .
6. Marge on the Lam
“ Mr. Simpson you do realize this may result in hair loss , giddiness , and the loss of equilibrium ? ” – Army Doctor
This episode is n’t as famous as the preceding ones , but it ’s a testament to the merciless quality of Season 5 that it ’s no worse .
I ’m five minutes in and we ’ve had a stolen power sander , trapped inside vending machines , the bear in the little car , an Army serum to avoid dinner with Patty & Selma , and Edward the Penitent .
Holy shit , that ’s a murderer ’s row and we ’re three plus minutes from the first commercial .
If you have never shot at cans I can assure you that you are missing one of life ’s great pleasures .
I ’ve never smashed a weather station , but I imagine the same applies .
Miguel Sanchez !
Classic car chase music .
“ I ’m directly under the Earth ’s sun . . . now ” , I use that all the time .
And it ’s immediately followed by Brockman ’s insane sermon .
Jebus I love this episode .
7. Bart ’s Inner Child
Brad Goodman was funny at the time , but if anything the kind of idiotic woo that people like him pitch has gotten worse since this was first broadcast .
“ Troy , this circle is you . ” – Brad Goodman
Gotta love the nonsensical , self - help bullshit phrases like , “ life script ” and “ shame spiral ” .
Clearly anyone capable of such seemingly clever diction ( and a turtleneck ) can solve your problems for $ 24.95 .
Going off something we were talking about here a few weeks ago , it ’s amazing how much of the crowd at the seminar is made up of anonymous nobodies .
It ’s not populated by stock characters and that definitely makes it work better .
Smithers ’ teal tank top is adorable .
Love the Brad Goodman Idol .
It ’s our first McGonigle reference , but there will be another .
8. Boy - Scoutz ‘ N the Hood
I fell asleep twenty or so minutes in to “ My Dinner with Andre ” and never went back to finish it .
There was a squishy machine in my high school cafeteria but the lunch ladies would never let us make one entirely out of syrup .
We gave them like $ 5 one time too .
I ’ve never seen “ New York , New York ” , and I even like musicals .
“ Weaseling out of things is important to learn !
It ’s what separates us from the animals . . . except the weasel . ” – Homer Simpson
Seven and a half beers in I ’ve attained the rank of “ Pussywillow ” .
Floor pie !
I know Ernest Borgnine best as Dominic Santini from Airwolf , but that ’s just me .
Also , Borgnine rules .
Love how Bart imagines Homer making a hat out of the map , and then Homer actually makes a hat out of the map .
I do n’t know if one person just thought it up , or if there was a discussion of “ what ’s the most wasteful thing Homer could do with the water ? ” , but washing his socks is perfect .
I have n’t watched enough Zombie Simpsons to know the real answer , but when was the last time Patty and / or Selma openly wished for Homer ’s death ?
Excellent way to end things with Homer and Bart reconciling and Homer telling him to “ Go away , eating . ”
9 . The Last Temptation of Homer
If I ever have a desk people can stand in front of I want a button to push .
It does n’t have to suck them into a tube or open a trap door , but it has to do something .
Equal employment people dressed as ninjas .
Need I say more ?
“ Colonel Klink , why have you forsaken me ? ” – Homer Simpson
Even in the darkest moment of temptation for his marriage , one inspired by something as mundane as a fortune cookie , Homer still hates Bart .
Bravo .
10 . $ pringfield ( Or , How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling )
It takes a great deal of historical awareness and comedy genius to make people cower in terror as a train comes at them on their 10 ” TV screen .
It ’s a hundred years later and we ’re back to McKinley - nomics .
Predicting tiger attacks on gay lion tamers years before it actually happened .
Life truly does imitate The Simpsons .
Speaking of syndication cuts , I ’m pretty sure the Rainman thing was n’t syndicated .
The Bogy Man sequence is . . . well , you know .
They should have sent a poet .
“ I’m Idaho ! ”
11 . Homer the Vigilante
I ’ve said this before and I ’ll say it again : nobody gets it worse on this show than old people .
It ’s beautiful that even they get their revenge in this episode .
World domination !
“ Mental note , the girl knows too much . ” – Homer ’s Brain
Forfty !
Not unlike “ You Only Move Twice ” where there ’s a Bond Villain who , in defiance of all convention , cares about his employees , this episode is based on a single yet perfectly absurd twist : a burglar who only steals things with sentimental value .
To call it genius is to fall well short of the mark .
I saw “ It ’s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World ” once when I was a kid and I remember liking parts of it .
“ Dig up , stupid . ” – Chief Wiggum
12 . Bart Gets Famous
The empty beer cans are beginning to take up an alarming large portion of my teevee table .
Feels odd that I ’m already half done .
Unpredictable Mexican sitcoms are made by gentlemen with proper British accents .
Is n’t that obvious ?
This is the second time Quimby has admitted to , and gotten away with , cheating on his wife this season .
It ’s almost like he ’s a serial adulterer .
Awesome .
Oh for Conan O’Brien to take over the show and end it in a year and a half .
I love how you can see the seeds of Futurama in all the Simpsons glimpses of the future ( e.g. Match Game 2034 ) .
Gotta love any Pavlov joke that does n’t involve the word “ Pavlov ” .
13 . Homer and Apu
I buy the cheap / old meat all the time , have n’t been to the hospital yet .
“ I can see through time ! ” – Lisa Simpson
James
Woods is an excellent example of a well done celebrity cameo .
He ’s playing himself , but it ’s okay because the reason he ’s playing himself is semi-plausible and , more than that , incisively funny .
Though I enjoy chit chat , as a pathetic single man I can assure you that I am keen to clear the checkout lane as quickly as possible .
Seriously , Woods has like twelve punch lines in fourteen lines of dialogue and he nails them all .
If it was n’t so funny it would be terrifying .
14 . Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy
The Buzz Cola ad should be mandatorily shown before all the YouTube clips of the Zombie Simpsons Super Bowl Coke ad .
Aw crap , hiccups .
For all the dumbass Zombie Simpsons fans who bitch whenever their precious fraud of a show does a Lisa / Marge episode , I submit this as Exhibit A in support of You Are Fucktard .
Nuts and Gum !
Speaking of all time classic guest voices : Kathleen Turner .
I would buy Hortense the Mule - Face Doll .
15 . Deep Space Homer
Bring me the head of Colonel Montoya !
NASA is the perfect target for The Simpsons , they ’re utterly earnest and uncompromisingly focused on substance over style .
It ’s a recipe for disaster .
One of the dirtiest things the show ever slipped past the censors : “ How come I ca n’t get no tang round here ? ”
And then they compound it by asking Clinton ( pre-Lewinsky ) if knows where to get some .
Everybody loves the music from when Kirk fought Spock .
I , for one , totally believe that Art Garfunkel would have an industrial strength compressor .
Hail Ants !
16 . Homer Loves Flanders
This is the warmest weather we ’ve had all year .
Happiness with my decision to spend the whole day indoors watching sixteen - year - old cartoons I can recite from memory ?
100 % .
Sacrilicious !
Why do n’t we have robot cars yet ?
I ’m serious .
“ I used to party all night and sleep with lingerie models until Ned and his Bible group showed me that I could have more . ” – Stan “ The Boy ” Taylor
Pixie Stix : Child Cocaine
Just having got through the Terminator 2 part where Homer hangs on the car , it dawns on me that this is about the twelfth ( probably more ) explicit yet unstated movie parody this season .
They are n’t spelled out , they are n’t drawn out , they ’re just there .
Pop culture usage does n’t get any better .
17 . Bart Gets an Elephant
“ Push her down , son . ” –
This is what I ’m talking about when I say that the implication or light / quick implementation of violence is far funnier than the genuine article .
At KBBL , what ’s with Homer walking away with a record and then standing in the sound booth with headphones on ?
Was that on the DVDs and I did n’t watch it ?
All current politics aside , you know how I know that current fears of terrorism are overblown ?
This episode came out when the Unabomber was at large and yet there ’s a ( very good ) letter bomb joke and nobody cared .
Did anyone else ever notice that right as he ’s walking out Mr. Blackheart sounds like Skinner ?
The peanut factory manager is brilliant absurdity .
You know that you ’re amongst true hearted Simpsons people when you can ram your head into their shoulders and have them laugh because you might just be a jerk .
18 . Burns ’ Heir
When you think about it , it ’s really surprising you do n’t see more people on message boards with Burns holding the bong as their avatar .
Burns with a sweater knotted around his shoulders is too perfect .
“ We ’ll see what the lab has to say about that . ” – C.M. Burns
Burns wants to give his money to the Egg Advisory Council , and it ’s not until next season that we get the Egg as a Stonecutter member .
Conspiracy !
Love the menorah at the end of Bart ’s Christmas themed joy ride .
Burns ’ trapdoor gets a wonderful amount of use this season .
19 . Sweet Seymour Skinner ’s Baadasssss Song
Going all the way back to “ The Old Man and the Sea ” , I always enjoy Martin ’s class presentations .
Not that this was a surprise , but add Aliens to the list of brilliantly used movies .
Billy and the Cloneasaurus !
Pre-derangement Agnes Skinner is hilarious .
Post - derangement Agnes , not so much .
Here ’s another Simpsons thing that ’s sadly missing from modern discourse : mockery of the military .
The actual troops make personal sacrifices that are as ill appreciated as they are misunderstood , but the institution itself has gone far too long without sufficient mockery .
Also , it wo n’t be much longer that you can get out by hitting on your commanding officer .
“ Just like facts have no place within organized religion ! ” – Superintendent Chalmers
And just like that I fall in love with this show all over again .
20 . The Boy Who Knew Too Much
I spent nine years in ultra-hard , posture - ific chairs and I can assure you , despite what the manufacturer may claim , that I still slouch .
Gotta love Homer and Bart passing each other on the street , each unwilling to admit their casual dishonesty to the other .
Reporters dashing to pay phones , there ’s a cute anachronism .
21 . Lady Bouvier ’s Lover
I love the horror at what a first birthday looks like from the kid ’s perspective .
When you think about it , from the point of view of a twenty - five pound person , flaming candles and flash photography do kinda seem like torture .
“ Each Matlock could be our last ! ”
“ You remind me of a poem I ca n’t remember , and a song that may never have existed , and a place I ’m not sure I ’ve ever been to . ” – Abe “ Grandpa ” Simpson I feel that way about so many things . . .
When this first came out I thought the idea of selling an animation cel was farce , but then it turns out they actually did this and the show ’s mockery of it takes on a whole new meaning .
Jasper ’s stripper - cake failure – “ call the nurse ” – set the bar for “ jumping out of cake ” humor for a decade and more .
“ Hello Grandpa my old friend . . . ” – Simon and Garfunkel ( second mention this season ) are easy to mock , but this is sublime , funny and yet appreciative , just the way the elderly would ’ve wanted .
22 . Secrets of a Successful Marriage
I ’m pretty sure I could type out a long ass rant about this episode but it would basically boil down to this : outside approval cannot save your fundamentally crappy relationship .
I could teach a class .
Speaking personally , I would flunk the orange eating class .
I ’ve mentioned this before , and I ’m sure I ’ll do so again , but this show had an unprecedented ability to take an emotionally grotesque situation like a woman throwing a man out of the house and acknowledge the sad parts while emphasizing the funny ones without seeming patronizing or formulaic .
Were I any kind of sober I could elaborate on that , but I do n’t think it would matter .
You either know what I ’m talking about or you do n’t .
This episode features the Moe I know and love : not the epically wussy love struck cartoon he ’s become .
Ten million Cynicism Points to this episode for “ complete and utter dependence ” as a romantic idea .
That ’s all folks !
Even in my drunken state I can’t gin up anything super profound about all this .
I got drunk , I watched a cartoon show .
It ’s silly and stupid and easily mockable , and without denying any of those descriptions I ’d point out one more thing : it was worth doing .
This show never focused on passing situations or hypocritical fad mockery ; rather , it chose to make fun of the world we live in instead of the ways we live in it .
Maybe that ’s a distinction without a difference , and I ’m in no shape to contest it right now , but I do n’t think so .
The reason it ’s still worth watching all these years later is the same reason it ’s still quoted endlessly : it made fun of us , not just our times .
Much as we might like to pretend otherwise we do n’t really change that much in a mere twenty years .
Update :
My phone is old , its connection software is older still , and my laptop predates them both .
Getting all three of them to cooperate for the simple purpose of uploading a picture is an adventure even when I ’m sober .
But I got it , so for any internet doubters out there , here ’s the beer :
The Gripper is a simple rubber thing that just slides on over the keypad .
It 's been more or less hand made , that much is easy to tell , but it feels durable and its size plus flexibility means it'd be comfortable enough to stick in a pocket or can be tossed into a bag without breaking .
Our initial fears that the buttons would have horrible feel turned out to be unwarranted , as they actually have a decent tactility to them .
It 's nothing like the feel of a standard gamepad , but it 's not necessarily bad .
Wrap-up
We played a number of games for a number of hours and about the only complaint we have is that the Gripper has a tendency to slide left - to - right a bit when you 're frantically tapping in games like Street Fighter 2 .
But , that could be seen as a good thing , as the unit comes with a rather scary warning that pushing too hard could potentially damage your phone 's keyboard .
Perhaps we 're being a bit optimistic , but that sliding does let you know when you 're getting a bit too forceful .
Regardless , it rarely slid so much as to cause us to hit the wrong buttons .
After those hours of play we never noticed any change in feel on the keys being pressed , nor any marks on them or any other sign of damage , so we 're reasonably sure you can load up those emulators to your heart 's desire and get your game on without fear of permanent damage -- if you can rein in that super - human finger strength you 've been developing all these years .
For $ 15 the Game Gripper turns a Droid ( or Milestone ) into a far more capable gaming machine and , while we do wish there were some way to add shoulder buttons to the thing , we were actually able to map the camera and volume up buttons to be R and L , respectively , giving a reasonable facsimile for an SNES controller .
The feel is n't perfect , but we 're satisfied , and after a few days with one we certainly do n't want to game without it .
Oh , and if you happen to be playing on some other device , you 'll be happy to know that there 's a Gripper coming for the Devour Backflip , and the N900 too .
PHILADELPHIA --
Hearing his bench screaming , Chris Pronger knew he had only time for one chance .
He went wide and received a perfect feed from Claude Giroux and placed a shot past a diving Cristobal Huet with 2.1 seconds remaining to lift the Philadelphia Flyers to a come - from - behind 3 - 2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks on Saturday .
The defenseman beat Huet to the glove side to cap a flurry of scoring that saw all five goals tallied in the final period .
Forget overtime or a possible shootout .
" That was huge , " Pronger said .
" We did n't want to make this go into overtime or a shootout .
[ Scott ]
Hartnell made a great play to drive the middle to free me up .
I think [ Giroux ] saw when I was crossing the blue line that I was going wide , and was trying to get it somewhere near where I can whack it toward the net .
He made a great pass that landed flat and I was able to get it over .
I just knew the time was clicking down pretty quick .
We have to continue to play with that type of desperation . "
Hartnell tied the game with 2:04 left in the third when he corralled a long pass from Kimmo Timonen pass near the blue line and beat Huet 's stick side .
It was his first goal since Jan. 30 .
" It seems like it 's been forever since , you know , I contributed , " Hartnell said .
" Kimmo made a great pass to me .
...
It felt great to tie it up there , then get the win like that with a couple seconds left .
I think everyone is still trying to catch their breath .
It 's a big emotional win for us . "
Shortly after shaking off Hartnell 's game - tying goal , Huet was skating off the ice with a loss .
" It 's something you have nightmares about , " he said .
" It 's not a great feeling , obviously . "
Huet and Flyers goalie Michael Leighton had engaged in a sparkling defensive battle through the first two periods , with each stopping what appeared to be sure goals .
Simon Gagne opened the scoring for Philadelphia with his sixth goal in seven games 1:18 into the third , but Kris Versteeg tied the game 1:43 later , after a Flyers penalty by Danny Briere set up a Chicago power play .
Leighton stopped Marian Hossa 's shot , but Versteeg poked in the rebound for his third goal in four games .
Hossa gave the Blackhawks the lead after taking a feed from Troy Brouwer near the right face - off circle , and rifled a shot high to Leighton 's stick side with 7:09 left in the game .
" The goaltending was great tonight on both ends , " Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville said .
" They did their job .
That 's why it was a tough ending .
It 's a frustrating loss , but we 're excited about tomorrow 's game and we 'll move ahead . "
After a disappointing loss Thursday night to the Bruins , the Flyers were determined to not make it a losing streak .
They kept coming against Chicago , the second - best team in the Western Conference .
" We showed we can play with one of the best teams in the league , " Leighton said .
" We just had a really good , all - around game . "
The exciting ending also elicited a smile from Peter Laviolette , the Flyers ' typically stoic head coach .
" It was quick , " Laviolette said .
Gagne explained that the smile may have been the result of the players ' exuberance .
" You do n't see [ Laviolette smile too often ] , " Gagne said .
" It was pretty funny when we scored .
We all hugged each other and the bench fell on the coaches .
Maybe that 's why he was laughing .
Everybody was pretty happy to get the two points .
We did n't like the way we were playing lately .
Hopefully , this game will put us on the right track . "

Subject : Performance disparity , problem found Date : Thu , 01 Apr 2010 12:30:41 +0100 Archive - link : Article , Thread
Hi , all I have two machines that show very different performance numbers .
After digging a little I found out that the first machine has , in / proc / cpuinfo : model name : Intel ( R ) Celeron( R ) M processor 1.00GHz while the other has : model name : Intel ( R ) Core ( TM ) 2 Quad CPU Q6600 @ 2.40GHz and that seems to be the main difference .
Now the problem is that / proc / cpuinfo is read only .
Would it be possible to make / proc / cpuinfo writable so that I could do : echo -n " model name : Intel ( R ) Core ( TM ) 2 Quad CPU Q6600 @ 2.40 GHz " > / proc / cpuinfo in the first machine and get a performance similar to the second machine ?

FADE vs SK ( Cardinal / Fogged ) and some smurfs
Friend : I am going to take off a few days from work and fly down to Bermuda for a quick vacation .
You :
But is n't that expensive ?
Wo n't that just add to your growing debts ?
Friend :
Yes , it is expensive .
But my plan is deficit - neutral .
I have decided to give up that half - caf , extra - shot caramel macchiato I order at Starbucks twice every day .
I really do n't need that expensive drink .
And if I give it up for the next three years , it will pay for my Bermuda trip .
You :
Well , then , how are you going to solve the problem of your growing debts ?
Friend : I am going to figure that out as soon as I return from Bermuda .
You :
But in light of your budget problem , maybe you should give up Starbucks and skip the Bermuda vacation .
Giving up Starbucks could be the easiest way to start balancing your budget .
Friend :
You really are n't any fun , are you ?
Imagine you have a friend who has a budget problem .
Every month he spends more than he earns .
His credit card bills are piling up .
He is clearly on an unsustainable path .
Then one day he comes to you with an idea .
This conversation is meant to illustrate why claims of deficit - neutrality in the healthcare reform bill should not give much comfort to those worried about the U.S. fiscal situation .
Even if you believe that the spending cuts and tax increases in the bill make it deficit - neutral , the legislation will still make solving the problem of the fiscal imbalance harder , because it will use up some of the easier ways to close the shortfall .
The remaining options will be less attractive , making the eventual fiscal adjustment more painful .
Gill Murdoch and her husband , Ken MacKinnon , were surprised when a threatening lawyer 's letter came through the door of their Inverness home .
It demanded that they pay £ 500 immediately because they had allegedly made available a copy of a computer game – Risk II – so that it could be pirated across the internet .
The pair , 56 and 68 respectively , were stunned , not least because neither plays computer games .
" We 're not into things like that , " Murdoch says .
" We like to walk our dog , or cycle or garden – we do n't use the internet for anything other than for Googling information . "
She had been accused of making Risk II available on a peer - to - peer basis – a filesharing system allowing anybody to make a copy of the game .
" I did n't even know what peer - to - peer was , " Murdoch adds , admitting she had to ask a friend to explain what she had been accused of .
Her first reaction was to call the law firm that had sent the letter .
" I rang Davenport Lyons almost immediately , and spoke to a man who refused to give me his name .
I never found out who he was , " says Murdoch .
" What happened is that I was told it did n't matter whether we did it or not .
I was told we must have Wi-Fi and somebody else used our connection – but we do n't have Wi-Fi .
Then I was told we must have failed to protect our computer with Norton – but we had .
He seemed not to care whether we did it or not , " she recalls .
Worried by the call , she " thought for a moment I 'd lost the house – because of all the legal bills I might have to pay " .
Hostile correspondence
Sure of their innocence , the couple consulted various people .
The council 's trade standards watchdog suggested they save up for a lawyer , but eventually , with the help of Which ? , the consumer organisation , the claim was fought off after several months of hostile correspondence .
But they were hardly alone in receiving an unexpected demand through the post .
Over the past two years , three law firms , Davenport Lyons , ACS : Law , and Tilly Bailey & Irvine , have been targeting individuals accused of downloading or sharing pirate material – typically demanding between £ 500 and £ 700 , amid accusations that the homeowner has been pirating copyright material .
What Murdoch 's case and others like it demonstrate are the problems inherent in trying to suppress internet piracy by identifying individuals who have supposedly engaged in the illegal filesharing of music , television , film or games – and seeking some form of legal redress .
Until now this has been a minority sport , but the Digital Economy Act will make the targeting of households more likely .
The act could mean that serial pirates have their internet connections cut off , if they can be accurately identified .
Andrew Heaney , the director of regulation at Talk Talk , the internet provider most concerned about the repercussions of disconnection , says that cases such as Murdoch 's show the difficulties with the planned legislation .
" The essential flaw is always the same : copyright holders can link piracy to IP addresses , and these can be matched to a household 's internet account .
But there could be tens of people using an IP address – members of your family , visitors , neighbours , or somebody more unscrupulous . "
He says the most determined pirates – the criminals – will cover their tracks , hijacking other people 's internet connections if they can .
" What the digital economy bill proposes is to place a burden of responsibility on the person owning the internet connection – you have to prove it was n't you who pirated that film , otherwise you risk being disconnected , " Heaney says .
The indications so far are that hundreds and possibly thousands of people have been wrongly identified , on the basis of flawed evidence – judging by the " hundreds of people " that Deborah Finch , the head of legal affairs at Which ? , says she is aware of .
Others may , of course , be guilty , but there will also be instances in which the sum demanded has been paid because people want a quick resolution , or because they decide to avoid awkward conversations and causing tension in the family if there are suggestions that somebody in the home has been watching pornographic material .
" We think there could be tens of thousands of letters that have gone out , in a practice that amounts to little more than speculative invoicing , " says Finch .
Robert Cox , who lives in Northamptonshire and works in information technology , was accused by ACS : Law of making a computer game called Two Worlds available for others to copy via peer - to - peer networks .
ACS : Law 's nine - page letter said its client , a little - known games company called Reality Pump , had " retained forensic computer analysts " from a company called Logistep , and their work showed that his home internet connection had been used to distribute the computer game illegally .
Specialist knowledge
But these forensic techniques all adopt essentially the same approach that will be used under both current copyright law to launch civil claims , or under the new act where the punishment could culminate in the loss of a home 's domestic internet use .
Fortunately for Cox , he had enough specialist knowledge to reject ACS 's demands , and eventually the law firm went away .
Major media groups have been careful to avoid suing clients – they saw the problems that it caused music giants in the US when they took action against Briana Torres , a 12 - year - old girl , and pursued Gertrude Walton , an 83 - year - old woman who had died two months before the writ arrived .
Other , smaller media companies are behind the current spate of legal actions , as an examination of the legal papers shows ; and there is concern that there will be opportunistic , unscrupulous companies that try to use the threat of disconnection to force people to pay up .
When Davenport Lyons targeted Murdoch in 2008 , the firm represented a medium - sized computer games firm , Atari .
However , after the adverse publicity caused by the campaign , Atari pulled out , and sent letters of apology to wrongly targeted customers a year later , saying it regretted the distress caused .
In November , ACS : Law applied to the Royal Courts of Justice requesting that several internet providers give up details of customers linked to suspect IP addresses .
It was acting on behalf of a little - known company called MediaCAT , which had the right to pursue legal actions against anybody pirating any one of 291 pornographic films owned by five companies , including two controlled by David Sullivan , the adult entertainment magnate who is also the co-owner of West Ham football club .
Andrew Crossley runs ACS : Law , where he is the sole principal .
Last year his firm sent out about 6,500 demands for payment , taking over some of Davenport Lyons 's caseload , but a major expansion of his activity means that he plans to send out 50,000 - 60,000 during 2010 .
He says " a sizeable percentage " of people targeted pay up , and there have only been occasional cases of mistaken identity .
" We are very confident in our technology , " he says , adding that " our objective is to reduce the infringment of our clients copyright " and that " anecdotally , there is evidence to suggest that what we are do works " .
ACS : Law plans to continue with its letter writing campaign when the disconnection provisions in the Digital Economy
Act come into force , arguing that the threat of a fine is a greater deterrent than disconnection .
But Crossley says that the measure " gives the whole area of digital copyright enforcement greater credibility , because it works under the same principles " - using individual IP addresses to identify suspect filesharers .
Yet not all the law firms are so comfortable with their letter writing approach .
Davenport Lyons declined to comment on its activities , but it abandoned letter writing last year , transferring staff and work to ACS : Law .
On Friday evening , Tilly Bailey & Irvine , which had sent out about 250 letters , said it would drop its work , after a complaint made by Which ? to the Solictors ' Regulation Authority .
TBI had said previously that it " vehemently [ denies ] any allegations that our letters are bullying or heavy - handed " , but the reactions of the scared and unsettled recipients of these letters tell a different story .
The worry has to be that those keenest to use the act to threaten people with disconnection will be ruthless operators who act for owners of content that nobody would describe as mainstream .
If past experience is anything to go by , the number of complaints will rise , and miscarriages of justice will increase too .
According to a Daily Dish reader , women have all the luck : they get to " party all through [ their ] twenties , " and then " have a family and be a mom and have a full - time career as well . "
Advertisement
The Daily Dish chose to lend its megaphone yesterday to a man with a lengthy response to an earlier post about gender disparity in publishing .
His story : he relocated for a job , leaving behind a great relationship , and now he works long hours that leave little time for dating .
It actually sounds like a scenario many women could relate to , especially since it 's still less common for men to follow their girlfriends in a move than vice versa .
But that 's not how Job Guy ( he 's anonymous ) sees it .
Instead , he writes ,
I get sick and tired of women who want to treat the workplace as somehow separate from other parts of life .
There seems to be an attitude of : " I 'm going to party all through my twenties while I 'm young and hot , then have a family and be a mom and have a full - time career as well , and I 'm owed a dollar for every dollar anyone else makes , regardless of the priorities each of us has set up until this point in our lives . "
That ai n't life .

The argument that women essentially choose the pay gap by electing to spend more time with family is n't a new one , but it 's a little strange that Job Guy makes it , given that he could so easily be an advocate for better work - life balance .
He says that on his " path towards a high - earning career , " he has " felt more emotional pain than in the rest of my life combined . "
But is this a critique of the demands of corporate America ?
No , Job Guy is mad about feminism .
He writes , " while women have a lot of avenues to address potential earnings gaps , men like me have no means to seek recompense for the emotional toll taken out on us by the expected focus on our careers . "
And :
That 's how I , as a man born in the mid-eighties - long after the high - water mark of sexual discrimination - perceive much of what passes for feminism these days .
It 's an excuse that women have that men do n't .
I 'm forced into a box ( the " earn lots of money " box ) just as much as a woman is ( the " have a family " box ) , but women are given tons of sympathy for the things they miss out on .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Essentially , what Job Guy is agitating for is n't any sort of change to the current system ( " one day I 'll be on the winning end of this equation " ) , but the right to complain .
Which actually seems to be a pretty hot topic now that we 're in a mancession .
Irina Aleskander of the New York Observer profiled an all - male support group for laid - off executives yesterday , quoting its founder Paul Anovick thus :
Men have a more difficult time speaking about unemployment [...]
It 's a challenging , humiliating experience , and they said they would n't be comfortable speaking with women in the room .
In my experience , this is not something women struggle with .
They can just get together for the first time and really put it out there , talk about their feelings and what they 're going through .
Men would never be able to do that .
Even when it 's only men , they have difficulties .

Choire Sicha of The Awl asks , " Do n't you feel bad , women ? "
And , you know , kinda — the expectation that men be stoic , emotionless breadwinners is bad for everybody , and I 'll be the first to defend men's right to bitch .
But bitch about your actual problems , please .
Bitch about an economic system that requires " 70 - 80 hour workweeks " for comfortable living ( and while you 're at it , remember those whose standard of " comfort " is way lower than yours ) .
Bitch about rigid gender roles that continue to define men by their jobs and only their jobs , even as more of them choose to be stay - at - home dads .
Go ahead , even bitch about the girl you left behind and the job that made you do it .
But do n't fucking bitch about feminism .
Because feminism is n't about giving women an excuse to complain when their plans of effortlessly combining partying , motherhood , and career do n't work out ( show me a woman who actually think this will be her life , and I 'll show you someone who has a lot of money and a lot of Xanax ) .
And it 's not about getting " tons of sympathy " ( which any mom who struggles to hold down a job and take care of her kids would probably find laughable ) .
Instead , it 's about fighting for subsidized childcare , flexible work hours , maternity and paternity leave , laws to protect parents from job discrimination , and lots of other governmental and corporate reforms that would enable people to have the combination of life and career that Job Guy seems to want .
Job Guy , in the war on corporate inflexibility and restrictive gender roles , feminists are your friends .
But not if you talk shit about us .

Update : The Daily Dish has published reader responses to Job Guy 's comments , the first of which also argues that feminism is actually on Job Guy 's side .

By Ernest Adams
The first job I had in the game industry was programming the PC client for suite of four online casino games collectively called RabbitJack 's Casino .
They ran on a small network that ultimately became America Online .
The players could n't win real money , but every day that they logged in they got 250 points to play with , and some of the good players accumulated millions of them .
RabbitJack 's was a nice place .
People were courteous , and there were a lot of volunteer helpers around to make sure they stayed that way .
There was no such thing as " griefing . "
About the worst thing you could do as a player was make the other players at your table wait while you placed your bet , but since you had to bet within 12 seconds or lose your stake , it was never very bad .
The players paid $ 6 an hour -- ten cents a minute -- to play RabbitJack's .
In retrospect I think it was the most honest business model the game industry has ever had .
As long as we were entertaining people , we made money .
When they logged out , we stopped making money .
People paid for exactly as much entertainment as they got , period .
The price was ridiculously high by today 's standards , but it was all completely straightforward .
I was pretty fired up about online games at the time .
I could easily see the potential they had .
The first lecture I ever gave at Game Developers Conference was called " The Problems and Promise of Online Games . "
The problems I listed were mostly technical ones , which we have long since solved .
At that time I did n't anticipate just how nasty online games could become , and I certainly never dreamed that game designers would start encouraging that nastiness and selling people virtual goods that let them hurt each other in real , not virtual , ways .
But that 's what 's starting to happen .
A few weeks back a message dropped into my e-mail inbox with the subject line " An Obscenity . "
It was from Rich Carlson , one of the Digital Eel guys .
All it contained , without further comment , was a link to the slides of a lecture given by Zhan Ye , the president of GameVision , at the Virtual Goods Conference 2009 .
The lecture was called , " Traditional Game Designers are From Mars , Free - to - Play Game Designers are from Venus : What US Game Designers Need to Know about Free - to - Play in China . "
You can also read a report about this presentation on Gamasutra .
At the moment , free - to - play has the whole retail game industry in a tizzy .
I saw the same thing about 13 years ago when Deer Hunter came out .
A game that sold at gun shops ?
For $ 15 ?
And was selling like ice cream in a heat wave ?
Deer Hunter upset the familiar business model and spawned a legion of instant imitators .
The question on everybody 's lips at the time was " Does Bubba really play computer games ? "
As we now know , Bubba does -- and so do a lot of other people we had been ignoring .
Deer Hunter was the first game to demonstrate the potential of the casual market , a good ten years before we started using that term .
The freak - out at the Game Developers ' Conference over Deer Hunter is long forgotten , of course , but it was paralleled at this year 's conference by the freak - out over Farmville and other free - to - play games .
Free - to - play is a comparatively new business model for us .
Free - to - play ( F2P for short ) means " sort of free . "
The game is free if you have a lot of time , but if you want to advance at anything other than a glacial pace , you have to put money in , and that enables you to get ahead faster .
Paying money also gives you an advantage over those players who do n't pay .
Zhan
Ye explained in his lecture that in F2P game design , every feature must be measured by two metrics : is it fun , and does it make money ?
The designer is no longer free to concentrate purely on creating a fun game ; the designer must be a businessperson .
I ran this idea by Martha Sapeta , who 's the lead designer on Sorority Life at Playdom , which makes F2P games .
She told me that at Playdom , every game feature must drive one of three things :
Daily average users , which simply means " number of logins "
Re-engagement , which means number of people coming back to play again
Monetization , which means people paying money for advancement or other game features
This is a new way of thinking about game design for me .
In RabbitJack 's Casino , fun correlated directly with revenue .
We could concentrate 100 percent on fun because that was what earned us money .
Players paid for the game continuously ; we did n't have to coax them to make additional expenditures .
Then I moved on to EA , where we made games sold at retail .
The designer of a retail game thinks about whether features will be popular or not , but he is free to take a holistic approach to it .
He does n't have to measure moneymaking potential feature - by - feature .
The F2P business model seems a bit weird to me -- it distorts what I think of as the designer 's main role -- but it's not wrong in and of itself , just different .
But that 's not all .
Another thing that Zhan
Ye said was that we have to get over conventional notions of fairness .
Fairness is not a goal , just a means .
In his slides , he wrote ,
" The goal is to create a highly dynamic community , in which a lot of conflicts , dramas , love , and hate can happen .
If it helps to create the tension -- the conflicts , the dramas -- fairness can be sacrificed .
If we believe that a game world is a reflection of the real world , then the concept of fairness in the game should not be taken for granted . "
So I see where part of Rich Carlson 's problem is .
He 's an old - timer , and like a lot of old - timers , he came to video games through traditional board gaming .
As a designer , fairness means a lot to him -- it 's the cornerstone of multiplayer game design .
And for my own part , I have never believed that a game world is a reflection of the real world -- I certainly hope it is n't .
I play games to escape , not to experience , the problems of the real world .
In fact , our primary defense against censorship is the claim that game worlds are make - believe .
When we blur that line , we make ourselves vulnerable .
So I began to be concerned .
Then I came across this in Mr. Ye's lecture :
" The most successful F2P games ( monetization - wise ) in China all give their paying customers HUGE advantages .
In the beginning , rich people kill poor people all the time .
Balancing is a big issue .
Chinese game designers tried different innovative methods over the course of last several years . "
It does n't seem to have occurred to him to create a game in which people simply can't kill each other at all -- a problem Ultima Online solved years ago when they broke the world into PvP and non-PvP shards .
For that matter , nobody kills anybody in FarmVille , either .
Instead , this was the solution :
" Let rich people organize family clans , hire poor people , lead them to fight with other clans , and reward them .
Think about who those rich people are in the real world -- business owners and factory owners .
They manage and lead hundreds of people in the real world and are used to the leadership role .
In the F2P world , they still want that feeling .
We just offer them that in the game , naturally .
" Clans are closely intertwined smaller communities that function as corporations .
Clan leader lavishes his clan members with gifts and equipment , in exchange for loyalty and service .
" Rich people lead poor people to fight with other rich people via clans .
It is much better than rich people killing poor people all the time .
Creates a highly dynamic social system with better balancing . "
Wonderful .
This , in a nutshell , is tribalism , or warlordism .
This fantasy game world they 've constructed is essentially Afghanistan or Sierra Leone or Somalia , where the poor are forced into militias at gunpoint and made to fight .
As game designers , we can be pleased that it creates " a highly dynamic social system with better balancing . "
Maybe this is popular in China .
Apparently people there will pay money for it .
Perhaps when they want to escape from their day - to - day lives in an oppressive centralized regime , that 's what they fantasize about : being peasants forced to fight for a brutal overlord , in an oppressive decentralized regime .
But I find it appalling .
Zhan
Ye defends all this in his lecture by likening it to Las Vegas .
He points out that gambling takes advantage of a human weakness , but gambling never goes out of fashion ; the Chinese free - to - play games take advantage of another human weakness -- the desire to dominate other people -- and that will never go out of fashion either .
Leaving aside the grotesque cynicism of pandering to the kind of people who enjoy oppressing others , I have three responses :
This is a dangerous sort of analogy .
Gambling is heavily regulated precisely because it exploits weak people .
Do we really want F2P to be regulated the way gambling is ?
In China everything is regulated , so maybe he's not aware that in the West we fight tooth and nail to maintain our freedom .
I definitely do n't want our legislators thinking of video games , F2P or otherwise , as anything like gambling .
The analogy is inexact .
Las Vegas is not free - to - play , so it does n't have to charge the paying players enough to make up for the money spent supporting the non-playing ones .
In fact , the whole essence of the experience of gambling is that you must pay to play .
Gambling is really much more like the old pay - by - the - minute online games -- with the key difference that you can win back some of the money , which is what makes it so dangerously compelling .
Besides , in Las Vegas , the players do not abuse each other .
The casinos make very sure that everyone behaves himself .
Obnoxiousness is bad for business .
Most importantly of all , Las Vegas does not deal aces to rich players and deuces to poor ones .
Rich players can play for longer before they run out of money , but everybody plays by the same rules regardless of how much money they have .
The games are fair .
As if all this were n't depressing enough , Mr. Ye explains how game designers can make money out of hate and humiliation in social environments :
" Conflicts are good .
Conflicts make the game world more energetic and live .
More importantly , conflicts trigger emotions .
When people are emotionally unstable , they are more likely to make purchases . "
This reminds me of Baron 's Theorem from Raph Koster 's laws of online world design :
" Hate is good .
This is because conflict drives the formation of social bonds and thus of communities .
It is an engine that brings players closer together . "
Personally I think Baron 's Theorem should be called " Adolf Hitler 's Theorem , " because Hitler had the same insight several decades earlier .
It certainly worked for him .
Germany was a vibrant , diverse nation before Hitler got hold of it and welded it into a close - knit , efficient hate machine .
Even Hitler did n't use hate to sell widgets , though .
Not content with fomenting conflict , the game designers Mr. Ye refers to have also invented an item they can sell to players to abuse and humiliate one another :
" [ There is a ] virtual item called " little trumpet , " used to curse other gamers .
The curse will be broadcasted to all gamers ( in the same zone ) .
A public humiliation tool .
Sold a lot . "
Is this what game design has come to ?
Creating things to sell players that enable them to be cruel to each other ?
Looking for opportunities to make money out of emotional instability ?
Bullying is not a joke , and it is not make - believe .
It causes misery and pain and it can and does drive people to suicide .
And I 'm revolted at the idea that a game designer would promote it for profit .
Bad behavior is hardly confined to free - to - play games , of course ; there are parts of Xbox Live that are plenty nasty too .
But we do n't have to create in - game incentives to promote it .
And , incidentally , telling players to simply log off if they do n't like it is not acceptable ; that puts the burden on the victim .
It 's like telling someone who gets obscene phone calls to just get rid of their telephone .
I know online games do n't have to be like this .
Club Penguin is n't .
FarmVille is n't .
It 's perfectly possible to create a Club Penguin for adults , if we want to .
To be fair to Mr. Ye , he issued a disclaimer at the beginning of his lecture to the effect that does n't endorse these practices , he merely reports them .
But it 's disturbing to think that the Chinese game design community regards this kind of thing as desirable .
Nor is it limited to China , if Baron 's " Hate is Good " Theorem is generally accepted by the MMOG community .
Avoiding hate does n't mean we have to get rid of competition .
A close , hard - fought game is a fun one .
When the 49ers beat the Broncos in the closing seconds , I cheer .
But that does n't mean that I hate the Broncos or their fans .
I do n't have any ill - will towards the Broncos at all .
If you watch American football players , they 'll knock each other down with incredible violence ... and then they 'll help each other back up .
There 's no hate there so long as nobody is cheating .
Boxers , fencers , and wrestlers do n't hate their opponents .
Hatred clouds judgment and inhibits peak performance .
There 's a social convention called sportsmanship that is designed to keep competition on the right side of the line .
I realize that the concept of sportsmanship sounds like something out of the 19th century ; perhaps it has no place in the tough , nasty world of online gaming .
But when competition turns to hatred , you have gone too far .
If you are building games that foster tribalism and hatred and cruelty , you are doing evil .
There is no such thing as artificial hatred .
All hate is real .
And we should not be selling it .

Two people have been injured in a car bomb explosion outside a police station in Newtownhamilton , County Armagh .
The explosion happened at about 2325 BST .
Police were told in a call to a Belfast hospital about an hour earlier that a vehicle had been abandoned .
Officers were en route to the station , which is staffed on a part - time basis , when the explosion happened .
The two people 's injuries are not life - threatening .
The bombers had fired shots in the air before driving off .
The two people who were treated in hospital - a woman in her 80s who was blown off her feet by the blast and a man who sustained a minor shrapnel injury - are said to have been left " extremely shaken " .
These are people who are hell - bent on killing police officers in this area
Chief Inspector Sam Cordner
Bomb condemned by politicians Structural damage is believed to have been caused to the police station and other homes and businesses were also damaged .
The car in which the bomb was placed completely disintegrated .
Local people criticised those responsible for leaving the device and the police response which meant that homes were evacuated by the fire service .
Last week , the Army defused a car bomb outside the village 's police station , one of a number of attacks on police and security bases in Northern Ireland recently , including an explosion at Palace Barracks in Holywood .
Presbyterian minister Rev Kerr Graham said local people felt abandoned by the police .
" The fact that dissidents can return to this village in just over a week to plant a second bomb says it all really .
" The question I would have for the police commander is ' where is the border ? ' because there are rumours in this area that the police will not come past Markethill , " he said .
" There 's a fear factor that these people are able to come in and out plant their devices and leave .
The fact that the fire crews last night had to evacuate the area is appalling . "

However , PSNI area commander Chief Inspector Sam Cordner , said officers responding to the bomb warning had to do so with caution .
" This was an attack designed to murder police officers and our response needs to be thought through and measured , " he said .
" These are people who are hell - bent on killing police officers in this area . "
He praised the work of firefighters who moved people from their homes .
" Due to the swift actions of fire service personnel who were on duty in Newtownhamilton at the time loss of life was prevented , " he said .
The bomb is believed to have been in a white Toyota Corolla and detectives have appealed for anyone who saw it being abandoned at the station , or beforehand , to contact them .
' High threat '
The attack came as security sources told the BBC the threat posed by dissident republicans in Northern Ireland was higher than at any time since the Omagh bomb almost 12 years ago .
The explosion was reportedly heard up to 10 miles from the scene .
The remains of the car used in the attack Northern Ireland 's first and deputy first ministers have issued a statement condemning the attack .
Peter Robinson said it was " cowardly and evil " while Martin McGuinness said those responsible had nothing to offer " but hardship , division and pain " .
Justice Minister David Ford said the bomb was " not just an attack on the people of Newtownhamilton , but on the wider political process and it will be condemned across the community " .
" Those who planted this bomb want to drag Northern Ireland back to the dark days of murder and mayhem , they want to undermine the political process , they want politics to fail , " he said .
Meanwhile , a pipe bomb has exploded behind a house in Chestnut Hill in the Brackaville area of Coalisland , County Tyrone at about 2330 BST on Thursday night .
A man and a woman , who were in the house at the time , were uninjured but a number of windows were damaged .

2009 was a great year for zombie fans , with releases like Pontypool , Dead Snow and Zombieland at the movies , Left 4 Dead 2 in games and lots of other great stuff .
2010 has the potential to be even better .
To get you up to speed on the year to come , I ’ve compiled a list of ten of the most exciting zombie projects I expect to see in the coming year .
Note that I only included things that I think have a solid chance of being released in 2010 , so things like Zombieland 2 or The 4th Reich have n’t been included , as cool as they might be .
Without further ado , I present my top ten picks for cool zombie shit coming in 2010 .
Make sure ot vote in the poll or leave me a comment with your thoughts !
10 ) Atom the Amazing Zombie Killer –
The first of my ten top prospects for the year has a bit of a special connection , since it was made right here in my hometownÂ and I have covered events related to it for the newspaper I work for ( Westword , in case you are interested ) .
Â
It ’s about a guy named Atom who realizes zombies are everywhere who takes it upon himself to stop them and has been described to me as “ Night of the Living Dead meets The Big Lebowski . ”
It looks to be ridiculous and goofy in that oh - so - special Troma way and while I generally find Troma - style films painful to experience , I do have a few favorites .
This looks like it could be one of those .
In any case I ca n’t wait to see it , regardless of the eventual outcome .
You can follow the movie ’s development on the filmmaker ’s MySpace page .
9 ) Exquisite Corpse –
It ’s a classic story : Boy meets girl , boy gets girl , girl dies , boy goes apeshit crazy and kills other girls in order to make the serum that brings her back for one more day … even though she comes back a little more fucked up every time .
This intriguing looking film looks like it may lean a little too heavily on the arty side , but I have high hopes nonetheless .
Love , obsession , brutal murder , mad science , zombies … what else can you ask for ?
No word on a release date , format or anything else , but it is complete and seeking a buyer .
Prognosis for it coming out this year is good , I ’d say .
Check the studio website or Facebook fan page for more info .
8 ) Eaters –
It may be a stretch to project this Italian “ extreme horror ” movie as a 2010 release , since Shock Till You Drop reports it is n’t set to begin filming until June , but this is a low budget Italian gore film — it ’ll probably be shot in a month and released a month later .
I can hope anyway .
This one is a post - apocalyptic story about another mad scientist looking for a cure for zombiism and the two zombie hunters who aid him .
There ’s a twist , too — let ’s just say you should never trust a mad scientist specializing in zombies ( did n’t Romero ’s Day of the Dead teach us that ? ) .
The presence of Uwe Boll ’s name in the opening credits gives me pause , but this looks to be just the right amount of cheesy ridiculousness .
Check out the studio website for more info and this Dread Central item for a much more detailed ( and frankly , slightly spoilery ) synopsis .
7 ) Zombie Culture : Documentary of the Living Dead – This Camelot DarKnight project is listed as 2010 on the website , but it says Development next to it .
Word is it was part of Camelot ’s EFM lineup , though .
What do I know – maybe they were shopping a concept , not a finished product .
Anyway , the world needs a good , comprehensive zombie doc , and this promises to be “ the most comprehensive documentary ever made on the worldwide longevity of zombie films . ”
It also promises a chronological format and an “ exhaustive feel . ”
Will it live up to its promise ?
There ’s no telling .
In any case , god knows no one has offered me a bunch of money to make one .
Until they do , let ’s hope this one fills the bill .
6 ) The Dead – Howard Ford ’s zombie apocalypse / road movie set in Africa has slowly wormed its way into my heart and mind .
Something about it evokes the classic Lucio Fulci Zombie vibe and that ’s a - okay with me .
The brutal stills that have been released and this interview with Ford helped solidify my interest .
I still wish they had called it something besides The Dead , but whatever .
I ’m sold at this point .
Let ’s hope it gets a theatrical release , even if it ’s a very limited one .
You can get some more info and some nice stills at the movie ’s official website .
5 ) Collapse – I ’ve covered Collapse a couple of times in the past ( see here and here ) and it looks promising .
It ’s the story of a rural farmer who has to fortify his house and protect his family from the zombie apocalypse .
It features a zombie head in a bag .
There ’s also a ridiculous baseball bat / saw blade weapon .
There ’s no trailer or anything out yet , as far as I know , but the film ’s Facebook page says they are in the editing stage .
Let ’s hope they wrap it up so we can see how it all came out .
4 ) A domestic release for REC 2 – Hello , Sony , we need to talk .
Seriously .
Are you trying to convince me to buy a region - free DVD player ( which , by the way , means I no longer have to put up with any of your region - specific shenanigans ) ?
Come on , goddamn it .
The U.S. deserves a chance to see this movie !
I ’m not asking for a theatrical release ( although that would be awesome ) but for fuck ’s sake , how about a bare - bones DVD release , or a Netflix streaming release or other VOD option .
Anything ?
Please ?
I have no indication that this is ever going to happen , but I dearly hope it does .
REC was awesome and at least some of the reports I have heard say REC 2 is even awesomer .
3 ) George A. Romero ’s Survival of the Dead - I know that the lucky few who have seen this flick have returned mixed reviews .
Whatever .
I do n’t care .
For one thing , I liked Diary of the Dead a lot more than most people did , and this is a direct sequel .
For another , it ’s George freaking Romero — if you ca n’t go into one of his flicks with an open mind , you are n’t much of a zombie fan .
The story of an island where some nutty types are trying to keep their zombie loved ones safe sounds like a suitably new wrinkle on the story — I ca n’t wait until April 30 so I can see for myself .
You can get updates at Romero ’s MySpace page or follow his Twitter feed .
2 ) Dead Rising 2 – The original Dead Rising ( review here ) is one of my favorite games of all time .
I have equally high hopes for the sequel , and actually wrote a while back about what I think would make it the greatest game of all time .
Sure , I am not totally enamored of the weird multiplayer , the outrageous storyline or the goofy crafting system that has you fashioning “ paddlesaws ” and killer wheelchair contraptions .
On the other hand , if you would have told me the first one featured a chance to put traffic cones on zombies ’ heads , I would n’t have been too excited about that , yet it ended up being quite amusing .
Regardless of any concerns , the chance to run rampant in a zombieified Las Vegas is just too awesome to pass up .
1 ) The Walking Dead on TV – Is this any kind of surprise ?
I adore Robert Kirkman ’s ongoing tale of survival in the wake of a zombie apocalypse .
And I have utmost respect for the caliber of serial drama that AMC has been able to produce .
I even more or less like Frank Darabont .
Add all that up and you have me jumping up and down with glee at the prospect of this show .
It starts shooting in May , so there ’s every reason to believe we ’ll have it on the air this fall .
If it lives up to its potential , we are simply talking about the greatest TV show of ALL TIME .
So those are mine .
What about you ?

I was chatting with some colleagues today who complained that their iPhones never seemed to learn new words properly and permanently , no matter how often they typed them .
In the case of the Ars staff , I wo n't lie — those words are typically naughty ones that even our own readers angrily write us en masse about .
Common dogma says you can train your phone to " remember " words if you type them repeatedly , but the staff has discovered ( much to their dismay ) that this tends to last for only a short period of time before it forgets them again .
Upon hearing this , I decided to do a little investigation , and what I found rather surprised me ; the way my 2.2 iPhone updated its user word database was n't what I expected .
Ars Creative Director Aurich Lawson helped suggest test - phrases for this exercise .
That database is stored in the " mobile " user directory , in / private / var / mobile / Library / Keyboard .
The file is called dynamic - text.dat .
It consists of a ( mostly ) plain text list of words that the iPhone has marked for special attention .
Once a word appears in that list , the autocorrect feature updates itself and accepts those items as proper spellings .
It 's really convenient for jargon words and last names that are part of your normal typing but do n't appear in the standard dictionary .
In order to test the data update , I fired up the Notes application and started typing words in an attempt to see how many repetitions it would take until the dictionary " learned " them .
About an infinite number , it would appear .
I say this because , after typing and typing and typing , the last modified date for my dynamic - text . dat file remained yesterday .
-rw------- 1 mobile mobile 1244 Jan 15 18:40 dynamic - text.da
It was n't until I left Notes and hopped over to Mobile Safari that I was able to make any difference at all .
In Mobile Safari , I opened a new browser , typed the same words into the Google search field and , in the words of Steve Jobs , boom .
Just as one would hope , the dynamic - text . dat file immediately updated without any further repetition needed .
I could also see the words by looking through the file .
-rw------- 1 mobile mobile 1359 Jan 16 11:51 dynamic -text.da
To test my update , I then returned to Notes and tried typing my words again .
This time , Notes immediately recognized my new additions as correct , without offering a special suggestion bubble .
What did I uncover here today ?
Well , clearly , not every iPhone application can " learn " words .
Notes seems to be brain - dead in that regard .
At the same time , using Safari's Google text entry field worked every time , expanding the database and adding new items to my keyboard dictionary .
This is n't the way you 'd expect the iPhone to work .
You 'd imagine that the keyboard learning algorithm would apply to all text no matter where you enter it , but apparently not .
Hopefully this little trick will help you out when you want to add words that you do n't want autocorrected .

Customer relations at the TTC took a turn for the worst Wednesday after a bus driver was arrested for assaulting a passenger .
An 18 - year - old man was shoved during a fare dispute , breaking a window on a Lawrence Ave. W. bus near Bayview Ave. , police said .
Police say the confrontation began around 10:45 a.m. , when the teen failed to present a student card with his fare .
The driver put the bus out of service , leaving only the teen and a friend on board .
The alleged victim , Ricardo Jardim , told CTV
News the driver had told the other passengers to get off the bus and then challenged Jardim to hit him .
“ Before I knew it , his hands were wrapped around my neck and my head smashed on to the glass , ” he said .
The assault charge is the latest setback for the TTC , which has been trying to climb out of months of bad publicity that began last year with a fare hike , followed by service interruptions , token hoarding and charges from management of a culture of worker complacency .
Rider anger reached a fever pitch when a photo of a fare collector dozing in his ticket booth went viral .
The union responded earlier this month by announcing a series of town hall meetings to discuss customer service .
The next “ Let ’s Talk ” session between TTC riders and workers is scheduled for 1 p.m. Sunday at Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute .
TTC spokesman Brad Ross said Wednesday ’s altercation was caught on the bus video and will be sent to police .
“ We have protocols in place when there is a fare dispute between a customer and an operator , ” said Ross .
He said records show one to two assaults on employees every day .
“ Even when that happens our employees are discouraged and not permitted to retaliate . ”
Jardim ’s injuries are described as not serious .
“ These are very serious allegations that have been levelled , ” said Ross .
“ Our operators are hardworking and do care about customer service — despite news in the last several months . ”
Typically , TTC workers are the ones facing harassment and abuse from the public , according to the union .
In fact , that was one of the reasons the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113 organized the town hall meetings .
“ We want a better relationship with our customers because frankly , it ’s hell out there right now , ” president Bob Kinnear said last month .

The independently minded political animal always wrestles with times of transition , and the changeover from the Bush to Obama regimes has been worse than most .
During the Dubya years it was easy to identify the enemy and to hate him with a blinding passion .
Sweet Jesus , George II and his sidekick , The Dick Cheney , played their roles with less nuance than the bad guy in Rambo 12 : Return of Ming the Merciless ( directed by Roland Emmerich ) , making it easy to identify with the loyal opposition just on principle .
But it ’s important to remember that the enemy of my enemy is n’t necessarily my friend .
They might just be fighting over which one gets to eat my tender bits .
Bush has been gone awhile now , and it ’s become disturbingly evident that this Barack fella ai n’t much to look at with the lights on , either .
Widespread indignation over the Busheviks fueled a prObama fervor that was frankly a lot more about Bush and anything remotely connected to him ( like his hugbuddy John McCain ) than it was about a cold - eyed appraisal of the man we were voting for , and we now find ourselves crawling inch - by - inch through a minefield strewn with cognitive dissonance .
“ That sold - out corporatist son of a bitch , ” we begin .
Pause .
Shuffle .
Mumble under breath , “ … that I voted for . ”
Mon semblable , mon frere – I feel your pain .
For reasons I ’ve never fully understood , my natural tendency is to oppose whomever is in power at the moment , and the process of shifting my spite every few years from one party to another is never pleasant , because it ’s in those moments that it ’s most clear how doomed I really am .
And if these transitional moments , where that small measure of hope gives way to despair , are so difficult for people who think as deeply about politics as I do , imagine the insensate bafflement that must torment the mass of the citizenry , which has always been encouraged to approach the machinations of political life with nothing but raw emotion .
Tea parties .
Coffee parties .
People who devoted eight years of unquestioning support to the thugs who gave us the Patriot Act and FISA and conspired with AT&T on patently unconstitutional wiretapping all of a sudden dressing up like Revolutionary War battle reenactment asshats ( I guess those would be “ asstricorns ” ) and raging against governmental oppression .
Crowds that had nothing to say as the kleptocracy looted the economy for the better part of a decade now foaming at the mouth over the current administration ’s mishandling of the economic crisis , as if they played no role whatsoever in helping create it .
Flying airplanes into IRS offices .
Carrying assault rifles to political rallies .
A hallucinatory longing for the utopian kumbayah of “ bipartisanship . ”
( Is “ kumbaypartisanship ” a word ?
If not , it ought to be . )
Well , raw emotion and a healthy dose of ignorance , is more like it .
But you take my point .
This is not the golden age of reason that Jefferson might perhaps have dreamed of as he pondered what this brave experiment in self - governance for rich white men might look like .
We can look at people who say things like “ Republicrat ” and “ they ’re all the same ” and feel some sympathy , especially when we read a righteous screed like my colleague Lex ’s flamethrower on the morally corrupt Sen. Kyl ( R - Health Insurance Industry ) .
The truth is that neither party has done a very good job of serving the interests of those who elected them , instead focusing their efforts on the interests of those who paid for their campaigns , and that ought to enrage us .
The problem is that these kinds of statements can reflect a dangerous false equivalence , because they ’re not all alike .
Not precisely .
A bank robber and a mass murderer are both criminals .
Neither should be wandering the streets .
Still , it ’s difficult to argue that their crimes are more or less the same just because both met a minimum standard of “ broke the law . ”
I jaywalk all the time but I ’m not Charles Manson .
Nonetheless , I spent eight years drilling the hell out of the Bushies .
And you have n’t heard me waxing eloquent about the glories of the Obamites , either , have you ?
( Or should I refer to this as the Emmanuel White House , much as I used to talk about the Rove administration ? )
Both groups have done an appalling job and when all is said and done both will have left the nation worse than they found it , and far worse off than it needed to be .
So , I hate them all – how am I not in the “ they ’re all alike ” camp ?
This was the question put to me the other night by a drinking acquaintance as we enjoyed a nice bourbon stout down the street at my favorite steak house / brew pub .
He ’s a proud member of the radical hang - ’em - all party and was having a hard time understanding how I was n’t just like him .
So here ’s how I explained it .
Imagine that Washington is the OK Corral .
There ’s a gunfight going on and I ’m in the middle of it .
The progressive Democrats are right there with me .
They share many ( if not all ) of my views on what we ’re fighting about and I can trust them .
Sadly , they ’re not the most effective of allies .
There are a few tough nuts in the bunch , but most are useless in a fight .
Either they ’re weak - willed , or they ’re bad shots , or they ’re fervently in favor of running up a white flag so they can negotiate away what little position they have .
Right now , they ’re behind me all the way .
Operative words : behind me .
Over to the right there are the Blue Dogs and some other assorted moderate Democrats ( to the extent that anybody to the right of Nixon can be called a moderate , anyway ) .
Now , they came up here to the corral with me .
They fought with me in that bar fight the other night .
They say they have my back .
But they ’re actually related to the people we ’re fighting against on their momma ’s side .
They shoot , but they never seem to hit any bad guys .
And , often enough that I ’m starting to suspect that they ’re doing it on purpose , they ’ll “ miss ” really badly and nearly hit me .
I have to be honest – I ’m not sure I quite trust them .
Then , on the other side of the corral you have the Republicans .
And those motherfuckers are trying to kill me .
And you .
And our families .
And our friends .
And anything they do n’t kill , they want to loot , rape and / or sell into slavery .
Me ?
I do n’t exactly know what it would mean to “ win ” the fight .
Mainly I just hope I get out of here alive .
That ’s how I see the gunfight at the DC Corral .
The liberals are useless , but at least their hearts are in the right place .
The Blue Dogs are n’t shooting at me at the moment , but I ’m keeping an eye on them .
The GOP , though , they ’re slinging so much ammo my direction that I ’m afraid I might catch lead poisoning just from breathing the air .
See the distinction ?
So yes , Obama is a problem .
Rahm is a problem .
Harry Reid is about as helpful as a kickstand on a garbage scow .
But enough with the false equivalence , okay ?
There are varying degrees of suck , and where the American political system is concerned , there ’s probably still some value in distinguishing between “ bad ” and “ worst . ”
For an idealist like me , anyway .

Beyond the Sun Tea Party of Nevada 's Constitution , bylaws and officers
Sun Coverage Sun politics coverage
It was a week of emotional highs and lows for Nevada Democrats .
They were briefly jubilant last week when Jon Scott Ashjian filed for the U.S. Senate on the Tea Party of Nevada ticket .
It seemed as if Sen. Harry Reid , whose razor - thin victories and wily ways drive Republican partisans bonkers , might again escape defeat in 2010 .
Perhaps Ashjian would peel enough votes from Republicans — who might vote for the Tea Party candidate because they love the movement — to deliver Reid to safety .
Democrats ’ disappointment was surely crushing then , when the Sun revealed Ashjian owes $ 200,000 to the Internal Revenue Service and could lose his license as a contractor after he allegedly bounced a check and never made good on it .
For Reid partisans , it must have been like a car slowing down to help a passing motorist in need , only to speed away .
Still , perhaps there are innocent explanations for Ashjian ’s foibles , and he ’ll be able to mount a serious campaign .
Or , maybe he ’ll launch an attack on the IRS — in these times , it might be an effective defense and political device .
Even if his campaign falls flat , he could still help Reid , which is probably why Republicans are filled with paranoid fantasies that Ashjian is a marionette , with the Senate majority leader pulling the strings .
Michael McDonald , an expert on voter behavior at George Mason University and the Brookings Institution , said it ’s impossible to know what effect Ashjian will have until we know more about him , but said he could definitely affect the race .
“ There could be a substantial number of people who are disgusted with the two candidates , Washington in general , anything that sniffs of being establishment , ” he said .
“ I would n’t be surprised to see him take 10 percent ” of the vote , McDonald said .
The nightmare for Republicans is what has become known among political junkies simply as “ NY - 23 . ”
This refers to a special election in a conservative upstate New York congressional district last year in which Republican Dierdre Scozzafava dropped out of the race when it was apparent she would lose , in large part because Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman was drawing votes from her .
Democrat Bill Owens wound up winning .
Democrats suffered a similar fate in 2000 when Ralph Nader ran to then - Vice President Al Gore ’s left and may have tipped the 2000 election in George W. Bush ’s favor .
McDonald and Cook Political Report analyst Jennifer Duffy said conjuring such a scenario in Nevada could be wishful thinking by Democrats , however .
In the end , “ voters do n’t want to waste their vote , ” Duffy said , noting that vote totals for minor - party candidates are nearly always smaller than public opinion polls would indicate before Election Day .
There ’s a perception among conservatives , Duffy added , that Ashjian is obstructing the Great Reid Hunt of 2010 and should be shoved aside .
But McDonald said if Ashjian can make a good showing , it could hurt the Republican nominee in subtler ways .
The Republican nominee would have to run to the right to protect his base , which could scare off centrist voters .
Indeed , this is the real danger of the Tea Party movement for Republicans , said David Frum , a conservative intellectual and former speechwriter for Bush .
“ These activist groups , though genuinely important , are small relative to the electorate — and can push a party in directions that make success more difficult , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
“ And inside the GOP , they can impede intelligent policy formation by crystallizing around conservative slogans that do n’t meet the reality test . ”
In any case Ashjian just showed once again that Nevada politics are never boring .
Ben Goldacre , The Guardian , Saturday 24 April 2010
What can science and evidence bring to an election ?
First there are the micro-issues : we can assess the validity of claims made by politicians by seeking out the evidence .
David Cameron , for example , claimed that UK cancer services were bad because fewer people die of cancer in Bulgaria than in the UK , which many have already debunked : he used death data from a country with inferior monitoring standards , and a far lower life expectancy , but more than that , he used death data , which is driven not just by treatment success , but also by the number of new cases to start with , which can vary widely for all kinds of reasons .
Still on cancer , but in a neglected example , Cameron also said : “ I have a man in my constituency [ with ] kidney cancer who came to see me with seven others .
Tragically , two of them have died because they could n’t get the drug Sutent that they wanted . ”
This was odd , because Sutent is actually available on the NHS for kidney cancer , having been approved by NICE in February 2009 ( despite costing £ 54,366 per “ quality adjusted life year ” , while NICE generally draws the line at £ 30,000 ) .
Where did Cameron get the idea it was rejected ?
I do n’t know .
On the 9th of April the Daily Mail published a bizarre article claiming that 15 cancer drugs ( including Sutent ) had been rejected by NICE .
They provided a list .
Bizarrely , 10 of the 15 drugs on that list which the Mail say NICE rejected have actually been approved by NICE .
The head of NICE wrote to all three parties on the 9th of April explaining that this article was bizarrely wrong .
His letter is posted in full on the NICE website .
( NICE did reject Sutent for people with a poor prognosis who are unsuitable for immunotherapy , but only there because they were n’t given any evidence on its use in that group ) .
As a side issue , of course , it ’s always unwise to claim that someone would be alive today if they had a specific treatment , in any situation .
The mighty statistician Prof David Spiegelhalter has run through the maths on his Understanding Uncertainty website , and even if you are in the better prognosis group , for whom we do have evidence , you only have a 58 % chance of surviving longer after receiving Sutent , and the median survival is 37 months with the drug and 27 months without it .
Worth it , of course .
I ’m just saying .
Alongside the science of individual claims , it ’s also worth looking at what the parties say about science itself .
Here , only the Liberal Democrats ’ manifesto stands out , promising funding like the others , but also making pledges on the use of independent scientific advice in policy ( in contrast to the David Nutt affair ) , and even coming out in favour of open - access academic publication .
But more than anything , this election offers a new opportunity : beyond expecting our politicians to follow the evidence , we can be evidence based ourselves , in our voting decisions , and hold ourselves to the same high standards .
VoteMatch can match your views against the party manifestoes .
SkepticalVoter knows if your MP believes in the homeopaths ’ magic beans .
Using TheyWorkForYou
I can see that my last MP ( Andrew Smith , Labour , Oxford East ) voted very strongly in favour of the Iraq war , very strongly against an inquiry into it , very strongly in favour of ID cards , and so on .
It ’s grim reading .
PoliticsPosters will print that on a poster , so you can make sure your neighbours know too .
Websites like these recognise that disseminating data in a meaningful form is as important as gathering it in the first place .
Your MPs voting record , and their attendance in parliament , have always been publicly available , but until recently it was an effort to find , so only journalists and lobbyists knew the ugly details .
That has changed .
In the past we relied on hunches and reputation , but now – uniquely – we have the option to leave tribalism behind , and deploy our vote using data .
Enlarge By Alan Poizner for USA TODAY Frank and Erin Lennon , a young couple living in this garage apartment , are working diligently to pay off their debts .
Enlarge Kristen Ammerman , 21 , is a senior at Michigan State University .
In addition to classes she works part - time and knows it will be hard to get a job when she graduates .
They 're called " Generation Y " — teens and twentysomethings known stereotypically for their coddled upbringing , confidence , opinionated dialogue , free - spending habits and openness to change .
Ultimately , however , the more than 50 million members may be best remembered for whether they can overcome the dire financial straits that plague many of them .
Even before the recession , those in Generation Y — the latest products of a get - it - now , pay - for - it - later mind - set that has permeated the nation 's economy — faced a range of financial pitfalls as they embraced expensive high - tech gadgets and added credit card debt onto student loans .
Now , stagnant wages , job insecurity , the decline in employer - sponsored health insurance and retirement benefits , the rapid increase in basic expenses , soaring debt and minimal savings have jeopardized the economic security of the entire generation , according to a recent report by Demos , a public policy research and advocacy think tank .
STUDY : Millennial generation more educated , less employed RECESSION GENERATION ?
Bracing for a simpler lifestyle HEALTH REFORM : 2 million eager to get on parents ' plans
Their generation is the first in a century that is unlikely to end up better off financially than their parents , the Demos report said .
" The recession has hit them hard , " says Jose Garcia , associate director of policy and research at Demos , based in New York .
" It affects their income potential , their saving potential and their career - ladder potential . "
Kristen Ammerman , 21 , a senior at Michigan State University , faces such challenges and sees her Gen Y classmates struggling with financial issues — while seemingly oblivious to the potential consequences .
" I work at a part - time job , have incredible debt and get food stamps , " she says .
" I 'm still short on rent every month .
...
My friends all want the newest and best things .
They spend money on them any chance they get . "
No standard definition for Generation Y exists , but analysts generally classify anyone born from the 1980s to 2000 as members .
Demographers also call them the Millennial Generation .
Their plight seems as much created by members ' pre-recession personal finance habits as by the misfortune of coming of age as the recession took hold in December 2007 : • About 37 % of 18 - to 29 - year - olds have been underemployed or out of work during the recession , the highest share among the age group in more than three decades , according to a Pew Research Center study released in February .
• This generation is the least likely of any to be covered by health insurance .
Just 61 % say they were covered by some form of a health plan , the Pew study said .
• Only 58 % pay monthly bills on time , a National Foundation for Credit Counseling ( NFCC ) 2010 survey said .
• 60 % of workers 20 to 29 years old cashed out their 401 ( k ) retirement plans — typically a big financial no - no because such a move squanders retirement assets and forces the recipient to pay a tax penalty — when they changed or lost jobs , an October study by Hewitt Associates said .
• Nearly 70 % of Gen Y members are not building up a cash cushion , and 43 % are amassing too much credit card debt , says a November MetLife poll .
On average , Gen Yers each have more than three credit cards , and 20 % carry a balance of more than $ 10,000 , according to Fidelity Investments .
• Millennials are graduating from college with an average of $ 23,200 in student debt , according to the most recent data from the Project on Student Debt .
That is a 24 % increase from 2004 .
" They have high , unrealistic expectations , " says Lee Jenkins , author of Lee Jenkins on Money and a managing partner of Atlanta Capital Group in Atlanta .
" And many of them do n't manage money very well . "
' A pretty optimistic outlook '
Even so , not all Gen Y members have learned from the harsh realities they face .
This year , 25 % of Gen Y members say they are spending more than last year , compared with 18 % of all adults , according to the NFCC survey .
" They are throwing caution to the wind and have a pretty optimistic outlook , " says Gail Cunningham , vice president of NFCC .
Unemployment among Gen Y members is " badly setting back their careers , " says Paul Taylor , executive vice president of the Pew Research Center .
" Yet , despite the problems they face , they tend to be upbeat — which is typical of young adults . "
That does n't necessarily mean that Millennials are confident in their ability to manage their finances in a way that allows them to emerge from their predicament .
" Many of them are willing to buy now and pay later , " says Ashley Adami , a financial planner for ClearPoint Credit Counseling Solutions in Seattle .
She not only has Gen Y clients , she is a Gen Y member .
A common trait within members of the generation is a belief that they have the skills and ability to make money and afford large purchases , even when it does n't appear that they do .
Frank Lennon , 27 , an analyst in the hospitality industry in Nashville , acknowledges that during his college years and after graduation , he spent more money than he made .
" I was greedy , " he says .
" I made a lot of poor financial decisions without thinking of the big picture .
I should have known better . "
Lennon 's wife , Erin , 26 , is still in college and has $ 28,000 in student loans .
It was only when they were married in October that they became aware of their total credit card and college loan debts .
" The real shock was on our wedding day , when we realized that we were $ 104,000 in debt , " Frank says .
" Because we had gotten some cash gifts , we used it to make a credit card payment on our wedding night . "
Turning around the turmoil
The keys to turning around financial turmoil traditionally have been employment and earnings .
But Millennials have become known for switching jobs constantly , says Brad Kimler , executive vice president of Fidelity 's Consulting Services business .
And unfortunately , when they have left jobs , they often have cashed out their retirement plans , saying they needed the money , he says .
Ammerman , who works part time at Home Depot , has job - hopped since she started working in high school .
" I switch around because I get bored or need to make more money , " she says .
She says she does not participate in Home Depot 's 401 ( k ) plan because she has too many bills to pay .
The recession and its fewer job opportunities have grounded some Millennials .
Stefanie Potts , 24 , an assistant director at the University of Southern California 's Office of Admission , says many in her generation initially thought it was desirable to move around , take job risks and get experience .
" The advice has completely changed , " she says .
" Most of us are happy to have a job . "
But many who are just graduating from college are having trouble starting out with an entry - level job in their field .
Some can find only unpaid internships .
And because entry - level jobs generally offer low pay , graduates who are overwhelmed with debt may have to seek better - paying , non-professional jobs .
" I was helped by my parents , " says Mark McShane , 27 , who works for a financial services company in Boston .
" Even when I graduated , they gave me a small stipend to help me with those first 15 months out of school .
But without that , I 'm not sure I would have been able to accept my initial job , which leads to the next step in my career . "
Even before the recession , nearly half of college students dropped out before earning a degree , the Demos report said .
Now , people from low - and moderate - income families are much less likely to enroll at all .
' A dose of reality '
The unemployment rate for Gen Y remains much higher than the national rate .
In March , the national rate was 9.7 % , compared with 18.8 % for workers younger than 25 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
" The economy has given them a dose of reality , " Jenkins says .
More than half of Generation Y , 60 % , say they are concerned about paying their bills , according to a recent poll by Harvard 's Institute of Politics .
" When you get a little bit of money , what do you do with it ? " asks Mikala Shremshock , 27 , who works for Veeco Instruments near Philadelphia .
" Do you pay off your credit cards , put it toward student loans , make an extra payment on your house or car , or put it in your IRA ?
I do n't have enough to really make a big dent in anything .
If you get a bonus , why not just spend it ? "
Faced with financial setbacks , Millennials are starting to be more realistic .
More than half of them , 55 % , say they are watching their spending very closely now , up from 43 % in 2006 , according to the Pew Research Center .
It 's unclear whether the more - conservative approach to personal finance is only temporary , Fidelity 's Kimler says .
Frank and Erin Lennon say they are living frugally now .
They rarely eat out .
Frank temporarily has stopped making contributions to his 401 ( k ) plan so they can focus on paying down debt .
" I think the reason why we 're being so frugal now is because we 've seen the rainy days , and we 've had friends that have gone through some really hard times , " he says .
The couple have a dry - erase " Bill Board " on their refrigerator , where they keep track of their debt .
" This allows us to remain on the same page and resist unnecessary spending , " Frank says .
Unlike their parents , who had the G.I. Bill and pension plans , those in Generation Y have few safety nets .
Ammerman is not worried about her future , even though she will graduate with a journalism degree at a time when newspapers are closing and jobs are hard to get .
Rather than trying the newspaper route , she is thinking of trying to use her skills to write about video games , a field she says is male - dominated .
" I know what I 'm capable of , and I know where I can go , so I can do the best , " she says .

( Newser ) – Apparently , only skinny girls can show cleavage on network TV .
Or at least , that 's the double standard Lane Bryant saw , after ABC and Fox got squeamish about its new lingerie ad , Adweek reports .
ABC refused to air the ad during Dancing With the Stars , while Fox “ demanded excessive re-edits , ” the company complained in a scathing blog post .
“ The networks exclaimed , ' She has ... cleavage ! Gasp ! ' ”
Meanwhile , Victoria 's Secrets ' ads have no trouble getting airtime , and their models leave just as little to the imagination .
“ Does this smack of a double standard ?
Yep .
It does to us too .
… ABC and Fox have made the decision to define beauty for you . ”
The company has since pulled the ad off YouTube , but Jezebel attests that it was “ not in the least bit racy or offensive .
Unless , of course , you 're offended ” by models with actual meat on their bones .

Epiphany - extensions has new additions including html5tube which replaces YouTube Flash with HTML5 and does not require you to have Flash installed .
The tab - key - tab - navigate plugin allows you to use Ctrl + Tab to change tabs .
The sidebar extension has been removed .
3.8 . Connect Remotely Vinagre , a remote desktop client for the GNOME Desktop , has added support for SSH tunnelling allowing you to access a remote machine more securely through an SSH tunnel .
You will need an SSH account on the remote client and then you can type in passwords and other information knowing you are connected securely .
Connecting to clients using a low bandwidth connection has been made easier by allowing you to choose a lower depth of colour to save bandwidth and by enabling JPEG compression .
These options are available in the connection dialogue in Vinagre .
A new listener mode has been added allowing the remote desktop you are going to view and control to connect to you .
This is helpful when the remote connection is behind a firewall or router and is unreachable through the normal connection process .
By enabling listener mode in Vinagre and giving your IP address to the user you are trying to connect to , the remote client can connect to you .

5 . What 's New for Developers
The following changes are important for developers using the GNOME 2.30 developer platform .
If you 're not interested in changes for developers , you can skip forward to Section 6 ― Internationalisation .
As well as the GNOME Desktop , GNOME 2.30 is the latest release of the GNOME Developer Platform , a set of API - and ABI - stable libraries available under the GNU LGPL which can be used for the development of cross-platform applications .
Fixing Usage of Deprecated Libraries Starting with GNOME 3.0 , various deprecated parts of GNOME will be removed .
These deprecated components include libraries such as libart_lgpl , libbonobo , libbonoboui , libglade , libgnome , libgnomecanvas , libgnomeprint , libgnomeprintui , libgnomeui , and libgnomevfs .
For applications that ship as part of the GNOME Desktop , a number of cleanup tasks have been carried out to ensure no deprecated code is used .
This will ensure a smooth transition to GNOME 3.0 .
Developers are strongly urged to follow this example in their own applications too .
Furthermore , for any developers ( or potential developers ) who wish to help us out , the GNOME goals wiki page lists the various tasks that are yet to be completed .
An automatically created and updated status overview of remaining work for modules that are supported by the jhbuild build tool can be found here .

Chomsky Warns of Rise of the Far Right in the U.S .
The right feeds on frustration and so ultra- conservatives advance such as the Tea Party .
Latinos and blacks are persecuted , like fascist Germany did to the Jews , suggests the intellectual .
Chomsky Warns of Rise of the Far Right in the U.S .
By David Brooks , for La Jornada
Disenchantment with the government and politicians has grown to unprecedented levels in recent times according to research .
There is growing anger , uncertainty , pessimism and distrust in Washington , and the fruit of popular frustration is being harvested by rightists .
" Never seen anything like this in my life , " said Noam Chomsky .
Interviewed by Chris Hedges for the website Truthdig .
He added that the mood of the country is terrifying .
The level of anger , frustration and hatred of institutions is not organized in a constructive manner .
Is diverted into self - destructive fantasies in reference to expressions of the populist ultra-right .
Anti-government sentiment has increased in society and only 22 % trust the government , according to research by the Pew Research Center , one of the lowest points in half a century .
For almost any conceivable measure , today 's Americans are less positive and more critical of their government .
There 's a perfect storm of conditions associated with mistrust of the government : an abysmal economy , an epic pessimistic and public discontent with Congress and elected officials , said Andrew Kohut , president of the Pew Research Center , in summarizing the findings of a series of surveys .
The Pew report noted that only 25 % have a favorable opinion of Congress - the lowest point in 50 years - and 65 % expressed a negative opinion .
Increasingly , Americans felt that the government has misplaced its priorities and that it has a negative impact on their daily lives .
About 62 % say the government 's policies only benefit some groups and 56 % believe that the government is not doing enough to help the average American .
In addition , it confirms the increase of anti government sentiment among a segment of society , doubling are those who say they are upset with the federal government : 10 % in 2000 to 21 % today .
And 30 % perceive that government is a threat to their personal freedom .
Pew also reported , in a setback compared to a survey of months ago , that most are suspicious of a greater state role in the economy , with the exception of the financial sector , where a large majority want the government to strictly regulate financial companies .
Perhaps the sector most unhappy with the government is called the Tea Party movement , ultra - conservatives who came a year ago in protest against the economic stimulus bill , which grew in visibility in the campaign against health reforms proposed by the government of Barack Obama .
This movement is mostly composed of white men , aged 45 or so , who describe themselves as upset or angry with Washington .
They are considered as the most dynamic part of the conservative movement , with the purpose not only to stop Obama 's proposals , but also to attack Republican politicians who are considered " not very " conservative .
Recent research from the New York Times / CBS
News poll revealed that 18 % of Americans identify themselves as supporters of the Tea Party , classify themselves " very conservative " and are very pessimistic about the direction of the country and severely critical of Washington and , of course , Obama .
Over 90 % of them believe that the country moves to a wrong path and the same percentage disapproves of the president and his administration policy .
Already 92 % of respondents estimated that Obama leads the country " toward socialism " ( an opinion shared by more than half the population in general ) .
Moreover , the expressions of popular right - wing anger are registered when referencing more hate crimes , a rise of radical right - wing groups , as well as unofficial reports of a growing number of death threats against the president .
Public safety agencies have raised the alert status for what is called " domestic terrorism . "
Incidents were reported , several under investigation , of acts of intimidation against congressmen and other elected officials .
Earlier this month , more than 30 governors received letters from an anti-government , ultra - conservative group who demanded their resignation in a period of three days ( although there was no threat of violence ) , which meant that federal authorities have warned local police that the letters could lead to violent behavior .
As such , there are more examples throughout the country .
The wave of disillusionment with the government and its rulers causes concern among some politicians who do not know what impact this might have on the elections of next November .
But for others the issue is more alarming .
" It 's very similar to Weimar Germany , the parallels are striking . "
Here , too , there is a tremendous disappointment with the parliamentary system , pointed Chomsky interviewing on Truthdig .
" The United States is very lucky that no honest and charismatic figure has appeared , and if this were to happen this country would be in real trouble for the frustration , disillusionment and the justified anger combined with the absence of a coherent response , " he concludes .
In Germany , he recalls , an enemy was created to explain the crisis which was the Jew .
" Here they are the illegal immigrants and blacks .
We will say that white men are a persecuted minority .
We will say that we must uphold and defend the honor of the nation .
Military force will be exalted .
There will be blows .
This could be converted into an undeniable force .
And if it takes place , it will be more dangerous than Nazi Germany .
The United States is a world power ... I do not believe that this is far from happening , " he says .

Introduction
Neural networks are a relatively new technology that aims to reverse engineer the functionality of the brain within a mathematics model .
This may sound daunting and complex but the underlying concepts are very simple and Neural Mesh does the hard work for you .
In a Web environment NNs ( neural networks ) are considered too slow and complex to warrant effort on what might even be a trivial task .
To solve this , Neural Mesh has been heavily optimized .
It uses caching to speed up running and training of networks .
The API and framework has been simplified to implement in PHP projects .
Unlike other Neural Network frameworks , Neural Mesh is written purely in PHP using a MySQL database .
This means it is easy to install on most host providers .
The required versions are PHP 5 or later and MySQL 5 or later with the following extensions installed : SimpleXML , MySQLi and GZip .
The concepts
Because neural networks utilize fuzzy logic , the standard system architecture is slightly different .
With programs and systems we create , we are used to entering some input data , processing that data with conditions and logic and then outputting some data .
Neural networks work much similar except the processing is done behind curtains .
We do not really care how it gets to an output ; we just want to make sure it does .
The magic behind neural networks is its ability to learn .
Because the second tier of the system , the processing layer , is essentially out of our control , we have to return correct results somehow .
This is done by training the network .
The network has to learn from past experience to be able to produce reliable results .
The main types of training are supervised and unsupervised training .
Supervised training is when we know exactly what we want to output from certain inputs and perform the training iterations ourselves , manually .
Unsupervised training is when we automate a training set based on past experience , for example , if the network was to learn how to play chess and it is beaten , we want the network to learn from its mistake and train it with the preferred response or output .
Figure 1
Neural networks take in binary digits and output fits ( fuzzy bits ) which is a number between 0 and 1 but never absolute ( e.g. 0.4323 , 0.9 , 0.1 ) .
For this reason , to make use of the output , we have to round off the fits to form bits ( binary units ) .
A reasonable threshold would be anything greater than 0.8 should be 1 .
Anything lower than 0.2 should be 0 .
Anything in the middle means the network is not smart enough and requires more training .
Looking at Figure 1 above , we see the graphical representation of the sigmoid function , the function used to return a fit .
You will notice that 0 or 1 is never reached in the line , hence why we must do logical rounding .
Figure 2
Figure 2 is a graphical representation of the structure of a neural network .
Parts of a Neural Network
A neural network consists of three or more layers , each with some neurons and a synapse linking from each neuron in a layer to each neuron in the next layer .
A neuron is basically a black box that takes some input and returns an output based on a formula .
A synapse is the connection from neuron to neuron across layers .
They have a weight value ( a number ) which affects the neurons output .
The first layer of the network is the input layer .
This is where data gets entered for which we want results .
The amount of neurons in this layer will depend on the data we are entering and how large the bit string ( string of binary digits ) will be .
This layer is abstract and acts as a virtual layer to pass on data to succeeding layers .
The information from the input layer is spread through to the hidden layer and using weights and mathematical functions it decides a path and outputs a value for each neuron to the next layer ( usually the output layer ) .
Multiple hidden layers are possible but you will rarely need more than one .
The output layer , similar to the input layer , requires an amount of neurons relative to the type of data you want returned .
Designing a Network
Designing the neural network is one of the most important aspects to utilising this great technology .
An important thing to ensure is that you have a way to convert your input data to binary and then the resulting output binary to your needed format .
A popular example to use for explaining neural networks is the XOR logic gate .
This will return 1 when there is an odd amount of 1's in the input .
Here is a truth table for a 2 input XOR logic gate :
00 => 0
01 => 1
10 => 1
11 => 0
So if we wanted a neural network to be able to perform the XOR logic gate , we would need 2 neurons for the input layer , maybe around 3 for the hidden layer ( there is no clear cut way of determining a neuron count for the hidden layer so play around and see which renders the best results ) and 1 for the output layer .
Another good use for a neural network is the AI in a Connect Four game .
We can user a Neural Network to decide based on the status of the board , which column to put a token down .
The rules of Connect Four are simple .
Players take turns in placing tokens down a column of a grid and try to form a line of their tokens either diagonally , horizontally or vertically .
The first player to connect four tokens wins .
First we need a system of recognising tokens .
We will need to display an empty slot , a slot filled by player one and a slot filled by player two .
This means we need two bits .
00 will indicate an empty slot , 01 will indicate a slot filled by player one and 10 will indicate a slot filled by player two .
A Connect Four board is 7 columns wide and 6 rows deep .
So therefore we will need 7 * 6 * 2 neurons ( or 84 ) to represent the status of the board .
We only need 7 output neurons to represent which column to put the token down and we will choose the output neuron closest to 1 .
For now we will have 40 hidden layer neurons because we want some reasonable speeds but can increase if it is not learning .
The rest of the application can be done in another environment , for my example I used Adobe Flash .
I also logged the moves that the player and computer took and what the status of the board was at that time and depending on who won the game , train the network with the winner 's moves .
So the more you play it , the smarter it gets .
You can try it at Neural Mesh project examples page .
Hidden Neurons
As mentioned above , deciding on an amount of hidden neurons is not deterministic .
There are some rules of thumb and heuristics to make the first decision easier , such as having 2/ 3 the amount of hidden neurons than inputs , but these are not perfect .
Remember , the more hidden neurons , the longer it takes to process and train , so it is a very bad idea to choose a large amount for the sake of it .
Training the Network
Our network is well designed , so now we want the network to actually produce correct results .
Therefore , we need to train it .
A training set needs to be made using the data from the truth table .
Training works by taking a pattern or input and then specifying a desired output ( or the output we want the network to return given said pattern ) .
An algorithm will then work out which synapses need modifying to be able to produce this output , then modify it by the learning rate .
This needs to be done many times to enforce these rules upon the network .
How are Neural Networks useful ?
Hopefully , the basics of neural networks are making sense to you , but how does this technology help us ?
We can use neural networks in many ways such as character recognition , game artificial intelligence and stock prediction .
They are useful when the complexity of the data and design is too impractical to implement by hand , when we want decisions to be based on experience or when we want the program to learn from mistakes through trial and error .
Using Neural Mesh
With Neural Mesh installed ( read the documentation for instructions and to download Neural Mesh ) we can go about creating that Connect Four network we designed .
For more details , read the online documentation .
After logging into the Neural Mesh administration interface , create a network with 84 input neurons , 56 hidden layer neurons , 7 output layer neurons and give it a name Connect Four .
The rest of the details can be default for now .
Below are the definitions of the fields .
The learning rate defines how quick the network learns .
There is a trade - off between speed and accuracy when deciding this value .
If it is too large the network will oscillate back and forth , not properly reaching a precise level .
If it is too small the network will take a lot more time to train .
A good medium is 1 .
Target MSE ( Mean Squared Error ) is a target that we want out network to reach .
The MSE is basically an indication of how inaccurate the network is or its error .
The lower this number , the more intelligent it will be .
If this value is reached during supervised training , the training will stop .
Do not make this number too small as we can deal with an error of around 0.02 by rounding the values .
The epoch max number is just a maximum amount of supervised training iterations or you can think of it as a time out .
If training has gone on for this many iterations and the target MSE is yet to be reached , then stop .
Now it gets even more advanced .
Most of these values you will want to leave as default .
The initial bias value should usually always be one .
The momentum rate is when the net reaches a plateau in its learning .
The momentum will continue to carry it in the right direction , overcoming the plateau .
This value is kept normally between 0.1 and 0.75 .
The initial weight range for random weights before the network is trained .
If 5 then it will be randomly generated between - 5 and 5 .
With the network created , select it from the control panel and take note of the Authkey .
This string is essential to work with our network outside of the administration interface , either via the API or framework .
If we are working outside of PHP , the API must be used to connect with the network .
If we are using PHP , we simply include the framework controller .
Using the Web services API
Using the Web services API we can run and train the network in any application by sending simple HTTP POST requests ( which every language should be capable of ) and using XML as the data format .
There are five types of functionality we can utilise via the API : create , run , train , bulk and destroy .
Create - will create an unmanaged network and return the authkey .
Run - simply takes a string of inputs and returns some outputs .
Train - will take a string of inputs ( or pattern ) and its desired outputs .
Bulk - will do the same as train but can take more patterns ( rather than do multiple train requests ) .
Destroy - will remove a network .
For added security , you must use an authorisation key specific to a user associated with a network .
This can be found in the Structure page in the administration interface .
To determine which function is executed , use the listed types as the query string ( e.g. nm-api.php?run ) .
The XML request should be posted with the variable name request .
Using the Framework
If you want to implement Neural Mesh with PHP , simply include the nm-controller .
php script and create an instance of the NeuralMesh class with the authkey to determine which network .
define ( " AUTH_KEY " , " 08b5c0f308f7ba12afcc9e9e0682426 b " ) ;
require ( " neuralmesh/nm-controller.php " ) ;
$ nn = NeuralMesh : : getNetwork ( AUTH_KEY ) ;
This allows us to do the same functionality as with the API but through PHP .
Using Neural Mesh ( continued )
The Connect Four example uses Adobe Flash as the interface , so we will need to utilise the API to connect to the network .
The first request will be running of the network .
The request will look something like this :
< request >
< auth > Authorisation Key </ auth >
< inputs > Input String </ inputs >
</request >
Where the Authorisation Key is the one found in the Neural Mesh administration interface that was noted and the input string is a snapshot of the Connect Four board which will be a very long string of binary digits ( 84 digits remembering we have 84 input neurons ) .
00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 => Empty
01 => Player 1
10 => Computer
Above is an example of a snapshot .
When passed to the network it will look like :
0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 00000000000000000000
This will return an XML response with the outputs of the run network which will look something like the following :
< response >
< outputs >
< output>0.994505</output >
< output >0.001673</output >
< output >0.000907</output >
< output >0.004143</output >
< output >0.012191</output >
< output >0.000961</output >
< output >0.004201</output >
</outputs >
</response >
Based on this result , the first column is the desired column to put a token down because it has the closest value to 1 .
Training the network was done by keeping a log of the snapshot of the board and the column the player put a token down ( both the player and computer ) then depending on who won , trains the network with the data .
Plans for the future
More features will come for Neural Mesh including support for Bayesian Networks and other types of machine learning , the ability to save networks as a file and import , more user management support , greater control with algorithms , tweaks and other settings and crucially more optimization .

In my rabbinic thought class , we have been tackling the interesting issue of divine justice .
In the realm of historical Judeo - Christian thought , how exactly does God go about judging humanity ?
What are the basic criteria God uses ?
Is God , at its core , a loving God , or an angry violent God ?
The answer I was raised with was pretty clear cut : God was both .
On one hand he is loving , and on another he is so utterly exasperated with us , he might , in one angry flash , just hurl the surly lot of us into oblivion .
God , in other words , is like that character Professor Quirell , in the Harry Potter books — a head with two faces , one on either side , and you are never entirely sure which one you are going to get .
Classic Christian dogma says that these two faces of God represent an evolution from an angry God in Hebrew scripture to a kinder , gentler God in Christian scripture .
Just for fun , I decided to Google the phrase “ angry God , loving God , Old Testament , New Testament ” and I found over 100,000 links containing these words .
Randomly clicking on them yielded all sorts of “ reasons ” for this divine evolution .
To paraphrase , they included such ideas as : “ People needed strict rules and a heavy hand in the beginning but did n’t need them later on . ”
To be fair , there were also Christian websites and blogs that argued against this stereotype , and which quoted a variety of passages from the Hebrew Bible in which God is clearly loving , patient and forgiving .
The biblical texts are what they are .
In Hebrew scripture , God does do a lot of smiting and his nostrils do do a lot of flaring .
And , there are many softer , gentler passages to temper this image as well .
What is interesting from a Jewish perspective on this debate though , is this :
How did the early rabbis perceive their God ?
Rabbinic Judaism rose up in the ashes of the fallen Second Temple — the same time as Christianity built its foundational texts .
How did this next stage in Jewish evolution and textual tradition look back on Hebrew scripture ?
It turns out , the rabbis had a pretty clear and unified vision on this .
Their views were quite different from the angry , brimstone God so often attributed to them .
Let ’s take a look at one representative sample :
Bavli Sanhedrin 89 b — a Talmudic text — tells a story of God going to Abraham and pointing out that humanity has sinned against him .
Abraham basically throws us all under the bus , admitting this is true and saying “ Let them be wiped out ! ”
So , God goes to Jacob , who does the same thing , saying “ Let them be wiped out ! ”
Finally , God goes to Isaac , who finally stands up to God and offers a defense .
Isaac says : “ But are not my children also your children ? ! ? ” he says .
“ You called them Israel my son , my firstborn , but now you are saying they are my sons and not your sons ! ? ”
Isaac then does a complicated mathematical deconstruction , arguing — in the best Jewish lawyerly fashion — for just how little we Jews have really sinned .
An average man lives 70 years , but 20 of those you do n’t punish for , so it ’s now 50 years , he says .
Half of those were at night — how could we be sinning when we ’re sleeping ? — so it goes down to 25 .
Half of that time was spent praying , eating and attending to “ nature ’s calls ” ( whatever that means ) , so it ’s now down to 12.5 !
So in other words , Isaac says , if you really want to punish us , you can only punish us for 12.5 out of the 70 years .
Oh , and by the way , remember how I almost offered up my own life for you ?
Just wanted to mention that . . .
Does God punish humanity for the 12.5 years ?
The text mysteriously does not say .
But we can presume not , as the topic shifts elsewhere .
What we see in this agaddah , this rabbinic tale , is a depiction of a God who even when egged on and urged to destroy humankind , keeps hunting until he finds someone to defend them .
He seems to readily , and without argument , accept the defendant ’s argument for a significantly reduced punishment , and then , seemingly , does n’t level any punishment at all .
Not exactly an angry , fire - in - the - brimstone God !
This portrayal of God is the standard , not the exception in rabbinic - era literature .
And this leaves us with a striking and important conclusion :
For reasons unbeknownst to us , Jews and early Christians , living in the shadow of the lost Temple , both began to develop a conception of a more compassionate , caring , slow - to - anger God than the texts of their inherited tradition .
The idea that God maybe was n’t so angry after all was not an evolution unique to Christianity .
It was a fundamental idea of rabbinic Judaism too , which modern Jews are an outgrowth of today .
Sean Kenney makes life - size sculptures of endangered animals out of Lego bricks .
Adam Reed Tucker reconstructs famous buildings throughout the world in Lego form .
Beth Weis specializes in Lego as home décor .
Some people grew up building with Legos , and then never stopped .
Lego invaded their minds and now they view the world through a Lego prism .
These people have made Lego into a full - time profession .
So much so that Lego now has an officially recognized category of what they call “ Certified Professionals . ”
There are nine of these Certified Professionals at present .
They are good at making things with Lego .
“ Brick by Brick : the LEGO Brick sculpture of Nathan Sawaya . ” Through April 13 .
Agora Gallery , New York .
Certified Professional Nathan Sawaya got his start at the Legoland theme park in Southern California .
Now , he is taking aim at the art world proper .
His show , “ The Art of the Brick , ” is currently on tour at museums and galleries throughout the country .
I went to see his Lego art at the Agora Gallery in Chelsea , New York .
The show takes on big issues like Despair and Grief .
One sculpture , “ Red , ” shows a male figure from the waist up , emerging from a pile of red Lego bricks into full form .
The figure reaches upward , desperate fingers clutching for the sky .
Another , “ My Boy , ” is a blue Lego man on his knees holding the collapsed form of what is presumably the dead or injured ( Lego ) boy in his arms .
It ’s a Lego tragedy !
The implied formal question in Sawaya ’s sculptures is about the limitations and possibilities of a Lego brick as an artistic material .
Looking at the work of Nathan Sawaya in relation to his professional Lego colleagues one thing becomes obvious .
Sawaya has achieved a qualitative leap .
The other pros , talented as they may be , are essentially doing the same thing that children do with Lego bricks , though at a higher level of proficiency .
Instead of making a one - room house with 50 bricks , they make the Sears Tower with 50,000 .
Sawaya has managed to separate Lego from that kind of literalism .
It ’s sort of analogous to the moment when painting finally freed itself from the limitations of direct representation and got wild with abstraction and other nifty new tricks .
Sawaya ’s work is still representational , for the most part , but it is n’t Lego - like anymore ; his constructions are n’t simply the toy- version of some real - world thing .
The sculptures are , however , extremely stupid .
I do n’t really mean that as an insult .
It ’s just that the sculptures are unsophisticated as works of art .
If you saw a contemporary figurative marble sculpture titled My Boy depicting a man holding a limp young boy in his arms you would likely categorize it as overly sentimental at best .
Yet , Sawaya has solved a formal problem .
A couple of years ago , it did not strike anyone as possible that Lego was a viable material for making sentimental sculptures .
In his artist ’s statement at Agora Gallery , Sawaya writes , “ Currently I am working with the human form , which can represent the everyman and my own metamorphoses , fears and accomplishments .
I aim to captivate people and strive to create artwork that is interesting and that is unlike anything they have seen before . ”
This is the kind of thing that trailblazers of any new artistic medium like to say .
It represents the phase of earnestness and idealism .
This Lego artist wants to reach out to his fellow creatures in a gesture of shared humanity .
Look , he says , I have made this material ( plastic interlocking bricks , in this case ) expressive in ways that we can all understand .
I have made it laugh and cry .
Say what you like , but that ’s a big step for Lego .
I remember being frustrated with Lego bricks as a child .
It was great to be able to build things , but the simplicity of the blocks was a limitation — it was mathematically impossible to make a curve .
Every time I tried to make a house it ended up as a multi-colored bunker .
That rigidity is , paradoxically , what makes Lego work .
Lego bricks manufactured 50 years ago will still fit together with bricks manufactured today .
This simplicity and universality is the essence of Lego ’s genius .
Any dumb toddler can get going with Lego .
The primary colors of the basic Lego set add to the simple essentialism .
It has been possible for many years to buy more complicated pieces and specialty sets .
But the heart of Lego is a yellow rectangle that snaps into a red rectangle .
That satisfying snap as the two blocks become one is the sound of Lego ’s now immortal soul .
It ’s no wonder that this simple product comes to us via a little village in Denmark .
Ole Kirk Christiansen , the inventor of Lego , hailed from Jutland , the area of Western Denmark made famous by the film Babette ’s Feast .
Jutlanders take their living stark and their Lutheranism straight - up .
Ole Kirk Christiansen named the toys Lego as a word trick from the Danish .
Lego is a contraction of the Danish words “ leg ” and “ godt , ” which translate to “ play well . ”
The purity and universality of the Lego brick is hard - wired into the toy ’s DNA , specially designed to please a strict , Protestant God .
The firm hand of Danish Lutheranism thus reaches , unbeknownst to most of us , directly from the rural hinterlands of Northern Europe into the living rooms of millions around the world .
How can something so rigid in its very essence be made to express the variety of organic life ?
We are beginning to find out .
Through an imaginative use of multiple layers and graded tiling , the Lego artists of today have worked their way around the formal constraints of that universal brick .
As kids , we were impatient .
We could never break out of the brutal square geometry that a Lego set imposes .
But the pros were willing to take up the challenge .
They were going to make the Lego bricks curve and bend without altering the essential sanctity of the brick .
Sawaya ’s sculptures practically dance on the grave of yesterday ’s Lego limitations .
There ’s nothing , in principle , in the three - dimensional realm that Lego can not now depict .
Alas , for all of Sawaya ’s innovations , we are still stuck somewhere in the realm of stupid .
His Lego sculpture “ Heartfelt , ” for instance , depicts a man ripping his own chest open to reveal a red Lego heart and a pile of white interlocking bricks spilling out onto the floor .
What we need now is a new crop of Lego artists who can take up Sawaya ’s set of formal techniques and go nuts .
We need someone willing to do something genuinely disgusting or offensive with Lego .
Or perhaps there ’s a Lego Mapplethorpe out there who can explore the beauty of vulgarity one square fist at a time .
Or maybe an Otto Dix who simply thinks poorly of human kind in general and is willing to express the ugliness and violence in the hearts of men via Lego .
We need an infernal Lego landscape , a vast room filled with pestilence and war as only Lego could portray it .
We need a life - sized installation , an entire functioning house constructed entirely with Lego that is then used as a methadone clinic .
We need a Lego whorehouse .
We need a tiny , exquisite object made of Lego bricks cut from diamonds .
We need someone to have Lego surgically implanted into their own body .
We need something wonderful made of Lego , some ocean - going craft that appears on our shores like a messenger from another universe that only Lego understands .
The craft stays for one week and then goes away , disappearing one morning never to be seen again .

Pierre Omidyar experiments in Hawaii with ' new way to do journalism that connects with ordinary citizens '
The founder of eBay – the virtual marketplace that connects sellers and buyers worldwide – is launching an online news site where people will pay to exchange ideas and discuss issues affecting their communities .
Pierre Omidyar , the chairman of eBay Inc , is entering the news business with an online service in Hawaii .
By charging $ 19.99 ( £ 13 ) a month for membership , Omidyar hopes to accomplish what newspapers and other media organisations have long struggled with – having readers pay for content and making local news profitable .
" It 's really critical to help find a new way to do journalism that connects with ordinary citizens in a better way , " Omidyar said in an interview .
" I think that is what 's been lacking .
Because the industry has been preoccupied with its own decline , it has n't had the opportunity to reinvent itself .
" As a new startup , we have the opportunity to reinvent that and bring journalism back into the centre of conversation . "
Civilbeat.com promises to provide in - depth reporting and analysis and be a civic plaza for island residents .
" Reporter - hosts " will post articles , interact with readers , provide frequent updates and host discussions .
" Journalism plays a central role in the way democracy works , especially in this country .
And our democracy does n't work when journalism does n't work , " Omidyar said .
" As I saw the decline in the industry , I really became concerned especially with our local communities not just here in Hawaii , but nationwide . "
Omidyar decided more than two years ago to launch a news service to cover local civic affairs , including the state , city , education , land and money .
" It 's very important for me that we demonstrate that we can do this sustainably , " he said .
Another unique aspect will be the discussion section .
Unlike traditional newspaper online comment sections which are often marred by hateful , obscene , racist or mindless commentary posted by anonymous readers , Civil Beat members will be identified and no anonymous comments will be allowed .
" We 'll have a billing relationship with them and so we know who they are , " Omidyar said .
Gerald Kato , chair at the University of Hawaii school of communications , said newspaper subscribers were coveted because they were considered to be older , wealthier and better educated .
But many had been turned off by what Kato described as " crazies " who participate in unmoderated comment sections .
" They 're trying to flip that around .
They want all these high - end people that would gravitate toward a newspaper , but want to filter out all the crazies , " Kato said .
" The filtering mechanism would be : you pay to play . "
Omidyar said he was hoping to encourage a " higher level of conversation " .
" I think the quality of conversation is going to be something which really creates a sense of value for people , " he said , especially for people who are concerned about issues in their community and want meaningful discussions and debate .
The unassuming Honolulu billionaire declined to say how much he has invested so far .
The editor of the news service is veteran newspaperman John Temple , who served as editor , president and publisher of the Rocky Mountain News , which ceased publication in February 2009 .
Omidyar points out that , unlike a newspaper , he has no printing presses , trucks , sales staff or other " legacy " obligations .
He said having a membership payment provided instant feedback from the readers .
He called traditional news organisations " advertising based " , with publishers answering to advertisers instead of the community .
" I think having a more direct business model will help us and I think it 's going to be part of the future for the industry as well , " he said .
The following is a letter sent to my colleagues urging them to sign on to this legislation .
It seems that every week , we 're hearing about another outrageous example of Private Military Contractors , especially Blackwater , ( or Xe , as they now call themselves ) .
Last week we were shocked to hear about allegations of how Blackwater billed the government for prostitution .
Two weeks ago The Nation highlighted the heartbreaking story of Blackwater 's youngest victim , a 9 year old who was shot by Blackwater guards .
He was one of 17 victims that day in Nisour square .
As of mid-2009 , the United States employed over 22,000 hired guns in Iraq and Afghanistan .
And that number keeps going up .
Our reliance on private , for - profit companies for the business of waging war is extremely dangerous .
It 's time we move to eliminate the use of these unaccountable and controversial mercenaries , and I ask you to join me as a citizen co-sponsor of legislation that I have just re-introduced , the Stop Outsourcing Our Security Act .
The Stop Outsourcing Security
Act , which will be introduced in the Senate by Vermont 's Bernie Sanders , recognizes that the U.S. needs to end its reliance on private security contractors , and it would prohibit the use of private contractors for military , security , law enforcement , intelligence , and armed rescue functions .
It would also increase transparency over any remaining contracts by increasing reporting requirements and Congressional oversight .

Dear Colleague :
JUST off the coast of the world ’s driest desert , the lifeless Atacama in northern Chile , lies one of the largest and densest masses of life anywhere on Earth .
The vast tangled mat of white “ hair ” , which has an area of 128,000 square kilometres , roughly the size of Greece , was recently mapped as part of the first comprehensive Census of Marine Life .
The ghostly submarine prairie is made of wispy strings of giant bacteria , says Victor Gallardo , a marine biologist at Chile ’s University of Concepción .
The bug thrives in water almost devoid of oxygen by extracting energy from hydrogen sulphide …
Finally , Apple is doing away with those arrogant upstarts who think then can write a few lines in a high level language and call it a program .
Their new developer agreement requires :
3.3.1 – Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any private APIs .
Applications must be originally written in Objective -C , C , C++ , or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine , and only code written in C , C++ , and Objective - C may compile and directly link against the Documented APIs ( e.g. , Applications that link to Documented APIs through an intermediary translation or compatibility layer or tool are prohibited ) .
This has a couple of good points – firstly banning stupid languages ( used by those people who are not smart enough to learn c++ ) , and secondly getting rid of translation layers .
Apple has clearly put a lot of thought into their APIs , so why would anyone want to put a layer on top of them – it ’s just going to make things harder to use .
Languages
There has been a lot of talk recently about compiling “ foreign ” languages , such as haxe , as3 , javascript , java , . net based languages , into binaries that will run extremely well on the iPhone .
But like all foreigners ( who are responsible for all the terrorism in the world ) these languages should be cleansed from all iPhones to maintain the iPhones mono - lingual purity .
Putting such insidious diversity into a beautifully designed device can be shown to confuse consumers , most of whom do n’t even know their device and been compromised by these so call “ high level ” languages .
By raising the barrier of entry , and only permitting “ real ” programming languages ( ie , “ C ” based ones ) , Apple ensures that the quality of apps will remain at its current lofty levels .
“ Natural Selection ” will then weed out those people who are too lazy or too stupid to learn a proper language .
In fact , I think Apple has not gone far enough here and should dabble in a bit of “ Intelligent Design ” by requiring that all developers who wish to submit apps hold at least a 4 year degree in computer science .
Just imagine a world where any kid can work out of his garage and build an application with an original language , or bit of hardware , that snubs its nose at the establishment – anarchy would ensue .
Therefore , it is important that the responsible companies out there vet such potentially disruptive ideas before they can cause too much damage .
It ca n’t be said that Apple do n’t like new langauges , after all , they championed the greatest NeXT Step in programming ever , Objective - C , it ’s just that all the other languages are utter crap .
Some of then do away with the beautiful square bracket , some use commas to separate function arguments and nearly all the modern ones perform “ Garbage Collection ” .
What a joke !
Apple solved this problem years ago be simply not creating garbage in the first place .
Again , it is only those too lazy to learn about how to use allocation pools and correct reference counting that need anything as dirty as Garbage Collection .
The new langages , such as haxe , are so terse that you do not even know when you are using a delegate .
How can anyone possibly understand that code like :
addEventListener( KeyboardEvent.KEY_DOWN , function ( event ) { trace ( event ) ; } ) ;
Is supposed to do ?
I mean where is the delegate ?
Where is the class that implements the UIText FieldDelegate protocol ?
( And why must these languages continue to call things “ Interfaces ” when they are clearly “ Protocols ” ?)
I think Apple are right to ban code generators , such as the haxe c++ backend .
While these produce code that could in theory be produced by hand , the code it robotic and lacks the “ soul ” of hand written code .
To err is human , and without the quirks introduced bu a human coding c++ we may as well hand the future over to SkyNet and let the machines run everything .
Layers and Tools
Thankfully , Apple has also done its research into programming techniques as well as programming languages .
The problem with programming these days is that where are too many layers and tools to learn , and they are taking us back to a simpler times where you are “ close to the metal ” .
Apple rightfully shuns these extra layers , and focuses only on code .
Once you understand Objective -C , Interface Builder , NIB , XIB , Frameworks , .app layouts , provisioning , xml , plist , controllers , delegates , owners and outlets , then you can create pure lovely code , without any of that layering crap getting in your way .
Programmers must beware of code that essentially “ lies ” by pretending that the beautiful , native API actually looks like one of the ill - conceived APIs from another language .
For example , why would anyone want to view a native UIView image as the practically unsable as3 “ equivalent ” ( I use the term loosly ) of BitmapData ?
I do n’t think there is a single successful application ever written that uses this BitmapData class .
Isolating your code from the native API will cause your code to lose its identity .
If you can compile it for another ( obviously inferior ) device then your code will become tainted by the lower class device , even it it performs identically on the Apple device .
How quickly people forget that the upper class should not mingle with the lower class .
I hope Apple ’s ban extends to the gzip “ translation layer ” .
Programmers should not be using this library because it has security implications , and they should simply use the streaming classes and do the decompression in their own code .
If more programmers thought like Apple , then there would be a lot fewer security holes in software .
Do n’t get me started on Game Making programs .
Thank god these are banned – imagine letting a non-programmer create an App .
What next , Artist creating games ?
Do n’t make me laugh .
Conclusion
Apple has made a huge stride forwards by tightening the definition of what a real developer is , and I ’m looking forward to what ’s next .
I think they have a little way to go – for example , what about all those people using foreign editors , rather than XCode ?
Surely if XCode is not good enough for a developer , then that developer is not good enough for Apple .
The best way I can see for them enforcing this is for them to install a “ watchdog ” application the the developer ’s machine , and send screenshots back to Apple periodically .
That way , if the developer does not conform to the coding purity required by Apple , they could be identified and sent to a camp to help them concentrate on being better programmers .
Win -win , what a great idea .

What separates the average network marketer from the superstars ?
The people making incomes and living the lifestyles we all dream about started out with a basic starter kit and no downline or customers , just like we did .
They have the same products , the same marketing plan , and the same company support we have .
If they came into your business and brought a downline over from another opportunity , you still know that in the beginning , when they first started in network marketing , they had nothing .
It ’s all up to each of us to take our business as far as we want .
It is n’t that we lack resources or tools – it ’s just in how we use them .
Have you heard things like this from your downline , or people you know who are building a business ?
the products are too expensive , nobody will buy them
nobody in my upline cares whether I succeed or not
that company policy change will destroy my business
this compensation plan does n’t pay out enough
This could go on and on .
These are excuses people use when their business is n’t growing .
Do the superstars talk like this ?
No way !
The top income earners find ways to turn negatives into positives .
Here are some ways that a network marketing superstar might look at things .
our products are the best and people will buy them once I show them how great they are
I will call my upline leaders every week and talk about what I did and how I can build my business better and faster
the company had to make some changes to prepare for the surge in growth expected over the next two years
this compensation plan pays me well for doing the right things and building my business to the best of my ability
It all comes down to an attitude thing .
Never blame someone or something else for lack of success .
Take responsibility and find the positive benefit in every circumstance .
This is what the top network marketing leaders and superstars do .

Tesco is minting it , suggest company results this week .
In his regular column , Michael Blastland reveals a new measurement for an age of mega numbers : The Tesco .
As shops go , Tesco is the daddy .
It 's often said that £ 1 in every £ 7 spent in the shops is spent at Tesco .
The company 's global sales this year were about £ 60bn , UK sales about £ 40 bn .
That 's handy .
No , not just because it keeps thousands in jobs , pays profits to our pension funds and taxes to the government etc ( though let 's not forget it has critics ) .
Tesco puts the world in proportion .
In fact , Go Figure can reveal that government ministers increasingly struggle to get their heads round the national finances .
For most of the numbers in public argument have gone enormous too .
Billions , trillions ?
Too many zeros .
What better way to understand them than with a new unit of measurement ?
From now on the Treasury will measure the economy and public spending in : The Tesco .
How does that work ?
Click through the presentation below .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
However , Tesco is n't just a British operation , so if we use the global sales of Tesco as our standard unit , at about £ 60 bn , then ...
The UK economy = about 24 Tescos US economy = about 156 Tescos .
Total UK government spending = about 11 Tescos .
Total UK government debt = about 13 Tescos .
Confidential Cabinet papers reveal that Ed Balls is calling for two Tescos for the Department of Children Schools and Families but may be willing to forgo the men's clothing , while Overseas Aid has put in a bid for an extra frozen veg .
Transport has accepted a cut of in - store bakery and toiletries .
Meanwhile , Sir Terry Leahy , Tesco chief executive , only - only ?
- has to increase his global business relative to the US by about 156 times and Tesco would be the world 's biggest economy .
Do you think he knows ?
Any ideas for other new units of measurement that could simplify the world ?
Send your suggestions and we 'll post the best .
Sources : Public Finances Databank , Public Expenditure Statistical Analysis , Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings , US Bureau of Economic Analysis .
Note :
Why does n't UK GDP ( 35 Tescos ) equal the private sector ( 28 Tescos ) plus public spending ( 15 Tescos ) ?
Mainly because a large part of public spending is transfer payments ( pensions and benefits and the like ) , that is , cash simply taken from one person and given to another .
This is not part of GDP .
So some of the private sector output is counted again in public spending when the money taken in tax is paid out in pensions etc .
Assumptions : GDP approx £ 1.4tn .
Public spending approx 44 % of GDP .
Market sector output approx 80 % of GDP .
UK debt to GDP ratio approx 63 % .
Readers have a sense of humour - the Treasury wo n't really being doing its sums in The Tesco .

None of my money passes through Tesco and I like it that way .
Yes Tesco provide thousands of jobs but they wipe out local competition such as small independent businesses and sell food at such a low price that our farmers are losing out .
It is becoming more and more difficult to shop somewhere different because Tesco stores sprout up everywhere and some people cannot access any other shops .
Surely this is taking advantage ?!
How are small businesses supposed to survive when Tesco can offer such low prices and provide everything from apples to car insurance ?!
There needs to be more control over the expansion and power of UK supermarkets .
I could go on but I wo n't !
Hannah Mintram , Southampton , England Sack ALL the politicians and get Tescos to run the country .
We 'd be in profit in no time at all .
David , Bawdeswell , Norfolk , UK Whilst a Tesco seems a sensible measure of government spending I fear it is too large to apply to government ' savings ' - would a Wimbledon be more appropriate ( mens and ladies singles champions receive £ 1 m each , 1 Wimbledon = £ 2 m ) making the debate over the proposed NIC increase 3,000 Wimbledons rather than a tenth of a Tesco ( or any arbitrary product / departmental ' guess ' in those stores ) ?

A unit of MP defined as the total average cost to the taxpayer of MP's , including salary , expenses , subsidies for food and office facilities , etc .
Then measure as a percentage of MP the money spent on Education per child Old Age Pension per pensioner Medical / Injury pension for disabled servicemen Average cost of keeping a convict in prison etc .

While a ' Tesco ' might be a useful measurement device , the effect of this retailer on the local community is one of devaluation .
The East End of London is overrun with Tesco Metro stores and the high - density housing projects all around the area seem to be provided with a conditional ' must include a Tesco Metro ' in the planning permission .
Local shops are being hammered - or in currency parlance , being treated like Sterling on Black Wednesday .
Eoin O'Connor , London , UK
You cannot compare a company 's sales to GDP : it 's apples and oranges .
GDP can be thought of as either a measure of economic value - add , or total spending on final goods and services .
Tesco 's revenues include intermediate goods : if you want to compare Tesco 's revenues to GDP , you need to think of Tesco 's revenues as including all the activities of farmers , manufacturers , transportation companies , energy companies , etc. that are involved the production of the final goods Tesco retails .
Tesco's own contribution to GDP is the sum of wages + profits , which does not equal revenues ( revenues = wages + profits + costs ) .

A helpful perspective on the Big Numbers , at last !
However , it does not help that the media have taken on use of the American quantity " billion " rather than using the " milliard " of 1 000 000 000 .
The US " billion " differs from the English " billion " for historic reasons , but the same word appears in most European languages with the English meaning of a million million .
Alex G , Ipswich , GB How many Tescos are there to a Walmart ?
I think we should know .
Darren Heal , Aberdeen , Scotland I have always thought that the Helen should be the standard unit of beauty , based on legendary beauty Helen of Troy !
For example , a woman with a beauty of 1 Helen could launch 100 ships , whereas a woman with a Micro - Helen would be beautiful enough to launch an inflatable dinghy !
Let 's face it , it would make rating celebrities easier !

I think we should use the number of incompetent politicians - a new unit !

Marcos , London
We already have lots of good new measures .
Length is the double decker bus .
Area is the football pitch ( unless it is a very large area in which case it is the Wales ) .
Volume the olympic swimming pool .
What we need is a measure of the truthfulness of politicians , may I suggest the daily waste production of the average male cow would be perfect .
Mike Thomas , West Kirby England UK Scientific budget = 0.1 Tesco , which is criminally little .
Keith , Loughborough
This is an interesting idea but it has a major flaw :
The overall value or trading figures for any company can vary wildly .
This means that it is hard to compare like for like figures in different years .
Or is that taking it a little too seriously ?
The idea that the whole US economy is only equivalent to 156 Tescos is intriguing .

Eighteen million US homes can — right now !— order up a fiber optic line that runs all the way to their door .
That 's 16 percent of the population , and this buildout has happened almost totally in the last seven years .
It 's good news for fiber , which has been on a growth rate that exceeds anything ever achieved by copper telephone wiring and coaxial cable wiring in their first years .
According to a new study of fiber - to - the - home connections ( PDF ) , " the highest early annual growth rate for copper was 76 percent and 125 percent for coax " within its first decade , but fiber - to - the - home has already hit 250 percent year - over - year growth rates .
There are caveats .
First , the huge majority of these lines are part of Verizon 's FiOS buildout — and that buildout has now reached the end of its first stage .
Those within reach of a FiOS connection can still order one and have it installed , but the company has no plans to pass any more homes in the near future .
And no other major company looks ready to do fiber - to - the - home at that scale .
Second , less than a third of those homes that can order a fiber connection have actually done so .
Verizon 's take rate has been decent but not earth - shattering ; on the other hand , the small non-Verizon deployments have done well , generating take rates of 52 percent .
There are more of these small projects than one might expect ; according to the report , " there is actually a very long tail " of 750 other fiber - to - the - home providers .
The success of the Fifth Annual Mediterranean Emergency Medicine Congress was inspiration to investigate how other countries provide health care .
Meeting physicians from around the world , a frequent point of discussion was about the future of health care in America .
All were eager to share the way that their country provides health care for its citizens .
AAEM and the Resident & Student Association continue to be involved in advocating for physicians ' practice rights , emergency medicine 's place in the " house of medicine , " and national tort and reimbursement issues , as well as broader health care reform .
As the national debate on the future of health care smolders on , here is a glimpse of health care around the world .
England
In the wake of World War II , The United Kingdom faced the challenge of rebuilding their country .
It was in this tumultuous decade that Winston Churchill , a conservative icon , spoke to the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons , stating :
" The discoveries of healing science must be in the inheritance of all ...
Our policy is to create a national health service in order to ensure that everybody in the country , irrespective of means , age , sex , or occupation , shall have equal opportunities to benefit from the best and most up - to - date medical and allied services available . " [ 1 ]
The official bill authorizing the National Health Service ( NHS ) in England and Wales was signed in to law in 1946 .
It provides free point of care health services to all citizens of England and is paid for by tax dollars .
The budget was roughly $ 200 billion in 2008 - 2009 and has seen an approximately 3 % annual rise in costs since it 's founding in the late 1940s .
[ 2 ]
For comparison , the 2007 budget of Medicare in the United States was over $ 400 billion and rises annually anywhere from 5 - 15 % .[ 3 ] 60 % of the NHS budget pays salaries for the staff , 20 % for drugs and supplies and 20 % for buildings and equipment .
The NHS is the world 's largest provider of health care and is also the world 's fourth largest employer .
There is a small market for private health care , paid for out - of - pocket or by insurance policy .
Life expectancy at birth in the United Kingdom is 79 years , higher than in the U.S.
Though outcomes are generally exceptional , there is less access to some novel therapies , contributing to a lower survival rate for certain cancers .
China
China currently has a disorganized health system .
In the late 1970s , the government privatized the health care system and took away a chunk of government subsidies .
Now , the nearly 700 million rural Chinese citizens have little to no access to care , and most of the 1.3 billion citizens must pay for any care they receive almost entirely out of pocket .
According to The Lancet , the average cost of hospitalization exceeds the average person 's wage .
[ 4 ]
The Chinese have one of the world 's highest personal savings rates , and many believe this is because individuals shoulder the majority of the cost of illness . [ 5 ]
The government has introduced a plan called Healthy China 2020 , which ambitiously intends to create universal health care for 1.3 billion people over the next ten years .
The plan provides some form of health insurance and drug coverage to all citizens .
China has invested $ 120 billion on hospital infrastructure and set price controls on 300 of the most commonly used drugs . [ 6 ]
France
Health care in France , like in England , is provided to all citizens , financed through a national health insurance system , paid for by the government through tax revenue .
France spends approximately 11 % of their GDP on health care , which is the highest of any country in Europe but less than the 16 % spent in the United States . [ 7 ]
Physicians are " self - employed " but receive reimbursement from a single - payer government insurance fund on a fee - for - service basis .
The government sets the reimbursement schedule .
Individuals have the option of purchasing private supplemental insurance .
Many employers offer supplemental insurance as part of their benefits package .
The government programs pay the vast majority of hospitals ' ( public institutions ) and doctors ' fees , and private insurance can be purchased to pay for drugs , prostheses , dental care and health care at private for - profit hospitals .
In general , taxes in France are higher than in the United States , but because of the complexity of both nations ' tax codes , it is difficult to compare apples to apples .
Individuals in France pay 5.25 % of their income to the health care plan . [ 8 ]
The government then plays a role in managing the health insurance funds themselves and negotiates drug costs and physicians ' reimbursements .
Japan
The Japanese have one of the longest life expectancies in the world .
They have a two - pronged approach to health insurance : employer - based health premiums and taxes .
Profits at health insurance companies are banned .
The program costs 8 % of the GDP . [ 9 ]
The Japanese see their physician on average 14 times per year ( four times more frequently than U.S. citizens ) .
Patients have access to preventive services and low cost prescription drugs , all leading to a lower prevalence of chronic diseases than in the United States , contributing to their longer lifespan .
Despite the inexpensive , easy access system , the limitations on doctors ' fees and a number of novel therapies may be unacceptable to many well - insured Americans .
And , while the Japanese have a much lower incidence of heart disease , the chances of surviving a heart attack are about two times higher in the U.S .
There are as many approaches to providing and funding health care as there are countries and localities in the world .
The challenges we face in the United States today are not as unique as we may think .
No one country has the perfect system , but there is always something to be learned by looking at others ' successes and shortcomings along with our own .
Ah , that tag combination makes me all warm and fuzzy inside …
Also , in case you missed it on Friday : I went ahead and remade most of the “ Dance ! ” strip , as I was n’t particularly pleased with the first version .
Here ‘s the new version .
MALMO , Sweden , March 25 ( UPI ) --
The warden of a Swedish jail said a prisoner received an official warning for voicing his discontent toward his situation via flatulence .
Anders Eriksson , warden of the Kirseberg prison in Malmo , said guards filed numerous complaints against the 21 - year - old prisoner , who was not named , alleging " a series of concerted attacks " in the form of the prisoner 's constant wind - breaking , Britain 's The Daily Telegraph reported Thursday .

" I have worked within the prisons and probation service since 1986 and I have never experienced a situation where behavior of this sort has led to punishment , " Eriksson said in an interview with Sweden 's Metro newspaper .
Prison authorities said the prisoner revealed the motive for his flatulence .
" I had an upset stomach while I was playing cards but did not want to fart there .
So I went over to the guards instead , " he was quoted as saying .
The prisoner was issued an official warning and could face punishment for any future attacks of intentional flatulence , Eriksson said .

Chances are , you are quite familiar with the logs of your on - premises Active Directory ( AD ) domain controller .
The corresponding Event IDs have been well documented over the years ( though not thanks to Microsoft ) , and many blog posts have been written about how to use AD logs to detect Pass - the - Hash , brute force attempts , Kerberoasting , and more .
Increasingly though , we all find our Active Directory slowly ( or quickly ) migrating into the Cloud , and becoming an Azure Active Directory ( AAD ) .
Some of the old on - premises AD body of knowledge in detection and defense still applies , but most is obsolete .
And - brave new world - AAD is usually exposed to the Internet in some form or fashion , so it is subject to all the noise that all the miscreants on the planet can fire against the IP address that happens to be yours .
As was the case with Active Directory , Microsoft is n't really making huge strides in sharing the knowledge needed to keep Azure AD safe , either .
The https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs and https://github.com/Microsoft repositories are sharing some samples , many of which are outdated , but in general , the documentation is still kinda thin .
If you are like many small businesses or institutions who use AAD , but can't afford the full - fledged Microsoft offering with Sentinel , Azure ATP ( now called Microsoft Defender for Identity ) and other $ $ $ - gadgets , you are kinda on your own .
You still should look at them logs though , because ... as mentioned above ... AAD is usually " internet - facing " , and if there is any chink in your armor , the miscreants will find it eventually .
Rather than to stream your AAD logs back to on - premises into your existing ELK or Splunk or what - have - you , I 'd suggest you look into connecting your AAD into a LogAnalytics space in Azure .
It is n't exactly cheap , but if you do n't go overboard with the volume or retention period , you 'll find it useful .
More info how to set it up , here : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/howto-analyze-activity-logs-log-analytics
Once you have this in place , you can use the Kusto Query Language to run quickfire analysis queries like this one , to look for failed logins that originate from the same IP , and hit several user IDs :
SigninLogs
| where ResultType != 0 // failed logins only
| extend TimeBin=bin( TimeGenerated , 2h ) // in 2h interval buckets
| summarize IDs=make_set ( Identity ) by IPAddress , TimeBin // attempted usernames per source IP and time bucket
| extend targets=array_length ( IDs ) // count how many
| render columnchart // paint a pretty picture
which in my case , for the community college where I 'm watching the AAD , is resulting in something like this for last week :
which in turn provides ample incentive to drill down further , and to also look into how to deploy some kind of automatic responder that bans this kind of nonsense , by pushing a temporary block rule to zap the offending IPs .

The bomb was placed in a taxi which was hijacked in north Belfast The Real IRA has admitted it was behind a car bomb which exploded outside the army base which houses MI5 's Northern Ireland headquarters .
The blast came on the day that David Ford was elected as NI 's Justice Minister , the first local politician to hold the job in 38 years .
It happened at about 0020 BST outside Palace Barracks , in Holywood , County Down .
Police said no warning was given .
The bomb went off as the surrounding area was being evacuated .
An elderly man walking near the barracks at the time was treated for minor injuries .
The bomb was placed in a taxi , which had been hijacked in the Ligoniel area of north Belfast , about seven miles from Holywood , at about 2150 BST .
The driver was held hostage by three men for about two hours before being told to drive his taxi to the barracks .
The vehicle was abandoned at the base just before midnight prompting police and security staff to evacuate the area .
The bomb exploded about 20 minutes later as the evacuation was still taking place .
There were two explosions - first the bomb and then the petrol tank , destroying the car and damaging other property .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Ford , the new justice minister , said the bombing was a cynical attempt to intimidate politicians ahead of Monday 's vote .
" Those who carried out last night 's attack will not be allowed to succeed in sowing dissension , distrust and disharmony , " he said .
Chief Constable Matt Baggott said the people responsible for such attacks would have to be locked up and put through the criminal justice system .
" My hope is that many people will be persuaded by their families and their communities that this is no longer the time for this , it 's gone , the war is over , " he said .
' Significant explosion ' Chief Superintendent Nigel Grimshaw said the police had not received a telephoned warning about the attack .
He said the taxi used was destroyed in the " significant explosion " .
The senior officer visited the scene on Sunday night .
" I saw young children in the arms of mothers and fathers , where we had moved people into a local community centre - that 's the type of people who were affected by this totally callous act .
" There is no question in my mind that it was designed to kill or seriously injure and that 's exactly what would have happened , were it not for the actions of my officers , military colleagues and indeed the community themselves who co-operated fully with us . "
Up to 60 people were moved from their homes and spent the night in a community centre .
All have now been allowed to return .
The attack appears to have been timed to coincide with the transfer of policing and justice powers from London to Belfast .
Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward said this " democratic transition stands in stark contrast to the activity of a criminal few who will not accept the will of the majority of people of Northern Ireland " .
" They have no support anywhere , " he added .
ANALYSIS Mark Simpson , BBC News Ireland Correspondent , Holywood
The timing and location of the bombing were designed to try to create the biggest possible international headlines and the deepest political impact .
Planting the bomb three miles from Stormont , and outside the army base which houses the headquarters of MI5 in Northern Ireland , was deliberate .
And making it explode shortly after midnight , less than an hour after policing and justice powers were transferred from London to Belfast , was a key part of the potentially lethal plan .
On a day when a new political era is starting at Stormont , dissident republicans wanted to highlight one of the weaknesses of the peace process - the threat of further violence .
The truth is the police suspected something might happen this week .
The reality is that they were not able to stop it .
That will be food for thought for Stormont 's new justice minister .
New era for policing and justice
What happens after powers transfer ?
In March , Northern Ireland Assembly members voted in favour of the transfer of policing and justice powers .
Out of the 105 votes cast in the Assembly , a total of 88 supported the move , with 17 Ulster Unionists voting against .
Disagreement on the timing of the devolution of the justice powers had threatened to collapse Northern Ireland 's power - sharing administration .
On Monday , Stormont assembly members voted to make David Ford , the leader of the cross-community Alliance Party the justice minister .
His department has taken over responsibility for many functions and agencies previously controlled by the London - based Northern Ireland Office .
As well as taking over responsibility for the police , the new ministry will oversee bodies like the Northern Ireland Prison Service , the prosecution service , the Probation Board and the forensic science service .

I had the opportunity , thanks to Natalie at Natalie ’s Killer Cuisine , to be a part of a Dallas Food Bloggers Pot -Luck Lunch .
She has a write up of the event on her blog , which you can check out here , and aside from a whole lot of good food , there was a whole lot of fantastic company .
We discussed food , blogging , photography , and life in general .
It was wonderful to connect with other local bloggers and learn about their food point of view .
I hope we can do it again soon !
So , when deciding what to make I decided I wanted something that was fresh , flavorful , and pretty .
This cake fits that bill .
It is a bit of a process to get this cake made , but it is easily made in one day .
It tastes best if allowed to chill overnight in the fridge so the raspberry curd and chocolate ganache can soak into the cake .
Just let the cake warm up for a couple of hours before serving at room temperature .
Chocolate and raspberry are a delightful combination because the tartness of the berries pairs so well with rich dark chocolate .
Rather than coat the cake with more dark chocolate I opted for a white chocolate buttercream .
The creamy vanilla notes blended well with the buttery cake .
Overall this cake is worth the time it takes to assemble it .
With its six layers and alternating fillings , it is perhaps even prettier when sliced !
Raspberry and Chocolate Ganache Cake with White Chocolate Buttercream Serves 14
For the cake :
12 ounces ( three sticks ) unsalted butter
13 ounces sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla
4 eggs
15 ounce buttermilk
13 ounce all purpose flour
1/8 ounce baking powder
1/8 ounce baking soda
For the raspberry curd :
6 ounces fresh raspberries
4 ounces sugar
2 teaspoons lemon juice
4 egg yolks
8 tablespoons unsalted butter
For the chocolate ganache :
8 ounces dark chocolate ( at least 65 % ) chopped
4 ounces heavy cream
1 vanilla bean
For the white chocolate buttercream :
4 ounces white chocolate , chopped
1 cup ( 2 sticks ) unsalted butter , at room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla
5 - 6 cups powdered sugar
2 - 4 tablespoons heavy cream , as needed
Shaved chocolate and fresh raspberries for decorating , if desired
Heat the oven to 350 F and spray two 8 ″ cake pans with non -stick spray .
In a large bowl cream together the butter and sugar until well mixed and creamy .
Add the eggs and whisk until well combined .
In a medium bowl mix the flour , baking powder , and baking soda until well mixed .
In a large measuring cup mix the buttermilk and vanilla .
Alternately add the flour mixture and buttermilk into the butter , in three additions , beginning and ending with the flour .
Divide the batter between the pans and bake for 35 to 40 minutes , or until the center springs back when pressed and the cake comes away from the sides of the pan .
Cool for ten minutes in the pans before turning out onto racks to cool completely .
Wrap the cooled cake in plastic wrap and chill for at least one hour .
While the cake is baking prepare the ganache and raspberry curd .
For the ganache pour the cream into a heavy pot .
Open the vanilla bean and scrape out the seeds .
Add the seeds and the bean to the cream .
Heat the cream , over medium high heat , until it begins to simmer .
Turn off the heat and add the chopped chocolate .
Allow to stand three minutes before whisking to combine .
Let stand at room temperature until completely cool .
For the raspberry curd begin by pureeing the fresh raspberries in a blender until smooth .
Strain the mixture through a strainer .
Pour four ounces of the puree into a non-reactive pot with the sugar , lemon juice , and egg yolks .
Cook the mixture , over medium low heat , until it thickens and begins to boil .
Remove the mixture from the heat and whisk in the butter .
Strain the mixture then cover with plastic , making sure to press the film down on the curd to avoid a skin , and chill in the refrigerator until completely cool .
For the buttercream begin by melting the chopped white chocolate in the microwave in 15 seconds bursts , stirring well between intervals , until completely melted .
In the bowl of a mixer cream the butter and vanilla until smooth .
Add the white chocolate and mix until well combined .
Add the powdered sugar , a cup at a time , until it reaches a spreading consistency .
If the frosting seems to dry add a little heavy cream , a couple of tablespoons at a time , until you reach a smooth consistency .
Cover with plastic until ready to use .
To assemble the cake :
Tort the cake into three layers each .
Place a layer of cake on your board , or cake plate , and spread 1/3 of the chocolate ganache until it is 1 / 4 ″ from the edge of the cake .
Top with a layer of cake and spread about 1 / 4 cup raspberry curd until it is 1 / 4 ″ from the edge of the cake .
Repeat until you reach the last layer .
Carefully apply a thin crumb coat of the white chocolate buttercream and then chill the cake for at least one hour , or up to four hours , before applying the final coat of frosting .
Decorate as desired .

If voters are given a choice between Rep. Ron Paul and President Barack Obama in a hypothetical 2012 presidential match - up , it ’s a dead heat , according to the latest Rasmussen poll .
Rep. Ron Paul ( R. , Texas ) speaks at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference in New Orleans , Saturday .
( AP Photo / Gerald Herbert )
An April 12 - 13 telephone survey of 1,000 likely voters had the Texas Republican trailing Obama by just one point , 42 % - 41 % .
Roughly one in 10 , 11 % , prefer another candidate while 6 % were undecided .
The poll was touted immediately by Campaign for Liberty , Ron Paul ’s political outfit .
It ’s an unusually high number for the lawmaker who rarely breaks in to the double - digits in polls ( other than unscientific straw polls ) when respondents are asked to pick a Republican nominee from a longer list of prospective 2012 candidates .
The 41 % figure more broadly indicates overall opposition to Obama .
The president has more support from self - identified Democrats ; 79 % said they would vote for him .
Two - thirds of self - identified Republicans said they would vote for Paul .
Unaffiliated voters favor Paul 47 % - 28 % over Obama .
There are divides regarding Paul and his effect on the Republican Party — nearly three in 10 , 27 % , of Republicans said he is a divisive force while 30 % said he presents a new direction for the GOP .
Most Republicans , 42 % , said they were n’t sure .
Turns out , the software that Lower Merion was using to track missing laptops was even more invasive than the Robbinses - and many other families - had imagined .
Since the suit was filed , the district has recovered about 56,000 images , and the Robbinses ' attorney said that there could be many more .
Federal regulators " looked the other way " while Wall Street firms engaged in dubious practices that led to securities charges against Goldman Sachs , the senior House Republican on financial issues said Tuesday .
Rep. Spencer Bachus ( Ala. ) , the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee , also suggested there was a certain amount of " cooperation and conspiracy " among large financial firms and regulators .
Bachus asserted that officials at Treasury or the Federal Reserve might have known about similar cases at other institutions , though he did n't specify during which administration he suspects the cooperation to have taken place .
" You have to believe the Fed knew about it ; you have to believe the Treasury knew about it .
You have to believe that there were people at the Fed and the Treasury that were cooperating with all of this , " he said during an interview with CNBC .
" And the whistle should have been blown , and it was n't . "
Goldman was hit with civil charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on Friday .
The SEC charged Goldman with selling a securities - based product to its clients without disclosing that the hedge fund manager who'd helped devise the product had bet on it to fail .
The SEC approved the charges , reportedly on a party - lines vote , and they have become a central part of the debate in Washington over financial regulatory reform .
" What I would say is that I think the bigger question is maybe not what happened in this case , " Bachus said of the Goldman case .
" But , I think it 's becoming apparent that since at least 2004 , the regulators looked the other way , and there was a certain amount of -- I do n't know if you call it cooperation or conspiracy -- between some of the large companies to cover their tracks . "
The season finale of the popular TV show House , which will air on May 17th , was filmed entirely with the Canon 5D Mark II .
cinema5D overheard the plan last month and Greg Yaitanes , the director of the show , has confirmed it through a tweet in which we made himself open to questions .
We ’ll republish some of the interesting questions and answers here , interview style :
@MVRamunno :
What is the difference in how it looks on a TV screen compared to a regular camera ?
Greg Yaitanes : richer .
shallow focus pulls the actors faces to forground [ sic ] @oamad0101 :
How many frames per second and why a Canon 5D Mark II ?
GY : 24 p and wanted it for ease of use in tight spaces .
@unikissa : Ok , seriously .
Can you tell us something about the lenses you used ?
GY : all the canon primes and the 24-70 and the 70 -200 zoom @sarabury :
Did you have to change any of your working practices to fit in with differences between the 5D and a typical setup ?
GY : some .
focus was hard with these lenses but more “ cine - style ” lenses are being made as we speak .
@marykir : were you using CF cards for storage or some sort of mass storage mod ?
seems like you would need a lot of cards :)
GY : some 18 gb or something like that card .
gave us 22 min of footage .
@ Drdiagnostic :
How was the quality as compared 2 the traditional camera used in shooting ?
GY : i loved it and feel it ’s the future .
cameras that can give you these looks @klizma :
How did you manage to stabilize the camera in tight spaces ?
Any special kind of brackets ?
GY : no. mostly gave it a hand held feel .
or on a small tripod
This is quite an endorsement for Canon , with a network giant entrusting the finale of one of its most popular shows to the 5D Mark II ( which happens to be the first digital camera to take the Presidential portrait as well ) .
Here ’s what Wikipedia has to say about the popularity of the show :
In 2008 , House was distributed in a total of 66 countries .
With an audience of over 81.8 million worldwide , it was the most watched television show on the globe and far surpassed the viewership figures of the leading TV dramas the previous two years
If you have n’t yet , check out the short film , The Last 3 Minutes , which we posted earlier today .
It was filmed with the same camera .

“ We now have the entitlement generation as CEOs .
They just plain feel entitled to being wealthy as Croesus with no responsibility , no accountability .
They have become literal sociopaths . ” - William K. Black on Bill Moyers ’ Journal
" When you 're rich , they think you really know ! " - " If I Were a Rich Man , " from Fiddler on the Roof
Californians have been drawn within the cross-hairs of a propaganda blitz bought and paid for by Meg Whitman , the billionaire former CEO of eBay , who , since declaring her intent to run for governor in February , 2009 , has already contributed $ 59 million of her own money to her " campaign " --- a one - sided political phenomenon which has seen a stealth candidate , with disturbing connections to Goldman Sachs , soar to the top of the polls because the electoral process has been emasculated by the absence of mandatory debates and meaningful investigative journalism ...
USC study exposes corporate media substance deficit
On March 11 the Norman Lear Center of the USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism published its analysis [ PDF ] of local television news coverage in Los Angeles .
Their findings are vital to understanding how the corporate media both creates a substance deficit and facilitates the ability of the billionaire class to deceive the electorate into voting against their own interests .
The TV stations , the report notes , receive their licenses to broadcast over the public airwaves free of charge based on nothing more than a promise to serve " the public interest , convenience and necessity . "
In practice the stations fail to come close to delivering the type of information that is vital to informed consent in a functioning democracy .
Where 68 % of L.A. area citizens rely on local TV stations as their primary source of " news , " what they receive , when their attention is not being diverted by celebrity gossip , can in no sense be described as journalism .
According to the report , in a typical , 30 minute " news " segment ...
Stories about government actions on topics like education , health care and law enforcement took up ... 1:12 .
The majority of this time ( 0:49 ) was devoted to government actions taking place at the federal level or in other states .
The study contains a graph reflecting that , on average , only 7 seconds out of every 30 minute broadcast is devoted to U.S. foreign policy as compared to 8 minutes 36 seconds devoted to paid - for commercials ; another 2:10 devoted to " teasers " asking viewers to stay tuned for coverage to come .
The bulk of the remaining time relates to sports , weather , crime and disasters .
Conflict of interest inherent in a corporate media profits and political ads
While the USC study revealed that nearly 29 % of each 30 minute local TV " news " broadcast is devoted to commercial advertising , one should not lose sight of the fact that " news " programs provide only a small segment of local television which , while engaged in other forms of " entertainment , " relies heavily on commercials throughout all of its programming .
State of the media.org reports that , in 2010 , 91 % of local station revenues were expected to come from advertising .
While , like the rest of the economy , 2009 advertising revenues fell sharply , especially in the automotive sector , " political issue ads ... may have doubled the total from the previous non-election year of 2007 . "
The problem goes beyond the fact that paid political ads distort the political process by placing greater emphasis on the ability to pay for the 30 second propaganda slots .
A station whose revenue is dependent on an especially wealthy candidate 's paid - for political ads will be less inclined to challenge their accuracy , especially when the ad runs in the middle of a " news " broadcast --- ads which , in the case of Meg Whitman --- present a carefully scripted , faux populist image of a successful businesswoman who benevolently intends to rescue economically distressed California , miraculously creating jobs and resolving the state 's fiscal crisis by cutting taxes and cutting state government spending .
" Step right in , " said the spider to the fly .
The power of a one - sided media pulpit
By evading reporters , ducking a debate with her chief Republican rival , state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner , at the state Republican convention --- she would later debate Poizner but only before a well heeled audience at the New Majority California , a Republican organization for deep - pocketed donors who pay a $ 10,000 annual membership fee --- and by presenting only a carefully scripted image by way of television and radio ads , Whitman vaulted to an early commanding five to one lead over Poizner and a 3 % lead over the likely Democratic Party nominee , CA Attorney General Jerry Brown .
Billionaire sociopaths
The first question any real journalist should ask is why a billionaire would be willing to invest an estimated $ 150 million of her own money in order to become the governor of California , a state which , at $ 1.8 trillion , has the world 's eighth largest economy ?
The answer , I fear , may well be found in William K. Black 's The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One .
The best way for Wall Street to pillage a state is to have one of their own installed as a governor .
During his April 23 appearance on Bill Moyers Journal , Black , a former bank regulator , deconstructed the Republican - led deregulation of Wall Street as essentially nothing more than the decriminalization of fraud .
He skewered Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner 's suggestion during Congressional testimony to the effect that the federal government was powerless to prevent it due to the repeal of Glass - Steagall , the Depression era legislation that separated commercial and investment banking , noting that it was the Fed which had " pushed for the repeal of Glass - Steagall " :
So this is a deliberately created regulatory black hole , created by the Fed .
And then the Fed comes into the hearing , eight years later , and said , we were helpless .
Helpless to do anything , because of a black hole we designed .
Black described both the ideology and symbiotic relationship between Wall Street and the politicians they control as " criminogenic " :
A criminogenic environment is a steal from pathology --- a pathogenic environment [ is ] one that spreads disease .
In this case , it 's an environment that spreads fraud ... And this ideology that both parties are dominated by says “ No , big corporations would n't cheat .
Fraud can't happen .
The market 's automatically excluded . ”
It 's insane .
Black blasted the nation 's business schools for churning out an irresponsible , unaccountable generation of CEOs who feel " entitled " to unlimited wealth ; " literal sociopaths " who " take control and destroy massive enterprises and cause global economic crises . "
As if on cue , on April 24 The New York Times confirmed Black 's assessment by reporting :
In late 2007 , as the mortgage crisis gained momentum and many banks were suffering losses , Goldman Sachs executives traded e-mail messages saying that they would make “ some serious money ” betting against the housing markets .
The pillage of Main Street
The looting of Main Street was by no means limited to unregulated derivatives in which risky mortgages were packaged , sold and resold .
As Matt Taibbi revealed when interviewed on Democracy Now , big banks like J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs have employed a ranged of unregulated derivatives --- " credit default swaps , collateralized debt obligations , interest rate swaps " --- in order to extract billions of dollars from local communities by " persuading " them to refinance their debt .
In his Rolling Stone piece , Taibbi focused on a $ 250 million Birmingham sewer project that was converted into a $ 5 billion debt obligation to J.P. Morgan :
There was so much money to be made bilking these dizzy Southerners that banks like JP Morgan spent millions paying middlemen who bribed --- yes , that 's right , bribed , criminally bribed --- the county commissioners and their buddies just to keep their business .
Hell , the money was so good , JP Morgan at one point even paid Goldman Sachs $ 3 million just to back the fuck off , so they could have the rubes of Jefferson County to fleece all for themselves ...
Birmingham 's mayor was convicted of fraud and money - laundering for taking bribes funneled to him by Wall Street bankers ... But those who greenlighted the bribes and profited most from the scam remain largely untouched .
" It never gets back to JP Morgan " ...
As revealed by the Los Angeles Times , in 1998 Goldman Sachs saddled Oakland , CA with an " interest rate swap " which is now costing the city $ 5 million per year .
As explained by Mike Elk at the Huffington Post , the sharks at Goldman persuaded Oakland to exchange their variable rate debt on $ 187.5 million in bonds for a 5.62 % fixed rate .
Although the rate of Goldman 's payments " dropped down to 0.15 percent ... Goldman Sachs is still forcing the taxpayers of Oakland to pay 5.68 percent , and pocketing the $ 5.2 million difference as profit " --- a pure profit made possible because Goldman borrows money from the Fed at zero percent interest ; then loans the money back to local government which then is saddled with a hefty interest obligation .
The San Francisco Chronicle reported , " Goldman is a major player in California state finance .
It has been the underwriter of $ 78.9 billion in bonds issued by the state since 2006 . "
The paper also reported that Goldman sought to privatize the California Lottery and purchase the CA agency which insures student loans .
Meg the Wall Streeter
When the California Accountability Project ( CAP ) stripped away the adroit PR facade of a brilliant businesswoman who places the word " integrity " in bold letters on her web site , they revealed a picture of the less flattering traits that typify a rapacious class of 21st Century CEOs .
Against the backdrop of a supposedly selfless citizen willing to spend $ 150 million of her own money in order to rescue the good citizens of California from those evil tax and spend Democrats , CAP noted that for " most of her life , Whitman did n’t bother to even cast a vote in a number of important elections , let alone participate in shaping public policy . "
It 's not that Whitman was completely divorced from politics .
As revealed by the San Francisco Chronicle , in " 2008 , during the heart of the financial crisis , Meg Whitman was advising Presidential candidate John McCain to support the federal bank bailout " --- no doubt out of the same benevolent spirit that led to her decision to run for governor .
I mean , who but a cynic would point to the " 20 Goldman Sachs investment funds in which Meg Whitman is an investor or partner " including " more than $ 1 million each in two Goldman Sachs ' distressed opportunity ' funds , or so - called ' vulture funds , ' which swoop in on failing assets and recession - ravaged companies ? "
The San Francisco Chronicle went on to report :
From 1998 to 2002 , while she was CEO of eBay , Whitman helped steer millions of dollars of her company 's investment banking business to Goldman ....
In 2001 , Goldman put Whitman on its corporate board , paying her an estimated $ 475,000 for little more than a year of part - time service .
The company also gave her insider access to the initial public offerings of hot stocks worth millions ...
According to Salon 's Lance Williams , Whitman received the $ 475,000 for attending perhaps a half dozen Goldman Sachs board meetings over the span of 15 months , though her stint at Goldman did include service on the board 's compensation committee which twice signed off on lucrative bonuses for then Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson .
Williams reviewed records which showed that " Paulson ’s 2001 bonus package was $ 11.5 million , more than 19 times his salary , " before he left the firm to become George W. Bush 's Treasury Secretary .
As Bush 's fox guarding the hen house , Paulson , in 2008 , led the movement to saddle U.S. taxpayers with the massive debt run up courtesy of the Wall Street casino , otherwise known as the derivatives market in mortgage - backed securities --- an event which Joseph Stiglitz , a Nobel prize winning economist described as " the Great American Bank Robbery . "
While it can at least be said that Goldman Sachs was raking it in at the same time Paulson received his bonuses , the same cannot be said of Whitman , whose annual compensation package , as reported by Eric Jackson of The Street.com , spiked during her last two years at eBay , " even as eBay 's stock price continued to decline .
Peaking at $ 58 at the start of 2005 , eBay 's stock price dropped 43 % over the next three years .
Over that same period , Whitman 's total annual compensation almost quintupled to $ 13.9 million from $ 2.9 million . "
Where Witman touts her own success at eBay , a Brad Stone New York Times piece noted that eBay 's growth hinged on the eventually unsustainable practice of raising seller fees , and that Whitman 's 2005 decision to purchase Skype , an internet phone and video service , based on the mistaken assumption that sellers and buyers would want to speak with one another before closing deals , ultimately forced eBay to write off " more than half of the $ 2.6 billion purchase price . "
Whitman 's tenure on the Goldman Sachs board ended abruptly after she was identified by Rep. Michael Oxley ( R - OH ) as one of 21 business executives to receive lucrative IPOs from Goldman Sachs , engaging in a practice known as " spinning . "
In " Meg Whitman has her own definition of the ' right thing , ' " Michael Hiltzik of the Los Angeles Times explains :
In spinning , executives would typically get shares in coveted initial public stock offerings , which they would " spin , " or resell , into a soaring market , usually within days and sometimes within hours .
Their quick and almost entirely risk - free profits were effectively gifts , and the investment banks the givers .
Where Whitman denied in her book , The Power of Money ( 2010 ) , that there was so much as a " conflict of interest , " let alone a quid pro quo between the lucrative IPOs she and other eBay executives received and the eBay investment banking business they steered to Goldman , a Delaware judge , in denying the executives ' motion to dismiss a shareholder suit , found otherwise , noting that Whitman and her fellow executives " ' were not free to accept this consideration from a company ' that arguably hoped to induce them to keep funneling business its way .
Whitman and the other executives eventually settled the lawsuit by giving up their profits . "
The damage wrought by unchallenged propaganda
In " Pew Research Center Shows Elites Have Destroyed America 's Middle - Class , " Hiram Lee observed :
Wide layers of the population , who have seen trillions of dollars funneled from the public treasury into the coffers of Wall Street executives while their own living standards have been assaulted , their jobs slashed , their children 's schools closed , and vital social programs such as Medicare cut by billions of dollars , have no faith in the US government to secure their most basic social needs .
What has become painfully obvious is that many within these " wide layers of the population " simply do not realize that the source of the middle class demise lies not in government per se but in the carefully thought out , decades long effort of the hard - right to " starve the beast " by massive tax cuts for those who already have too much in order to , in the words of Grover Norquist , reduce government to the point it could be " drown in a bathtub " and in order to privatize the commons so that the privileged few can be enriched beyond the wildest imagination of ordinary citizens .
An American Political Science Association study , cited by Bill Moyers in Moyers on America ( 2004 ) referred to a " radical political elite who have ... inequality as its mission and has organized ' a fanatical drive to dismantle the political institutions , the legal and statutory cannons , and the intellectual and cultural framework that have shaped public responsibility from social harms arising from the excesses of private powers . ' "
Four years before the housing bubble burst , Moyers observed that in " creating the greatest economic inequality in the advanced world , they have saddled our nation , our states , and our cities ... with structural deficits ... systematically stripping government of its capacity ... to do little more than reward the rich and wage war . "
More recently , in Capitalism : A Love Story ( trailer below ) , Michael Moore touched upon the harsh reality their cynical ideology produced .
If the public airwaves and digital cable TV were not monopolized by a corrupt corporate media which is complicit in the pillage , these misguided masses ( aka Tea Baggers ) would understand that the answer lies not in destroying their government 's control of vital " public functions " --- police , fire , education , parks , health care , environmental protection , access to clean and affordable housing , water , wholesome food and electricity .
In our vice - into - virtue , greed - is - good capitalist society a bevy of snake oil salesmen have convinced the uninformed that a harsh winner - take - all society that places the greed of the fortunate few above the needs of many and even above the ability to maintain a sustainable planet is a good thing ; that democratic socialism , a system that extols positive human traits --- empathy , compassion , community , a recognition that we 're all in this together --- is to be feared and despised .
The choice before the citizens of California is not simply whether to accept or reject Meg Whitman as their next governor .
It is a choice between democracy and what Chalmers Johnson described on the cover of Naomi Klein 's The Shock Doctrine as " our headlong flight back to feudalism under the guise of social science and ' freedom . ' "

A senior foreign al - Qaeda commander has been arrested in Pakistan , US media reports citing Pakistani officials say .
Initial reports suggested the detainee was US - born al - Qaeda spokesman , Adam Gadahn .
Other reports name him as Egyptian - American Abu Yahya Azam .
He is reported to have been in charge of al - Qaeda operations in Afghanistan .
There is no official confirmation about the arrest from Pakistani authorities .
A number of militant suspects are said to have been seized in recent weeks .
But few reports have been officially confirmed .
Analysts say that most of the information about these arrests has come from unnamed Pakistani intelligence officials , which makes it very difficult to verify .
But US and Pakistani officials did confirm the capture in Karachi of the Afghan Taliban 's military commander Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in February .
A civilian employee at the Camp Lejeune Marine Base in North Carolina has won his battle to display anti-Islamic decals on his van while driving on the base .
Jesse Nieto , whose son was among 16 sailors killed in the 2000 terror attack against the USS Cole , had used the windows of his car as a place of tribute to his son .
He displayed a gold star ( a symbol of death in combat ) , a combat action ribbon , and the message : “ Remember the Cole , 12 Oct. 2000 . ”
But Mr. Nieto also used his vehicle to express his opinion of those who killed his son .
Decals proclaimed : “ Islam = Terrorism , ” “ We Died , They Rejoiced , ” and a picture of the US flag with the words : “ Disgrace My Countries [ sic ] Flag And I Will [ defecate ] On Your Quran . ”
He also displayed a decal picture of Calvin ( from the Calvin and Hobbes cartoon ) urinating on a cartoon illustration of the Prophet Mohammed .
The Mohammed illustration was a re-creation of one of the cartoons that provoked Muslim protests against a Danish newspaper and sparked an assassination plot against the cartoonist .
After seven years with these messages on his car , someone on the base complained .
Nieto was ordered to remove them .
He removed the most offensive decals , but was later cited again for violating a base traffic regulation that prohibits the display of “ extremist , indecent , sexist , or racist messages ” on motor vehicles .
Nieto , a Marine combat veteran , decided to fight back .
In a lawsuit filed in federal court in North Carolina he claimed a First Amendment free speech right to express his opinion of Islam and Islamic terrorists .
Government lawyers countered that a military base is not an open public forum like a town hall meeting or a public park .
The base commander is entitled to enact and enforce reasonable restrictions on speech when open debate or protests might disrupt the military ’s mission , they argued .
Nieto ’s lawyer , Robert Muise of the Thomas More Law Center , countered that government restrictions of speech must be viewpoint neutral and not just aimed at silencing speech critical of Islam .
He argued that the base regulation would not ban decals praising Islam , only those critical of Islam .
Last week , Senior US District Judge Malcolm Howard ruled for Nieto .
He said the base regulation was not being enforced in a neutral manner and was therefore unconstitutional as applied to Nieto .
“ The fact that [ Nieto ’s ] message may be extremely offensive to some is not a sufficient basis for banning [ his ] decals , ” Judge Howard wrote .
“ While the military may have greater leeway in restricting offensive material in furtherance of securing order and discipline among its troops , ” he said , “ it may not do so in a manner that allows one message while prohibiting the messages of those who can reasonably be expected to respond . ”
To Nieto , the fight was about more than just protecting free speech , Muise said .
“ Here is a Marine dad who lost his son to terrorists , ” the lawyer said .
“ It is not just the First Amendment , for him it is more .
For him it is the way he is mourning the loss of his son . ”
Muise said the case was a result of “ political correctness run amok ” on a military base .
“ What is refreshing , is that the judge saw through this political correctness nonsense and applied the law straight up , ” he said .
Death and Taxes
The deadline for Americans to file ( or not file ) income tax paperwork is coming up on the 15th of April .
The way taxation works shows the non-consensual nature of the state .
One is not allowed to opt out of paying for things the government does , regardless of whether one wants them done at all .
Taxation rests on coercion .
Money taken through taxes helps support state monopolies and fund enforcement .
In addition , a higher tax burden means that one needs a higher income to maintain a standard of living .
By doing so , taxes raise the barriers to independent living and undertaking non-traditional work .
Stronger state monopolies , stricter enforcement , and incentivizing longer working hours means less time for liberty and fewer opportunities to build alternatives to authoritarian controls .
Taxation supports the state ’s efforts to reach further into all areas of life .
Federal taxes are put to especially violent use .
According to the War Resisters League , 54 % of the portion of the federal budget funded by income taxes ( which excludes Social Security and other items separately taken from income ) was put towards military spending in 2009 .
That ’s more than $ 1.4 trillion dollars to kill people , prepare to kill people , and pay off past preparations and killings .
Killings in the pursuit of expanding political power and boosting the profits of privileged industries .
( The figures that War Resisters League gives can be found at : http://www.warresisters.org/pages/piechart.htm)
And putting a dollar figure to the war machine is not about being a callous bean - counter .
Each dollar spent on the military - industrial complex could have been put to a productive use .
The much - lauded advances in technology that military research had a hand in could have been done sooner if they were a bigger priority than politically - driven weapons advancement .
With the cost of each single F - 22 fighter jet listed as $ 142.6 million on Wikipedia , one has to wonder what a few extra billions of dollars in the economy would do for things like medical research , food quality , and basic living conditions .
Taxes for military spending cause death and deprivation at both ends .
The War Resisters League figures do n’t include paramilitary forces deployed against Americans .
The division between law enforcement and military , in equipment , attitude , function , and personnel are as blurry as ever .
Taxes pay for Tasers , tear gas , and tanks .
Activities that are controlled by government or by government - supported monopolies are based more on political incentives ( how much something satisfies people in high ranks of the power structure ) than on economic incentives ( how much satisfaction something brings to a number of individuals ) .
So the more top - down control of education , research , technology , and resources , the more likely that education , research , technology , and resources will be geared toward serving power structures over the needs of individuals who do not rank high in power structures .
Taxation , which governments use to secure funding , is a key part of this system of control .
Income tax is not the only way the US government takes wealth from people .
Every time more dollars are printed and then given to large banks , the dollar loses purchasing power .
So you ca n’t buy as much when your wage stays the same .
Government force plays a major role in keeping the economy rigid so you need to work more to have less .
And they will borrow money to fund their programs .
But the debts that governments get into and the thugs they send after those who step out of line all depend on government guarantees to pay for services using money they take from taxpayers .
To stop the cycle of violence and robbery , work from the ground up to make the population ungovernable .
The Daily Mail and the Sun are – what 's the polite term ?
– bricking it at the thought that the Lib Dem surge could result in the party making a major breakthrough in this election .
Ever since Nick Clegg 's victory in that debate six days ago , the rightwing press , much like the Tory party , has been utterly paralysed , unsure whether to launch a full - tilt attack on the Lib Dems , or to patronise the party 's surge as the teenage tantrum of an electorate who should jolly well just grow up .
And they 're still confused .
The Daily Mail 's editorial today is the funniest : truly , it is quite genuinely ( and unintentionally ) hilarious .
The " only explanation " for the Lib Dems ' rise , it imperiously states , is that " the public , disgusted by the near moral bankruptcy of the last parliament , is looking for revenge " .
Those of us who read the Mail are familiar with its leader writers ' shrill moralising .
What 's more telling is their desperation today to attack the Lib Dems , flinging whatever mud they can dig up on the presumption that some of it will stick .
The Mail 's list of charges against the Lib Dems is so hyped - up as to defy their readers ' intelligence .
For instance , we are told that Lib Dem MPs were the " worst expenses offenders " – in spite of the fact that not a single Lib Dem MP was connected with the most serious abuses of " flipping " their second homes for capital gain , nor claiming for phantom mortgages .
The Mail conveniently ignores the Lib Dems ' determined efforts over many years to clean up politics – such as giving the public the right to sack corrupt MPs , putting a cap on political donations , and clamping down on lobbying – in the teeth of Labour and Conservative opposition .
" Fisking " a Daily Mail editorial is , I fully realise , an utterly futile activity .
And perhaps we can forgive the paper for treating a political party 's surge warily .
After all , the last time the Mail advocated breaking the mould of British politics they sided with the British fascists and Hitler .
What really worries the Mail and Murdoch about the Lib Dem poll ratings is this : they understand Clegg 's party is a direct threat to the cosy status quo with which they are so comfortable .
Do n't take my word for it : the former Sun editor David Yelland made the point quite explicitly on these very pages just a couple of days ago in his explosive article that Nick Clegg 's rise could lock Murdoch and the media elite out of UK politics .
Will the tabloids ' full - frontal assault work ?
We will see .
I think its utter and complete over - the - topness is far too transparent , and that fair - minded voters will see it for what it is : a knee - jerk reflex from a paper out - of - step with the times .
It 's perhaps significant that one of the top-rated comments on the Mail 's website from one of its readers asks simply : " Do Tory party central office write all of this paper ? "
Of course newspapers matter , and I would much rather the Mail and Sun were offering their readers proper news rather than rightwing agitprop .
But they no longer matter as much : most of the public take in their information from broadcast media , which is obliged by law to be impartial .
And the staggering success of the unofficial Lib Dem Facebook group – with 120,000 - plus members , now far bigger than the Labour and Tory fan - groups combined – demonstrates the power of the internet to mobilise voters who scorn the rightwing press 's attempts to dictate the news agenda .
The Lib Dem rise in support is about more than just a rejection of the ways of the two old parties that have ruled this country for 65 years .
It is also a rejection of the age - old stitch - up between the vested interests of traditional politics , the media , big business and trade unions that has so often left the British public short - changed .
This is about the British people taking a long hard look at their elites , putting their foot down and saying : enough 's enough .
This is , above all , a very British insurgency .

Oklahoma City man with ' fetish for flatulence ' tells police he was sexually assaulted
An Oklahoma City man seeking a " friend " who shares his " fetish for flatulence " told police he was sexually assaulted by a man he met online , according to police report released today .
The 27 - year - old man told police Friday he exchanged phone numbers in January with another man , who sent text messages with graphic sexual questions and comments , some of which the victim saved and showed to police .
The victim agreed to meet the man March 27 and went to his Oklahoma City apartment about 11 p.m. because the man said he would " fart for me , " the victim told police .
The police report said the victim has autism .
LONDON ( AFP ) Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ A British grandmother was heavily fined and electronically tagged for selling a goldfish to a child , triggering criticism Wednesday of over - zealous use of animal protection laws .
Pet shop owner Joan Higgins , 66 , was fined 1,000 pounds ( 1,500 dollars , 1,120 euros ) also given a dusk - to - dawn curfew for selling an animal to a person under the age of 16 , but her 47 - year - old son Mark — also ordered to do community service — slammed the ruling as a farce .

The pair were prosecuted after the local council sent a 14 - year - old boy to buy a goldfish in a “ sting ” operation following reports that their shop , Majors Pets , had sold a gerbil to a teenager with learning difficulties .
The shopkeepers sold the fish without asking his age or how the fish would be cared for , prosecutors said .
“ I think it ’s a farce and legal lunacy and I told the council that , ” said Mark Higgins , cited by the Daily Telegraph , noting that his mother was also given an electronic tag .
“ What gets me so cross is that they put my Mum on a tag — she ’s nearly 70 , for goodness sake …
You would think they have better things to do with their time and money , ” he said .
But Trafford Council in northern England defended the decision to prosecute , noting that the gerbil sold to the teenager with learning difficulties — who was also 14 — was put in a cup of coffee .

“ The evidence presented for this conviction clearly demonstrates that it is irresponsible to sell animals to those who are not old enough to look after them , ” said Iain Veitch , the council ’s head of public protection .
Higgins and her son pleaded guilty at Trafford Magistrates ’
Court to selling an animal to a person aged under 16 .
She was ordered to obey a curfew from 6:00 pm to 7:00 am for seven weeks because she is unfit for community service .
Her son , who manages the shop , was fined 750 pounds ( 1,100 dollars ) and ordered to carry out 120 hours of unpaid community work at the end of eight months of legal action Tuesday .

The story was highlighted by a number of British newspapers Wednesday .
The Daily Express said it made a “ farce ” of Britain ’s legal system , adding in a front - page headline : “ Proof Britain really has gone mad . ”
Comic Description :
' Out of Tens ' A webcomic by Cory Rydell and Grey Carter .
Working for one of the biggest game review sites on the web should be fun , but as our intrepid heroine , Erin Stout quickly discovers , the life of a popular games journalist is not all it 's cracked up to be .
Caught between an absurdly corrupt boss and a savagely opinionated readership , Erin soon finds herself forced to choose between her journalistic principles and her desire to not live in a cardboard box .
She also occasionally plays video games
While chomping on some Honey Bunches of Oats , it occurred to me that they 've taken that beehive - shaped wooden Honey - Stick Thing and actually made it their mascot .
I love how proudly it 's featured on the box .
If Honey Bunches of Oats was a TV show , it would definitely be starring the honey thing .
It did n't take much looking to see what a nice career this utensil has carved out for itself .
Over the years the honey - stick thing has appeared in a long - running series of boxes with fellow cereal star , the Honey Nut Cheerios bee .
The honey thing can also be seen co-starring ( and drizzling ) with Dig ' Em the Frog in the big - budget buddy comedy , " Honey Smacks . "
The stick even scored a guest - starring role in the critically acclaimed cruncher , " Golden Grahams . "
Despite working with industry heavy - weights , it is certainly not beneath the Honey - stick to slum it for a quick check .
Here he can be seen in the straight - to - video cereal equivalent " Honey Bumpers " as well as playing an embarrassing dual - role in the breakfast aisle flop , " Mighty Bites . "
You have done well for yourself , little wooden honey thing .
I suspect you have a kick - ass publicist , since NOBODY ACTUALLY USES YOU .
If I were that cute bear - shaped squeeze bottle of honey in my kitchen , I 'd be on the phone with my agent right now , tearing him a new one .

I stumbled across this quote from Mary Shaw .
Less than 10 % of the code has to do with the ostensible purpose of the system ; the rest deals with input - output , data validation , data structure maintenance , and other housekeeping .
I do n’t know the context of her quote , but she could be talking about any software project .
When I began working as a professional programmer , I was surprised that I spent most of my time on work that was n’t directly related to what I wanted to accomplish .
Computer science classes and writing software for my own research had not prepared me for this .
I kept thinking that as I got more experience , the proportion of my effort going directly toward what I wanted to accomplish would increase .
It did , but very slowly , and never by very much .
Only later did the reason occur to me : the vast majority of the work that needs to be done is n’t directly related to the purpose of the project .
People who know a little bit about programming can make difficult clients because they can imagine how they might write the core 10 % ( or maybe core 2 % ) of a large project .
Every once in a while someone will claim to have a solution that will change things .
They ’re selling a framework , a language , etc. that will radically change things .
The sales pitch is “ You spend most of your time doing low - level stuff .
Use my product and your programmers can focus on the value - added part and not do so much plumbing . ”
But plumbing is value - added work .
( Call it “ infrastructure ” if you like ; that sounds more important . )
Sometimes plumbing work becomes repetitive and can be reduced by reusing code , but there ’s always new plumbing to work on .
Most of the work to be done is invisible and I do n’t foresee this changing any time soon .
Update : See this list of non-functional requirements by Mike Griffiths .
This list gives some specific examples of where development effort goes , things that must be done but are not obvious until you mention them .
WASHINGTON , April 24 ( Reuters ) - Argentina said on Saturday it was better off free from the shackles of the International Monetary Fund , which it blames for contributing to its $ 100 billion debt default nearly a decade ago .
In a statement to the IMF ’s steering committee , Argentina said “ we can proudly celebrate that we have cemented our economic independence as never before in our recent history . ”
The South American country has a fraught relationship with the IMF , stemming from what it sees as the Fund ’s mismanagement of its 2001 - 2002 debt crisis .
Argentina is now trying to restructure more than $ 6 billion in defaulted debt with creditor nations , and the IMF said on Thursday it hoped to schedule a long - delayed economic review .
[ ID : nN22135552 ]
Argentina said it had learned “ harsh lessons ” from its earlier crisis and its economy was faring better because it was not obliged to follow IMF guidance .
The IMF conducts general Article IV reviews with all of its 186 member countries as part of its monitoring of the global economy , but loan programmes come with strict conditions attached .
“ If we had followed the recommendations traditionally made by ( the IMF ) -- which have favored opening our economies , foreign indebtedness , financial liberalization and ‘ unbeatable ’ market - oriented reforms -- the outcome would have been totally different and today we would have been embroiled in a fresh economic , social and political crisis , ” the statement said .
“ Therefore , we celebrate today our well - gained economic independence . ”
The country also said it expects 2010 economic growth in the range of 3.5 percent to 5 percent , “ tilted to the upside . ”
The IMF ’s own forecast is for growth of 3.5 percent , and it pointed out in its World Economic Outlook that private analysts think Argentina ’s growth has been lower than the official reports since the last quarter of 2008 .
( Reporting by Emily Kaiser ; editing by Patrick Graham )
( CNN ) -- The U.S. Coast Guard launched a major search effort Wednesday for 11 people missing after a " catastrophic " explosion aboard an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico engulfed the drilling platform in flames .
Another 17 people were injured -- three critically -- in the blast aboard the Deepwater Horizon , which occurred about 10 p.m. Tuesday .
The rig was about 52 miles southeast of Venice , Louisiana , said Coast Guard Senior Chief Petty Officer Mike O'Berry .
As of late afternoon Wednesday as many as six firefighting vessels were working to contain the massive fire caused by the explosion .
" It obviously was a catastrophic event , " O'Berry said .
An investigation into the cause of the blast is under way , but there are no indications it was a terrorist incident , the Coast Guard said .
The Coast Guard dispatched helicopters from New Orleans , Louisiana , and Mobile , Alabama , to help evacuate workers from the rig and search for the missing .
It also sent four cutters to the scene .
Coast Guard Rear Adm .
Mary Landry said search and rescue crews in the air and sea were prepared to search through the night for the missing workers using infrared devices .
It was not known whether the workers were able to make it to one of the rig 's lifeboats -- fully enclosed , fire - resistant vessels designed to evacuate people quickly .
Officials said 126 people were on board at the time of the explosion .
Of the 115 accounted - for workers , 17 injured were evacuated by helicopter from the rig .
Another 94 people were taken to shore with no major injuries , and four more were transferred to another vessel , according to the Coast Guard .
Several people were hospitalized , including at least two who were taken to a mobile trauma center .
Six people were taken to the University of South Alabama Medical Center in Mobile , according to spokesman Bob Lowry .
Five were treated and released , and one was admitted to the facility 's burn center , Lowry said .
Four people were taken to West Jefferson Medical Center in the New Orleans suburb of Marrero .
Two were taken by ground at 3:20 a.m. , and two were flown in at 5:45 a.m. , said hospital spokeswoman Taslin Alfonzo .
All four were treated and had been released by 11:15 a.m. , she said .
Adrian Rose , a vice president for Transocean Ltd. , the company that owns the rig , said Wednesday that " we are deeply saddened by this event .
Our thoughts and prayers are with the crew members of the Deepwater Horizon and their families . "
Transocean 's website describes the company as the " world 's largest offshore drilling contractor and the leading provider of drilling management services worldwide " with 140 offshore drilling units .
The rig involved in the explosion -- a mobile unit that moves to different locations in the Gulf of Mexico -- had been drilling for oil in its current location since January , said Eileen Angelico , a spokeswoman for Minerals Management Service , the agency that regulates the oil industry in federal waters .
The rig had undergone at least three safety inspections since January , according to Deputy Secretary of the Interior David Hayes .
Before the blast , there was " no indication of any problems " as crew members carried out routine work around the drill site , Rose said .
He said the vessel did n't appear to be in danger of capsizing after the blast , though it was listing up to 10 degrees by Tuesday evening as fire damaged the rig and water from the firefighting vessels added weight .
Seven major oil spill response vessels were being dispatched to the scene to help prevent any polluting of the waters in the vicinity .
" If there is any pollution , we believe it is minor pollution because most of the oil and gas is burning , " said David Rainey , a vice president for BP .
But he warned the situation could change once the fire is contained .
However as of Tuesday afternoon , there was only a moderate sheen in the water and not a large spill , Landry said .
Photos and videos released by the Coast Guard showed workers being evacuated from the scene by helicopter and a massive plume of smoke reaching hundreds of feet into the air as vessels poured water on to the burning rig .
Fires on oil rigs are rare because engineers design them with safety in mind , said Greg McCormack , director of the Petroleum Extension Service for the University of Texas .
" They 've built safety into the rigs .
They 've built safety into the operations , because they know that if you have a fire on an isolated rig that 's out in the Gulf , you have a real issue , " McCormack said Wednesday .
Velshi : Rigs are some of the safest places
Even with lifeboats on hand , evacuating rigs is difficult , he said , and emergency crews can be delayed .
" The worst thing that can happen on an oil rig is you have a fire , and then you have to evacuate without the fire being put out , because then it can only get worse , " McCormack said .
The Minerals Management Service said 39 fires or explosions were reported offshore in the Gulf of Mexico in the first five months of 2009 , the latest period for which statistics are available .
The agency categorized all of those incidents as " minor " or " incidental . "
According to the Minerals Management Service , there are 90 active rigs working in U.S. waters in the Gulf of Mexico .
The agency puts the level of oil production in the Gulf at 1.7 million barrels per day and 6.6 billion cubic feet of gas per day as of October 2009 .
Recently by Ron Paul : Bizarre Spending Habits
Since my 2008 campaign for the presidency I have often been asked ,  How would a constitutionalist president go about dismantling the welfare - warfare state and restoring a constitutional republic ?
This is a very important question , because without a clear road map and set of priorities , such a president runs the risk of having his pro-freedom agenda stymied by the various vested interests that benefit from big government .
Of course , just as the welfare - warfare state was not constructed in 100 days , it could not be dismantled in the first 100 days of any presidency .
While our goal is to reduce the size of the state as quickly as possible , we should always make sure our immediate proposals minimize social disruption and human suffering .
Thus , we should not seek to abolish the social safety net overnight because that would harm those who have grown dependent on government - provided welfare .
Instead , we would want to give individuals who have come to rely on the state time to prepare for the day when responsibility for providing aide is returned to those organizations best able to administer compassionate and effective help — churches and private charities .
Now , this need for a transition period does not apply to all types of welfare .
For example , I would have no problem defunding corporate welfare programs , such as the Export - Import Bank or the TARP bank bailouts , right away .
I find it difficult to muster much sympathy for the CEO ’s of Lockheed Martin and Goldman Sachs .
No matter what the president wants to do , most major changes in government programs would require legislation to be passed by Congress .
Obviously , the election of a constitutionalist president would signal that our ideas had been accepted by a majority of the American public and would probably lead to the election of several pro-freedom congressmen and senators .
Furthermore , some senators and representatives would become born again constitutionalists out of a sense of self - preservation .
Yet there would still be a fair number of politicians who would try to obstruct our freedom agenda .
Thus , even if a president wanted to eliminate every unconstitutional program in one fell swoop , he would be very unlikely to obtain the necessary support in Congress .
Yet a pro-freedom president and his legislative allies could make tremendous progress simply by changing the terms of the negotiations that go on in Washington regarding the size and scope of government .
Today , negotiations over legislation tend to occur between those who want a 100 percent increase in federal spending and those who want a 50 percent increase .
Their compromise is a 75 percent increase .
With a president serious about following the Constitution , backed by a substantial block of sympathetic representatives in Congress , negotiations on outlays would be between those who want to keep funding the government programs and those who want to eliminate them outright — thus a compromise would be a 50 percent decrease in spending !

While a president who strictly adheres to the Constitution would need the consent of Congress for very large changes in the size of government , such as shutting down cabinet departments , he could use his constitutional authority as head of the executive branch and as commander in chief to take several significant steps toward liberty on his own .
The area where the modern chief executive has greatest ability to act unilaterally is in foreign affairs .
Unfortunately , Congress has abdicated its constitutional authority to declare wars , instead passing vague authorization of force bills that allow the president to send any number of troops to almost any part of the world .
The legislature does not even effectively use its power of the purse to rein in the executive .
Instead , Congress serves as little more than a rubber stamp for the president ’s requests .
If the president has the power to order U.S. forces into combat on nothing more than his own say - so , then it stands to reason he can order troops home .
Therefore , on the first day in office , a constitutionalist can begin the orderly withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq and Afghanistan .
He can also begin withdrawing troops from other areas of the world .
The United States has over 300,000 troops stationed in more than 146 countries .
Most if not all of these deployments bear little or no relationship to preserving the safety of the American people .
For example , over 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall , the U.S. still maintains troops in Germany .
Domestically , the president can use his authority to set policies and procedures for the federal bureaucracy to restore respect for the Constitution and individual liberty .
For example , today manufacturers of dietary supplements are subject to prosecution by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) or Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) if they make even truthful statements about the health benefits of their products without going through the costly and time - consuming procedures required to gain government approval for their claims .
A president can put an end to this simply by ordering the FDA and FTC not to pursue these types of cases unless they have clear evidence that the manufacturer ’s clams are not true .
Similarly , the president could order the bureaucracy to stop prosecuting consumers who wish to sell raw milk across state lines .
A crucial policy that a president could enact to bring speedy improvements to government is ordering the bureaucracy to respect the 10th Amendment and refrain from undermining state laws .
We have already seen a little renewed federalism with the current administration ’s policy of not prosecuting marijuana users when their use of the drug is consistent with state medical - marijuana laws .
A constitutionalist administration would also defer to state laws refusing compliance with the REAL ID act and denying federal authority over interstate gun transactions .
None of these actions repeals a federal law ; they all simply recognize a state ’s primary authority , as protected by the 10th amendment , to set policy in these areas .
The Revolution : A Mani ... Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.99 Buy New $ 6.99 ( as of 11:00 EST - Details )
In fact , none of the measures I have discussed so far involves repealing any written law .
They can be accomplished simply by a president exercising his legitimate authority to set priorities for the executive branch .
And another important step he can take toward restoring the balance of powers the Founders intended is repealing unconstitutional executive orders issued by his predecessors .
Executive orders are a useful management tool for the president , who must exercise control over the enormous federal bureaucracy .
However , in recent years executive orders have been used by presidents to create new federal laws without the consent of Congress .
As President Clinton ’s adviser Paul Begala infamously said , stroke of the pen , law of the land , pretty cool . 
No , it is not pretty cool ,  and a conscientious president could go a long way toward getting us back to the Constitution ’s division of powers by ordering his counsel or attorney general to comb through recent executive orders so the president can annul those that exceed the authority of his office .
If the President believed a particular Executive Order made a valid change in the law , then he should work with Congress to pass legislation making that change .
Only Congress can directly abolish government departments , but the president could use his managerial powers to shrink the federal bureaucracy by refusing to fill vacancies created by retirements or resignations .
This would dramatically reduce the number of federal officials wasting our money and taking our liberties .
One test to determine if a vacant job needs to be filled is the essential employees test .
Whenever D.C. has a severe snowstorm , the federal government orders all non-essential federal personal to stay home .
If someone is classified as non-essential for snow - day purposes , the country can probably survive if that position is not filled when the jobholder quits or retires .
A constitutionalist president should make every day in D.C. like a snow day !
A president could also enhance the liberties and security of the American people by ordering federal agencies to stop snooping on citizens when there is no evidence that those who are being spied on have committed a crime .
Instead , the president should order agencies to refocus on the legitimate responsibilities of the federal government , such as border security .
He should also order the Transportation Security Administration to stop strip - searching grandmothers and putting toddlers on the no-fly list .
The way to keep Americans safe is to focus on real threats and ensure that someone whose own father warns U.S. officials he ’s a potential terrorist is not allowed to board a Christmas Eve flight to Detroit with a one - way ticket .
Perhaps the most efficient step a president could take to enhance travel security is to remove the federal roadblocks that have frustrated attempts to arm pilots .
Congress created provisions to do just that in response to the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
However , the processes for getting a federal firearms license are extremely cumbersome , and as a result very few pilots have gotten their licenses .
A constitutionalist in the Oval Office would want to revise those regulations to make it as easy as possible for pilots to get approval to carry firearms on their planes .
While the president can do a great deal on his own , to really restore the Constitution and cut back on the vast unconstitutional programs that have sunk roots in Washington over 60 years , he will have to work with Congress .
The first step in enacting a pro-freedom legislative agenda is the submission of a budget that outlines the priorities of the administration .
While it has no legal effect , the budget serves as a guideline for the congressional appropriations process .
A constitutionalist president ’s budget should do the following :
Reduce overall federal spending Prioritize cuts in oversize expenditures , especially the military Prioritize cuts in corporate welfare Use 50 percent of the savings from cuts in overseas spending to shore up entitlement programs for those who are dependent on them and the other 50 percent to pay down the debt Provide for reduction in federal bureaucracy and lay out a plan to return responsibility for education to the states Begin transitioning entitlement programs from a system where all Americans are forced to participate into one where taxpayers can opt out of the programs and make their own provisions for retirement and medical care
A Foreign Policy of Fr... Paul , Ron Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 8.85 ( as of 06:20 EST - Details )
If Congress failed to produce a budget that was balanced and moved the country in a pro-liberty direction , a constitutionalist president should veto the bill .
Of course , vetoing the budget risks a government shutdown .
But a serious constitutionalist cannot be deterred by cries of it ’s irresponsible to shut down the government !
Instead , he should simply say ,  I offered a reasonable compromise , which was to gradually reduce spending , and Congress rejected it , instead choosing the extreme path of continuing to jeopardize America ’s freedom and prosperity by refusing to tame the welfare - warfare state .
I am the moderate ; those who believe that America can afford this bloated government are the extremists . 
Unconstitutional government spending , after all , is doubly an evil : it not only means picking the taxpayer ’s pocket , it also means subverting the system of limited and divided government that the Founders created .
Just look at how federal spending has corrupted American education .
Eliminating federal involvement in K — 12 education should be among a constitutionalist president ’s top domestic priorities .
The Constitution makes no provision for federal meddling in education .
It is hard to think of a function less suited to a centralized , bureaucratic approach than education .
The very idea that a group of legislators and bureaucrats in D.C. can design a curriculum capable of meeting the needs of every American schoolchild is ludicrous .
The deteriorating performance of our schools as federal control over the classroom has grown shows the folly of giving Washington more power over American education .
President Bush ’s No Child Left Behind law claimed it would fix education by making public schools accountable .
However , supporters of the law failed to realize that making schools more accountable to federal agencies , instead of to parents , was just perpetuating the problem .
In the years since No Child Left Behind was passed , I do n’t think I have talked to any parent or teacher who is happy with the law .
Therefore , a constitutionalist president looking for ways to improve the lives of children should demand that Congress cut the federal education bureaucracy as a down payment on eventually returning 100 percent of the education dollar to parents .
Traditionally , the battle to reduce the federal role in education has been the toughest one faced by limited - government advocates , as supporters of centralized education have managed to paint constitutionalists as anti-education . 
But who is really anti-education ?
Those who wish to continue to waste taxpayer money on failed national schemes , or those who want to restore control over education to the local level ?
When the debate is framed this way , I have no doubt the side of liberty will win .
When you think about it , the argument that the federal government needs to control education is incredibly insulting to the American people , for it implies that the people are too stupid or uncaring to educate their children properly .
Contrary to those who believe that only the federal government can ensure children ’s education , I predict a renaissance in education when parents are put back in charge .
The classroom is not the only place the federal government does not belong .
We also need to reverse the nationalization of local police .
Federal grants have encouraged the militarization of law enforcement , which has led to great damage to civil liberties .
Like education , law enforcement is inherently a local function , and ending programs such as the Byrne Grants is essential not just to reducing federal spending but also to restoring Americans ’ rights .
Pillars of Prosperity : ... Ron Paul Best Price : $ 4.87 Buy New $ 7.63 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
Obviously , a president concerned with restoring constitutional government and fiscal responsibility would need to address the unstable entitlement situation , possibly the one area of government activity even more difficult to address than education .
Yet it is simply unfair to continue to force young people to participate in a compulsory retirement program when they could do a much better job of preparing for their own retirements .
What is more , the government cannot afford the long - term expenses of entitlements , even if we were to reduce all other unconstitutional foreign and domestic programs .
As I mentioned in the introduction to this article , it would be wrong simply to cut these programs and throw those who are dependent on them into the streets .
After all , the current recipients of these programs have come to rely on them , and many are in a situation where they cannot provide for themselves without government assistance .
The thought of people losing the ability to obtain necessities for them because they were misled into depending on a government safety net that has been yanked away from them should trouble all of us .
However , the simple fact is that if the government does not stop spending money on welfare and warfare , America may soon face an economic crisis that could lead to people being thrown into the street .
Therefore , a transition away from the existing entitlement scheme is needed .
This is why a constitutionalist president should propose devoting half of the savings from the cuts in wars and other foreign spending , corporate welfare , and unnecessary and unconstitutional bureaucracies to shoring up Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid and providing enough money to finance government ’s obligations to those who are already stuck in the system and cannot make alternative provisions .
This re-routing of spending would allow payroll taxes to be slashed .
The eventual goal would be to move to a completely voluntary system where people only pay payroll taxes into Social Security and Medicare if they choose to participate in those programs .
Americans who do not want to participate would be free not to do so , but they would forgo any claim to Social Security or Medicare benefits after retirement .
Some people raise concerns that talk of transitions is an excuse for indefinitely putting off the end of the welfare state .
I understand those concerns , which is why a transition plan must lay out a clear timetable for paying down the debt , eliminating unconstitutional bureaucracies , and setting a firm date for when young people can at last opt out of the entitlement programs .
A final area that should be front and center in a constitutionalist ’s agenda is monetary policy .
The Founders obviously did not intend for the president to have much influence over the nation ’s money — in fact , they never intended any part of the federal government to operate monetary policy as it defined now .
However , today a president could play an important role in restoring stability to monetary policy and the value of the dollar .
To start , by fighting for serious reductions in spending , a constitutionalist administration would remove one of the major justifications for the Federal Reserve ’s inflationary policies , the need to monetize government debt .
There are additional steps a pro-freedom president should pursue in his first term to restore sound monetary policy .
He should ask Congress to pass two pieces of legislation I have introduced in the 110th Congress .
The first is the Audit the Fed bill , which would allow the American people to learn just how the Federal Reserve has been conducting monetary policy .
The other is the Free Competition in Currency Act , which repeals legal tender laws and all taxes on gold and silver .
This would introduce competition in currency and put a check on the Federal Reserve by ensuring that people have alternatives to government - produced fiat money .
All of these measures will take a lot of work — a lot more than any one person , even the president of the United States , can accomplish by himself .
In order to restore the country to the kind of government the Founders meant for us to have , a constitutionalist president would need the support of an active liberty movement .
Freedom activists must be ready to pressure wavering legislators to stand up to the special interests and stay the course toward freedom .
Thus , when the day comes when someone who shares our beliefs sits in the Oval Office , groups like Young Americans for Liberty and Campaign for Liberty will still have a vital role to play .
No matter how many pro-freedom politicians we elect to office , the only way to guarantee constitutional government is through an educated and activist public devoted to the ideals of the liberty .
For that reason , the work of Young Americans for Liberty in introducing young people to the freedom philosophy and getting them involved in the freedom movement is vital to the future of our country .
I thank all the members and supporters of YAL for their dedication to changing the political debate in this country , so that in the not - too - distant future we actually will have a president and a Congress debating the best ways to shrink the welfare - warfare state and restore the republic .

The Best of Ron Paul
By Phillip S. Smith , Drug War Chronicle
Alternet – April 6 , 2010
There is a chance , albeit an outside one , that the entire West Coast could go green in November .
Last week we noted that the California tax and regulate initiative had made the ballot , and reported on the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act initiative ’s ongoing effort to make the ballot .
This week , we turn our attention to Washington state , where yet another marijuana legalization initiative campaign is underway .
Sponsored by Seattle Hempfest head Vivian McPeak , marijuana defense attorneys Douglass Hiatt and Jeffrey Steinborn , and journalist - turned - activist Philip Dawdy and organized under the rubric of Sensible Washington , initiative I -1068 would legalize marijuana by removing marijuana offenses from the state ’s controlled substances act .
As the official ballot summary puts it :
“ This measure would remove state civil and criminal penalties for persons eighteen years or older who cultivate , possess , transport , sell , or use marijuana .
Marijuana would no longer be defined as a ‘ controlled substance . ’
Civil and criminal penalties relating to drug paraphernalia and provisions authorizing seizure or forfeiture of property would not apply to marijuana - related offenses committed by persons eighteen years or older .
The measure would retain current restrictions and penalties applicable to persons under eighteen . ”
“ We ’ve had to go this route because the legislature is n’t getting the job done , ” said Dawdy .
“ We had a decriminalization bill and a tax and regulate bill , and neither one could even get through committee .
We ’ve basically hit a brick wall in Olympia , and as activists , we ’re tired of waiting .
The state is spending way too much on arresting , prosecuting , and sometimes jailing people for marijuana crimes .
We have 12,000 people arrested for marijuana offenses every year .
It ’s got to stop .
If the legislature ca n’t get it done , we have the initiative process . ”
The initiative campaign needs to gather 241,000 valid signatures by July 2 .
According to the campaign , they are shooting for 350,000 signatures and are about 20 % of the way toward their goal .
So far , it ’s an all - volunteer effort .
“ We ’ve been battling the weather , which has been horrible , and that makes it really difficult to work outdoor events , ” said Dawdy .
“ You ca n’t gather very many signatures when it ’s raining .
But we are starting to get inundated with signature petitions , and we remain confident we can get enough to make the ballot . ”
The campaign is finding support in some unusual places , Dawdy said .
“ The issue is really popular here , and one of our best hits was at a gun show .
Libertarians and conservative Democrats go to those things .
We ’re probably going to have a gun show coordinator for western Washington , and try to target those events .
And we can use retired police officers instead of stinky hippies . ”
There are no signs yet of any organized opposition , but Dawdy said that was no surprise .
“ I would have been surprised if any popped up this early .
I would n’t expect it until we make the ballot , and then there will probably be some law enforcement group showing up to float the gateway theory and all that stuff . ”
“ We ’re doing this on a shoestring , ” Dawdy explained .
“ We ’re getting online donations , a few in - kind donations , a few thousand - dollar checks , but funding from the national organizations has n’t really gelled yet .
But the medical marijuana campaign in 1998 did n’t get any big money until May , and they got on the ballot and one .
I think we can do the same thing . ”
Unlike California and , to a lesser degree , Oregon , there is little money to be had from the Washington medical marijuana community , Dawdy said .
“ It is n’t like California here , ” he said .
“ There are no $ 70 eighths , it ’s very much a nonprofit kind of system .
What profits there are are small and underground , and they ’re underground for a reason . ”
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) executive director Allen St. Pierre said that the national NORML board of directors had endorsed the initiative and that local chapters were involved in the effort , but that NORML would n’t do much more than that until — and unless — the initiative makes the ballot , something St. Pierre suggested he doubted would happen .
“ I ’m very skeptical about their prospects , ” he said .
“ These guys said from the beginning they did n’t have any money , and no initiatives not funded by billionaires have actually made it , yet they still decided to move forward .
I told them NORML ca n’t do much until they get on the ballot — it ’s not worth the time and effort to point people towards initiatives that have n’t made the ballot . ”
“ We ’re getting sick and tired of being written off by people 3,000 miles away , ” retorted Dawdy .
“ That ’s just not fair , and it suggests that they do n’t really know Washington state despite coming out for three days each summer for Hempfest .
People here are sick and tired of the situation , and legalization and reform are issues that poll strongly .
People back
East do n’t appreciate this and they do n’t understand this is one of the few issues where you can actually make the ballot with an all - volunteer effort . ”
That ’s not the only flak the initiative campaign is getting .
One of the leading drug reform groups in the state , the ACLU of Washington has refused to endorse the initiative on the grounds that it does not include a regulatory system for marijuana .
In a February statement , the Washington ACLU ’s lead person on drug policy , Allison Holcomb , laid out its arguments :
“ The ACLU supports marijuana legalization and will continue to work toward that goal .
However , we will not be supporting I - 1068 because it does not provide a responsible regulatory system . ”
“ We believe that full marijuana legalization will be accomplished only through implementation of a controlled regulatory system .
Marijuana should be placed under controls that not only remove criminal penalties for adult marijuana use but also address the public ’s concerns about health and safety .
It is unrealistic to regulate it less than tobacco or alcohol . ”
“ We ’re aware that some believe that I - 1068 ’s passage would force the legislature to adopt such regulations in 2011 . ”
“ However , the ACLU is n’t willing to support an incomplete initiative in hopes that the Legislature will fix it .
We believe that when seeking support of such an important and complicated issue , the public should be presented with a carefully considered and well - vetted proposal . ”
But the initiative campaign argues that Washington ’s stringent single - issue rule for initiatives blocks it from concocting an elaborate regulatory scheme .
Passage of the initiative would force the legislature to then enact regulations , they said .
“ All our initiative does is remove criminal penalties for adult use , possession , and cultivation , ” Dawdy explained .
“ That will put it back in the hands of the legislature to come up with sensible civil regulations .
We would have loved to do regulations in the initiative , but the single issue rule on initiatives in our state is very strict . ”
The Washington ACLU also argued that support for legalization is less than solid and that a defeat at the polls would be “ a significant setback ” for the drug reform movement .
And so things stand as April begins .
Initiative campaigners have about 90 days to gather the requisite signatures and make the ballot .
Maybe then they ’ll begin to get some respect .
And maybe then they can join California , and hopefully , Oregon , in turning the West Coast green .

Emergency Room Myths
The overutilization of emergency rooms is often cited as a dangerous symptom of America ’s broken healthcare system .
But a new Slate article from Zachary Meisel and Jesse Pines offers a rosier picture of emergency room usage , and dispels several pervasive myths .
They write that E.R. care represents less than 3 percent of healthcare spending , only 12 percent of E.R. visits are non-urgent , and the majority of E.R. patients are insured U.S. citizens , not uninsured , illegal immigrants .
Meisel and Pines also point out that E.R. visits do n’t necessarily cost more than primary care visits : “ In fact , the marginal cost of treating less acute patients in the ER is lower than paying off - hours primary care doctors , as ERs are already open 24/7 to handle life - threatening emergencies . ”
Ultimately , Meisel and Pines believe that emergency rooms are functioning as they ’re supposed to , as “ an always - available resource to alleviate pain , make sure your baby is not truly ill , and patch you up after a nasty fall is vital , even if it turns out that your condition was n’t as serious as you feared . ” [ % comments ]
Gerrit : Google - style code review meets git

Gerrit , a Git - based system for managing code review , is helping to spread the popular distributed revision control system into Android - using companies , many of which have heavy quality assurance , management , and legal processes around software .
HTC , Qualcomm , TI , Sony Ericsson , and Android originator Google are all running Gerrit , project leader Shawn Pearce said in a talk at the October 2009 GitTogether event , hosted at Google in Mountain View .
The Gerrit story starts with the progressive escape of an in - house Google process and tool .
Google requires code review for any change to company code or configuration files ; there are a few exceptions , but those are subject to review after deployment .
The code review process started out using lots of email , but for the past several years it has been automated .
When Guido van Rossum , creator of the Python language , began working at Google in 2005 , he started developing a tool , in Python naturally , to coordinate code reviews .
The result , called Mondrian , lets users view the proposed change as a side - by - side comparison , and participate in comment threads attached anywhere in the code under review .
An overview page shows a to - do list of incoming changes to review and reviewers ' comments .
Van Rossum presented Mondrian at a public talk in 2006 .
( video ) .
Mondrian has been a huge success inside Google , Pearce said .
" Almost every engineer uses this as their daily thing . "
But Mondrian is heavily dependent on Google 's internal infrastructure , including the in -house Bigtable non-relational table store and the proprietary Perforce revision control system .
Google is a huge Perforce shop , and has built its own highly - customized IT infrastructure , including Perforce - dependent tools .
The first step in making a Mondrian - style tool available to a wider audience was van Rossum 's 2008 release of Rietveld , which uses Subversion instead of Perforce , and the public interfaces of Google App Engine instead of Google internals .
It 's named for modern architect Gerrit Rietveld .
As Google began the Android project , though , developers demanded a Mondrian - like tool for their codebase , tracked with Git. Google App Engine was a deal - breaker , because mobile hardware vendors working on Android - based products maintain internal repositories , and wo n't rely on an outside service .
Shawn Pearce , who previously reimplemented git in Java as JGit , and is now at Google , took on the project ; the result is Gerrit Code Review , now used to track public proposed changes to Android .
Android 's applications are written in Java , so writing the new tool in that language should make it more accessible to would - be contributors among Android developers .
Gerrit runs a copy of the Mina SSH daemon , along with JGit , which is now maintained as part of the Eclipse EGit project .
Although the combination is slower than original git over OpenSSH , it 's fast enough for the Android developers .
" The entire Android team uses this as their interface to Git , " Pearce said .
The server - side dependencies are Tomcat and an SQL database , which so far can be either MySQL , PostgreSQL , or H2 .
Gerrit uses OpenID for authentication by default , but can be configured to use HTTP basic ( or digest ) authentication , or Siteminder , a single - sign - on system from Computer Associates .
On the UI side , Gerrit uses Google Web Toolkit , an Apache - licensed project that compiles Java to JavaScript with AJAX functionality .
The UI has a few tiny Flash widgets for convenience , - to copy Git command lines to the clipboard , for example - but Flash is not required .
A user who prefers not to use the web interface can also ssh to the Gerrit server to execute commands .
Gerrit does n't enforce any particular processes to make git look more like the centralized revision control systems that spawned Mondrian and Rietveld .
A Gerrit -using developer has a full git install and can still do distributed revision control tricks , such as cherry - picking from a newer upstream release .
Gerrit just guards access to its own repository .
A developer can set up a git repository with " origin " pointing back to an ssh:// URL on the Gerrit server , and do something like centralized development , or do " drive - by " interactions with a Gerrit server like any other Git repository .
To propose a change for approval through Gerrit , a developer must start a branch in git for that change .
Each change , and each iteration of a reworked change , becomes a new branch .
In order to preserve information among successive versions of the same work , Gerrit includes a git hook to apply a " Change - Id " line to commit messages .
After doing a git push to the Gerrit server , the developer can come back to the web dashboard and see the status of the pending change , then request a code review .
Alternatively , a wrapper called Repo lets the developer specify a reviewer on the command line when doing the push .
Once a reviewer is lined up , Gerrit starts sending email , giving both the URL for the Gerrit page and a git command line for the reviewer to pull the change .
On the change page , a reviewer can see the change side - by - side with the original or as a diff , and add review comments anywhere in the code along with a " cover sheet " message .
Approval has multiple levels , with configurable access to the range that a reviewer can apply .
Typically , an individual developer would be able to apply - 1 or +1 , which are " prefer you do n't submit this " and " I like it , " and some would have access to the - 2 " do not submit " and +2 " Approved " levels .
The web interface is not required - - a reviewer can ssh to the Gerrit server to approve or reject a change .
A rejected and reworked change with a proper " Change - Id " line preserves Gerrit metadata , and the reviewer can see his or her original comments and the submitter 's replies , join an existing comment thread on the previous , rejected version , or start new comment threads anywhere in the new version .
If the change is not accepted , the new version has to be a new branch .
Kernel developer David Brown , at the Qualcomm Innovation Center , uses Git and Gerrit with his team .
" The biggest complaint people have so far about Gerrit is people have to be constantly rebasing their changes , " he said .
However , the company has an extensive review process in order to make anything available under a free software license , and Gerrit streamlines the process of approving changes for the people who are authorized to check outgoing code .
" The biggest thing that 's changed since last year is Gerrit .
The second biggest thing that 's changed since last year is Gerrit , " Brown said .
But , he added , doing things the Gerrit way does work .
" Most people learn a really small subset of git , I mean a really really small subset of git , " he said .
Gerrit can be set up to automatically enforce some policies .
" There 's a lot of different work models people want , " Pearce said .
For example , Gerrit can be set up to enforce a check for a signed contributor agreement .
The public Gerrit instance for Android enforces the contributor agreement requirement for all modules except the kernel , where only a " Signed - off - by " line is required .
Gerrit can be integrated with a bug tracking system ( BTS ) , but the integration is still based on site - specific tricks , since everyone is on a different bug tracker and nobody seems to like theirs very much .
Besides better BTS integration , Pearce is looking at ways to store Gerrit metadata in git .
" We 'd like to do all the things that Gerrit does , offline , " he said .
" The fact that it does n't work offline is a bug . "
The Android developers are still figuring out how to connect with upstream .
Staging maintainer Greg Kroah - Hartman plans to drop Android drivers from drivers / staging as of 2.6.33 , as " no one wants to maintain them and help get them merged into the kernel , " he said in email .
Behind the apparent driver slowness are substantial corporate culture changes , though , with both Qualcomm and TI starting programs to manage outgoing code .
Qualcomm is the lead sponsor of Code Aurora Forum , and TI is behind OmapZoom.org .
In the potential minefield that is the mobile industry , with considerations such as not offending carrier partners , securely supporting third - party applications , deploying codecs and GUI code without patent troubles , and complying with radio regulations , Gerrit seems to be a needed focus for gatekeeping efforts .
*** Update ***: The ACLU of Mississippi has apologized to the American Humanist Association .
*** Update 2***:
There are some choice quotations from this whole debacle :
From the ACLU :
A staff person at the ACLU of Mississippi made an error in judgment in sending an e-mail to the American Humanist Association expressing concerns about accepting its donation and sponsorship offer .
To our understanding , MSSC has not made a decision regarding the acceptance of this funding and sponsorship offer .
The decision is up to MSSC .
The American Humanist Association has been made aware of the error , and the ACLU of Mississippi has expressed its apologies to the association for that error and the sentiments expressed in the e-mail .
The sentiments expressed by the ACLU of Mississippi staff person in the referenced e-mail do not reflect the views of the ACLU of Mississippi or the National ACLU in any way .
The ACLU remains a stalwart defender of freedom of belief and expression for all .
From the AHA :
“ We accept the apology , but we feel that an apology is owed not just to us but to the people of Mississippi , ” said David Niose , president of the American Humanist Association .
“ To suggest that the good people of Mississippi are so unenlightened that they ca n’t be accepting and welcoming to the goodwill of a humanist group is insulting to them , not just to us .
We are confident that our involvement would have been met with warmth and Southern hospitality . ”
From donor Todd Stiefel ‘s Facebook page :
Hooray !
The ACLU apologized to the AHA .
They should have also apologized for misleading people into thinking that the AHA was making unreasonable demands .
The AHA was not putting conditions on their donation , it was the ACLU that was putting a condition on accepting it .
ACLU would only accept it if they could hide who the money came from , which would mean AHA would have to hide the gift from their members .
They should also apologize to the people of Mississippi and Southern Baptists for insinuating they are intolerant bigots .
The best news is that it looks like Constance and her school will get an amazing “ Second Chance Prom . ”
Hopefully , the AHA will be one of the sponsors .
From the Secular Coalition for America :
The Secular Coalition for America has repeatedly lobbied the Obama administration for safe schools legislation that includes gay students as well as nonbelieving students .
The behavior of this local school underscores the clear need for schools that are safe and welcoming environments for gay students and nonbelievers as well .
More broadly , the notion that a civil liberties organization would themselves ‘ tremble ’ to associate with a positive , humanitarian group like the AHA , simply because they are nonbelievers , makes clear the necessity of the work of the Secular Coalition for America as it advocates for federal law that increases the visibility and respect of the nonreligious in American society .
From the ACLU of Louisiana ( in an email written to members of the New Orleans Secular Humanist Association ( NOSHA ) ) :
Harry , Charlotte , and the rest of NOSHA : I ’m just reading the story in today ’s NY Times about the ACLU of Mississippi having rejected money from the American Humanist Association for a prom for Constance McMillen .
I ’m shocked , embarrassed , and appalled that any ACLU entity would turn down such a generous offer from good friends to help a client with a worthy cause .
This is not a reflection of the entire ACLU , certainly not the ACLU of Louisiana , and I want to assure you that we do not shy away from the word or the concept of “ atheism , ” or from our friends who support us in our work .
Please accept this as an apology on behalf of the ACLU of Louisiana for the actions of the ACLU of Mississippi , over which we have no control .
…
Remember the Mississippi high school that canceled prom because one of the students , Constance McMillen , wanted to attend with her girlfriend ( and wear a tux ) ?
Remember how atheist Todd Stiefel donated $ 20,000 to the American Humanist Association so that they could help hold an alternative prom that would be inclusive of GLBT students ?
Well , the ACLU is helping with the alternative prom , and they have a message for Stiefel and the AHA :
We do n’t want your money .
They ’re rejecting the gift .
You ’ll never believe why :
“ Although we support and understand organizations like yours , the majority of Mississippians tremble in terror at the word ‘ atheist , ’ ” Jennifer Carr , the fund - raiser for the A.C.L.U of Mississippi , wrote in an e-mail message to Roy Speckhardt , executive director of the humanist group .
… Regarding the A.C.L.U. move , Ms. Carr wrote to Mr. Speckhardt : “ Our staff has been talking a lot about your donation offer and have found ourselves in a bit of a conflict .
We have fears that your organization sponsoring the prom could stir up even more controversy . ” … Mr. Speckhardt said he was “ really shocked ” to hear the gift had been rejected .
“ We ’ve worked with the A.C.L.U. many times in the past , ” he said , “ so this really felt like a slap in the face to me . ” …
“ You ’d think they would have learned a lesson from the very case they ’ve been working on , ” [ Stiefel ] said .
“ The school board was trying to avoid a controversy by silencing a controversial minority , and now the A.C.L.U. is making the same mistake . ”
The Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition ( MSSC ) is organizing the alternative prom and they do n’t know why the ACLU is acting this way .
They could certainly use the donation .
According to Matthew Sheffield , a spokesman for the Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition , the organization arranging the event , the A.C.L.U. of Mississippi did not have authority to decline the gift .
“ We asked someone at the A.C.L.U. to assist us in handling all the donations , and that person told them we were not interested and that is not true , ” he said .
First of all , why is the ACLU shying away from atheists and the word “ atheist ” ?
The ACLU , of all groups , ought to be on our side in making that term acceptable .
There ’s no reason to reject it on account of potential controversy .
Of all the controversial issues here , that atheists want to help the situation is not the biggest one .
Secondly , there are a lot of distractions in this whole story , but ultimately , I hope Constance gets to attend prom .
A prom .
Her school ’s being ridiculous and that ’s just sad .
But I held the ACLU in far higher regard .
They ’ve really let me down with this one .
I give money to the national ACLU .
I do n’t want to have to think twice before renewing my membership next time .
What the Mississippi ACLU is doing may turn some progressives away from being members .
It ’s not too late to rectify the mistake , though .
The ACLU could accept Todd ’s donation on behalf of MSSC and throw in some of their own money as a way to make amends .
I ’m sure everyone would appreciate that — especially the kids brave enough to attend the alternative prom .

Booting into 64 - bit mode ( Snow Leopard )
Update : the install disk for the 2010 Mac Pro now defaults Mac OS X 10.6.4 to 64 - bit mode .
By default in 2009 , Snow Leopard boots into a 32 - bit kernel , an odd proposition for an OS claiming to be 64 - bit .
But Apple defaulted to a 32 - bit kernel for good reasons —
it keeps compatibility high with drivers and specialized software , which lowers hassles for users ;
it keeps bad press away .
Like bad breath , bad press makes a lasting first impression .
Microsoft halitosis ( also known as Windows ) turned off a lot of users .
( I think Microsoft should change the name , it ’s a perfect fit ! ) .
performance is still improved over Leopard .
Since page was written , over a year has passed —
Update !
The 2010 Mac Pro now boots the 64 - bit kernel by default .
Should you boot into the 64 - bit kernel ?
Tests of photographic applications show that the gains of booting with the 64 - bit kernel can be substantial , keeping in mind that a 30 % gain via hardware often costs several thousand dollars more .
Why not get a good chunk of that for about $ 25 ?
Your 64 - bit programs ( if any ) will run fine on a 32 - bit kernel , gaining the benefits of 64 - bit - ness .
But they wo n’t see full performance that way .
The reason not to boot into 64 - bit mode is compatibility with software drivers of various kinds .
Apple really can’t be faulted here , but you can make an intelligent choice for yourself .
You ’ll want to verify if your software has any issues in 64 - bit mode . ; one way is simply to try it .
Does your Mac have 64 - bit EFI firmware ?
PERMALINK
You Mac might be a few years old and have 32 - bit EFI firmware ( the code that runs to boot the Mac ) .
See this Apple tech note for which machines can boot the 64 - bit kernel
With 32 - bit firmware , you can not boot into 64 - bit kernel ; it ’s not possible .
To determine if your Mac has 32 - bit or 64 - bit firmware , copy / paste the following command shown in red into Terminal ( Terminal is found in the / Applications / Utilities folder ) :
llcMP :~ lloyd $ ioreg - l -p IODeviceTree | grep firmware - abi | | " firmware - abi " = <" EFI64 " >
As shown above , the firmware - abi has the value EFI64 , indicating that my Mac Pro is 64 - bit capable .
If it reads EFI32 , then your Mac can not be booted into a 64 - bit kernel .
A 64 - bit EFI is required to boot into K64 but is not always sufficient .
Some machines do have a 64 - bit EFI but are not able to boot into K64 ( the iMac7 , 1 falls into that category ) .

You can still run 64 - bit apps on a 32 - bit kernel !
PERMALINK
Even if you cannot or do not boot the Mac OS X Snow Leopard kernel into 64 - bit mode , you can run your 64 - bit apps as 64 - bit , and they can take advantage of all the memory in the machine .
This was / is possible even with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard .
The main problem being that there are only a handful of 64 - bit applications available as of September 2009 .
Uncheck the “ Open in 32 Bit Mode ” option .
Testing shows that doing so is highly beneficial , even on Mac OS X Leopard .
How to boot into 64 - bit mode PERMALINK
I recommend testing first , using the two - finger dance approach , below , because rebooting without it gets you right back into 32 - bit mode .
Some older Macs with 32 - bit firmware cannot boot into 64 - bit mode .
That ’s life .
The two - finger dance — wired keyboard only ( not wireless )
Hold down the ' 6 ' and ' 4 ' keys when the Mac starts up ( until the Apple log ) .
After starting up in 64 - bit mode , check About This Mac… , click More Info , then click on Software .
In 64 - bit mode there will be a “ yes ” next to “ 64 - bit Kernel and Extensions ” .
The configuration file approach for always booting into 64 - bit PERMALINK
Update : Apple has added a command line setting for enabling the 64 - bit kernel .
You can open a Terminal window and type :
sudo systemsetup - setkernelbootarchitecture x86_64
This is the method I use , because I can leave it set the way I want to ; having to hold down ' 6 ' and ' 4 ' keys at startup is absurd , it ’s ridiculous that Apple did not provide a system preference panel for this .
The change is shown in red below ( “ arch=x86_64 ” ) .
Use a plain - text editor , such as Text Wrangler .
Edit the file :
/ Library / Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist
Insert arch=x86_64 into the Kernel Flags field .
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?>
<!
DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-// Apple Computer //DTD PLIST 1.0//EN " " https://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd " > < plist version = " 1.0 " > < dict > < key > Kernel</key > < string>mach_kernel</string > < key > Kernel Flags </ key > < string > arch=x86_64 </ string > </dict > </ plist >
The PRAM method for always booting into 64 - bit mode PERMALINK
I ’m not a big fan of this method , because I ’d rather edit a text file than mess with non-volatile machine settings in the computer itself .
This method sets the PRAM ( parameter RAM ) to tell the machine to boot 64 - bi modet .
It ’s unclear what happens if this is done on a machine that is not 64 - bit capable , or if the com.apple .
Boot. plist method interacts with it ( which overrides which ? ) .
It forces the Mac to always try to boot into 64 bit mode ( assuming the boot volume contains a 64 bit kernel ) .
It can be undone by resetting the PRAM by booting up while holding down the < command > , < option > , ' P ' and ' R ' keys .
It does n't require changing any system files which might be updated or
modified by other parts of the OS .
I have not tested this method , you ’re on your own here .
Open a Terminal window and enter this command :
sudo nvram boot - args = " arch=x86_64 "
You should be able to reset things as follows :
sudo nvram boot - args= " "
Again , I have not tested this .
Sen . Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) added potential fuel for Democratic outrage over his block of a one - month extension of federal jobless aid earlier this week .
In a Tuesday phone interview with The Hill , Coburn said the Republican obstruction of $ 9 billion in extended unemployment benefits is n’t a big deal because it only affects “ a relatively small group of people . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The easiest thing in the world is to pass this bill unpaid for , but consider the millions of Americans whose financial futures would be damaged , versus the relatively small amount of people who will be affected by this delay , ” he said .
“ Now you tell me which vote takes the most courage .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
The number of Americans temporarily losing their unemployment benefits this week because of Coburn ’s block is around 212,000 .
The congressman also said he intends to block all future Senate spending bills that are n’t “ paid for ” by cutting from other spending programs .
He said he will “ absolutely ” object to any such bill .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The fact is that the country wants us to start making hard choices on spending , and if we canÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t do it on a $ 9 billion bill , then weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re certainly not going to be able to do it on our $ 1.6 trillion deficit , Ã¢â‚ ¬
Â  he said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The problems are so severe in our country , our debt is so severe and the impact is so great in the near and long term that itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s time for some of us to take a stand .
We may lose .
But weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re not going to give up on doing the tough things that Washington needs to do , and if that earns us consternation , so be it .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
ADVERTISEMENT
David Dayen of FireDogLake argues that Coburn ’s ultimatum is superfluous because that kind of financial balancing are already mandated by a measure Congress passed earlier this year requiring statutory paygo restrictions that must pair new spending with offsets .
“ Notice that Coburn only sees one possibility for offsets Ã¢â‚¬â€œ cuts to other spending .
Revenue increases never get a mention , ” he writes .
“ As for blocking other unfunded spending bills , I look forward to CoburnÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s principled stand against the war in Afghanistan . ”
Coburn has earned the nickname “ Dr. No ” for his record of blocking Democratic initiatives on Capitol Hill .
Sexually transmitted diseases , sometimes known as venereal diseases , are diseases that are transferred between people primarily as a result of sexual contact .
Some of these diseases can be treated or cured while others , such as human immunodeficiency virus , or HIV , are not curable and can lead to death .
Many , but not all , states have laws that criminalize the transmission of at least some types of STDs between people .
These laws , and the penalties imposed by them , differ significantly among states .
To learn about the laws surrounding transmitting an STD in your state , jump ahead to the section on state by state laws for transmitting an STD .
HIV and Other Sexually Transmitted Diseases
Criminal transmission of an STD crimes commonly encompass different types of diseases .
Though state laws differ , they typically include both HIV as well as other communicable or contagious sexually transmitted diseases .
Some state laws list the individual diseases covered by name , while others use more general language that includes any type of communicable or sexually transmitted disease .
Also , some states limit these crimes to the transmission of HIV , while others include HIV as one of the diseases covered by the law ; yet others provide for additional penalties if the transmitted disease is HIV .
Intentional or Reckless
You can be convicted of the criminal transmission of an STD only if you cause someone else to be infected intentionally , knowingly , or recklessly .
For example , if you have been diagnosed with an STD and later engage in sexual relations with someone else without telling that person you have the disease , you can be convicted of this crime if that person becomes infected .
However , if you are unknowingly infected with an STD , you can not be found guilty of this crime .
In order to convict you , a prosecutor must be able to show that you knew you had the disease and you intentionally exposed someone else to danger .
Alternately , a prosecutor can show that , while knowing you had the disease , you were indifferent to the risk of exposing someone else and engaged in contact that recklessly endangered the other person .
If someone knowingly and intentionally infected another to cause death , then attempted murder charges are a possibility .
Consent
Many states have laws that allow for people with an STD to knowingly engage in sexual contact without fear of prosecution if they tell the other person about the presence of the disease .
As long as the other person consents to the relationship , the person with the STD is not guilty of criminal transmission , even if the other person is eventually infected .
However , laws in other states do not allow for the informed consent exception , and it 's possible to be convicted of criminal transmission of an STD in these states even when the other person knows of the presence of the disease and consents to the sexual contact .
In practice , however , because prosecutors have discretion when choosing which cases to prosecute , they may choose not to bring charges in cases where adults knowingly consented to sexual relations .
Penalties
If you are convicted of knowingly transmitting an STD , you face a number of potentially very serious criminal penalties .
State laws categorize this crime as either a felony or misdemeanor offense , and the potential penalties differ significantly depending on the state where it occurs .
Regardless of the state , all criminal sentences involve the same potential types of penalties .
Jail or prison .
A misdemeanor conviction for transmission of an STD can result in a sentence of up to one year in jail , while a felony conviction has a maximum penalty of a year or more in prison .
Potential prison sentences for this crime differ significantly , and while some states impose a potential maximum sentence of up to one year in jail for the transmission of any STD , other states allow for as much as a life sentence in prison where a person knowingly transmits HIV .
A misdemeanor conviction for transmission of an STD can result in a sentence of up to one year in jail , while a felony conviction has a maximum penalty of a year or more in prison .
Potential prison sentences for this crime differ significantly , and while some states impose a potential maximum sentence of up to one year in jail for the transmission of any STD , other states allow for as much as a life sentence in prison where a person knowingly transmits HIV .
Fines .
You can also be fined if you are convicted of either a felony or misdemeanor transmission of an STD crime .
Misdemeanor fines are typically up to $ 1,000 .
Like jail sentences , however , state differences are extreme , with possible felony fines going as high as $ 50,000 .

Restitution .
Restitution payments can also be made a part of transmission of an STD sentence .
Restitution payments go towards any victims to compensate them for the losses they have incurred , and can differ widely among cases .
Restitution must be paid in addition to any fines imposed by the court .

Restitution must be paid in addition to any fines imposed by the court .
Probation .
In addition to , or instead of , a jail or prison sentence , courts can also sentence someone convicted of unlawful transmission of an STD to a probation term .
Probation usually lasts one to three years , though longer terms are possible .
Those on probation must comply with the court 's probation conditions .
These conditions can differ between cases , but commonly include regularly reporting to a probation officer , paying all required fines and restitution , submitting to random home searches , not breaking any more laws , and not leaving the jurisdiction without first obtaining permission from the probation officer or the court .

Sex offender registration .
Someone convicted of the criminal transmission of an STD will also have to sign up for the state 's sex offender registry .
Sex offender registration requirements differ by state , but someone on the sex offender registration list can remain there for 25 years or longer .
Registrants have a difficult if not impossible time obtaining housing and work -- in many ways , registration is the worst possible sentence .

The Orange Order in Ireland said it cannot welcome the Pope 's visit .
The Orange Order in Ireland has said it cannot welcome or agree with the visit of Pope Benedict XVI to Great Britain for " biblical reasons " .
Pope Benedict XVI is due to visit England , Wales and Scotland in September 2010 .
The Grand Orange Lodge called on UK citizens , especially its members , to demonstrate against the visit .
Sinn Fein have accused the Order of being " firmly in the camp of the far right " by its stance .
The trip , which does not include Northern Ireland , is the first official state visit by a Pontiff to the UK .
The Orange Order is a Protestant organisation which regards itself as defending civil and religious liberties of Protestants and seeks to uphold the rule and ascendancy of a Protestant monarch in the United Kingdom .
It is best known for its parades in Northern Ireland and many senior unionist politicians are members .
" We take this opportunity to call on all the people of our land to examine the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments , especially on the matter of eternal salvation , " the Order said in a statement .
" To see that the teaching of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church is at total variance with the Biblical message that salvation is by grace alone , through faith alone , in Christ alone .
" At the same time , we call on all members of the Loyal Orange Institution to refrain from any uncharitable acts or sentiments against our Roman Catholic fellow countrymen . "
The Order said it recognised the right of the Pope to visit his flock as it recognises the civil and religious rights of all .
' Far right '
But it continued , " anyone welcoming Pope Benedict is in danger of appearing to acknowledge his primacy and universal supremacy as Vicar of Christ on earth " .
Sinn Fein's Daithi McKay said that the Orange Order was simply an " anti-Catholic organisation " .
" They are now firmly in the camp of the British far right in organising opposition to this visit .
The mask has clearly slipped and the recent public relations efforts of the Order now lie in tatters , " he said .
" At a time when politicians and others are trying to put together a better way of dealing with contentious Orange parades this statement is extremely unhelpful . "
Grand Chaplain Reverend Alistair Smyth , a clergyman in County Down , said they did not want protests of a violent nature taking place .
He said the final decision was up to the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland and Grand Orange Lodge of England , but that leafletting and letter writing were possibilities .
He said that members might consider rallies outlining the differences between the Catholic Church and the principles of the Protestant reformation Orange Order members espouse .
He told RTE the Order 's statement was not sectarian , but he said members wanted to flag up the principles of the reformed faith .

INDUSTRY -RELEVANT CURRICULUM
I was able to apply the concepts learnt during an HR Audit in my organisation .
Choosing SMU - DE was one of the right choices of my life .
Aishwarya
MBA Student , HR Professional
The discovery means that the epitaph Harry Willis ' grief - stricken mother composed in 1918 will be inscribed on his headstone by the time a memorial service to commemorate the 94th anniversary of the battle in July takes place .
It will read simply : '' Beloved son of John and Janet Willis of Alberton , Victoria ' ' .
'' And that 's all it needs to say , '' said the soldier 's great - nephew Tim Whitford .
Mr Whitford - a former tank commander and a key figure in the push for an official search for the men - said he drove to tell his grandmother the news as soon as he received the phone call yesterday morning saying Harry had been identified .
" I am still speechless an hour later , '' Mr Whitford said .
'' You have all these defence mechanisms … in my heart , in my head I believed that it was him and that he was trying to help us find him , '' he said .
" But then you also try to set yourself up so that you wo n't be shattered if it did n't happen .
It hits you like a truck when it 's confirmed and that happened again this morning . "
Private Willis , a farm hand from Yarram , left his family of 14 siblings to join the 31st Battalion in 1915 .
Eleven months later , on June 19 , 1916 , he was dead , one of 1900 men who died and another 3100 who were injured or went missing in the bloodiest 24 hours in Australian military history .
That figure is equivalent to Australia 's combined casualties in the Boer , Korean and Vietnam wars .
The Diggers fell on that fateful June night on a slice of lush farmland just north of the tiny town of Fromelles .
It was their first battle in France .
Outnumbered two to one , the men were ordered to cross a 400 - metre patch of ground to reach the German lines - fields already covered by the bodies of English soldiers killed in a similar battle the year before .
A few made it through , only to be cut off , captured or killed as they tried desperately to return to the Allied trenches .
During the next few days , German forces dragged hundreds of bodies from the fields to avoid disease in the high summer and buried them in graves near the village .
Most were recovered but one mass grave - at Pheasant Wood - went undiscovered for 90 years .
Now , after two years ' work , Australian war history books will be able to close another chapter .
Viable DNA has been obtained from all but about six sets of remains , with testing on samples to continue until 2014 .
Just three sets of remains of the 250 have been identified as British .
Their individual identities have yet to be confirmed .
Mr Whitford , whose wife Liz and daughter , Alexandra , 8 , spent several weeks at Pheasant Wood during the preliminary excavation in 2008 , was present when a team from Glasgow University found the first remains .
The Whitford family have been waiting anxiously since the men were exhumed by an English firm , Oxford Archaeology , last year .
They were reinterred with full military honours in individual , unmarked graves last month .
Those identified will now have their headstones inscribed in time for a ceremony on the anniversary of the battle , on Monday , July 19 , 2010 , at the new war graves cemetery .
Mr Whitford was accompanied on his visit to his grandmother yesterday by Lambis Englezos , whose tenacious research drove the search for the men .
He described the news as seriously wonderful .
" This is about dignity and about identity … now the soldiers have been restored to their families and restored to their countries . "
Others identified include Berrol Mendelsohn , 24 , great - uncle to Melbourne man Oliver Mendelsohn .
'' Somewhat in spite of myself , I felt quite emotional when I got the call , '' Dr Mendelsohn said .
He said he might attend the June service if it '' takes into account that Berrol Mendelsohn was a Jew ' ' .
Then there is Private Herbert George Pollard who was born in Northcote in 1891 .
Private Pollard was a farmer , single and living at Kew in Melbourne when he enlisted in July 1915 and a member of the 29th Battalion when he died .
Lastly , Private Arnold Holmes born at New Lenton in Nottingham , England , in 1889 .
A psychiatric warder , he was single and living at the hospital for the insane in Perth , when he enlisted in July 1915 .
He was a member of the 32nd Battalion .

Margot Wallström , the recently appointed Secretary - General ’s Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict , voiced concern about the “ lingering assumption that sexual violence is a tradition , rather than a tactic of choice ” by groups engaged in war .
“ Prevailing opinion would have us believe that what happens in a ‘ private hut ’ has nothing to do with security , ” she wrote in the Oslo newspaper Dagsavisen on Tuesday in a column jointly authored with Jonas Gahr Støre , Norwegian Foreign Minister .
“ While bullets , bombs and blades make the headlines , women ’s bodies remain invisible battlefields .
Yet it is utterly indefensible to downgrade the threat level of sexual violence because it primarily targets women and girls .
What makes forced displacement part of the war , and mass rape an intractable cultural trait ? ”
Ms. Wallström and Mr. Støre wrote that there are only cultures of impunity , and not cultures of rape , as some commentators have argued in certain countries or conflicts .
“ Cultural relativism legitimizes the violence and discredits the victims , because when you accept rape as cultural , you make rape inevitable .
This shields the perpetrators and allows world leaders to shrug off sexual violence as an immutable – if regrettable – truth .
It is time to state , once and for all , that mass rape is no more inevitable , cultural or acceptable than mass murder . ”
The Special Representative – who is visiting Norway on her first official visit since being appointed by the UN – and the Foreign Minister stressed that the best way to overcome this problem is to ensure that perpetrators of rape and other forms of sexual violence are held accountable .
“ We are convinced that where there ’s a political will , there ’s a way .
Every rape – even in the midst of war – is a crime that can be commanded , condoned or condemned .
That is a choice made by those in power , and it is a matter that concerns the guardians of global peace and security . ”

Video gamers were forced to put down their joysticks Sunday as tens of millions of Sony PlayStation 3s were hit by a bug in the console 's clock that prevented owners from playing certain games or connecting to the Internet .
The problem is apparently caused by the device 's internal clock , which for unknown reasons on Feb. 28 changed to Dec. 31 , 1999 .
The calendar error prevented users from playing any game downloaded from the Internet or certain recent releases on discs , including Atlus Entertainment 's fantasy action game Demon 's Souls and Sony 's own recently released noir game Heavy Rain .
In addition , PS3 owners can't connect to the Internet to compete against other players online or to download movies and television shows .
In a blog post that went up today , a Sony Computer Entertainment America spokesman warned that the problem may effect any PS3 sold before a new " slim " version launched in September .
As of June , the last date before September for which the Japanese electronics giant reported financial information , it has sold 23.8 million PS3s around the world .
The Sony blog advised owners of any PS3 except the new " slim " version not to use the device and said the company hopes to have a fix within 24 hours .
Sony 's video game console ( which is also the world 's bestselling Blu- ray player ) has previously had a much stronger quality record than its primary competitor .
Microsoft has had to replace millions of faulty units of its Xbox 360 at a cost of more than $ 1 billion .
No word if gamers have decided that as they can't play they might as well party like it 's 1999 .
[ Update , 6:10 p.m. : Sony reported in a recent blog post that the problem has been corrected .
Several users have reported that their previously unusable Playstation 3's can now access the Internet . ]

Why Watchdog ?
And why questions ?
Questions the press should ask .
Great questions are a key to great journalism .
But often , in the press of deadlines , the flood of raw information , manipulated news , deliberate misinformation and just plain junk , great questions are hard to develop .
Reporters and editors need to know what 's happening , why it happened , who 's involved , who 's affected and what happens next .
The premise of watchdog journalism is that the press is a surrogate for the public , asking probing , penetrating questions at every level , from the town council to the state house to the White House , as well as in corporate and professional offices , in union halls , on university campuses and in religious organizations that seek to influence governmental actions .
The goal of watchdog journalism is to see that people in power provide information the public should have .
The Nieman Watchdog Journalism Project grows from this premise and this goal : to help the press ask penetrating questions , critical questions , questions that matter , questions not yet asked about today 's news .
NiemanWatchdog.org seeks to encourage more informed reporting by putting journalists in contact with authorities who can suggest appropriate , probing questions and who can serve as resources .
What sets us apart .
There are already many very good journalism Web sites .
Nevertheless , we think our function at NiemanWatchdog.org – suggesting questions the press should ask – sets us apart .
The Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University was founded in 1938 " to promote and elevate the standards of journalism in the United States . "
For many years now the program has included international reporters and editors as well .
Nieman Fellowships enrich outstanding practitioners by bringing 24 of them to Harvard University for a year of study in fields of journalistic specialty .
NiemanWatchdog.org carries this process a step further .
It seeks to bring the richness of Harvard and other centers of learning to journalists around the world and to other interested groups and individuals as well .
Independent experts are often eager to help journalists identify what is important , what can illuminate and expand a story .
NiemanWatchdog.org will give journalists access to such experts at Harvard , the home of the Nieman Foundation , and at other campuses across the country .
NiemanWatchdog.org will also seek out the expertise of authorities in the professions , activist groups , politics , commerce and government – perceptive thinkers who are experienced in and care about public affairs .
Through NiemanWatchdog.org , these authorities will suggest questions and provide background on topics in the news .
We will supplement their knowledge with a Web log , links to other informative Web sites and additional resources .
Why questions ?
Some may wonder about our emphasis on asking questions , since politicians and most of the rest of the world – even schoolchildren – are adept at sidestepping them .
What 's the point of asking good questions if the answers are n't forthcoming ?
First , the ability to ask appropriate questions comes only with an understanding of the subject at hand .
When experts help with questions and background , they also help deepen the reporter 's knowledge of the issue .
Second , targeted , insightful questions are typically more difficult for public officials , candidates and others in public life to dodge , mislead or even lie about .
Finally , the questions do n't disappear simply because a president , or someone else in a high position , wo n't give a straight , complete answer .
The answer may lie in documents or in interviews with other sources , or both .
But assuredly , a key to great journalism comes mostly to reporters and editors who ask the right questions , who have a full understanding of what they are looking for and who can recognize what rings true and what does n't .
We encourage your comments about NiemanWatchdog.org .
Your feedback will help us make this site an even more useful resource for you .

I am thinking of getting the prepaid dishNow satellite system from Dish network .
It comes with all the necessary cables but it does not include professional installation by a technician .
I live on the second floor of a apartment and I can not climb a roof or wall to install it myself .
Who do i go to to install this sytem ?
How much does it cost ?
It does n't make sense to expect everyone to install there own dish just because it is prepaid .
I know they offer free installation but that is only for the regular system , which requires a credit check .
I can not afford a $ 200 deposit upfront .
Any sugestions ?
Deadliest US mine disaster in nearly 40 years
Families begin to bury 29 killed in West Virginia explosion
By Andre Damon and Samuel Davidson
12 April 2010
For full WSWS coverage of the West Virginia mine explosion , including additional interviews with miners , click here .
If you have thoughts and comments on this article , click here .
Families of workers killed in the West Virginia mine explosion are beginning to bury their loved ones , as residents speak out against Massey Energy and government regulators responsible for the disaster .
Mourners at a vigil on Saturday
In an especially vindictive move , workers said that Massey has refused to allow miners at the company time off so that they can attend the funerals of their coworkers .
The bodies of four miners were found early Saturday morning , bringing the total number killed to 29 .
The final death toll makes last week ’s tragedy the deadliest mine disaster in the US since 1972 , when 91 workers were killed from a fire at the Sunshine silver mine in Idaho .
It is the deadliest incident at a coal mine since 1970 , when 38 people were killed in an explosion at a Finley Coal mine in Hyden , Kentucky .
It appeared that the miners found Saturday , like all those killed in the mine , had made no attempt to put on their rescue breathers .
This means that the blast killed them almost immediately .
The explosion was so powerful that it shredded railroad tracks , buckled mine barriers , and reversed the direction of ventilation fans five miles from the origin .
The size of the explosion suggests an extremely concentrated buildup of methane gas and coal dust at the Upper Big Branch mine .
It exemplifies the disregard for the human lives with which Massey Energy , abetted by mine regulators , makes its profits .
The bodies of the four workers were found near the other miners .
Rescuers had passed them last Monday but did not see the bodies because of smoke and debris .
Two miners survived the blast .
One is still hospitalized .
A Massey mine several miles north of the Upper Big Branch mine
Only seven bodies have so far been recovered , and rescue crews said on Sunday afternoon that the mine would have to be ventilated for 12 to 15 hours before they could go in and recover the remaining 22 .
Some funerals have already been held .
The funeral of Jason Matthew Atkins , 25 , was held on Saturday after a viewing on Friday evening .
Laura Morris , his cousin , criticized Massey and government inspectors for not ensuring the miners ’ safety .
“ I just ca n’t believe it , ” she told WSWS Friday .
“ I think it should have been prevented .
With as many times as they had been cited , they should have done something about it by now . ”
Massey Energy told employees that if they miss work to attend the funerals they would be fired , workers said .
A Massey worker from another mine , who did not give his name because he is afraid of losing his job , said that his coworkers were outraged that they were not given time off to mourn their friends and brothers .
The WSWS spoke to workers and relatives outside a local market .
Chuck Smith , an unemployed miner with seven years work underground , said Massey ’s decision to force miners to work during the funerals was a calculated move .
“ What would it look like if a bunch of people wearing Massey uniforms showed up to the funeral yelling ‘ damn Massey ? ’ ”
Smith said another factor was Massey ’s profits .
“ Is a lump of coal that valuable to you that you ca n’t even give the miners a day off to mourn their friends ? ” he asked .
Sherry , a miner 's wife , works at the local
supermarket with co-worker Denny
Sherry , the wife of a coal miner , echoed these sentiments .
“ These are the miners ’ brothers ; they know them better than their own families , ” she said , “ and they ca n’t even attend their funerals . ”
“ Everybody knew that mine was about to blow up , ” said Smith , “ I told my friend not to work there .
That was three months ago ; he worked two months and quit .
If you check the work records , you ’ll see that a lot of experienced miners left the mine because the conditions just got worse and worse as they ramped up production . ”
“ Other coal companies at least gave workers some respect , ” Smith added .
“ When you got to work they would have food for you ; the miners would sit around and talk about life ; talk about fishing and family ; you ’d get to the mine half an hour late , but who cared ? ”
“ Massey is different .
They wo n’t let you have a minute .
They do n’t give you boots or a helmet ; you have to buy it yourself .
But it ’s not just your time ; it ’s your safety they take . ”
Anger among workers is growing as reports pile in of the mass of safety violations at the mine , combined with government inaction .
Many violations came at the same time that Massey was in implementing a sharp increase in production .
Production figures for the mine show that the company had nearly doubled output - per- miner in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the third quarter .
( See , “ Miners doomed by collusion between regulators and coal companies ” ) .
Investigators have not determined the exact nature of the powerful explosions , but miners who have worked for years underground say that an explosion of that force could only come from a methane explosion that ignites a secondary coal dust blast .
“ It ’s like a fuel - air explosive , ” said one retired miner .
Laura Morris , the cousin of Jason Atkins , a killed
miner , with John Davis , her husband
Smith said that the reason Massey has been so successful was because they are able to undercut the competition at workers ’ expense .
“ They have everything a mine operator could want .
They buy off judges and have political connections .
They disregard safety rules ; they get away with it .
And most of all they work you to the bone . ”
Over the past four days , the WSWS spoke to dozens of miners , workers , and their relatives .
All who were critical of Massey said they feared retaliation by the company .
Workers said that Massey maintains a blacklist of people who it will not hire .
They say that speaking out against the company will affect not just a worker , but also his relatives and family members .
There is an all - pervasive fear and hatred of the company , which workers refer to as “ him ; ” equating Massey with the person of Don Blankenship , its multi-millionaire CEO .
“ When you work for Massey , you give your life to Massey , ” said Sherry .
“ People become miners to support their families , but they never get to see them .
The miners see their co-workers more than their families , so they become like family .
That ’s why it ’s so hard when someone dies . ”
Workers said that the police would not defend their families against even the most blatant robbery .
The main role of the police , they said , was to protect company property .
“ I bolt ceilings , ” said Smith .
“ My motto is ; bolt it once and bolt it right .
If I do something wrong ; miners die .
I ’m responsible for every miner I work with ; most of my brothers are the same way .
But Massey makes sure that an honest man will never last long as a safety inspector . ”
For miners , 10 - 12 hour shifts are normal , but even 16 - hour shifts are not unusual .
The typical workweek for a miner is 60 hours , according to workers .
Smith summed up the situation : ” They used to say to the miners in the old days : ‘ when the dynamite goes off , you better be sure the donkeys are far away .
You can do whatever you want with yourselves .
You ’re replaceable , but we only have so many donkeys . ’ ”
This Friday , the United Nations international climate negotiations will gear up again in Bonn , Germany .
The meeting — and the announcements and news that will surround it — will be an important gauge of whether the international climate process still shows signs of life .
Early indicators seem to suggest that there 's at least a pulse .
It 's been just over 4 months since the Copenhagen climate talks ended in confusion and disorder , failing to deliver the international climate treaty many of us had hoped ( and worked ) for .
Copenhagen left the UN metaphorically bruised and battered ( the adjectives were literal for many protesters outside the conference ) and in the final hours of the talks and weeks to follow , many doubted that the international climate process would continue at all .
For one particularly insightful postmortem with an emphasis on implications for the climate justice movement , click here .
In the last few weeks , the climate talks have shown a few signs of life .
First , was the creation in early March of a high - level advisory group on climate finance , including civilians such as George Soros and Nicholas Stern , along with heads of state , such as the UK's Gordon Brown and Ethiopia Meles Zenawi .
The group has been tasked with finding $ 1 trillion worth of financing for adaptation and are considering a number of different schemes , including the Robin Hood Tax , which has gained some traction in the online world as well .
Second , was a recent statement by the UK that they would be willing to sign onto a new round of the Kyoto Protocol .
Without delving into the specifics , one of the major dilemmas in Copenhagen was the divide between rich and poor nations over whether or not the meetings would produce a new treaty that would require major developing countries to take on commitments while weakening the legal obligations of rich countries or whether countries would just sign onto a " second commitment period " of the existing Kyoto Protocol which is set to expire in 2012 .
Britain's new willingness to sign onto Kyoto has been lauded by some as a step towards healing the divide between rich and poor .
Andy Atkins , Friends of the Earth 's executive director , said : " It 's positive that the government has restated its commitment to the Kyoto protocol , which enshrines the responsibility of rich countries , as the biggest historical polluters , to slash their emissions first and fastest . "
Also keeping things interesting on the international front is the move by Bolivia to host a People 's Summit on Climate Change in Cochabamba later this month .
Bill McKibben , founder of 350.org , who will be hosting a youth summit in Cochabamba to coincide with the event , wrote in a recent piece on Huffington Post :
In a week when the American president has decided our energy policy should involve lots more offshore oil drilling , it 's easy to despair–it does n't look like it 's going to be much of an Earth Day in the U.S. this April .
But maybe we 'll get a jolt of political energy from the south , courtesy of the groups and leaders assembling from across the world in Cochabamba , Bolivia .
This People 's Summit on Climate Change will be seen as naive by precisely the kind of people applauding the president for turning on the oil spigots today–after all , its by definition a People 's Summit , free from the kind of corporate interference that helped sink the Copenhagen conference in December ( Bolivia 's Supreme Court having not yet decided that corporations are people ) .
And then there 's been the massive drought in southwestern China , mining disasters from West Virginia to Shanxi , the crash of a coal ship into the Great Barrier Reef , Obama 's offshore drilling announcement ( join the 20,000 strong Facebook group against the decision ) , and the impending decision by the World Bank whether or not to loan South African coal giant , Eskom , $ 3.5 billion to build new dirty coal fired power plants and nuclear facilities ( you can sign a petition against the loan here ) .
All that 's to say that things are heating up again in the international climate change arena .
For those of you that followed the nail biter that was Copenhagen and have been recovering ever since , now's a good time to get back in the game — checking out the 10:10 campaign and 350.org 's Get to Work campaign are two ways to start .
As is keeping up to date with the discussions in Bonn by following Adopt a Negotiator , either on their blog or Twitter feed .
At the end of Copenhagen , youth from around the world told political leaders they were " Not Done Yet . "
Looks like they were right .
For women who choose to go through pregnancy and childbirth , the freedom to choose where and with whom to birth is not always immediately accessible .
Before childbirth in hospitals became the norm , women birthed at home , under the care of a midwife .
It was n’t until the 1950s that childbirth care shifted significantly from midwives and homebirth to physicians and hospital birth .
However , birth for healthy mothers and their babies does not necessarily have to be medicalized .
And because it was becoming increasingly clear that birth was drifting , quickly , from the hearts and hands of women to the more medicalized , economic model put forth by hospitals , women ’s health advocates interested in natural birth created a movement .
There is nothing inherently wrong with hospital birthing , of course ( written from the heart of a mother who birthed two beautiful children in a hospital birthing center ) .
It is the focus on economics , while having lost our sense of what birth is all about by straying far away from trusting women and women ’s bodies , that is the “ wrong . ”
We now have a cesarean section rate in this country of 30 percent – one out of every three births in this country is via c-section – that dangerously exceeds the World Health Organization ’s recommended rate of 5 to 10 percent of all births .
With a cesarean rate of over 15 percent , the WHO says , we ’re in the realm of doing “ more harm than good . ”
We are not providing women with the optimal enivornments for birthing , or giving women the chance to choose where they wish to birth and with whom .
There are of course many reasons for this , not the least of which is access .
Women who have no health insurance are not in a position to “ choose . ”
Pregnant women who live in a small town with one hospital that forces c-sections upon women who have had a previous c-section are not in a position to “ choose . ”
Women who live in a state where midwifery , essentially homebirth , is illegal are not in a position to “ choose . ”
This can not be what our mothers want or what we want for our mothers .

Things are looking up .
According to a new report by the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) released this week , more women in the United States are opting to birth at home or out - of - hospital , when they are able , mostly out of a desire for a low - intervention birth or because of cultural or religious reasons , and sometimes because of lack of transportation .
The report also identifies reduced costs associated with out - of - hospital maternity care as a factor in the increased demand .
Over the last five years , out - of - hospital births ( which includes home birth and birthing at a free - standing birth center ) rose 3 percent and home births rose 5 percent after having sharply declined between 1940 and 1969 and then remaining static over the last few decades .
Approximately 17 percent of these home births recorded were unplanned – either because of transportation issues for women who live in rural areas or emergency scenarios .
The report acknowledges that home births were “ less likely than hospital births to be preterm , low birthweight , or multiple deliveries . ”
Out - of - hospital birthing , particularly home birthing , has been treated with more than a raised eyebrow by the media as well as some professional medical associations ( specifically the American Medical Association ( AMA ) and American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( ACOG ) ) over the last few years .
The AMA passed a resolution in opposition to home birth stating that hospital births are the safest route for mothers and babies .
In a poorly reported segment on The Today Show a few months ago home birth was treated as a perilous fad spurred on by celebrities who birth at home with hordes of pregnant women clamoring to “ do what Ricki Lake did . ”
However , the report makes a point to note that in contrast to the AMA and ACOG , the organizations that represent physicians who facilitate birth in hospitals , “ the World Health Organization , the American College of Nurse Midwives , and the American Public Health Association all support home and out - of - hospital birth options for low - risk women . ”
As for midwives who attend home births and birth center births around the country ?
The Big Push for Midwives Campaign Manager , Katie Prown , says , “ Those of us who have been advocating for increased access to Certified Professional Midwives and out - of - hospital maternity care have long known that the research shows that AMA and ACOG statements about the safety of home birth and the reasons why women choose out - of - hospital delivery have no basis in the evidence , “ said Prown .
“ It ’s great to be able to cite even more research on the safety of out - of - hospital birth and to be able to point to data showing that women in the United States do not , in fact , make decisions about where to have their babies for frivolous , selfish , or trendy reasons . ”
* Phones to revolutionise system camera market soon
* HD quality video on phones within 12 months
HELSINKI , April 20 ( Reuters ) -
Fast developing cameraphone technology will shortly make SLR system cameras and even professional cameras obsolete , the sales chief of the world 's top cellphone maker Nokia NOK1V .
HE said on Tuesday .
" They will in the very near future revolutionise the market for system cameras , " Anssi Vanjoki said in a speech in Helsinki .
“ There will be no need to carry around those heavy lenses , ” Vanjoki said , pointing to a professional photographer taking pictures of him .
The proliferation of smartphones with picture quality comparable to most pocket cameras has boosted photography around the world , but they have so far not challenged real system cameras due to phones ’ smaller size and weaker technology .
Vanjoki said high - definition ( HD ) quality video recording was also coming to cellphones within the next 12 months .
“ It will not take long , less than a year , when phones can record HD quality video and you can transfer it directly to your HD television set , ” Vanjoki said .

" I absolutely fucking hate the iPhone App Store , " declared indie developer Tommy Refenes during his segment of the Indie Game Makers Rant at Game Developers Conference in San Francisco this week .
Refenes , known for his work onand the upcoming , has philosophical objections to Apple 's mobile digital distribution platform .
" The majority of people who do anything for the App Store work on it and then kind of get screwed over , " he said .
The App Store " is the Tiger handheld game of this generation , " Refenes explained .
Just like low - quality LCD - based handheld games , the true successes of the App Store seem to be translations of established franchises and brand names that present severely downgraded versions of their original experiences .
He pointed to less - playable iPhone versions of , andas examples .
After all , as Playfish co-founder Kristian Segerstrale observed during GDC , seven of the eight best - selling App Store games last year were mobile versions of existing major game franchises .
"
It 's just a way to sell a brand , " Refenes said .
" That 's what the Tiger handheld games were , and that 's what I think the App Store is .
" But Refenes ' rant was n't limited to a debatable analogy .
He came equipped with a personal experience that further confirmed his impression of the App Store as a place where traditional correlations of quality have little meaning .
" About five months I started an experiment , and the experiment was basically to prove the App Store is kind of shit for most things , " he said .
Along with fellow prolific indie developer Adam Saltsman ( ) , Refenes developed a " joke game " for iPhone titled , consisting mainly of popping virtual pimples .
Like so many other iPhone games , launched at $ 0.99 .
Sales were never remarkable , and they eventually tapered off entirely .
But rather than pursue a traditional marketing strategy like offering the game for free for a limited time , Refenes did just the opposite : he raised the price to $ 15 , exorbitant by iPhone standards .
Shockingly , " the day I put it up to $ 15 , three people bought it , " Refenes said .
" So , " he continued , " I said , ' I 'm going to put it up to $ 50 . '
Four people bought it .
" After observing that fortuitous trend , Refenes decided to test its resilience by boosting the game 's selling price every time at least one copy was sold .
" I stopped paying attention to it for a while , " he recalled , then " I checked it on Valentine 's Day , and 14 people bought it at $ 299 .
" The game has now reached a price tag of $ 350 .
Based only on Refenes ' sales figures for a limited number of the game 's many price tiers , generated at least $ 4,431 at the $ 15 , $ 50 , and $ 299 price points alone .
It currently holds an App Store customer rating of two and a half stars out of five , with only two written reviews , one of which reads in its entirety , " It 's hilarious . "
( Its official description still claims it costs " a FRIGGIN DOLLAR . " )
" My conclusion to all of this , " Refenes said , " is that the people who you 're selling to on the App Store are not necessarily gamers . "
The computer crime task force of the Santa Clara County district attorney 's office is investigating the Gizmodo purchase of an Apple prototype iPhone to determine if criminal charges will be filed .
A report by Greg Sandoval of CNET stated that police are investigating the circumstances of the event to determine if there is enough evidence to support criminal prosecution .
Gizmodo announced paying $ 5,000 for what it believed to be a prototype of Apple 's forthcoming new iPhone model , after finding a seller who had claimed to possess the device after finding it in a bar .
CNET said it " has not been able to confirm whether the investigation is targeting Gizmodo.com , its source who reportedly found the iPhone in a bar , or both . "
Gawker Media , Gizmodo 's owner , has previously floated offers to pay sources for access to unreleased Apple products in order to publish the company 's trade secrets on its Valleywag tech gossip site .
After Apple objected to the offer , Gawker taunted the company by saying it would keep its leaks anonymous .
The report noted that California law states that anyone who finds lost property and knows who the likely owner is , but " appropriates such property to his own use " is guilty of theft .
Taking property valued at more than $ 400 can result in more serious charges of grand theft .
Additionally , Californian law also states that any person who knowingly receives property that has been obtained illegally can be imprisoned for up to one year .
While First Amendment rights granting freedom of the press have supported Supreme Court rulings to allow members of the media to broadcast confidential information , the buying and selling stolen property are separate criminal law issues .
California also has trade secret laws that would enable Apple to seek civil damages related to the incident .

Scientists using the Mini-SAR instrument on India ’s Chandrayaan - 1 spacecraft have detected water ice deposits near the moon ’s north pole .
Mini-SAR , a lightweight , synthetic aperture radar , found more than 40 small craters with water ice .
The craters range in size from 2 to15 km ( 1 to 9 miles ) in diameter .
Although the total amount of ice depends on its thickness in each crater , it is estimated there could be at least 600 million metric tons of water ice .
“ The emerging picture from the multiple measurements and resulting data of the instruments on lunar missions indicates that water creation , migration , deposition and retention are occurring on the moon , ” said Paul Spudis , principal investigator of the Mini- SAR experiment at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston .
“ The new discoveries show the moon is an even more interesting and attractive scientific , exploration and operational destination than people had previously thought . ”
During the past year , the Mini-SAR mapped the moon ’s permanently - shadowed polar craters that are n’t visible from Earth .
The radar uses the polarization properties of reflected radio waves to characterize surface properties .
Results from the mapping showed deposits having radar characteristics similar to ice .
“ After analyzing the data , our science team determined a strong indication of water ice , a finding which will give future missions a new target to further explore and exploit , ” said Jason Crusan , program executive for the Mini-RF Program for NASA ’s Space Operations Mission Directorate in Washington .
The results are consistent with recent findings of other NASA instruments and add to the growing scientific understanding of the multiple forms of water found on the moon .
Previously , the Moon Mineralogy Mapper discovered water molecules in the moon ’s polar regions , while water vapor was detected by NASA ’s Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite , or LCROSS .
Mini-SAR and Moon Mineralogy Mapper are two of 11 instruments on Chandrayaan - 1 .
The Mini-SAR ’s findings are being published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .

I ’m still a Detroiter in spirit .
I lived there in the ’70s and ’ 80s and return regularly now .
My years there left a distinctive mark on me .
Last month I visited Detroit and once again saw first - hand what can only be described as an economic and human catastrophe .
This great city of rich African American and working class tradition has been pillaged by the corporate class .
Unless you are there , it is hard to imagine the scale of the destruction and the crisis of everyday living .
It is of an order of magnitude that is off the charts – no exaggeration .
The crisis there is decades long now .
The Great Recession , as bad as it is , only deepened the economic misery and closed off whatever avenues remained for a decent job and life .
Yes , there are some pockets of development especially downtown , but the signs of unrelieved poverty are everywhere .
Detroit , as is said , is no place for wimps .
Unemployment officially is in the 27 percent range and unofficially as high as 45 percent , according a recent article in the Detroit News .
Mind you , in the depths of the Depression that figure was roughly 25 percent .
The city ’s productive base has been relocated , shuttered , or dismantled .
When I first arrived in Detroit in the mid-70s , auto plants , big and small , spread across the southeast and southwest side of the city , providing union jobs and benefits to Black and white workers alike and an entry point into the workplace for their children .
The Ford Rouge plant in nearby Dearborn was still an integrated production site with everything from steel - making to auto assembly , and employed about 25,000 workers .
Over the last quarter century , the city has lost a million people .
Some went to other states , some moved to the suburbs .
This de-peopling of a once thriving city in the space of a few decades is probably unprecedented .
Schools and the quality and availability of other public services mirror the larger crisis of the city .
Boarded homes and overgrown lots where houses once stood are commonplace .
Some of the latter have been turned into community gardens – a testament to the resourcefulness and community spirit of this city ’s people .
The city is like “ a raisin in the sun . ”
Most of the poor are African Americans , but not all .
Poor white people and a long - standing Mexican American community remain too .
Joining them are new immigrants , mainly Central American .
What their future will look like is still to be decided .
One thing is for sure – no one should hang their hopes on private capital and the private sector .
The immediate causes of this calamity are traceable to the intersection of private capital – namely U.S. auto corporations – and intensified racism and right - wing extremism that dominated national politics for three decades .
On a deeper level , capitalism is the guilty party .
Its insatiable , built - in desire to accumulate capital and maximize profits is the motor that has driven the relentless exploitation of autoworkers , the rise of a hyper - competitive global auto industry , new decentralized worldwide production networks , the flight of capital from the real economy where profits are lower into non-productive , highly speculative ventures in unregulated financial markets , and the impoverishment and fracturing of the autoworkers and their communities , and , not least , racial inequality and oppression .
So if private capital and the larger system of capitalism ( which developed in an interactive and organic embrace with racial slavery and subsequent systems of racial oppression ) got the city and its working people into this mess and likewise have no desire to clean it up , where should Detroiters look for solutions ?
What is needed to revive the city ?
Three things come to mind .
First , a massive and sustained federal government commitment to rebuild the city , provide jobs , and restructure the region ’s economy along green lines .
Second , a battle against deficit hysteria coming from Washington and Wall Street .
The massive deficits are a potential problem , but still pale in the face of a stagnant economy that , unless something is done , promises a long stretch of high unemployment and growing inequality .
Third , a reenergizing of the movement that elected President Obama .
If there is any one conclusion that we can draw from the past year , it is that a growing , sustained , multi-racial people ’s movement , in which labor is in the center , is n’t yet operating on all cylinders .
The recent jobs and infrastructure initiative of the AFL - CIO , NAACP , La Raza and other organizations represents a potential launching pad for a momentous struggle for Detroit ’s future and the future of the country .
As I see it , an energized , broadly based , multi-racial movement is the key link that if grasped can decisively change the trajectory of Detroit and the whole country to a path that favors people , their communities , and racial and other forms of equality rather than corporate profits , tax breaks for the wealthy , war spending , and lopsided , uneven , and racially unequal economic development .
In the longer term , an alternative system – socialism – at the center of which is the conscious activity and needs of working people and their allies – is on the agenda .

Real Madrid and other large clubs can rely on continued fan loyalty , Deloitte says
Real Madrid have topped the league table of the world 's richest football clubs for the fifth straight year , according to Deloitte 's sport unit .
Its Football Money League , based on data for season 2008 / 09 , also says Real are the first global sports team to see annual revenues top 400 m euros ( £ 357 m ) .
Real 's arch - rivals Barcelona have taken second spot in the list , ahead of Manchester United who drop to third .
Arsenal , Chelsea and Liverpool are fifth , sixth and seventh respectively .
With international TV rights becoming an increasingly important source of income and leagues competing for attention around the world , the Spanish model has clear dangers .
Nils Blythe , Business correspondent
Why TV is the key to Real success
The authors said that United would have been top of the Money League if the pound was still at June 2007 levels .
But they point out that , despite exchange rate issues , seven of the top 20 in its table are from England , the other three being Tottenham ( 15th ) , Manchester City ( 19th ) , and relegated club Newcastle United ( 20th ) .
All the 20 clubs represented are from the " big five " European leagues , with Germany contributing five clubs , Italy four , and France and Spain two each .
' Challenges ' Real retained top position despite a disappointing season , coming second in La Liga and exiting the Champions League at the Round of 16 stage .
BUSINESS OF SPORT DEBATE Join leading figures in football for a BBC debate : The Business of Sport - Football in the Red .
It will be broadcast live on Tuesday 2 March ( all times GMT ) 2000 - 2100 BBC News Channel 2000 - 2130 BBC

But they were boosted by a much - improved television contract with Mediapro , guaranteeing the club more than 1.1bn euros over seven seasons .
Arch-rivals Barcelona had a hugely successful season , winning La Liga and the Champions League - beating Manchester United , who won the English Premier League in 2008 / 09 , in the final .
" We continue to assert that the game 's top clubs are well placed to meet the challenges presented by the difficult economic environment , " said Deloitte 's Dan Jones , who compiled the report .
" Their large and loyal supporter bases , ability to drive broadcast audiences , and continuing attraction to corporate partners , provide a strong base to underpin revenues . "
He said that this was shown by the fact that the combined revenues of the top 20 Money League clubs was over 3.9bn euros in 2008 / 09 , up 26 m euros on the previous year .
And the majority of Money League clubs maintained average match attendances when comparing 2008/09 with 2007 / 08 .
There was not a great deal of movement in the top 20 , with two new clubs - Werder Bremen and Manchester City - replacing VfB Stuttgart and Fenerbahce .
WEALTHIEST CLUBS BY REVENUE 1 ) Real Madrid : 401.4 m euros 2 ) Barcelona : 365.9 m euros 3 ) Man Utd : 327 m euros 4 ) Bayern Munich : 289.5 m euros 5 ) Arsenal : 263 m euros 6 ) Chelsea : 242.3 m
7 ) Liverpool : 217 m euros 8 ) Juventus : 202.3 m euros 9 ) Inter Milan 196.5 m euros 10 ) AC Milan : 196.5. m euros Source : Deloitte : 2008/09
Mr Jones said the limited change " reflects the fact that those clubs with the largest supporter bases in strongest economic markets , high attraction to commercial partners , and consistent participation in European competition , will dominate the top positions " .
Football income
However , there were warnings that many clubs now face " increased pressure on ticket pricing strategies and all clubs will continue to face challenges in managing match day " returns .
And the report also points out that the current season , 2009 / 10 , will offer clarification about whether the global recession has had a major impact on clubs ' revenues .
The Deloitte review does not include the cost of transfer fees or player wages , or VAT and other sales taxes , and concentrates solely on day - to - day income from football business .
Income includes money from ticket sales , sponsorship , merchandising and other commercial revenues , television monies , corporate hospitality , and non-match day stadium use such as for conferences .
The list had been headed by Manchester United for eight years until Real Madrid deposed them .

In my previous post on boolean search , we wrote an efficient list ( array ) intersection function .
But , to be honest , I was n’t very happy with it .
Considering the fact that we were using Ruby , it just was n’t very Ruby - like .
So , this time I am going to try and show how that function can be re-written to not only be more Ruby - ish but to also be tighter and easier to understand .
In addition I will look at a couple of interesting aspects of OpenStruct , which will lead nicely into my next post on skip pointers ( I ’ve spoken about covering skip pointers before ) .
The Ruby -ish Intersection Function
The last time we implemented an array intersection function it looked like this :
```ruby def intersect_lists ( list1 , list2 ) final_list = [ ] current_list1_index = 0 current_list2_index = 0
while (current_list1_index < list1.length && current_list2_index < list2.length ) if list1[ current_list1_index ] == list2[ current_list2_index ] final_list << list1[ current_list1_index ] current_list1_index += 1 current_list2_index += 1 elsif list1[ current_list1_index ] < list2[current_list2_index ] current_list1_index += 1 else current_list2_index += 1 end end final_list end```
There is actually nothing wrong with the code itself .
It is an efficient implementation .
The reason it is efficient is due to the fact that we only need to walk through each of the lists once , in order to produce the intersected list .
So if the sizes of our two lists are x and y , the intersection takes x+y operations , i.e. the complexity of the algorithm is O ( x+y ) .
If we were writing that function in C , everything would be fine at this point , but we ’re using Ruby .
What we really want our function to look like is something along the lines of :
ruby def intersect_lists ( list1 , list2 ) list1.each do |item1| list2.each do |item2 | # stuff end end end
This would actually work , but we go back to the naive array intersection implementation where we scan through the whole of one list for each of the elements in the other .
What we really want is to be able to exit the inner each iterator to allow the outer one to advance , but then restart where we left off the next time we enter the inner one .
This way we can compare all the values in both arrays to produce the intersection while still scanning both lists only once .
Fortunately with Ruby , we can simply open up the array class and create just such an iterator :
```ruby class Array def each_continued if [ email protected ] _index reset_current_index end while @current_index < self.size next_index = yield( self[@current_index ] , @current_index ) if next_index @current_index = next_index break end @current_index += 1 end end
def reset_current_index @current_index = 0 end end```
As you can see our new iterator uses a class level variable ( [ email protected ] index ) to keep track of where the iteration is at .
We stop the iteration based on the value that is returned from the block that needs to be passed to this iterator .
If the value returned from the block is nil , we continue to iterate .
When the value returned is a number , we set it to be the index from which we will restart the iteration next time the method is called .
This allows us to not only stop and restart the iteration where we left off , but also roll the iteration forward or back if necessary .
This is actually important as we will see shortly .
There is only one issue with this implementation , the fact that we need to use a class level variable .
The problem is the fact that when one full iteration through the array completes , you need to remember to rewind ( i.e. must call reset_current_index ) – not great .
The only way to overcome this would be keep track of the current position of the iteration externally and pass this value in as a parameter to the iterator , but we wo n’t worry about that for now , for our purposes , resetting the array is not such a big deal .
We can now re-implement our intersection function , it will look like this :
ruby def rubyish_intersect_lists ( list1 , list2 ) list3 = [ ] list1.each do |value1 | list2.each_continued do |value2 , index2 | if value1 == value2 list3 << value2 index2 + 1 elsif value1 < value2 index2 end end end list3 end
You ’ll probably agree that ’s much tighter and more Ruby - ish looking .
There are two important things to note , in order to understand how it works .
When the values from both lists match , we copy the result into our intersection array , we then need to advance both lists .
In order to do this , we get the block of the inner iterator to return the index of the next value in the list .
This will cause the inner iterator to terminate , but will also prime it to restart from the index we return out of the block ( see what I mean about the importance of giving our iterator the ability to restart the iteration from any index we want ) .
This way we advance our inner iterator and naturally advance the outer one , since the inner one has exited .
When the value of the array in the inner loop is bigger than the outer one , we want to keep advancing the outer iterator , but keep the inner one where it is .
We do this very easily , by making the block of the inner iterator return the current index of the list .
This has the effect of exiting the inner iterator and priming it to restart in exactly the same place on the next iteration , and of course it naturally advances the outer iterator .
The only other scenario is when the value of the outer loop iterator is bigger then the inner one , in which case we want to advance the inner one .
This will happen by default , and so needs no special code to handle it .
Sorting OpenStructs
As I said , this post actually a lead into another post , which will be about skip pointers .
This in itself , is no big deal , we still want to intersect lists , the only issue is , they have to be lists of objects rather than lists of primitive integers .
After all you actually need somewhere to put the skip pointers ( if you do n’t really get it , do n’t worry , I ’ll explain in the next post ) .
When I was playing around with skip pointers initially I decided to use OpenStruct to wrap the integers ( which are the values of the arrays we were going to intersect ) .
In hindsight I should have created an object , but I was a bit too far along and did n’t want to go around changing a bunch of code .
Here is the problem .
In order to test my intersection function , I generate arrays of integers , using the following function .
ruby def create_raw_mock_postings_list( min_postings , max_postings , corpus_size ) postings_list = [ ] num_postings = min_postings + rand ( max_postings ) num_postings.times do postings_list << rand ( corpus_size ) + 1 end postings_list.sort.uniq
end
This allows me to dummy up what a posting list for a term would look like ( a particular number of document ids each of which is a random number between 1 and the size of the corpus ) .
The important bits are in the end i.e. _postingslist.sort.uniq .
It is very important that the posting list is sorted and all values are distinct .
This is fine when your value are integers , it all just works .
It would also be fine if the value were objects , since all you would need to do would be to implement the spaceship operator ( < = > , so that you can compare them to each other ) for everything to once again work ( which is why I should have used an object ) .
I , of course , was using OpenStruct and I do n’t know of any way to implement the comparison operator .
When it comes to sort , this is reasonably easy to overcome , since that function takes a block that it can use for comparison , but when it comes to uniq , we ’re out of luck .
I needed a function similar to the following :
ruby def create_wrapped_mock_postings_list(min_postings , max_postings , corpus_size ) postings_list = [ ] num_postings = min_postings + rand ( max_postings ) num_postings.times do wrapped_id = OpenStruct.new wrapped_id.value = rand ( corpus_size ) + 1 postings_list << wrapped_id end postings_list.sort{|x , y| x.value <= > y.value}.block_uniq{|item| item.value} end
Ruby goodness came to the rescue , since we can , once again , open up Array and create our own uniq function .
Like so :
ruby class Array def block_uniq uniqness_hash = {} uniqed_array = [ ] self . each do |value| if block_given ? uniqness_value = yield ( value ) else uniqness_value = value end if !uniqness_hash.key ?( uniqness_value ) uniqed_array << value uniqness_hash [ uniqness_value ] = nil end end uniqed_array end end
We use a hash , to make sure the items are unique ( i.e. if it is already in the hash , discard it ) .
If no block is given to this function it will just operate like a normal uniq function , but when the block is there , it will use the return value of the block rather than the array items themselves to do it ’s job .
Implementing this function allows our create_wrapped_mock_postings_list function to work as intended .
One last thing to note is the fact that our new _blockuniq function preserves the order of the elements of the array we are uniquing , always good to keep things neat .
Intersecting Structs
Now that we ’re dealing with structs rather than integers , our previous intersection function is no longer correct ( for exactly the same reason , why sort and uniq were such a pain , I really should have used an object instead of OpenStruct , it ’s a good learning experience , but let that be a lesson to me for later ) .
We could just slightly alter our intersection function to work with our structs :
ruby def rubyish_intersect_for_wrapped(list1 , list2 ) list3 = [ ] list1.each do |item1 | list2.each_continued do |item2 , index2 | if item1.value == item2.value list3 << item2 index2 + 1 elsif item1.value < item2.value index2 end end end list3 end
This is actually what I did , but is not necessarily a good solution , since we can augment the original function to work either with integers or with structs or anything else , in a similar way to how we implemented our _blockuniq function .
For example :
ruby def rubyish_intersect_for_wrapped( list1 , list2 ) list3 = [ ] list1.each do |item1| list2.each_continued do |item2 , index2 | if yield ( item1 ) == yield ( item2 ) list3 << item2 index2 + 1 elsif yield ( item1 ) < yield ( item2 ) index2 end end end list3 end
We can now call this function like so , when we want to work with structs :
```ruby
when we have just plain integers , we would do :
As the CTIA kicked off its annual conference in Las Vegas yesterday , it also released the results of its semiannual US wireless industry survey for the last half of 2009 .
Even in the face of the largest economic recession since the Great Depression , results show that the wireless industry continues to grow as a vast majority of the US population is using a mobile phone .
The survey of wireless carriers revealed that over 285 million Americans are mobile subscribers , about 91 percent of the total population .
That 's up 15 million over the same time last year , and growth has slowed somewhat due to market saturation .
Those 285 million callers used 1.12 trillion minutes of talk time in the last half of 2009 , up 3.4 percent of the same period in 2008 .
That breaks down to an average of 6.1 billion minutes used per day , or about 21 minutes per person per day .
Wireless service revenues totaled $ 77 billion for the last half of the year , up slightly from last year .
But the real growth is coming from wireless data services — mobile Web , text messages , and other non-voice services .
In the latter half of last year , revenue for wireless data service totaled over $ 22 billion , nearly a third of overall wireless services revenue and up 26 percent year - over - year .
The survey revealed that 257 million " data - capable " devices are active on US carriers ' networks .
However , roughly 50 million of those are smartphones capable of more advanced wireless services than SMS , MMS , and WAP browsing .
Another 12 million are 3G - enabled laptops .
Those devices are responsible for the majority of data service revenues .
" With wireless connections now equal to more than 91 percent of the U.S. population , mobile broadband is pivotal to ensuring all Americans are ' digitally literate , ' " Steve Largent , president and CEO of CTIA , said in a statement .
" Mobile broadband will increasingly play a vital role in people ’s lives . "
CTIA did n't reveal specific numbers on data use , but it did reveal that Americans traded 822 billion text messages — 5 billion per day — for the second half of 2009 , and over 1.5 trillion for the whole year .
MMS messaging is more than double year - over - year for the last half of 2009 , with 24.2 billion photos , videos , and audio clips moving from one mobile phone to another in just six months .
During a keynote presentation at the CTIA conference yesterday , AT&T Mobility CEO and current CTIA chairman Ralph de la Vega also said that the US is tops globally in a number of categories , including number of 3G subscribers , number of smartphones activated , and number of mobile applications purchased .
With May fast approaching , garage sale season is kicking off in the US .
For the DIY crowd , that means a lot of digging through piles of obsolete technology in the hopes of finding something useable , then bargaining with the seller to pay as little for it as possible .
This year , you can add 3.5 ″ floppy drives and disks to your shopping list , courtesy of Daniel McAnulty ’s project Floppy Audio Effects .
Dan figured out a couple of neat tricks to create delay / reverb effects by writing audio to the disks directly , then reading that information back using a tape head .
This type of analog / digital collision is an excellent deliberate misuse of an outdated technology .
I can picture someone DJing an entire live set from Floppys pre-loaded with recorded loops of sound , queing up each ring of audio and letting them phase against each other like a cross between Richie Hawtin and Steve Reich .
Here ’s another experiment , performing a “ continuous record ” by multiplexing the sound across multiple drives .
This is a great hack to get around each floppy ’s somewhat limited record time .
Note the use of an Arduino to keep everything synched up .
Dan says he ’ll be posting more information shortly for anyone interesting in setting up their own floppy - based delay line system .
Keep up the good work , sir .

Flying is a heated topic .
But if there is no such thing as an ' eco - friendly ' flight , is grounding planes the only option ?
Does air travel really have a big environmental footprint ?
There 's no way around the fact that flights are bad news for the environment .
It 's not just that planes are worse than most other forms of transport in terms of the impact of greenhouse gases per passenger mile .
Just as important is the simple fact that flying allows us to travel a far greater number of miles than we otherwise could .
Thanks to these two factors , individual trips by air can have a remarkably large carbon footprint – which helps explain why aviation has become such a heated issue in the climate change debate .
What is the total impact of flying on the climate ?
As the aviation industry is usually keen to point out , planes account for only around 1.5 % –2 % of global CO2 emissions .
However , this figure is somewhat misleading .
For one thing , most flights are taken by the wealthy , so in developed countries the slice of CO2 emissions caused by flying is higher – around 6.3 % in the UK , according to Department for Transport figures for 2005 .
Even this figure underplays aviation 's environmental footprint , however , and not just because the number of flights has risen since 2005 .
There are at least three other reasons why 6.3 % is likely to be a strong underestimate .
First , the total global warming impact of each flight is thought to be around twice as high as the CO2 emissions alone ( see ' What 's an aviation multiplier ? ' , below ) .
Second , the figures are skewed in favour of British travellers .
The standard way to account for the emissions for an international flight is to allocate half to the country of departure and half to the country of arrival .
But UK residents take up two - thirds of the seats on the average plane landing at or taking off from a British airport .
This means the official statistics are effectively offloading the emissions of British holidaymakers and businesspeople on to the countries they 're visiting .
Third , the aviation industry causes emissions over and above those of the planes themselves .
The processing and transportation of the aviation fuel , and the manufacture and maintenance of planes , airports and support vehicles all create extra carbon dioxide .
There 's not enough data to say for sure , but it seems likely that aviation 's true impact in the UK is around 13 % – 15 % of total greenhouse gas emissions .
If that still sounds fairly low , compared with the massive amounts of attention heaped on aviation by climate change campaigners , bear in mind that most people in the UK do n't regularly fly .
The average British resident takes a short - haul leisure flight only every two years , and a long - haul leisure flight only every five years .
In other words , the air travel of a minority of regular flyers causes a substantial slice of UK emissions .
Is the UK government 's aviation policy compatible with its carbon targets ?
It 's very hard to reconcile the British government 's plans for increased aviation capacity with its plans for carbon cuts .
The UK is seeking to reduce its emissions by 80 % by 2050 , relative to 1990 levels .
At the same time it predicts a rise in the number of flights sufficient to use up more than half of the remaining 20 % of emissions .
What about greener planes ?
A number of technologies designed to reduce the environmental impact of flying have been researched , tested and implemented .
However , compared with greener cars , where the technologies are proved and the carbon saving huge , the potential for eco-friendly flying looks rather limited .
There will be some further gains in engine efficiency over the coming decades , and larger planes with more seats will allow slightly lower emissions per passenger .
But there is nothing in the pipeline with the transformative potential of the electric car .
The problem is that electric motors can't produce enough power to get a plane off the ground , so the only alternative to regular kerosene - based aviation fuels are special kinds of biofuels .
These are n't an ideal solution , since biofuels can be environmentally problematic in themselves , and anyhow it would take a huge chunk of the world 's arable land to grow enough crops to fuel all the world 's planes .
( A back - of - the - envelope calculation suggests it might require as much as a fifth of all cropland . )
What can individuals do ?
For anyone concerned about their contribution to global warming , cutting back on air travel is an obvious goal .
This might mean giving up flying altogether or it might mean taking fewer flights and picking destinations that are closer to home .
It 's true that short flights tend to be more harmful to the climate per mile travelled than long - haul flights are ( because they have more empty seats , and because taking off and landing burns more fuel than cruising ) but this does n't change the fact that the further you travel , the greater the emissions that will result .
If you do fly , you can in theory make some small difference to the carbon impact by favouring day - time flights .
This at least means that any contrails ( see ' What 's an aviation multiplier ? ' below ) caused by the plane will reflect some sunlight away from the Earth in addition to locking warmth into the atmosphere .
Also consider limiting your luggage .
Finally , you might want to consider which airlines you use .
People often assume that budget flights are somehow more eco-unfriendly than expensive ones .
In fact , the opposite tends to be true .
Budget airlines pack more passengers on each flight and typically have younger , more fuel - efficient fleets than longer - established airlines .
Indeed , the least eco-friendly tickets of all are n't the cheapest but the most expensive .
Business - class and first - class seats take up more space on the plane , thereby reducing the number of people who can fit on each flight .
Is it really greener to go by train ?
As a rule , taking the train instead of the plane will substantially reduce your carbon emissions – perhaps by a factor of five to ten on a domestic trip .
The benefits will be somewhat reduced as the journey gets longer .
That 's partly because shorter flights are more polluting per passenger mile than longer ones , but it's also because long train journeys usually necessitate sleeping onboard .
Sleeper cars usually carry fewer passengers than regular carriages , so their emissions per passenger are higher .
If , as is common in some countries , the train is powered by diesel rather than electricity , then the emissions will typically be higher still .
Indeed , an old diesel sleeper train travelling a long distance might emit nearly as much CO2 ₂per passenger as a plane .
Even then , the train will typically be greener once you consider the plane 's non-CO2 warming effects , but the fact remains that long - haul rail is not by any means inherently eco-friendly .
Unfortunately , almost every long - distance train journey will cost you far more than flying would .
Indeed , the difference in price is often so great that for some unavoidable trips it would arguably make sense to take the plane and spend the savings on something more environmentally beneficial than a train ticket , such as insulation at home .
What 's an ' aviation multiplier ' ?
The impact of planes on the climate is complicated and not perfectly understood .
The CO2 emissions are straightforward enough , but plane engines also generate a host of other " outputs " , including nitrous oxide , water vapour and soot .
At flying altitudes in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere , these outputs produce a range of climatic effects , multiplying the plane 's environmental impact .
For example , nitrous oxide causes the formation of ozone — a greenhouse gas that warms the local climate — but at the same time undergoes reactions which destroy methane , thereby removing another greenhouse gas from the atmosphere .
Even more complicated is the impact of soot and water vapour , which together can cause contrails ( vapour trails ) and in cold air can lead to the formation of cirrus clouds .
The science surrounding this topic is not yet rock solid , but researchers believe that contrails add to the greenhouse effect – especially at night , when their tendency to stop heat escaping from the Earth is n't offset by their tendency to reflect incoming sunlight .
Today , most experts favour an aviation " multiplier " of around two .
In other words , they believe that the total impact of a plane is approximately twice as high as its CO2 emissions .
The exact multiplier , however , will always depend on the individual plane , the local climate and the time of day .

The Venus Express spacecraft has found convincing evidence that Earth is not the only geologically active planet in the solar system .
Infrared emissions from lava flows on the surface of Venus indicate that they are relatively young , which means the planet may still be capable of volcanic eruptions .
" The solidified lava flows , which radiate heat from the surface , seem hardly weathered .
So we can conclude that they are younger than 2.5 million years old – and the majority are probably younger than 250,000 years , " Jörn Helbert of the DLR Institute of Planetary Research in Germany , co-author of a study published April 8 in Science , said in a press release .
" In geological terms , this means that they are practically from the present day . "
The results could explain why there are fewer asteroid impacts than expected on the planet 's surface .
Volcanism has been the prime suspect , because lava flows can fill in and obscure craters .
But scientists were unsure whether a major episode of volcanic activity resurfaced much of the planet all at once in the past , or if intermittent activity has slowly filled in craters over time .
The existence of a recent flow suggests the latter is more likely , and that volcanism may be ongoing .
Venus is shrouded in a thick cloud cover which obscures the visible light emissions form the surface .
So a team led by Suzanne Smrekar of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory studied the thermal emissions of the surface using the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer on the Venus Express orbiter .
Older surfaces tend to be smoothed by weathering over time , while younger surfaces are more rough and have higher thermal emissions .
Several areas on the surface had been identified as potential volcanic centers by radar imagery data from the Magellan mission , which ended in 1994 when the spacecraft was intentionally crashed into the surface .
Smrekar 's team targeted three of these areas and found they had higher thermal emissions than the surrounding areas .
“ Now we have strong evidence right at the surface for recent eruptions , ” Smrekar said in a press release .
Because Venus is similar in size and internal structure to Earth , comparisons between the two planets can help scientists understand our own planet 's evolution .
If volcanism on Venus is also similar to Earth , as the new study indicates , that narrows the factors that could have sent the planets on such different paths that ended with Earth being habitable and Venus being bone dry and hellishly hot .
In order to determine what the young rock is made of , Helbert plans to build a lab that can heat various rock types to around 900 degrees Fahrenheit , the planet 's surface temperature , and study their thermal emission signatures to compare to the Venus Express readings .

Justinmind ’s top 10 wireframing tips to take your web or mobile design process to the next level .
Pay special attention to number 2 !
The wireframe is an important element of any web or mobile design project .
Whether it ’s just a quick sketch on paper or you ’re building a digital prototype with a UI kit , wireframing can make your design process better .
For instance , Shopify shows us how presenting wireframes for design approval can help clearly communicate plans to your team , client , and key stakeholders .
So if this is the first time you ’ll be wireframing , it ’s time to get your feet wet .
Here are 10 wireframing tips that will help convert your earliest ideas into design success stories .
Wireframing tip # 1 — identify the design problem , rather than creating more
At the beginning of the design process , there is a tendency to want to find solutions , rather than tackling the initial problem .
You may have a good design idea .
But before you dive off the deep end , create a wireframe and allow that idea to evolve .
You ’ll end up with a great design that actually resolves the initial problem .
Wireframes help us identify problems , visualize and test out possible ways to overcome them and rework down the line .
Sure , not all design ideas work out .
But it ’s way easier to make changes early on during the wireframing phase , than after having written all that code .
With a design tool like Justinmind , you can jump between changes you ’ve made to your wireframes without losing any content .
It ’s called version control and will help you fail forward .
Wireframing tip # 2 — always design user - first
Your users are the ones you need to impress .
Making your design user - centered will encourage users to stay on your site or app and hopefully convert .
That ’s what this is all about after all 😉
In order to design user - first , you ’ll need to know what your users needs are .
The first step towards capturing the user ’s needs is to understand your target users and customers , using personas .
Personas are fictional characters used in design and typically have a name and picture ; relevant characteristics such as a role , activities , behaviors , and attitudes ; and a goal , which is the problem that has to be addressed or the benefit that should be provided .
Learn how to create user personas here .
Remember : You +
Us +
Them = Something Useful

Wireframing tip # 3 — stick to a deadline
If you want to keep a project moving , divide it up into phases , assign deadlines and stick to them .
Time keeping is an important skill for everyone involved in the design process – but especially when it comes to wireframing .
Do n’t spend longer than is needed on a wireframe – in fact , pixel perfection is frowned upon at this stage in the game .
Once you ’ve defined the scope of your design project , try to think about a timeline that you can follow .
Justinmind ’s Atlassian Jira integration will help you track tour time and manage your requirements at the same time .
Wireframing tip # 4 — choose functionality over beauty ( at least for now )
Let ’s take a trip down memory lane : usability and accessibility come first , the aesthetics can wait .
No matter how beautiful your interface , if users can’t work it , they will leave .
Start by mapping out the main screens in your web or mobile UI – learn how to create a new screen in your Justinmind wireframe here .
Add the main components , such as the navigation system and the UI elements that directly contribute to the user journey .
Test these out before you get any deeper into the visual details .
Wireframing tip # 5 — keep everyone in the loop
One of the key objectives of wireframing is to communicate an initial design idea .
Keep your wireframes simple and make sure that they fulfill their purpose of communicating and translating ideas .
It ’s important that everyone involved in the process , from designers and developers to stakeholders and users has a say and can give feedback .
A wireframe can act as a blueprint with which designers , developers , architects and project managers can work on to get everyone up to scratch , so allow it to work its magic .
With Justinmind , you can keep everyone in the loop with our teamwork and collaboration features .
Users can work on the same wireframe simultaneously , locking out areas to avoid overriding their colleagues ’ work .
Wireframing tip # 6 — content is King
Even though wireframes do n’t necessarily focus on the details , you ’re still going to want to home in on some of the atomic elements and features of your final end - product .
If your wireframes are n’t sketches , be realistic about the amount of content that will be added to the page .
This holds true for the number and length of links in the navigation too .
If possible , use accurately sized fonts , images and graphics , and consider what will happen to the design when more content is added .
The last thing you want it stakeholders thinking that heaps and heaps of extra content can be included .
With Justinmind , you can use our rules , guides and grids to help you keep your content hierarchy on point .
Wireframing tip # 7 — aim for consistency
A consistent app or webpage is always helpful , to users , stakeholders and product teams alike .
Customer loyalty is built on trust , and trust requires familiarity and consistency .
Consistency makes the world go round , and , of course , sites easier to use .
For instance , think about older users who might be more inclines to stay on a website if they are familiar with the navigation system .
For instance , uses are more likely to revisit your website if they can easily navigate it the first time round .
Keep things simple and consistent .
Opt for a low fidelity wireframe to test out your initial ideas .
Then , use templates and masters to avoid rework and maintain consistency across wireframe screens .
Wireframing tip # 8 — take advantage of with 3rd - party integrations
Tired of design tools that do n’t talk to each other ?
Choose a tool that works well with other resources , no matter the work flow .
Justinmind is integrated with several other design tools , such as Illustrator and Sketch .
Export your Sketch artboards and start building them into interactive prototypes with Justinmind .
You can even choose which artboards to export when .
Wireframing tip # 9 — keep your design process server - side and secure
A secure design process will help keep your stakeholders happy , and should be best practice every time .
Stakeholders should feel that your resources comply with their specific needs .
Justinmind Enterprise allows you to host your wireframes on your own servers , for added security and personalization .
This is particularly important when working with sensitive or confidential material .
Your entire organization is able to collaborate on - premise behind your corporate firewall .
You can also password protect each of your wireframes for added security .
Wireframing tip # 10 — pick the right tool
Using the wrong tool to build your wireframe can ruin your initial design and increase the chances of rework and errors down the line .
Getting ideas out on paper is often a good way to start throwing together ideas and concepts .
However , you should be thinking about moving on to wireframing and prototyping as the project evolves .
Choose a tool like Justinmind that allows you to build in dynamic content , interaction and animation .
Justinmind is a complete low to high - fidelity wireframing and prototyping tool that allows you to create designs that you can present to everyone .

WASHINGTON — US President Barack Obama on Tuesday said his administration wanted to see all countries sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , including Israel .
At the end of a 47 - nation nuclear summit that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to attend , Obama was asked about Israel ’s refusal to join the NPT even as Washington works to bolster enforcement of the treaty .

“ As far as Israel goes , I ’m not going to comment about their program , ” Obama told a news conference .
But he said that “ whether we are talking about Israel or any other country , we think that becoming part of the NPT is important . ”
That was a long - held US position that preceded the current administration , Obama added .
Foreign military experts believe Israel has an arsenal of several hundred nuclear warheads , but Israel has never publicly acknowledged it has nuclear weapons and has maintained a policy of deliberate ambiguity .
Israel , like nuclear - armed countries India , Pakistan , and North Korea , is not a signatory to the nuclear NPT to avoid international inspections .
ADVERTISEMENT
Obama ’s comments came after Prime Minister Netanyahu abruptly pulled out of the nuclear summit last week , and amid the worst tensions between the two allies in years .
Israeli media said Netanyahu was concerned that Muslim nations attending the conference planned to press for Israel to open its own nuclear facilities to international inspection .
Netanhayu ’s decision underscored Israeli reluctance to expose its own nuclear programme to scrutiny , even as it voices growing concern over Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .
In a sign Republicans may be worried that health reform is more popular than they ’re willing to admit , the GOP senator famed for saying the health overhaul will “ pull the plug on grandma ” is now taking credit for some of its elements .
In a press release put out this past weekend , Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said he “ worked successfully to improve Medicare payments to doctors in rural states like Iowa and , in turn , access for beneficiaries , as part of the health care reform enacted this year . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
That got the attention of MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow , who reported on Grassley ’s new argument on Tuesday night .
“ I voted against it , and it ’ll kill your grandma , but if there ’s any chance you like it , would you mind giving me credit for it ? ”
Maddow mocked .
Grassley made waves last summer when he told an Iowa crowd , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ You have every right to fear .
You should nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t have counseling at the end of life , you should have done that 20 years before .
Should not have a government run plan to decide when to pull the plug on grandma .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
Maddow also noted that Grassley has been criticizing the health care law ’s individual mandate requiring people to buy health insurance as “ unconstitutional , ” even though he “ himself proposed a health insurance mandate back when Republicans were opposed to President Clinton ’s health reform ideas . ”
This is not the first time Grassley has tried to associate himself with the health care law he voted against .
A day after President Obama signed health reform into law , Grassley sent out a press release to reporters which stated that “ health care legislation signed into law yesterday includes provisions Grassley co-authored to impose standards for the tax exemption of charitable hospitals for the first time . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The press release added : “ The provisions enacted in the new health care law are the result of Grassley ’s leadership on tax - exempt organizations ’ accountability and transparency , including hospitals . ”
“ Senator Grassley is up for re-election in November , needless to say , ” Maddow said .

SUNSHINE Coast Council will spend $ 28 million during the next four years in a desperate bid to retain and enhance the remains of what was once considered one of the world ’s most biodiverse regions .
Studies show eight flora species are endangered and a further 29 are listed for concern as the pressure of population growth impacts on the natural environment .
Council ’s biodiversity strategy released this week earmarks $ 19.6 million to buy environmentally - significant land and a further $ 8.3 million for community grants and partnerships to rejuvenate degraded vegetation .
The projects would be funded from the environment levy which collects $ 9 million annually .
The council will settle next week on the $ 1.125 million purchase of 37ha of land of outstanding biodiversity values to extend the Ringtail Creek Conservation area .
The purchase has been supported by $ 800,000 worth of federal funding .
The council is also nearing purchase of a $ 1.4 million Cooroibah property to connect existing conservation areas .
Two other properties are also being actively pursued .
“ We always try to extend environment levy funding by accessing grants from other levels of government , but we ca n’t do that without the levy , ” environment head Cr Keryn Jones said .
Before the 2009 - 10 financial year a further four properties valued at $ 4.98 million were purchased with the last settling in October , 2009 .
The Commonwealth provided $ 1.689 m towards the cost .
The council would also look at the purchase of land to establish permanent nature covenants before on - selling the properties .
The region has 133,500 ha of remnant vegetation , over half of which is in private ownership and 6674 ha within the urban footprint .
The biodiversity strategy would guide investment in key environmental programs , provide a platform for landscape protection and restoration and inform the regional planning scheme .
Cr Jones said improved mapping of the natural habitat would drive a strategy that aimed to protect , enhance and connect key areas of biodiversity .
She said the environment levy was critical to the process .
Ms Jones said the good will and support of the State Government would vastly improve council ’s ability to maintain the environmental advantage that not only was the tourism industry ’s competitive edge , but also acted as an attraction to business and enhanced community well being .
She said the state ’s failure to support the requirement that Stockland provide 2000 ha of rehabilitated land to offset the impact of the 2100 ha Caloundra South development was a big hit for the environment .
The council would use mapping to develop the more detailed planning needed to determine the region ’s appropriate residential growth capacity regardless of the push to boost population to 497,000 .
WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans , united in opposition to the Democrats ’ legislation to tighten regulation of the financial system , voted on Monday to block the bill from reaching the floor for debate .
As both sides dug in , the battle has huge ramifications for the economy and for their political prospects in this year ’s midterm elections .
Republicans said they were intent on winning substantive changes to the bill and accused the Democrats of rushing the most far - reaching overhaul of the financial regulatory system since the Great Depression .
Both sides say they expect the overhaul eventually will be approved .
Democrats charged that Republicans were leaving the country at risk of another financial calamity and siding with wealthy corporate interests .
The chief executive of one such firm , Goldman Sachs , the Wall Street powerhouse accused of fraud by federal regulators , is to testify Tuesday before a Senate committee .
Sensing political momentum at a time of deep public anger at Wall Street , Democratic leaders said they would keep the regulatory bill on the floor — and delay the rest of their busy legislative agenda — to ratchet up the pressure on the Republicans .
Still no inquiry .
Still no answers .
A trillion pounds has been devoted over the past 18 months to protect Britain 's financial system from alleged Armageddon , with not a murmur of value for money .
This stupefying sum is more than has ever been spent on any project by any government in British history .
We know where the money came from but we do not know if it was necessary , nor who now has it .
We know only that , a year on , Britain is experiencing a worse recession than any comparable country .
The lack of accountability , the sheer lack of curiosity from the political community , is amazing .
The nearest to an explanation came from the man responsible , Alistair Darling , on Michael Cockerell 's recent BBC documentary on the Treasury .
If he had not acted in October 2008 as he did , Darling asserted , " the bank doors could n't have opened , cash machines would n't have functioned .
All over the world people would n't have got money " .
Who says ?
The reality is that at the time , a year after Northern Rock and with Lloyds / HBOS and RBS faltering in the wake of the Lehman Brothers collapse , Whitehall was in policy turmoil .
Every option was in the air .
Darling and his patron , Gordon Brown , were in perpetual conclave with advisers such as Lord Myners and Lady Vadera and Downing Street 's " UBS mafia " .
Calls were coming from important City figures saying such things as , " We ca n't go on beyond lunchtime … Give us the money " .
Faced with a global asset bubble of some $ 290 trillion about to burst , a frantic Darling started throwing millions , then billions , then a trillion at underpinning the banks ' near worthless " casino " debts .
He never spent such money on indebted homeowners or indebted manufacturers or indebted African states .
He did it to banks because they told him they were too big to fail .
Advised by bankers , surrounded by bankers , obsessed with bankers , Darling paid .
I would like to know why .
Ask those involved and they go wide - eyed and mutter " Armageddon " , rather like Tony Blair explaining the Iraq invasion .
To these people , not letting banks fail was not an option but a creed .
They cannot explain what is " wrong " with taking hold of a reckless bank in trouble , guaranteeing its deposits ( and cash machines ) and continuing to lend against a Treasury guarantee , while dumping the casino activities into administration .
Shareholders lose out , but that 's capitalism .
Talk of bank doors closing is rubbish .
Andrew Ross Sorkin's Too Big To Fail , the chaotic but gripping saga of September 2008 , tells of Wall Street and Washington playing with the " good bank , bad bank " option over and again .
At one point Lehman 's toxics were to be hived off into a SpinCo ( dubbed ShitCo by Wall Street ) .
It did not happen , but a version was tried at AIG .
In Britain in 2007 , Northern Rock was both nationalised and reorganised on a good bank , bad bank basis .
The good bank reported this week , and should soon repay the taxpayers their investment .
The policy worked .
So why were RBS and Lloyds / HBOS not fully nationalised , rather than given unconditional largesse ?
Speaking at this year 's Spectator lunch , Darling boasted that " I own four banks " .
They appear to own him .
They assured him they would use his money to lend to businesses and homeowners to avert recession .
They lied and Darling knew it .
He knew his money would disappear into underwriting the banks ' casino debts and overheating the stock market .
By December 2009 , a year after the bailout began , bank lending was not stagnant but declining at an unprecedented rate .
Still Darling did not relent .
Indeed he made lending harder by increasing VAT , reducing high street demand and rendering commercial lending more , not less , risky .
Meanwhile the Bank of England poured cash into bank balance sheets .
An Economist headline put it pithily : " Banks fine : pity about the customers . "
Darling did not even require banks to curb their extraordinary bonuses , even when they consumed a large share of reported losses .
The American financier , Warren Buffett , famously protested that banks were " being run for their employees … with lucrative paydays that enriched people who are not particularly intelligent and add little value " .
Since he claims to own them , Darling might at least explain why he was further enriching them at public expense .
Last year John McFall , the Labour chairman of the Commons treasury committee , argued for a " state bank " .
There were four already , but economically inert .
When RBS returned to the casino tables , the money it spent was draining from the real economy in Darling 's repeat of the Thatcher / Howe recessionary squeeze of 1980 - 81 .
At a time when consumer demand was collapsing , the government found itself unable to respond with more VAT cuts , pensions bonuses , higher social security and more public projects , in other words a classical Keynesian answer to a slump .
That is what Germany and many far eastern countries did , with benefits rises , tax holidays and consumer scrappage schemes .
The British government did the opposite .
It ended such schemes , increased VAT and made deep cuts in government ( which means also private ) spending .
Small wonder one in four high street stores might be facing closure – but no more banks .
Darling continued to claim that his printing of new money through quantitative easing was aiding business .
Yet each week the financial pages reported how the extra money was evaporating , most of it disappearing overseas .
It would have been better to adopt the old monetarist answer to recession , of dropping bank notes on shoppers from helicopters .
I appreciate there may be arguments against this analysis , but it would be good to hear them .
Why did Darling not let HBOS or Lloyds fail , merely guaranteeing their deposits ?
Alternatively , why did he not nationalise and split up the ailing banks in October 2008 ?
Again , if they really were too big to fail , as they alleged , why has he not made them emphatically smaller , so when they fail next time they do not drag the economy down with them ?
Gillian
Tett 's book on the psychology of credit greed , Fool 's Gold , shows the corrupting effect of unfettered derivatives trading on the whole financial system .
Darling has done nothing to mitigate that effect .
The world is alive with talk of curbs on bonuses , hedge funds , short trading , proprietary dealing and transaction taxes .
There is talk of stress tests , living wills and higher reserve ratios .
In almost all these arguments , Labour ministers are on the side of unregulated banking and against further controls .
They are the wildest of free - marketeers .
Brown and Darling have gone native and become puppets on a banker 's string .
Britain has paid , and will go on paying , a horrific price for this government allowing bankers to dictate credit policy after 2008 .
To avoid ministers suffering the ideological odium of proper nationalisation ( as opposing to bailing - out ) , Britain is being forced to lose jobs , firms , infrastructure , prosperity and the happiness it brings .
Too big to fail has taken a savage toll on the economy .
If it was worth it , I would like to see the account .
If not , someone should pay .
Yet because the policy was backed by all three main parties , there is no questioning , no inquiry .
All is silence .

Today , the President announced that he will be issuing an executive order after the passage of the health insurance reform law that will reaffirm its consistency with longstanding restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion .
While the legislation as written maintains current law , the executive order provides additional safeguards to ensure that the status quo is upheld and enforced , and that the health care legislation ’s restrictions against the public funding of abortions cannot be circumvented .
The President has said from the start that this health insurance reform should not be the forum to upset longstanding precedent .
The health care legislation and this executive order are consistent with this principle .
The President is grateful for the tireless efforts of leaders on both sides of this issue to craft a consensus approach that allows the bill to move forward .
A text of the pending executive order follows :
EXECUTIVE ORDER
- - - - - - -
ENSURING ENFORCEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ABORTION RESTRICTIONS IN THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America , including the “ Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ” ( approved March __ , 2010 ) , I hereby order as follows :
Section 1 . Policy .
Following the recent passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( “ the Act ” ) , it is necessary to establish an adequate enforcement mechanism to ensure that Federal funds are not used for abortion services ( except in cases of rape or incest , or when the life of the woman would be endangered ) , consistent with a longstanding Federal statutory restriction that is commonly known as the Hyde Amendment .
The purpose of this Executive Order is to establish a comprehensive , government - wide set of policies and procedures to achieve this goal and to make certain that all relevant actors — Federal officials , state officials ( including insurance regulators ) and health care providers — are aware of their responsibilities , new and old .
The Act maintains current Hyde Amendment restrictions governing abortion policy and extends those restrictions to the newly - created health insurance exchanges .
Under the Act , longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience ( such as the Church Amendment , 42 U.S.C. § 300a - 7 , and the Weldon Amendment , Pub. L. No. 111-8 , §508 ( d ) ( 1 ) ( 2009 ) ) remain intact and new protections prohibit discrimination against health care facilities and health care providers because of an unwillingness to provide , pay for , provide coverage of , or refer for abortions .
Numerous executive agencies have a role in ensuring that these restrictions are enforced , including the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) , and the Office of Personnel Management ( OPM ) .
Section 2 . Strict Compliance with Prohibitions on Abortion Funding in Health Insurance Exchanges .
The Act specifically prohibits the use of tax credits and cost - sharing reduction payments to pay for abortion services ( except in cases of rape or incest , or when the life of the woman would be endangered ) in the health insurance exchanges that will be operational in 2014 .
The Act also imposes strict payment and accounting requirements to ensure that Federal funds are not used for abortion services in exchange plans ( except in cases of rape or incest , or when the life of the woman would be endangered ) and requires state health insurance commissioners to ensure that exchange plan funds are segregated by insurance companies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles , OMB funds management circulars , and accounting guidance provided by the Government Accountability Office .
I hereby direct the Director of OMB and the Secretary of HHS to develop , within 180 days of the date of this Executive Order , a model set of segregation guidelines for state health insurance commissioners to use when determining whether exchange plans are complying with the Act ’s segregation requirements , established in Section 1303 of the Act , for enrollees receiving Federal financial assistance .
The guidelines shall also offer technical information that states should follow to conduct independent regular audits of insurance companies that participate in the health insurance exchanges .
In developing these model guidelines , the Director of OMB and the Secretary of HHS shall consult with executive agencies and offices that have relevant expertise in accounting principles , including , but not limited to , the Department of the Treasury , and with the Government Accountability Office .
Upon completion of those model guidelines , the Secretary of HHS should promptly initiate a rulemaking to issue regulations , which will have the force of law , to interpret the Act ’s segregation requirements , and shall provide guidance to state health insurance commissioners on how to comply with the model guidelines .
Section 3 . Community Health Center Program .
The Act establishes a new Community Health Center ( CHC ) Fund within HHS , which provides additional Federal funds for the community health center program .
Existing law prohibits these centers from using federal funds to provide abortion services ( except in cases of rape or incest , or when the life of the woman would be endangered ) , as a result of both the Hyde Amendment and longstanding regulations containing the Hyde language .
Under the Act , the Hyde language shall apply to the authorization and appropriations of funds for Community Health Centers under section 10503 and all other relevant provisions .
I hereby direct the Secretary of HHS to ensure that program administrators and recipients of Federal funds are aware of and comply with the limitations on abortion services imposed on CHCs by existing law .
Such actions should include , but are not limited to , updating Grant Policy Statements that accompany CHC grants and issuing new interpretive rules .
Section 4 . General Provisions .
( a) Nothing in this Executive Order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect : ( i ) authority granted by law or presidential directive to an agency , or the head thereof ; or ( ii ) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary , administrative , or legislative proposals .
( b) This Executive Order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations .
( c) This Executive Order is not intended to , and does not , create any right or benefit , substantive or procedural , enforceable at law or in equity against the United States , its departments , agencies , entities , officers , employees or agents , or any other person .
THE WHITE HOUSE ,
RLSLOG , one of the world ’s most popular release news sites , has been pulled offline by its German hosting company following a takedown request from Universal Music .
The site , which has never hosted any copyrighted material on its servers , is currently looking for a new home outside Germany .
With millions of visitors every month , RLSLOG has grown out to be the authority when it comes to news about scene releases .
A hard - working team of editors constantly ensures that fresh releases are covered daily , week in week out .
Yesterday , however , its readers were shook up by an absence of news .
Instead of seeing the regular homepage , visitors were welcomed by the following unpleasant message :
“ RLSLOG . net was suspended by its German hosting company after removal request from law firm representing Universal Music , although we never hosted any files or copyrighted data on our server .
Our site is strictly informative , ” the message reads .
TorrentFreak briefly caught up with RLSLOG founder Martin who told us that he ’s currently trying to find a new home for his site , hopefully with a hosting company that will not shut down the site so easily .
The suspension came without prior notice , hence the downtime .
This is not the first time that RLSLOG is been put out of action by takedown notices .
Last year , Web Sheriff sent complaints to RLSLOG ’s former host and the host ’s bandwidth provider , who then took the site offline .
Also , Google has filtered several of RLSLOG ’s pages from its search results after complaints from copyright holders .
These issues raise the question whether sites such as RLSLOG are acting within the law or not .
Technically the site is not hosting any copyrighted material , but it generally does point readers to various locations where copyrighted material can be found .
Legally , this is a gray area in most countries .
As we ’ve learned from the cases against torrent sites like The Pirate Bay and Mininova , not hosting copyrighted material on ones site is no prerequisite for the courts to find operators not guilty of assisting in copyright infringement .
RLSLOG might actually have an even worse case since the ‘ links ’ are selected and published by the site ’s editors .
Refraining from posting links to searches or files hosted externally might be the only option to avoid legal issues at a future host .
However , for RLSLOG founder Martin , his primary concern is finding a new hosting provider so he can get the site back online again .
Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Says Catholic Church Should End Celibacy Rules for Priests
Oscar Arias , the president of Costa Rica , recently stated that he believes the time has come for the Roman Catholic church to cease demanding celibacy from its priests .
He also stated on Wednesday that he supports a new proposal put forth by lawmakers in his country to grant rights to same - sex couples .
Saying " sexual orientation is given by God or by nature , " he urged his countrymen to respect homosexuals .

A new report by the American Community Survey has determined that Salvadorans have replaced Dominicans as the fourth largest Latino group living in the United States .
ACS , which analyzed data from 2008 says that the top the three largest Latino groups remain Mexicans , Puerto Ricans and Cubans .
The National Institute for Latino Policy notes that results of the 2010 Census are necessary in order to accurately reflect current Latino subgroup figures .

Which space rock ?
DECIDING to send astronauts to an asteroid is all very well , but now NASA will have to find the few space rocks that are suitable to visit , and work out how to rendezvous safely .
Last month , US president Barack Obama announced the next destination for NASA astronauts would be an asteroid , as early as 2025 .
The goal would be to gain experience of safely sending humans far from Earth , as a stepping stone towards longer journeys to Mars .
Studying the interior of an asteroid up close could also prove important if …

As Jesus was on his way , the crowds almost crushed him .
And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years , but no one could heal her .
She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak , and immediately her bleeding stopped .
“ Who touched me ? ” Jesus asked .
When they all denied it , Peter said , “ Master , the people are crowding and pressing against you . ”
But Jesus said , “ Someone touched me ; I know that power has gone out from me . ” — Luke , 8:42 - 46

A teenage girl is crying , sobbing inconsolably , her face a tear - streaked mask of sweet anguish .
She ’s English , dressed in schoolboy drag : a white dress shirt and blazer , topped off with the regulation necktie .
Pinned to her jacket is a photo button of David Bowie in character as Ziggy Stardust .
She exhibits all the emotional stigmata of Ziggymania , a hormonally fueled religious hysteria that convulsed Anglo - American teen culture from 1972 until 1974 , if not later .
We ’re watching her in a 1973 report on the Bowie phenomenon by the BBC news program Nationwide , uploaded to YouTube .
“ They said ‘e was comin ’ ‘ round the back !
I ’ve been waiting for ages to see ‘ im , ” she wails , agonized at missing the star ’s limousine arrive .
“ Why ’re you so upset ? ” a bemused interviewer asks , across a generational chasm .
She looks up , incredulous at the man ’s inability to grasp the obvious : “ He ’s smashing ! ” Another girl crowds into the frame , as radiantly happy as her friend is distraught .
“ I kissed his hand ! ” she gasps , in the grip of some mystical eros .
“ I kissed his hand !
I went ( mimes kissing Bowie ’s hand ) ; Oh , he ’s lovely ! ”

It pleased our Lord , one day that I was in prayer , to show me His Hands , and His Hands only .
The beauty of them was so great , that no language can describe it . [ … ]
You will think … that it required no great courage to look upon Hands … so beautiful .
But so beautiful are glorified bodies , that the glory which surrounds them renders those who see that which is so supernatural and beautiful beside themselves .

Ziggy Stardust , for anyone who was n’t a teenager in the seventies , is the protagonist of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars , Bowie ’s 1972 concept album about a Martian prophet of “ soul love ” who touches down on a doomed Earth .
Proclaiming an astro - hippie gospel of transcendence through free love ( “ let all the children boogie , ” unquote ) , Ziggy seizes on rock stardom as the most effective media pulpit for his message .
Not content with mere celebrity , he imagines himself a “ leper messiah . ”
But , like too many telegenic holy men , he ends up seduced by his own Cult of Personality : “ making love with his ego / Ziggy sucked up into his mind ” ( “ Ziggy Stardust ” ) .
In the Ziggy outtake “ Sweet Head , ” he sings , “ Your faith in me can last / Besides , I ’m known to lay you , one and all , ” then tosses off a line calculated to outrage : “ Till there was rock , you only had God . ”
In the end , he ’s murdered by his crazed fans , torn limb from limb onstage .
His jealous backing band , The Spiders from Mars — who had “ bitched about his fans ” and toyed with Golgotha - friendly fantasies of “ crush[ing ] his sweet hands ” — wash their hands , Pontius Pilate - like , of the whole sordid business : “ When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band . ”
In concert , Bowie became Ziggy , introducing himself and his band as “ Ziggy and the Spiders . ”
Forehead emblazoned with a gilded moon , hair dyed drop - dead red and spiked into a Kabuki frightwig , he was a vision of posthuman beauty , with a face like Garbo ’s death mask and a leer on loan from Alex , the ultra-violent punk in A Clockwork Orange .
And the costume changes — a whole clothes rack ’s - worth of them , each more jaw - dropping than the last : sci - fi samurai in a tear - away kimono ; camp Flash Gordon in a skin - tight jumpsuit ; gay - pride sumo wrestler in a sequined jockstrap ; Surrealist burlesque dancer shimmying in a man - bra made of glitter - skinned mannequin hands .
Freeze - framed in the eerie pulsations of a strobe , with the raunchy proto-punk of the Spiders squalling behind him , Bowie — Ziggy ? — seemed truly Not of This World , especially to teenagers trapped in the have - a- nice - daymare of ’70s suburbia .
He was a spiked cocktail of ladyboy vulnerability and George Grosz grotesque , the Frankensteinian spookiness of his shaved eyebrows and morgue - slab pallor clashing with his androgynous physique and feline grace .
Even his weirdly mismatched eyes — the result of a boyhood fistfight that left one pupil permanently dilated and different - colored — marked him as a resident alien .
“ It was quite scary to see someone on stage who did look like an alien , ” recalled a Bowie fan named Bernard .
“ I remember I got really confused and at one point I really did think he was something alien … in all that Ziggy get - up , he was such an awe - inspiring figure . ”
At the height of Ziggymania , Bowie ended each concert with Ziggy ’s swansong , “ Rock ‘ n ’ Roll Suicide . ”
The song builds , cresting in a hymnlike refrain worthy of a Broadway curtain - closer : “ Gimme your hands ‘ cause you ’re wonderful / Gimme your hands ‘ cause you ’re wonderful . ”
Peaking , the song crashes with Ziggy ’s last words , caught at the moment his orgasmic cry turns into an agonized wail , as his fans rip him to shreds : “ Oh gimme your hands ! ”
By all accounts , Bowie ’s then - wife Angie dreamed up the gimmick of having Bowie extend a pleading hand toward the crowd as the song crescendoed .
Soon enough , the gimme - your - hands shtick was as formalized as the laying - on of hands at a faith - healing revival — a spotlit rite of communion between a worshipful crowd , desperate to touch the “ leper messiah ” ( “ Ziggy Stardust ” ) , and a star who flirted with delusions of messianic grandeur .
In truth , Bowie was haunted by the fear that he would be rock ’s first martyr , a blood sacrifice to celebrity culture .
He exorcized his fear ( even as he indulged his Saint Sebastian complex ) before a howling crowd , in Ziggy ’s passion play .
Offstage , his calculated blurring of the boundary between media myth and private self brought him perilously close to living out the Ziggy - esque martyrdom of his paranoid fantasies .
Next Week :
At 14 , the author , stranded in 1974 suburbia , has his born - again Christian brain short - circuited by the gender - bent but heart - stoppingly beautiful Ziggy .

CHARING CROSS STATION , London , 9:10 P.M :
And when he arrived they screamed and they cried , and they rushed , and gushed forth and beat their feverish feminine fists into the backs of the indeed brave coppers who shielded HIM .
For he is indeed HIM .
One girl , her face bloated , and most ugly with tears and ruddy emotion , fell half - way twixt train and rail .
A young copper dragged her to safety .
Ten yards down the platform HE was pretty close to injury to HIM .
Bowie , despite all the fierce bodyguarding , was being kissed , and pinched , and touched , and ripped at .
His hair now untidy ; his eyes wild ; his mouth open .
A picture of terror .
But his open mouth also bore the shadow of a crazed smile .
They pushed him against a carriage door .
It took Spartan constabulary to lift this small squirrel - haired figure to safety ; his face now very creased with every emotion a face could ever squeeze itself into .
And they squeezed him into a car that was battered , and clawed at .
And that car squeezed its way to safety .
And Mr. Bowie was back in England .
And on Platform One , in a dirty wet huddle , lay two plumpish girlies , crying , and holding each other , and just crying .
Everyone had gone , except them .
Their tights all ripped , their knickers showing .
And they just lay there crying .
— Roy Hollingworth , “ Cha…cha…cha …changes : A journey with Aladdin , ” Melody Maker , May 12 , 1973
Crowd :
Will you touch , will you mend me Christ ?
Wo n’t you touch , will you heal me Christ ?
Will you kiss , you can cure me Christ ?
Wo n’t you kiss , wo n’t you pay me Christ ?
Jesus :
Oh , there ’s too many of you , do n’t push me Oh , there ’s too little of me , do n’t crowd me Heal yourselves !
— “ The Temple , ” Jesus Christ Superstar ( 1970 ) •
On July 3rd , 1973 , Bowie ceremonially retired his Ziggy Stardust persona before a crowd of true believers , a melodramatic gesture immortalized in the D.A. Pennebaker documentary Ziggy Stardust : The Motion Picture .
Actually , it was more ritual sacrifice than retirement : Bowie sentenced Ziggy to death , partly because the leper messiah ’s shock value was losing its jolt , partly because the strain of playing the Jesus of Cool , onstage and off , was beginning to tell on him .
“ It was quite easy to become obsessed night and day with the character , ” he later recalled .
“ Everybody was convincing me that I was a messiah … ”
Returning for an encore , Bowie leans into the mic with a knowing , almost coy smile .
“ Of all the shows on this tour , this particular show will remain with us the longest because not only is it the last show of the tour , but ” — pause for dramatic effect — “ it ’s the last show that we ’ll ever do . ”
A collective gasp from the stunned crowd , intermingled with stricken cries of “ No ! ”
On cue , pianist Mike Garson pulses the opening chords of “ Rock ‘ n ’ Roll Suicide ” : “ Time takes a cigarette / puts it in your mouth … ”
Ziggy was our savior .
He rescued my only friend Lisa and [ me ] ( two American kids with very British taste in music ) from teenage boredom and launched us through outer space to his very own planet , somewhere beyond Pluto .
The U.S. TV show [ Don Kirshner ’s Rock Concert ] featured the final Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars concert at London ’s Hammersmith Odeon .
It was the first and only time we would see Ziggy live in action ( besides the hundreds of magazine photos and posters we had ) .
The stage was dark , the focus was soft , and the camerawork shaky and evasive .
Ziggy was shrouded in mystery .
He was definitely from the cosmos ; androgynous , surreal and seductive , perfect porcelain skin , unearthly mismatched eyes with a foreign , piercing stare . [ … ]
We saw this on a black & white TV , yet it was still utterly compelling .
We had found our ultimate icon , and there he was announcing his final performance .
Our devastation mounted .
— Madeline , a Bowie fan
Late on the night of October 25 , 1974 in a San Diego suburb hard by the Mexican border , a 14 - year - old me kneels close to the TV , flicker bathing my rapt face .
It ’s the only light in the house .
I ’m watching Ziggy Stardust : The Motion Picture , D.A. Pennebaker ’s 1973 film of Bowie ’s farewell performance as Ziggy , on Don Kirshner ’s Rock Concert — the same broadcast that ’s saving the bored teenage souls of Madeline and her friend Lisa , somewhere in New York .
Down the hall , my parents are asleep .
It ’s past midnight , and I know , somehow , that I ’m the only kid in my chicken - coop suburb beholding this miraculous visitation , wondrous as the presentation of the hermaphrodite in Fellini ’s Satyricon .
To be sure , Bowie ’s a freak — code for “ fag ” among the real - life Jeff Spicolis in my junior high class , righteous dudes whose idea of total radness is firing up a beer bong , dropping the needle on Pink Floyd ’s Dark Side of the Moon , and watching The Wizard of Oz with the sound turned off .
But he ’s so heart - stoppingly beautiful , in such a confusingly feminine way , that he short - circuits my teenage brain , a brain whose congenital straightness I ’ve never questioned … until now .
Those Venus de Milo shoulders ; that slim - hipped teenage - boy torso on top of those Rockette legs ; that otherworldly face — moon - white , immaculate , like Dietrich in cryo-sleep .
And the way he moves : biker - butch one minute , swivel - hipped the next , with a predatory grace true to Ziggy ’s boast in “ Hang on to Yourself ” that he and the Spiders “ move around like tigers on Vaseline . ”
“ Come on , come on , ” he pants , in time , syncopating the Spiders ’ skidding , careening beat .
I catch myself thinking how sexy he is .
And I wonder what that means .
And I realize I do n’t care .
•
Riding the volume knob , I split the difference between waking my parents and coaxing all the ecstasy I can from the TV ’s tin-can speaker .
I do n’t know how to take this
I do n’t see why he moves me
He ’s a man
He ’s just a man Should I bring him down
Should I scream and shout
Should I speak of love
Let my feelings out ?
I never thought I ’d come to this
What ’s it all about ?
— Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber , “ I Do n’t Know How to Love Him , ” Jesus Christ Superstar
Earlier that night , I ’d gone looking for another sort of ecstasy .
Crowded into the House of Abba with the other Jesus Freaks , I prayed with eyes closed and palms uplifted , whispering sweet nothings in God ’s ear , beseeching him to fill me with his holy spirit .
(3)
Abba , a youth outreach launched in 1971 by the Chula Vista First Baptist Church and run by the church ’s teens and twentysomethings , took its name from Christ ’s term of endearment for his Heavenly Father .
( “ Abba ” is Aramaic for “ Daddy ” ) .
The name was perfectly suited to the laid - back , Jesus - is - just - alright vibe , heavy on the group hugs , that prevailed at the weekend “ coffeehouses , ” as such services were called .
Friday nights at the House of Abba were stunningly unlike the soporific Sunday mornings at Saint Mark ’s Lutheran Church , where I ’d spent most of my church - going life , dozing fitfully while pretending to study the mimeographed liturgy handed out at the door .
Abba ’s hang - loose cool stood in stark contrast to Saint Marks ’ clip - on tie conservatism .
At Saint Mark ’s , we sat bolt upright , in unforgiving pews ; at Abba , we sat cross -legged on a patchwork carpet hand - stitched by the youth in the church ’s “ art ministry ” to give it a crash - pad ambiance .
They ’d also painted the sanctuary walls with cartoony , faux - naif pop-art murals ( “ imagine a hippy Sistine Chapel , ” the pastor ’s son , Tim Pagaard , recalls ) .
Abba ’s radicalism went far deeper than interior decoration , scrapping the liturgy and smudging the historically sharp line between clergy and congregation .
To be sure , Abba services had leaders , but they were laypeople and , more to the point , young people — a breezy flouting of elder power , from a Lutheran ’s - eye view .
Not a reversed collar in sight , but plenty of longhairs in Pendleton shirts ( worn , as SoCal style dictated , over a long john top , flannel sleeves rolled up to flaunt the underwear — an inscrutable convergence of beach - bum cool and the Little House on the Prairie couture favored by the back - to - the - garden wing of the Woodstock Nation , Richard Brautigan Division . )
Abba leaders wore their authority lightly , deciding on the fly whether we should sing , ponder a passage of scripture , or simply praise the Lord , lifting our voices in a weirdly beautiful welter of whispered prayers , wordless song , murmured praise — “ thank you , Jesus ” ; “ bless you , lord ” — and , inevitably , the ecstatic babble of people speaking in tongues .
The Chula Vista First Baptist Church was a flashpoint in the so - called Charismatic Renewal , an outbreak of neo-Pentecostalism that erupted , incongruously , in American Catholicism in 1967 and spread like holy fire through the mainline Protestant denominations .
The FBC ’s charismatic orientation encouraged public displays of beatified passion and , more generally , a middle - class , white ( read : toned - down ) version of the exuberant call - and - response dynamic that has animated black Pentecostal churches and Southern white revival meetings for generations .
On October 25 , 1974 , as on most Friday nights , Abba ’s house band Hebron churned out folk - rock worship music , original tunes that gene - spliced David Crosby and King Crimson — a progressive take on what would come to be known as Christian Contemporary Music ( CCM ) .
Someone spoke in tongues ; someone else prayed for the gift of interpretation .
A girl rocked as she sang , eyes closed , cheeks silvered by tears .
I knew how she felt .
Sometimes , as I tried to wrap my mind around God ’s fathomless love for me — me , an insignificant speck among earth ’s billions , yet He numbered the very hairs on my head — a wrenching feeling welled up inside :
God ’s love engulfing me , then overspilling my soul , a flood of love for all humankind .
This was agape , the Greek word the early Christians used to refer to the unconditional love God felt for us , his children , and which we were supposed to feel for the world .
Equal parts transport of sanctified rapture and endorphin rush , it was the next best thing to sex , for an alienated teenage loner .
Once , the feeling came over me as I sat reading the bible on one of the few hills in town untouched by development , an island of wild grass lapped by sprawl on every side .
Another time , it overwhelmed me in my bedroom , as I prayed with eyes fixed on a picture torn from a magazine and taped to my wall , a blown - up detail of Christ ’s sorrowful face from some Renaissance fresco — nightly devotions not unlike those performed by numberless teenage fans , in bedrooms across America , before pin-ups ripped from rock magazines like Creem or Circus or Hit Parader , except in my case the object of my obsession was the Son of God .
I caught myself thinking how passionately I loved him .
And I wondered what that meant .
And I realized I did n’t care .
Soul love – the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love – and how my God on high is
All love – though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him Love is careless in its choosing – sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none – just to touch the flaming dove — David Bowie , “ Soul Love , ” Ziggy Stardust
Abba ’s Jesus owed a debt to the Christ of the Jesus movement of the times , with which Abba shared not only historical space but cultural and , to a lesser degree , theological DNA .
Emerging on the West Coast in the late ‘ 60s , the Jesus movement — call them Jesus Freaks , Jesus People , street Christians , hippie Christians — was a grassroots ( forgive the pun ) revival rooted in the counterculture .
Disenchanted by the Summer of Love ’s sordid crack - up in Altamont , the Manson murders , and the zombie - eyed casualties of one too many trips , burned - out seekers began to See the Light — not the mind - frying blotter acid cooked up by Captain Clearlight , the San Francisco LSD kingpin , but The Light of the World .
Fundamentally white and middle - class in nature , it percolated out of the storefront missions and street outreaches of the urban counterculture — Ted and Elizabeth Wise ’s Living Room coffeehouse in San Francisco ’s Haight - Ashbury neighborhood , Arthur Blessitt ’s His Place coffeehouse on the Sunset Strip , in Hollywood — into suburban America .
The Jesus movement entered the national consciousness in 1971 , when Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell opened Broadway and off - Broadway , respectively , and a pink - skinned , purple - haired Jesus in the Sky with Diamonds stared soulfully from American newsstands — the Peter Max - style illustration for Time magazine ’s cover story on “ The Jesus Revolution . ”
Time dutifully informed Middle America that :
Jesus is alive and well and living in the radical spiritual fervor of a growing number of young Americans who have proclaimed an extraordinary religious revolution in his name . [ … ]
Christian coffeehouses have opened in many cities , signaling their faith even in their names :
The Way Word in Greenwich Village , the Catacombs in Seattle , I Am in Spokane . [ … ]
‘ It ’s like a glacier , ’ says ‘ Jesus - Rock ’ Singer Larry Norman , 24 .
‘ It ’s growing and there ’s no stopping it . ’
Explo ’ 72 , a “ Christian Woodstock ” hosted by the conservative evangelical group Campus Crusade for Christ , packed an estimated 80,000 young believers into Dallas ’s Cotton Bowl .
( Attendance swelled to 250,000 on the day Kris Kristofferson performed . )
The Jesus Freaks ’ ad - hoc theology could be summed up in two words : solus Jesus ( “ Jesus alone ” ) , a “ radically Jesus - centric ” Christianity ( to borrow a phrase from the religious historian Stephen Prothero ) that privileged a soul - joltingly emotional relationship with the Son of God .
The Jesus movement took the tendency , in American Christianity , to conceive of Jesus in down - to - earth , warmly human terms to new extremes .
Unsurprisingly , the Jesus Freaks imagined Christ as one of their own — a hippie , like Ted Neeley ’s sad - eyed Prince of Peaceniks in the movie version of Jesus Christ Superstar , or a surfer dude like Richard Hook ’s popular Head of Christ ( 1964 ) , whose stoned gaze makes him look like the kind of party - on messiah who peppered his conversation with words like “ gnarly ” and “ bogus . ”
The Jesus People moved the sandaled , longhaired Son of God center stage and banished his hard - assed , disciplinarian Dad — Yaweh , assistant principal of the Old Testament — to the wings .
( Yet more proof of Feuerbach ’s postulate that man creates God in his own image . )
To a rebellious overthinker adrift in the Sun Belt ’s answer to Stepford , Abba ’s Jesus was thrillingly radical .
It was only a matter of weeks after I left Saint Mark ’s for Abba , with my parents ’ grudging blessing , that I found myself rising , one Friday night in 1973 , to answer the altar call — the exhortation , in every evangelical service , to heed Jesus ’s knock at the door of your heart and come forward , with the other converts - to - be , to Accept Jesus as Your Lord and Personal Savior .
I ’d met this Jesus before , in Jesus Christ Superstar ( 1970 ) : a righteous messiah , opening a can of whupass on the moneylenders , giving the one - finger salute to the hypocritical religious establishment , and suffering political martyrdom at the hands of The Man .
For me , as for many boomers , Superstar was a paradigm - warping experience .
When my stepdad gave the just - released original cast album to my mom , I intercepted it and played it non-stop for the rest of the day , poring over the staplebound libretto as if it were some impossibly awesome version of God ’s word — which , to a 10 - year - old with a spotty knowledge of scripture , it was .
In a single afternoon , Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan ’s arena - rock Jesus , Andrew Lloyd Webber ’s hooky , guitar - driven tunes , and the Mod Squad grooviness of Tim Rice ’s lyrics had re-branded Jesus , in my mind , as Pure Awesome .
Growing up , I ’d come to see Christ as an Establishment Tool , ventriloquized by the same malevolent , oyster - eyed old guardians of the social order who bullied us into saying the Pledge of Allegiance , hands on hearts , before they force - marched us off to Vietnam .
My Country , Right or Wrong ; Support Your Local Sheriff ; and God Said It , I Believe It , That Settles
It were all products of the same Pavlovian conditioning , I decided ; religion was just another cog in the machinery of social control .
The House of Abba Jesus , like the Jesus of Superstar and the Jesus Freaks , was poles apart , an anti-establishment troublemaker who came to turn the gerontocratic world of power and privilege upside down .
He was the perfect combination of supercool role model and intimate confidante — an Invisible BFF who , unlike your parents or pastor or even your friends , totally understood you but never judged you and was always ready to kick back and listen while you poured out your tormented teenage heart .
Sure , the historical Christ was over 30 , but as re-imagined by Abba , Superstar , and the hippie Christians , he was One of Us , a historical revision so right for the zeitgeist that it trickled down to my local head shop , where an unwittingly hilarious poster depicted a Jesus who looked more than one toke over the line , asserting , “ You guys can wear your hair any length you want ; just tell them I said so . ”
As Stephen Prothero , author of American Jesus : How the Son of God Became a National Icon , puts it , the Jesus of ‘ 70s pop Christianity ,
grew his hair long , picked up the slang of the youth culture , and started strumming a guitar ( first acoustic , then electric ) .
Like other Jesus Freaks , Jesus became a hip rebel against the square culture of the Man in the Gray Flannel Suit .
He dissed his parents , quit his job , and took to the road with his closest friends .
Caiaphas , the high priest in Superstar , spoke for a generation : “ One thing I ’ll say for him — Jesus is cool ! ”
(4 )
But as I delved deeper into scripture with my bible - study group , I found myself nagged by the awful doubt that while Christ was cool , Christianity was n’t .
I ’d always had issues with the Father of All Authority Figures , Yaweh , whose because - I - said - so !
insistence on instant , unquestioning obedience to authority was matched only by his serious anger - management problems .
When he was n’t giving the Israelites carte blanche to bash out the Midianite babies ’ brains and rape their virgins , he was hardening Pharaoh ’s heart so that he could justify punishing him for having a hard heart , which is what attorneys like to call a nice point of law .
Yaweh seemed about as judicious and coolly rational as Idi Amin Dada , yet like every totalitarian Dear Leader he insisted his fear - sickened people love him …or else , booming , “ I , the LORD your God ” — always with the screaming CapsLock , like some online whack job — “ am a jealous God , punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me … ” ( Exodus 20:5 ) .
Happily , Yaweh was safely chained in the basement of the pop-Christian unconscious , the Old Testament , which most Jesus kids I knew seemed to view as a dusty scroll of Sunday - school fables about ancient Israelites , periodically interrupted by a yawn - inducing list of begats or the heaven - sent Genocide of the Week .
But the New Testament had its problems , too .
The more I read , the more troubled I was by the dissonance between the righteous Jesus of the social gospel — the Revolutionary of Love , defending the destitute and the despised and demanding social justice on their behalf — and Paul ’s chauvinism , misogyny , and homophobia .
Worse yet , Christ , who seemed to have inherited his dad ’s megalomania , insisting ad nauseam that he was The Way and The Truth and The Life and threatening his believers with eternal banishment to the outer darkness unless they submitted to His Will .
Around that time , being a Jesus Freak was losing its outsider cool , in my mind — the kiss of death , for any teenager .
Some religious historians date the co-optation of the Jesus movement from its high - water mark in the mass media : Explo ’ 72 , Campus Crusade leader Bill Bright ’s shrewd re-packaging of conservative Christianity in the hippie sounds and styles of the Jesus Freaks — a breakthrough move that showed evangelical America how to use pop culture to market its message to its prodigal sons and daughters .
More profoundly , Bright ’s “ Godstock ” witnessed the first stirrings of the evangelical demographic that would emerge in the ‘ 80s as a political force to be reckoned with .
Following market capitalism ’s tried - and - true strategy of marketing subcultural transgression as defanged fad , conservative Christianity embraced the teen style , if not the theological substance , of the Jesus movement — and squeezed the life out of it .
By no accident , evangelicals were fruitful and multiplied .
Meanwhile , at the FBC , Abba was a victim of its own success , outgrowing the smaller of the church ’s two sanctuaries — a godsend to the Old Guard , since it enabled the church to resorb Abba into the established order .
“ By 1974 , space became a problem , and Abba moved into the much larger main sanctuary of the church , ” Tim Pagaard , son of former pastor Ken Pagaard , recalls .
“ The proceedings grew more formal .
Worshipers now sat in neat rows of pews instead of cross-legged , shoulder - to - shoulder , helter - skelter on the patchwork carpets of earlier years .
“ As Abba became increasingly formalized , though , the crowds eventually began to dwindle .
What had once been a quasi - independent youth movement was entirely absorbed into the church schedule in 1975 as a ‘ Friday evening service . ’
Leadership was turned over to the church elders , and the Thursday and Saturday meetings were cancelled .
‘ Abba ’ as an entity was no more . ”
The Revenge of the Dads .
By 1975 , I was gone .
Ultimately , I had n’t been able to swallow Abba ’s — or the bible ’s — unconscionable defense of “ governing authorities , ” no matter how venal or violent , following the apostle Paul ’s decree in Romans 13:1 , that “ everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities , for there is no authority except that which God has established ” — a helpful reminder to be Good Germans , even in the days of Mayor Daly and My Lai , Kent State and Nixon ’s Christmas bombing .
Nor could I conscience Abba ’s — or the bible ’s — sanctioning of sexist inequities and homophobic drivel that , to my mind , should have been buried with the Hebrew patriarchs .
Faith - based apologetics for bigotry and blind obedience simply did n’t square with my vision of Jesus as a sharp - tongued prophet of social justice , come to speak truth to power and right the wrongs of this world .
I drifted away from Abba and , over time , from Christianity altogether .
In the made - for - TV version of my life , I ’d lose my religion in one mind - cracking moment , like some film of Saul on the road to Damascus run backwards .
Unfortunately , that version would be as autobiographically fraudulent as it would be dramatically satisfying .
Truth to tell , I lost my belief by degrees , as the ‘ 70s waned .
But my earliest recollection of realizing I was losing the faith was melodramatic enough .
It happened that night , hours after Abba , while I was kneeling before the glowing image of Ziggy Stardust , desperately wishing I could reach through the screen and touch what Teresa of Ávila would have called his glorified body , so “ supernatural and beautiful ” that it rendered me beside myself as I mouthed the words to “ Moonage Daydream ” as Ziggy sang them : “ The Church of Man , love / is such a holy place to be … ”
(5 )
The distance between being a Jesus Freak and being a Ziggy devotee turned out to be vanishingly small .
By accepting “ Bowie ’s star - crossed glam Christ ” ( David Fricke1 ) as My Personal Savior , I was simply substituting one leper messiah for another — the Jesus of Cool for Jesus ; a demon lover for a Sweet Savior .
Of course , Bowie was the perfect choice for a surrogate Jesus .
More than any other rock star , he invites ( demands ? ) deification .
This has partly to do with the messianic sense of destiny that propelled him to rock godhood — a precocious child ’s sense of specialness , inflated to Übermenschen extremes by the Nietzsche his older brother Terry introduced him to at an impressionable age .
( “ I always had a repulsive sort of need to be something more than human , ” Bowie confesses in George Tremlett ’s David Bowie : Living on the Brink .
“ I thought , ‘ Fuck that , I want to be a Superman . ’” 2 ) Becoming Ziggy , onstage and off , from ’ 72 through ’ 74 , completed his transfiguration into the doomed alien savior of his dreams ( a volatile mix of Nietzschean will - to - power fantasies and a martyr complex ) .
His Svengali - like manager ’s strategy of limiting media access to the divinity fixed the image of Bowie as aloof and otherworldly in the public mind .
By the New Wave era , says Ann Magnuson ( a boldfaced name on New York ’s downtown scene in the late ‘ 70s and early ‘ 80s ) , Bowie “ had turned into something godlike to certain kids who loved the weird , the edgy , the arty , and the glam .
By that point , he had become deified . ”

For those with eyes to see it , there had always been a nimbus of religiosity around Bowie , whose metaphoric language is shot through with spiritual symbolism and religious references .
A Talmudic study of his lyrics , cross-referenced with a close psychoanalytic reading of his life , reveals an inveterate seeker , hungry for gnosis — the hermetic wisdom that will unriddle the metaphysical questions that nag him .
Bowie ’s pilgrimage has taken him through Buddhism to the alien saviors of science fiction and flying - saucer theology and mystical traditions ranging from kabbalism to English magician - scholars such as Aleister Crowley and A.E. Waite to the dimestore occultism of Dion Fortune ’s Psychic Self - Defense to the Maronite Christian mysticism of Kahlil Gibran , whose The Prophet , like Hermann Hesse ’s Siddhartha , was a pick - up - line staple at ‘ 60s love -ins .
Bowie entered his Dharma Bum phase around 1965 , after discovering Tibetan Buddhism through Heinrich Harrer ’s 1952 book Seven Years in Tibet , a title he lifted for a song on his 1997 album Earthling .
( His passion for the Beats , more intellectual trickledown from Terry , had pointed the way to Buddhism , as well . )
Immersing himself deeply in Buddhist practice , he studied with the exiled Tibetan lama Chimi Youngdong Rimpoche and seriously considered becoming a monk .
Bowie memorialized this period in “ Silly Boy Blue ” ( 1966 ) , a psychedelic travelogue starring a Tibetan Buddhist chela ( disciple ) who flouts the rules of his order .
“ It ’s telling that Bowie ’s lyric , while full of Tibetan Buddhist imagery ( the references to chelas and overselves , etc. ) , still sympathizes with the young monk who ca n’t pay attention , who ’s a bit at odds with his culture , ” notes Chris O’Leary on his Bowie blog Pushing Ahead of the Dame : David Bowie , Song by Song .
“ Even in the midst of worship , Bowie has an eye for the heretics . ”
4
By 1971 , Bowie was wading into darker waters .
In his majestic hymn to spiritual exhaustion , “ Quicksand ” ( Hunky Dory ) , he name - checks the notorious occultist and self - styled “ Wickedest Man in the World ” Aleister Crowley and the Golden Dawn , a hermetic order with which Crowley was associated , alongside references to Nietzsche , Nazi occultism , and , fleetingly , Tibetan Buddhism .
Later , in 1975 - ’76 , when he was living in L.A. while working on Station to Station ( 1976 ) , Bowie would burrow much deeper into the occult .
Descending into a drug - warped Dark Night of the Soul , he spent days without sleep , sustained by cocaine as he tried to change the channels on his TV telekinetically , scrawled protective magical symbols on the walls , and buttonholed anyone within earshot about the Nazis ’ quest for the Holy Grail and the witches who wanted to steal his semen .
To create a baby .
To sacrifice to Satan.5
In his essay , “ Occult Rock , ” Greg Taylor discerns traces of Bowie ’s occult dabblings on the eponymous title track of Station to Station , where Bowie “ references the Kabbalah … with the line ‘ one magical movement from Kether to Malkuth , ’ talks of ‘ flashing no color ’ ( part of the Eastern occult Tattva system ) , and also makes a sly tip of the hat to Aleister Crowley ’s book of pornographic poems White Stains in the very last line of the song .
The album ’s art ( at least on the CD version ) also includes a picture of Bowie sketching the Kabbalistic Tree of Life on the floor . ”
6
Fascinatingly , the record also includes an achingly beautiful prayer of a song , “ Word on a Wing ” :
Just because I believe do n’t mean I do n’t think as well
Do n’t have to question everything in heaven or hell …
Lord , I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I ’m trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It ’s safer than a strange land , but I still care for myself
And I do n’t stand in my own light
Lord , lord , my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things ?
In 1999 , Bowie told an audience the song was a product of “ the darkest days of my life … I ’m sure that it was a call for help . ” 7
Soaringly emotional , “ Word on a Wing ” is unabashedly hymn - like , inviting interpretation of Station to Station as a Manichaean struggle between occultism and Christianity .
But it is “ Quicksand , ” more than any other song , that most eloquently articulates the tension in Bowie ’s artistic psyche between belief and disbelief ( of the scarifying , Nietzschean sort as well as the soul - sick existentialist variety ) .
“ I ’m torn between the light and dark , ” he sings .
“ I ’m sinking in the quicksand of my thought . ”
Hedging his bets , he stacks some of his chips on atheism ( or at least cynicism ) , sneering , “ Ca n’t take my eyes from the great salvation / of bullshit faith , ” then makes an about - face , paying lip service to the Buddhism of his hippie days : “ If I do n’t explain what you ought to know /
You can tell me all about it /
On the next Bardo . ”
Finally , just to keep his bases covered , he makes an offering at the empty altar of existentialism : “ Do n’t believe in yourself / Do n’t deceive with belief / Knowledge comes with death ’s release … ”
“ Questioning my spiritual life has always been germane to what I was writing , ” he told an interviewer in 2002 .
“ Always .
It ’s because I ’m not quite an atheist and it worries me .
There ’s that little bit that holds on : ‘ Well , I ’m almost an atheist . [ … ]
There ’s just one niggling thing .
Once I shave that off , we ’ll be fine and dandy , and there wo n’t be any questions left . ’
It ’s either my saving grace or a major problem that I ’m going to have to confront . ”

A mash - up of tropes and themes familiar from the biblical passion and apocalyptic sci-fi , A Star is Born and The Bacchae of Euripides , The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars ( 1972 ) is thick with Christological symbolism and biblical allusions .
Ziggy re-stages the rise and fall of Jesus Christ as a Pop - art comic strip — an Exploding Plastic Parable ( with apologies to Warhol ! ) about the celebrity as demigod in a fame - crazed culture , where millions worship their idols onscreen ( “ praying to the light machine , ” as Ziggy puts it ) but would sacrifice them in a heartbeat — burnt offerings on the altar of Mark David Chapman psychopathy — for a shot at tabloid immortality .
Ziggy ’s name , borrowed from a legendarily eccentric pop singer called The Legendary Stardust Cowboy , says it all .
Like Jesus , who is “ manifest in the flesh , justified in the Spirit ” ( 1 Timothy 3:16 ) , Ziggy is a walking paradox , what scholars of myth and religion call the coincidentia oppositorum ( the conjunction of opposites that resolves all difference into a cosmic unity ) .
He is , on one hand , “ star ” ( that is , a celestial being like Jesus , who says in Revelation 22:16 , “ I am the bright Morning Star ” ) and on the other “ dust ” ( mortal clay , as in Genesis 3:19 , “ for dust you are and to dust you will return , ” the source text for The Book of Common Prayer ’s graveside homily about “ ashes to ashes ” and the title , incidentally , of a 1980 Bowie song ) .
By outfitting his Martian messiah in campy , retro-futurist gear borrowed from the prop room of 1950s ’ rocket - operas ( “ Keep your ‘ lectric eye on me babe / Put your ray gun to my head , ” Ziggy sings , in “ Moonage Daydream ” ) , Bowie provides enough ironic distance for us to see that all heavenly saviors are , by definition , space oddities : otherworldly beings who walk among us , passing as human ; incorporeal body snatchers in mortal guise .
Ziggy arrives , as saviors always do , in humanity ’s hour of need .
“ Earth is really dying , ” a weeping newscaster reports , in “ Five Years , ” the album ’s opening song ; in just five years , the planetary ecosystem will experience an epic fail : “ News had just come over , we had five years left to cry in . ”
Like Christ , Ziggy spreads a radical gospel of love .
But while Christ admonishes his followers to abandon the nasty , brutish logic of the Mosaic world view ( “ eye for eye , and tooth for tooth ” ) [ 1 ] and emulate his unconditional , turn - the - other - cheek love for all mankind ( a message so revolutionary it convinces the apostle John that God , in a word , is love ) , [ 2 ]
Ziggy preaches a gospel of transcendental eros .
“ Let all the children boogie , ” he decrees , in “ Starman , ” using a mothballed hippie verb that , back in the day , was a euphemism for doing the nasty . [ 3 ]
In Ziggy ’s erotic beatitude , the solitary self is consumed by an overmastering “ idiot love ” — a transport of sexual rapture that obliterates the boundaries of the conscious ego and “ spark [s ] the fusion , ” in the song “ Soul Love , ” with …uh …the Cosmic Whatever .
Is Ziggy ’s space - hippie sermonizing about transcending adolescent alienation ?
Or hieing your astral ass off a dying planet through some orgasm - fueled transport of rapture ?
Bowie ’s starman , a prophet who thinks with his crotch , is n’t big on specifics .
All he knows is that “ the church of man , love , is such a holy place to be , ” a proverb that manages the neat trick of crossing eros with agape , reconciling them in the profane sacrament of soul love ( “ Moonage Daydream ” ) .
Actually , Ziggy may be smarter than he knows .
The art historian Partha Mitter reminds us that ,
from a very early period in the history of Greek religious thought , earthly love was looked upon as a reflection of divine love …
The mystic association between love and religion appeared early in Orphic rhapsodists , who saw no reason to differentiate between creation and procreation , for they were essentially two kinds of love , one cosmic and the other human . [ 4 ]
Mitter notes the influence of Orphic thought on Plato ,
who often expressed profound spiritual ideas through sexual images [ and who ] saw a close relationship between erotic and religious impulses because for him love began in worship , but at the same time seeking a closer union with divinity .
Plato , who believed that love regained the soul ’s purity through the contemplation of beauty , uttered these remarkable lines in the Phaedrus : “ Such as one , as soon as he beholds the beauty of this world , is reminded of true Beauty , and his wings begin to grow ; then is he fain to lift his wings and fly upward . ” [ 5 ]
Ziggy — a closet neo-Platonist ?— reaches up through his loneliness to a “ God on high ” who , like Saint John ’s , “ is all love . ”
Ziggy , too , wants to lift his wings and fly upward , to “ spark a fusion ” with the divine — to “ touch the flaming dove , ” an image reminiscent of Plato ’s but also lifted , intact , from Christian iconography , where the Holy Spirit appears as a dove , haloed by flames .
Ziggy is Christlike in other , equally roundabout ways .
In “ Moonage Daydream , ” he boasts that he ’s “ a rock ‘ n ’ rollin ’ bitch , ” a “ mama - papa coming for you ” ; in “ Lady Stardust , ” he slip - slides between genders , morphing into the ladyboy of the title .
Ziggy ’s twofold nature — gender - bending ladyboy , switch - hitting bisexual , “ mama - papa ” ( an image recalling the freakshow hermaphrodite known as a half - and - half ) — aligns him with the intersexed or androgynous deities of pre-Christian myth .
This archetype , which the historian of religion Mircea Eliade reads as a personification of the coincidentia oppositorum , wears a thousand mythic masks , most notably Phanes - Eros , the primeval creator - god of Orphic theology , who was both androgynous and bisexual ; [ 6 ]
Bacchus , identified in Orphic hymns as simultaneously male and female ( and given the Lady Stardust - like epithet “ Queen of Priapus ” for good measure ) ; [ 7 ] and Bacchus ’s Greek alter ego Dionysus , a fertility god who tore fawns apart with his bare hands and whose emblem , paraded by his votaries , was the phallus but who was at the same time a beautiful , androgynous youth — “ man- womanish ” is the preferred adjective , in ancient sources — with effeminate curls , the proverbial wine - dark eyes , a fondness for crossdressing , and a weakness for swinging young shepherds . [ 8 ]
How does this underscore the leper messiah ’s kinship with Jesus ?
Because Jesus , in the eyes of historians of religion such as Carl Kerenyi ( Dionysos : Archetypal Image of Indestructible Life ) , shares cultural DNA with Dionysus .
Some scholars believe the Dionysian mystery cult and early Christianity left a legible impress on each other ’s traditions , and that the two religions fought for cultural dominance .
Both Jesus and Dionysus embody the archetype of the god who dies and is reborn ; both were begotten miraculously ( Dionysus from his father Zeus ’s thigh ) ; both were honored with wine rituals consecrated to their resurrection ; and both were ritually consumed by their worshippers , who believed that by symbolically ingesting their god they were communing with him .
In Dionysus ’s case , wine - maddened orgiasts tore a totemic animal such as a goat to pieces with their bare hands and devoured the bloody flesh raw ; having drunk Dionysus ’s blood and eaten his body ( hello , Jesus ) , they surrendered themselves to frenzied ecstasies , possessed by the god ( hello , spirit - filled Pentecostals . )
Whether Jesus is a lineal descendant of the Greek god or not , he is associated , like Dionysus , with a troublingly ambiguous relationship to gender ( troubling , that is , for fundamentalists ) .
In Mephistopheles and the Androgyne , Eliade traces a theological tradition stretching back to the Middle Ages , in which the prelapsarian Adam , born without sin , exists in a state of primordial perfection , reconciling both genders ( the coincidentia oppositorum strikes again ! ) .
Medieval , and later Renaissance , theologians made much of Genesis 1:27 ( “ So God created man in his own image , in the image of God he created him ; male and female he created them ” ) , which mysteriously precedes Eve ’s creation in Genesis 2:21 .
Likewise , Eliade points out , “ several midrashim [ early Jewish commentaries on biblical texts ] represent Adam as having been androgynous , ” contending that the first man “ was a man on the left side , a woman on the right ; but God split him in two halves . ” [ 9 ]
Androgyne or hermaphrodite , Adam mirrored his creator : “ In God there is no more division , for God is All and One , ” writes Eliade . [ 10 ]
Christ must necessarily reconcile the opposing genders , since he , as Yaweh , created Adam in his perfect image . [ 11 ]
According to the fifth century theologian Maximus the Confessor , Eliade tells us ,
Christ unified the sexes in his own nature , for in the Resurrection he was ‘ neither man nor woman , though he was born and died a man . ’[ 12 ]
He refers us to the eighth century theologian Johannes Scotus Erigena ’s belief that the ,
division into sexes was the result of sin , but it will come to an end in the reunification of man , which will be followed by the eschatological reunion of the circle of earth with Paradise .
Christ has anticipated this final reintegration . [ 13 ]
German Romantics took this line of argument and ran with it , Eliade asserts — to Ziggy extremes .
“ For the German Romantics the androgyne was the type of the perfect man of the future .
Ritter , a friend of Novalis , had sketched …a whole philosophy of the androgyne .
For Ritter the man of the future would be , like Christ , an androgyne ” ( and , as a fringe benefit , immortal ) . [ 14 ]
Premonitions of Ziggy ?
Bowie ’s song “ Oh! You Pretty Things ” ( Hunky Dory ) augurs the coming of a Nietzschean Overman , a glam - rock angel with Jesus genes who sounds a lot like Ritter ’s man of the future :
Look at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Do n’t kid yourself they belong to you
They ’re the start of a coming race
The earth is a bitch
We ’ve finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they ’re here to stay …
Oh !
You Pretty Things
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior

There was a psychological logic , as well , to my transition from born - again Christian to Bowie votary .
Rock fandom , taken to its obsessive extreme , is indistinguishable from the hallucinating , levitating ardor of an enraptured believer like , say , Saint Teresa of Ávila .
The etymological origins of the word are helpful : “ fan ” is short , of course , for “ fanatic , ” from the Latin fanaticus , “ mad , enthusiastic , inspired by a god , ” deriving from fanum ( “ temple ” ) and related to festus ( “ feast ” ) .
1
Some sources smell a whiff of orgiastic rites still clinging to the word , which would explain the tale told by a fan named Julie , in Fred and Judy Vermorel ’s 1985 study of fan culture , Starlust — a bizarre ( and , be it said , thoroughly unsubstantiated ) account of a spontaneous outbreak of Dionysian frenzy at Ziggy ’s 1973 farewell concert , in which :
a lot of men were throwing off their underwear and showing their cocks all over the place …
I thought it was so extraordinary because nobody had any inhibitions .
I remember that around me nobody gave a shit really about doing these things because it was rumored that maybe this was the last time Bowie would perform .
Maybe this was the last time Ziggy would be here .
And everyone ’s got to get in on this because otherwise you ’re just a square . [… ]
Then I suddenly realized that all the things I ’d been doing were perfectly O.K .
Because here were people doing it with each other and sharing it .
How wonderful , you know .
So get off on that .
And I thought I ’d never seen so many cocks in my life .

Holy communion in The Church of Man .
By the way , I ’m not using the term “ Dionysian ” lightly .
In The Great Transformation : The Beginning of Our Religious Traditions , the religious historian Karen Armstrong describes the carnival atmosphere that prevailed at celebrations of the Dionysian mystery cult : “ Everybody drank wine , and there was music and dancing ” and “ sometimes , the whole group fell into a trance , a heightened state of consciousness , which spread from one celebrant to another . [… ]
They called this experience of divine possession entheos : ‘ within is a God . ’
” 3 ; Oh , and “ men wore women ’s clothes , like the young Dionysus when he was hiding from Hera . ” ( Emphasis mine . )
A devout fan strives in every way to imitate his idol — to become him , in fact , in the same way that the Dionysian celebrants whipped themselves into a delirious state of divine possession ; in the same way that the 16th - century Catholic mystic Saint John of the Cross strove , through the Imitation of Christ , to attain an ecstatic oneness with God ; in the same way that charismatics fervently desire the “ indwelling ” or “ infilling ” of the Holy Spirit , so that they may live “ spirit - filled ” lives , guided by God ’s will ( entheos ) ; in the same way , perversely , that the deranged Beatles fan Mark David Chapman was convinced that killing John Lennon would transform him into a household deity like his idol , a “ guardian angel ” maybe , or even a “ quasi- savior . ”
4
A fan is a consumer whose all - consuming idolatry is just the well - behaved face of a sublimated desire to actually consume the love object .
What more intimate and irrevocable way to have that faraway figure on the Jumbotron screen , the unattainable figment of a million fans ’ fever dreams , all to oneself ?
The gonzo rock critic Lester Bangs winks at the inherent depravity of “ psychofandom ” in his gore - nographic fantasy of gobbling up a “ giant rotten glob ” of Elvis ’s carcass in order to ingest the King ’s magical powers : “ I do n’t need to go get The Golden Bough just to prove to everybody else what I already know because it ’s simple horse sense , which is if I eat a little bit of Elvis ( the host , as it were , or is that mixing mythologic metaphors ? ) , then I take on certain qualities possessed by Elvis when he was alive … ”
5
As Bangs ’s invocation of Frazier ’s Golden Bough and the sacrament of holy communion suggests , fans ’ appropriation of their idols ’ hairstyles , fashion statements , signature poses , and , in some extreme cases , distinguishing features is only the latest stop on the elevator ride up from the basement of the religious unconscious — the postmodern return of one of the most primitive manifestations of the fan mind , namely , ritual cannibalism , in which participants absorb an enemy ’s magical powers by eating his flesh .
Following Freud ’s analysis , in Totem and Taboo , of the Christian Eucharist as a revival of that ancient totemic practice , unbelievers have gotten endless mileage out of the obvious correspondences between ritualized anthropophagy and the rite of communion , arguing that the Last Supper is just a sublimated blood feast .
( The Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation , which holds that the consecrated wafer metamorphoses miraculously into Christ ’s flesh , has been god ’s gift to irreverent wags . )
6
Yet little , if anything , has been written about the conceptual hyperlinks between Christ ’s solemn promise to his disciples , “ whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me , and I in him ” ( John 6:53 - 56 ) , and the quintessential fan practice of incorporating iconic aspects of the star ’s appearance and attitude into his psyche — what Freud would call introjection — in order to be born again , into a more liberatory identity .
Fans remake themselves in their idol ’s image by metaphorically tearing him to pieces , like Ziggy in “ Rock ‘ n ’ Roll Suicide ” — obsessively collecting and fetishizing photos , videos , concert memories , celebrity sightings , memorabilia , and other hallowed fragments of the divinity , from which they assemble new , recombinant selves .
In an unguarded moment , Bowie traced his own metamorphosis from devotee to deity :
I took a look at my thoughts , my appearance , my expressions , my mannerisms and idiosyncrasies and did n’t like them .
So I stripped myself down , chucked things out and replaced them with a completely new personality .
When I saw a quality in someone that I liked , I took it .
I still do that .
It ’s just like a car , replacing parts .
7
This is what the music critic Simon Reynolds means when he talks about the “ circularity ” of rock fandom , “ where fans grow up to be idols , having learned the art of posing from their idols . ”
8
Hence the importance , in fan culture as in Roman Catholicism , of miraculous relics : objects the star has touched , like the Concert Used Handkerchiefs —
Lot 106 in the auction catalogue for the Gary Pepper Collection of Elvis Memorabilia , “ owned by audience members who gave them to Elvis Presley to wipe his face during a concert , after which they were returned .
Unwashed . ” — or , better yet , consecrated remnants of the star himself , like Lot 66,9 the Large Quantity of Elvis Presley ’s Hair , sure to be “ treasured by fans who wish to own a piece of the king himself . ”
Talismanic objects such as ticket stubs and tour T - shirts are more common ; most common of all are venerated images displayed on bedroom walls : on the Bowie fansite Ziggy Stardust Companion , an ardent fan named Madeline proudly displays a blurry snapshot of her “ Ziggy wall .
” 10 ( image , upper right ) .
Wall - mounted photo collages are devotional aids — focal points for inner dialogues with the deity , daydreams , wet dreams , wish - fulfillment fantasies involving fan and star or fan as star .
Intimately situated in a teenager ’s Fortress of Solitude ( her bedroom ) , they ’re domestic shrines , depicting the tutelary god at his most iconic , styled and posed and lit ( if clothes make the man , lighting makes the god in celebrity portraiture and Christian iconography alike ) , then retouched into an unattainably idealized version of Himself — a Photoshop apotheosis .
Icons have played a key role in the contemplative lives of Christians for centuries , putting an approachably human face on the deity while concentrating the mind on otherworldly things .
Saint Teresa had her first mystical catharsis when she entered a chapel and stumbled on an image someone had left behind , a picture of the wounded Christ that stirred her soul as no picture ever had , literally bowling her over , leaving her on the floor in “ a great flood of tears , ” overmastered by the feeling that “ He was within me , or that I was totally engulfed in Him . ”
11
In American Jesus : How the Son of God Became a National Icon , the historian of religion Stephen Prothero traces the history of chromos , wallet - sized prints , posters , and other mass - produced images as zeitgeist weathervanes , spun this way and that by changing attitudes toward Jesus .
Shaped by the cultural politics of a given historical moment ( think of the longhaired , drop - out Jesus of the Jesus Freaks or the fan - mobbed , fame - sick messiah of Superstar ) , such images also shaped popular conceptions of the Son of God — one of the tight feedback loops typical of a highly networked , mass - media age .
“ Advances in printmaking made lithographs affordable in the first half of the century and halftone engravings inexpensive in the last , ” he writes .
“ As images of Jesus proliferated in illustrated books and prints suitable for display in the home , Americans increasingly approached God through images as well as texts , and those images reinforced their devotion .
” 12
In the dream life of American culture , mass - marketed depictions of Jesus , from Warner Sallman ’s pensive , doe - eyed Head of Christ ( 1941 ) , distributed by the millions to servicemen during World War II , to the Fabio - haired prizefighter messiah of Stephen S. Sawyer ’s Undefeated ( 1999 ) , have left an indelible stamp on the inner lives of believers .
“ When devout viewers see what they imagine to be the actual appearance of the divinity that cares for them , ” the art historian David Morgan contends , the picture in question “ becomes an icon ” — an image with a life of its own , charged with the divine presence .
13
“ When I look at [ Sallman ’s Head of Christi ] in prayer , and when I am the most in need , ” says a believer quoted by Prothero , “ I see not only a painted portrait , but the face of the real , the living Christ .
” 14
Spoken like a fervent Bowie fan , one of those worshippers who are “ most in need , ” desperate to be healed by the Master ’s touch as he passes by , frantic to kiss his hand — or to “ crush his sweet hands ” if he turns out to be a false idol , “ making love with his ego ” ( “ Ziggy Stardust ” ) instead of us , his frenzied votaries , Maenads of a secular mystery cult .

6 Catholics would argue that , while the essence of the host is transformed , those aspects of the sacrament that are apprehensible to the senses ( “ the accidents ” ) remain unchanged , thus ensuring that celebrants are not , in fact , cannibalizing the Divine — - an awkward bit of theological footwork that , to my mind , is nothing more than an attempt to dodge the bullet of atheist mockery , not to mention skeptical inquiry , however unconvincingly .

“ Nobody has ever been able to put their finger on me because I ’m not really here , at least not in the way they think I am .
It ’s all in their heads .
What I ’m into is mindlessness .
I just empty myself out , so what people see is just a projection of their own needs .
I do n’t do or say anything . ”
— Lou Reed , 1975 [ 1 ]
Thirty - six years after the fact , looking back on my teenage - fanboy crushes on Jesus , then Ziggy , I ca n’t help wondering :
What was that about ?
Was it all in my head , as Reed suggests ?
Were both icons just apotheosized projections of my awkward , alienated self — perfected personalities I dreamed of becoming through fastidious imitation ( imitatio Dei ) .
Ironically , is n’t that what both leper messiahs had done — passed as gods ?
“ Do n’t dream it , be it ” is the first commandment of celebrity culture , sung by Dr. Frank N. Further , the “ sweet transvestite from Transsexual , Transylvania , ” in the glam - camp musical The Rocky Horror Picture Show ( which debuted , on the stage , in the Ziggy - mad year of 1973 , and which , according to Bowie : A Biography by Marc Spitz , “ David , Angie , and their entourage took in…multiple times … clearly taking notes in the margins of their programs ” ) .
[ 2 ]
Were n’t Ziggy and Jesus really just transfigured fanboys , figments of their own worshipful imaginations who had wished their stardom into existence by “ chucking out ” the aspects of themselves they did n’t like and replacing them with “ a completely new personality , ” as Bowie put it ?
Did n’t Bowie admit as much when he said , in 1972 , “ The artist does n’t exist .
He ’s strictly a figment of the public ’s imagination .
None of us exist .
We ’re in the twilight zone .
We ’ll all go to hell , ‘ cause we set ourselves up as gods ” ? [ 3 ]
Does n’t Jesus echo that same anguished sentiment when Pilate asks him , “ Art thou the King of the Jews ? , ” in Mark 15:2 , and he retorts , “ Thou sayest it ” ?
Across the centuries , we can still hear the world - weariness of the superstar who ’s tired of serving as a movie screen for the wish - fulfillment fantasies of the multitude .
“ Watch me turn into Lou Reed before your very eyes , ” Reed deadpans , on Take No Prisoners , the infamous live record on which he ritually trashes his greatest hits , mau -mauing hecklers and ranting about whatever crosses his drug - addled mind , like some gonzo Henny Youngman .
“ I do Lou Reed better than anybody , so I thought I ’d get in on it . ”
Lou Reed is the least likely Christian mystic ever : Jewish , bisexual , and in 1975 the twitchy - eyed , sallow - skinned larval form of some species of glam - rock stick insect .
Yet his description of his fill - in - the - blanks persona — “ I ’m not really here … what people see is just a projection of their needs ” — is weirdly consonant with the mystical Christian notion of kenosis , the emptying out of the self to make room for the indwelling spirit of God .
To the devout , the blurry apparitions of the messiah on Veronica ’s Veil and the Shroud of Turin are palpable evidence of Christ ’s historical reality and of his divinity .
But they can also be read backwards , as visual metaphors for the shadow of a doubt that haunts all fandom :
He ’s not really here , at least not in the way you think he is .
It ’s all in your heads .
Bowie is a palimpsest , his “ authentic ” self buried under centuries of evasion , dissembling , and self - mythologization .
And the new - and - improved Bowie of recent years — frighteningly effervescent and teeth - lifted , last seen in a hoodie and sneakers , horsing around with the irrepressibly normal Ellen Degeneres — is no less a Warholian fabrication than Ziggy , the “ totally credible plastic rock star — much better than any sort of Monkees fabrication ” he became in order to ascend to pop godhood .
[ 4 ]
Who is Bowie ?
Is he just a constellation in the mass mind , the connected dots of all the data points we ’ve gleaned from the media , most of them pure fakery , planted by the man who would be god ( or at least a plastic god ) ; who told an early interviewer , “ I always had a repulsive sort of need to be something more than human …
I thought , ‘ Fuck that , I want to be a Superman ’ ” ? [ 5 ]
Speaking of supermen , who , for what matter , was Jesus ?
Bowie , who was probably thinking of something else at the time , once quipped that Hitler was “ one of the first rock stars . ”
Maybe .
Or maybe Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice were right , in Jesus Christ Superstar : Maybe Jesus was the first rock star , masterfully managing his public image , working the crowds like a show - biz pro , delivering every gnomic one - liner , every cryptic parable , every portentous aside with one eye on the only audience that really matters — the fans beyond number who will one day venerate him , a radical apocalyptic prophet born sometime around 4 BCE , as a god .
“ I know that one day a big artist is going to get killed onstage , and I know that we ’re going to go very big , ” Bowie told an interviewer , in 1974 .
“ And I keep thinking : it ’s bound to be me .
Go out on me first tour , get done in at me first gig , an’ nobody will ever see me .
That would be wild . ” [ 6 ]
What better way to ensure celebrity immortality than to die young and glamorous , like glam - rocker Marc Bolan of T. Rex , your purple Mini wrapped around a Sycamore tree ?
Or , better yet , nailed to a tree , an iconic image made to order for the world tour that never ends ?
( As Judas asks , in the title song from Superstar , “ Did you mean to die like that ?
Was that a mistake , or / did you know your messy death would be a record breaker ? ” )
Then again , the biblical scholar Bart D. Ehrman has argued persuasively that Jesus himself did n’t believe he was the messiah .
Ehrman attributes Jesus ’s deification to later sources with a vested interest in his mythologization — the Gary Peppers in Christ ’s fan base . [ 7 ]
“ If we want to know about the historical Jesus , we are more or less restricted to using the four gospels , Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John , ” Ehrman writes , in Jesus , Interrupted : Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible ( And Why We Do n’t Know About Them ) .
These are not disinterested accounts by eyewitnesses , however .
They are books written decades after the fact by authors who had heard stories about Jesus from the oral tradition , stories that had been altered and even made up over time .
There were lots of discrepancies in these stories , and the Gospel writers themselves changed them as they saw fit . [
8 ]
It gets worse : we do n’t even have the original fanzines in which these heavily embroidered tributes to a long - dead idol originally appeared .
“ Not only do we not have the originals ” of the gospels , says Ehrman , “ we do n’t have the first copies of the originals .
We do n’t even have copies of the copies of the originals , or copies of the copies of the copies of the originals .
What we have are copies made later — much later .
In most instances , they are copies made many centuries later .
And these copies all differ from one another , in many thousands of places . ” [ 9 ]
Look at any messiah from the right angle , and you can still see yourself , the fan within , in a sort of inverted entheos .
Bowie may be coolness incarnate , but shift your perspective slightly and he reveals another face , like the Christ of those lenticular postcards : the painfully lame Anthony Newley impersonator who warbled novelty ditties like “ The Laughing Gnome , ” whose chipmunk - voiced vocals and groaningly cornball puns make even the staunchest fans blanche in horror .
In Jazzin ’ for Blue Jean , the promotional mini-movie for the song “ Blue Jean ” from his 1984 album Tonight , Bowie makes light of — and casts a psychoanalytic light on — the gap between his rock - god persona and his inner fanboy .
Literalizing the Divided Self hinted at in his lyrics ( specifically , in Man Who Sold the World ’s recurrent references to his brother Terry ’s schizophrenia ) and on the iconic cover of Aladdin Sane , where a painted lightning bolt bisects his face , Bowie plays a painfully dorky fan named Vic and a swooningly cool popstar named Screamin ’ Lord Byron .
In his painted face and harem pants , Byron looks to the adoring camera eye like a glam - rock gloss on Yellow Book decadence : Aladdin Sane meets Valentino ’s Sheik , as imagined by Aubrey Beardsley .
But when he steals Vic ’s girl in the final scene , Vic ’s idol - worship curdles into Mark David Chapman - esque resentment : Byron , he sneers , is nothing but a “ conniving , randy , bogus , Oriental old queen . ” [ 10 ]
Similarly , Christians may believe Jesus is God incarnate , but through the magnifying glass of historicity he looks like a hairy - eyed , lapel - grabbing zealot , staple - gunning his Xeroxed screeds about the End of Days to every telephone pole in town .
Who raptured these guys out of mass anonymity , into the beatitude of celebrity ?
Was n’t it us , the true believers who knew every line of every song by heart , singing along as Ziggy implored , on the razor ’s edge between yearning and taunting ,
Gimme your hands ‘ cause you ’re wonderful
Gimme your hands ‘ cause you ’re wonderful
In his marvelous exercise in amateur hermeneutics , Ziggy ’ 72 : A Catalogue of Lost Objects , Bowie fan Harvey Molloy offers a poignant meditation on the fan - idol dynamic .
Pondering fans ’ role in apotheosizing one of their own , Molloy arrives at a realization of the entheos at the heart of all fan cultures , secular and religious : if what fans — believers , by any other name — are idolizing is really “ just a projection of their own needs ” ( Reed ) , “ a figment of the public ’s imagination ” ( Bowie ) , then the object of their adoration , in a very real sense , lies within .
“ When [ Ziggy ] sings the finale , ” writes Molloy ,
I feel like I ’m watching Jesus .
He leans over the crowd at the end of the stage , his outstretched hands taunting the front row audience who would give anything to touch him .
Sublime , unobtainable , out of reach .
I know that I will never speak to him …
Who is he , in the end , without his costumes , his make - up , the identity and signature he has invented for himself ?
Perhaps no one .
Yet he ’s also indispensable ; larger than life , the one teaching us that by watching a performance you make it happen .
For one moment , the gap between us closes and I know that the audience too is wonderful ; we ’re the wonderful ones who make it happen . [ 11 ]
Another fan , in another time , had the same thought :
Neither shall they say , Lo here !
Or , lo there !
for behold , the kingdom of God is within you .
— Luke 17:21

Shakespeare fans and archaeologists can now join in the exploration of Shakespeare ’s last home on - line , in a new website launched by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust .
The brand new website supports the groundbreaking archaeological exploration of New Place in Stratford - upon - Avon , which began earlier this month in a bid to reveal new information about Shakespeare ’s later life .
www.digforshakespeare.com has been designed to keep potential visitors , as well as Shakespeare fans throughout the world , up to date with the latest news from the archaeological dig at New Place .
The website has been created to keep the dig accessible to visitors young and old , incorporating a clip library with the latest footage of archaeologists at work , interviews with experts and volunteers involved in the dig , and background material about what the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust is hoping to find .
To keep younger visitors entertained , the site also contains a fun game ( http://www.digforshakespeare.com/dig-for-shakespeare), where children can literally join in a virtual dig , playing as an archaeologist digging for Shakespeare goodies in the soil below New Place .
Each time they make a find , they are rewarded with a quote from a Shakespeare play – and they can also record their scores in a bid to be the top virtual archaeologist –making a visit to digforshakespeare.com fun , challenging and educational !
“ Dig for Shakespeare really is a whole new visitor experience – people can come down to New Place and watch the excavation as it unfolds , or if they are not local , they can keep up to date with the latest news and blogs from the dig via the new website , ” explains Director of the Trust , Diana Owen .
“ The dig has been a real success with visitors , with many of them are keen to find out about the latest discoveries after their visit to the site .
The extent of the dig is changing on a daily basis at the moment and this is the perfect way of letting them know what ’s happening . ”
The website will be updated every few days , including blogs from the Birmingham Archaeology team - the archaeologists conducting the dig - as well as the army of volunteers who have signed up to lend a hand with the huge task of excavating the site .
The dig , now into its third week , sees archaeologists exploring three key areas of the site where Shakespeare ’s final home , New Place , would have stood .
Even though it is relatively early days for the dig – which will remain active until September , and open to the public until the end of October – archaeologists have already revealed the brickwork of Shakespeare ’s bay window , where he may have gazed out whilst writing one of his later plays .
Work is also underway to explore what is believed to be the servants ’ yard – an area between the house and the great garden - that possibly housed rubbish or cess pits .
Visitors can walk along a specially constructed platform around the edge of the digs , where they are literally able to look over the shoulders of archaeologists at work and watch as exciting finds are pulled out of the ground – some of which will not have seen the light of day since Shakespeare himself lived there !
The Dig for Shakespeare at New Place in Stratford - upon - Avon is open to the public daily until the end of August , from 11.00 am to 5.00 pm ( last entry 6.00 pm during July & August ) .

Qooxdoo ( pronounced [ ' kuksdu : ] ) is a universal JavaScript framework for creating enterprise - grade single - page web applications .
With its class - based object orientation , Qooxdoo allows the code of even the most complex applications well organized and manageable .
The integrated compiler produces single file applications ready for deployment .
Framework
The Qooxdoo framework enhances the javascript language with a full - fledged , class - based object - oriented system , including a powerful properties system , interfaces , and mixins .
Qooxdoo code is based on namespaces to allow rigorous and scalable code structure , asy integration with other libraries and existing user code .
It comes with a comprehensive API reference that is auto - generated from Javadoc - like comments in the framework sourcecode .
Qooxdoo programs are written in plain javascript ; no new syntax is introduced , and all the extra functionality is realized through clever application of existing javascript abilities .
In order to create an application that can be loaded by the browser , the Qooxdoo source code has to be processed by the Qooxdoo compiler .
The Qooxdoo compiler is a NodeJS - based application written in Qooxdoo itself .
It loads Qooxdoo source code and adds all the required framework components necessary to create an application that is executable in the browser .
GUI Toolkit
Despite being a pure JavaScript framework , Qooxdoo is on par with GUI toolkits for desktop applications like Qt when it comes to advanced , yet easy to implement , user interfaces .
It offers a full - blown set of widgets that are hardly distinguishable from elements of native desktop applications .
Full built - in support for keyboard navigation , focus , tab handling , and drag & drop is provided .
Dimensions can be specified as static , auto - sizing , stretching , percentage , weighted flex or min/max , or even as combinations of those .
All widgets are based on powerful and flexible layout managers which are at the core of many of the advanced layout capabilities .
No HTML or CSS has to be used and augmented to define the interface .
The Qooxdoo developer does not even have to know CSS to style the interface .
Clean and easy - to - configure themes for appearance , colors , borders , fonts and icons allow for complete themability .
Communication
While being a client - side and server - agnostic solution , the Qooxdoo project includes different communication facilities , and supports low - level XMLHttpRequests ( XHR ) as well as an RPC API .
An abstract transport layer supports queues , timeouts and implementations via XHR , Iframes and Scripts .
Like the rest of Qooxdoo , it fully supports event - based programming which greatly simplifies asynchronous communication .
Qooxdoo is not only a library , but also comes with a set of sophisticated tools .
Some help with the development workflow , such as the command line interface .
Others let you quickly get to know the widgets ( such as the widget browser ) , become fluent in the Qooxdoo API ( such as the API Viewer ) , or to debug or demonstrate code snippets ( such as the " Playground " ) .
Package
A versatile web framework would n't be complete without a package system which allows modularizing and reusing code .
Qooxdoo's package system is based on GitHub repos .
Packages can be installed and published very easily with the Qooxdoo CLI .
History
Qooxdoo was originally developed by one of the world 's leading web hosters : 1&1 Internet ( now part of United Internet AG ) .
In late 2015 , the Qooxdoo framework with all its assets , was turned over to the Qooxdoo association , located in Switzerland .
Qooxdoo development has , since then , been lead by a group of dedicated developers congregating on gitter and github .
Contributions are always welcome .

In the netbook edition for 10.10 , we ’re going to have a single menu bar for all applications , in the panel .
Our focus on netbooks has driven much of the desktop design work at Canonical .
There are a number of constraints and challenges that are particular to netbooks , and often constraints can be a source of insight and inspiration .
In this case , wanting to make the most of vertical space has driven the decision to embrace the single menu approach .
It ’s all about vertical pixels
Netbooks are conventionally small - and - wide - screen devices .
A common screen format is 1024×600 .
There ’s plenty of horizontal space , but not a lot of vertical space .
So we ’ve been lead to explore options that really make the most of the vertical space .
This is important because the main thing people do with a netbook is surf the web .
And most pages will fit horizontally in a netbook screen , but they require quite a lot of vertical scrolling .
The more we can optimise the use of vertical space , the more enjoyable it will be to spend time on the web , with your netbook .
In the first few iterations of Ubuntu ’s netbook - oriented UI , we concentrated on collapsing the window title into the top panel .
In 10.10 , we ’re going to put the menu there .
Only on the Netbook Edition UI
We ’re going to put the menu in the panel on the netbook edition of Ubuntu , and not on the desktop edition , because that ’s where the screen real - estate is most precious .
There are outstanding questions about the usability of a panel - hosted menu on much larger screens , where the window and the menu could be very far apart .
Those questions are greatly diminished in the netbook environment , by definition .
Also , the netbook edition has a reduced application load .
That will reduce the number of applications we need to get this working on .
However , it will be straightforward to use this on your desktop too , if you want , and we ’d encourage people to try with that configuration .
The more testing we have early on , the better we ’ll understand how it works with different applications .
It will be easy to add to the standard desktop panel for people who want to try it out , or prefer to work that way .
Innovation : combining title and menu in a single panel
It ’s not confirmed yet , but we will aim to go beyond what Apple and others have done with panel menus , to consolidate both the window title ( and window controls ) into the panel along with the menu .
By default , we ’d display the contents of the title bar .
When you mouse up to the panel , or when you press the Alt key , the contents would switch to the menu .
That way , you ’re looking at the document title most of the time , unless you move towards it to click on the menu .
In mockups and prototype testing , the result was a leaner , cleaner feeling netbook interface .
Less clutter , less wasted space , and improved clarity of purpose .
We ’ll have to get running code in front of users to evaluate the usability of it and tweak transitions and presentation .
Generally , people use netbooks with a small set of applications running , all maximised .
In that case , putting the menu in the panel will save 24 pixels , about 4 % of the vertical space .
Combined with other work on the netbook interface , we ’re confident there is no better OS for surfing the net on your ultra -mobile netbook .
Under the hood : d- bus menu transport
The technical approach we are taking in this work is to build on the d-bus menu work that Cody Russel and Ted Gould have pioneered for our work on indicators .
Essentially , this lets us map a menu into d-bus space , where a different application can take responsibility for rendering it .
The technology works across both Gtk and Qt applications , so we are confident that it will work for the common cases of GNOME and KDE apps running on the Ubuntu netbook edition .
Of course , there is a lot of work to be done to support applications that use different toolkits , notably the Mozilla suite of Firefox and Thunderbird , and OpenOffice .
And there will be many applications which need some thought as to how best to map the experience from the current world of “ one menu per window ” to a single , panel - displayed menu .
We ’ve started working on this with the existing Global Menu project .
While there are differences in the technical approach we want to take , that team has already identified many of the common issues , and there are great opportunities for us to collaborate .
I ’m looking forward to seeing the result in action in 10.10 !

AMD 's Radeon 5970 dual - GPU video card is the fastest consumer graphics card available , but Asus is cooking up a customized monster that steps things up a notch .
Codenamed Ares , this ' true ' dual - 5870 solution is point to leave everything else on the market in the dust .
AMD 's current 5970 GPU carries the same number of stream processors and memory as a standard 5870 but runs its core and memory 15 percent and 20 percent slower .
The Ares scoffs at such limitations ;
Asus has combined two 5870 's back - to - back , kept them running at full speed , and slapped the whole shebang into a single PCI - Express slot .
A Pair of Radeon HD 5870 GPUs Full - Bore On One PCB
The resulting card is something of a monstrosity .
At 2.5 slots thick , Ares is geared for war ( pardon the pun ) and easily surpasses the benchmark scores of mere standard 5970s .
We were able to run 3DMark Vantage at both its " Performance " and " High " detail settings .
Asus ' did n't have a high - resolution monitor on the demo machine so we could n't test the program 's " Extreme " mode , but the performance and scaling we saw in the lower modes bodes well for the upper ones .
Asus is n't sure if they 'll bring Ares to the US , but the company reps we talked to implied that yields were fairly good ( keeping in mind that this is a top - margin part ) .
We brought up the issue of power -- the current 5970s are listed with a maximum board power of 294W and this card sports a third auxiliary power connection , which implies it 's already leaning pretty heavily on the power supply .
According to Asus , AMD 's maximum board power supply numbers are a bit conservative ; the current set of 5970s coming off the fabs are hitting around 260W at maximum power draw while the Ares is sitting just under the 300W mark .
We 'd love to see Ares in the channel , but if it does become available we 'd caution against using it in anything but a top - end board with a very good PSU .
This is precisely the sort of situation where ' invisible ' differences in board construction can come into play and top - end features and / or additional validation can suddenly become important .

According to Gibson , you can't put " cyber " and " computer " together .
To which somebody else asked , what do the people in Second Life do their homework on ?
Gibson replied : " Those invisible keyboards they talk on ? "

It 's interesting how many people thought " cyber- chocolate " and " cyber - ham " would be an abomination , in particular .
I 'm also somewhat amused by the person who insisted that there 's no such thing as cybersex .
I hereby challenge you , our readers , to go forth and create the cyber - spork .

This two - day practical course was designed to provide veterinarians with the theoretical and especially the practical skills to competently examine every joint of the front - and hindlimb ultrasonographically .
A panel of international experts who have dedicated a significant proportion of their careers to musculoskeletal ultrasonography are involved with this course .
The first day will focus on ultrasonography of the frontlimb and on the second day the hindlimb will be covered together with an update on conventional and regenerative systemic and intra-articular joint therapies .
Between both afternoons , 7 hours of small group sessions ( 2 – 4 attendees / ultrasound machine ) will give attendees plenty of opportunity to further develop their skills on live horses under the supervision of the specialists .
There will furthermore be plenty of time for discussions and each attendee will rotate through the following practical stations : Coffin , Pastern & Fetlock Joints ; Carpus & Carpal Sheath ; Digital Flexor Tendon Sheath & Shoulder Joint ; Tarsus , Tarsal Bursae & Sheath ; Stifle Joint ; Correlative NeedleView Arthroscopy – Attendees to choose Joints .
Free turn - by - turn Google Maps Navigation has already threatened an entire industry of GPS navigation companies whose livelihood depends on selling paid versions of what the search giant is now giving away for free .
Currently Google Maps Navigation is available for Android phones only , but in a London press conference Google said it will bring free navigation to the iPhone and other platforms .
The press ushered in the arrival of Google Maps Navigation in the UK , but perhaps the juicier part of the news was the official confirmation of free nav in development specifically for the iPhone .
Unfortunately , the company still wo n't say exactly when we should expect the feature to roll out on Apple 's smartphone platform , but knowing the light speed at which Google prefers to move it wo n't be long before we have more news on this front .
What do you think : can free turn - by - turn direction service on smartphones replace the traditional in - auto GPS system , or do standalone navigation devices still have value ?
How will GPS manufacturers adapt to the changing satnav landscape ?
Police ID Person Who Found New iPhone Police , Apple track down person who found prototype of new iPhone , reports say .
April 28 , 2010  --
The case of the leaked Apple iPhone continues to unfold .
Police have identified the person who found the prototype of the new iPhone after it was left behind at a bar by an Apple engineer , according to local reports .
But authorities have n't said if the same person sold the phone to tech blog Gizmodo for $ 5,000 .
Last week , the Internet went wild when Gizmodo published an exclusive story about a prototype of the next generation of Apple 's iPhone -- scheduled for release this summer .
But earlier this week , the site revealed that Friday police entered the home of Jason Chen , a Gizmodo editor who wrote about the next - generation iPhone , to seize computers and other gadgets .
No One Charged With Crime , District Attorney 's Office Says
Investigators have identified and interviewed the person who picked up the prototype phone after Apple engineer Gray Powell left it at a Redwood City , Calif. , bar March 18 , the San Jose Business Journal said Tuesday .
" We 're still not saying it 's a crime , " San Mateo County Chief Deputy District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe told the Journal .
" The investigation has contacted as many segments of the people involved in this situation , including the person who took the phone from the German restaurant .
The police know who he is and they have talked to him . "
Wagstaffe said Powell and outside counsel for Apple contacted the district attorney 's office Wednesday or Thursday of last week to report a theft and ask for an investigation , the Journal said .
Then they were referred to the Rapid Enforcement and Allied Computer Team , or REACT , the high - tech crime task force that ultimately confiscated computers from Gizmodo 's Chen .
In response to the police seizure , Gawker Media LLC , Gizmodo 's parent company , wrote a letter invoking the California shield law for journalists and said the search warrant to enter Chen 's home was invalid .
Wagstaffe said the investigation is on hold until it 's determined whether those protections apply in this case .
Wired : Apple May Have Tracked Down Finder of the iPhone
Representatives of Apple may have also visited the person who found the famous iPhone , Wired magazine reported Tuesday night .
" Someone came to [ the finder 's ] house and knocked on his door , " a source , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told Wired.com .
The person said a roommate answered the door but would n't let them enter the room .
The source said that the person who found the phone tried to notify Apple and the owner , but failed .
The person then tried to contact the press to confirm its authenticity and locate the owner , the source said .
" The idea was n't to find out who was going to pay the most , it was , who 's going to confirm this ? " the source told Wired , adding that the $ 5,000 agreement with Gawker was for exclusivity only .
Gizmodo was supposed to help return the phone to the owner or return it to the person who found the phone , the source said .
Wired also said that it received an e-mail from a tipster in March who offered access to the device , but Wired did not follow - up after the tipster made " a thinly veiled request for money . "
Web Reacts to Fallout from Gizmodo's Scoop
The whole drama has sent off a lively debate online , triggering arguments as to whether bloggers are journalists , whether Gizmodo 's actions were illegal or merely unethical and whether Apple orchestrated the whole to - do as an elaborate marketing ploy .
In an interview with Wired , Jennifer Granick , civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation , said the federal Privacy Protection Act , which prohibits the government from seizing materials from journalists and others who possess them for the purpose of communicating to the public , also protects Chen .
But L.A.
Times technology blogger Dwight Silverman is n't sure journalistic shield laws apply :
" As a journalist , I think shield laws are important for protecting sources .
And yes , I consider bloggers who actively report and provide information to the public on a regular basis to be practicing journalism , " Silverman wrote in a blog post this morning .
" But California 's shield law , which is part of its Constitution , is designed to protect the sources of journalists -- it 's not blanket immunity for crimes committed by journalists .
If the legal system determines that Gizmodo broke laws by its purchase of the ' lost ' iPhone , that action is n't protected . "
Mashable framed the issue as a core test for the future of media .
" The entire saga has brought a slew of legal , moral and ethical issues that could impact the future of blogging and journalism .
It depends on how the legal and criminal issues play out , " Mashable 's Ben Parr wrote .
Mashable commenter Elly challenged , " Give me one good reason why online journalists should n't have the same rights as print journalists . "
L.A. Times commentator Steve C. wrote , " Let 's turn it around .
What if instead of a phone , it was a document left behind exposing collusion and possible crimes by senior management at a corporation ?
The document is " owned " by the corporation .
If the finder of the document asks the L.A .
Times for a finder 's fee , what would they do ?
Would it be wrong ?
It 's a gray area . "
However , many online commenters say regardless of whether bloggers are journalists , Chen lost his right to be considered a journalist the minute he paid for what could have been stolen property .
" Jason Chen is no journalist .
He may write for a website , but journalism implies a kind of morality , " L.A. Times commenter Brian B. wrote .
A commenter at Digg , which has so far clocked 1007 comments on the story about the police raid , similarly shed few tears for Chen .
" I have to say that I have no sympathy for this guy .
He took what he knew was a product that was secret and meant millions if not billions of dollars and posted it all over the Internet .
I am glad he did it , but it was still irresponsible and dumb .
I know the excitement of it all might have caused some bad judgment , but this guy was a moron if he thought Apple was not gonna make an example out of him , " wrote lukewind .
Others say the entire thing may have been orchestrated by Apple to stimulate buzz and publicity for its next hotly anticipated version of the iPhone .

I ’ve been looking at Twitter data lately – here are a couple of visualizations of the twitter stream plotted onto Google Earth after doing some natural language processing on it .
All the tweets on the map have had some named entity disambiguation and georeferencing done ( e.g. , mapping “ New York , ” “ NYC ” , “ The Big Apple ” and “ Home of that boy Biggie ” to lat / long coordinates ) along with some sentiment analysis to gauge whether it was positive ( happy / nice things to say ) , neutral , or negative ( trash talking or sad ) .
Chile 2/27
The first is all tweets mentioning Chile between Feb 26 and Feb 27 – not a whole lot going on until 1:34 am Feb 27 , when the whole world lights up .
Note the sentiment starts out strongly negative ( “ chile has had an earthquake omggg this has me sooo scared ” ) but then moves positive as the day goes on ( e.g. , “ Pray for the people in Chile ! ! ” ) .
Go full screen to see the timescale .
Olympics 2/21
The second is all tweets mentioning the Olympics between Feb 20 - Feb 21 – you can see them peak both days about 9 - 10 pm EST , especially on Sunday the 21st ( figure skating ? ) .
Mostly green and yellow too , suggesting postive / neutral sentiment ( e.g. , go Bodie ! ) .
After a break I 'm back , and I bring Jon Stewart and the daily show ...

Nice .
No one really knows why , but for an open wound , simply applying suction dramatically speeds healing times .
( The theory is that the negative pressure draws bacteria out , and encourages circulation . )
But for almost everyone , that treatment is out of reach–simply because the systems are expensive–rentals cost at least $ 100 a day and need to be recharged every six hours .
No more .
Danielle Zurovcik , a doctoral student at MIT , has created a hand - powered suction - healing system that costs about $ 3 .
The device is composed of an airtight wound dressing , connected by a plastic tube to a cylinder with accordion - like folds .
Squeezing it creates the suction , which lasts as long as there ’s no air leak .
What ’s more , where regular dressings need to be replaced up to three times a day–a painful ordeal –the new cuff can be left on for several days .
Zurovcik originally intended to field - test the device in Rwanda , but then the Haiti Earthquake struck .
At the request of Partners in Health , an NGO , she traveled to Haiti with 50 of the pumps .
Currently , Zurovcik is verifying the healing benefits of the device , and developing a new model that can be readily carried and concealed .
The one technical hurdle that remains is ensuring the bandage seals tightly –but after that , the device could benefit a huge portion of the 50 - 60 million people in the developing world that suffer from acute or chronic wounds .

This Cracked writer humbly cries bullshit .
Commercials have gotten away with this ridiculousness for too long .
Their history of deceit is responsible for an entire alternate reality specific only to advertising , one where your friends know more than doctors and pollen genuinely wants to hurt you .
The following six are the most egregious .
Commercials are duplicitous .
They are designed to elicit the same response from us as a burning fire ; our interest level is minimal at best yet we can't tear ourselves from a constantly shifting image .
Advertisers do this to protect the absurdity in every commercial , encouraging viewers to watch , but not too intently that reason might step in and say , " What the fuck is going on here ? "
And ordinarily , we accept it without argument the same way we accept blue raspberry as a legitimate flavor .
6 Only Women Eat Yogurt
In a shocking display of arrogance , yogurt companies determined at some point that half the population on the planet was no longer a suitable audience for their product .
In the commercial universe , men do n't eat yogurt , and in some cases , can't even see it .
" I do n't understand !
Where is food ? "
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Take a look at this .
Women on the other hand , use the curdled milk as an excuse to get together in the afternoons wearing their hooded sweatshirts and cardigans to talk about how much they fucking love yogurt .
They eat it partially because it tastes like Boston cream pie and apple turnovers , and mostly because it makes them shit .
In fact , it turns out women can't defecate without yogurt .
The yellow digestion balls in every woman 's stomach is directionless before the cultures organize them into an arrow pointing toward the ass .
The yellow balls tasked with shit regulation have forgotten evolution !
Does poop escape through the pores ?
When you watch the mainstream news , how often do you hear them identify the Federal Reserve as the ultimate source of all of our financial problems ?
Never ?
Well , there is a good reason .
The Federal Reserve was created and continues to benefit the elite international bankers that are raping the United States blind financially .
Many of the same financial powers own large interests in the 6 gigantic media companies that dominate U.S. mainstream media .
So you wo n’t hear the truth from them .
On this website we go on and on about how bad the U.S. national debt is .
And it is really , really , really bad .
But rarely do you hear from anyone who we owe all of this money to .
Yeah , we owe large amounts to Japan and China and a bunch of other nations , but the biggest holder of our debt by far is the Federal Reserve .
Just like the owner of your mortgage or your car loan , they expect to be paid back – with interest .
Now U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is warning that the U.S. national debt could balloon to more than 100 % of GDP by the year 2020 .
For those familiar with national debt statistics , that is a very , very dangerous threshold to cross .
Basically the United States is in debt up to its eyeballs and the debt continues to grow at an exponential rate .
So what is the solution ?
Well , according to Bernanke , United States citizens will soon have to make difficult choices between higher taxes and reduced social spending .
Perhaps both .
The truth is that either alternative will slow down the U.S. economy and will reduce our standard of living , but this is the situation that we have gotten ourselves into .
And we have got to service that gigantic debt that we owe to the Federal Reserve ( among others ) .
In fact , a whole lot of government officials are talking about taxes these days .
And not about lowering them .
Some administration officials are floating the idea of a national sales tax and others are openly discussing adopting a European - style “ value - added ” tax .
Any way that they can drain more money out of us sounds good to them .
In fact , members of Barack Obama ’s “ fiscal reform commission ” say that higher taxes must be considered as a way to handle the U.S. government ’s mounting debt problem .
Of course they could just stop wasting trillions of dollars , but apparently that is too hard .
And so where will all of these new taxes go ?
To managing our colossal debt of course .
The truth is that we have locked generations of Americans into debt slavery .
We have piled up the biggest mountain of debt in the history of the world , and our children and grandchildren will spend all of their lives trying to pay interest on it .
Have n’t we left them with such a wonderful legacy ?
If you do n’t understand who the Federal Reserve is or what they are doing to us , please watch the excellent 4 minute video below .
It does a great job of introducing people to the rotten core at the center of the U.S. financial system .
We encourage you to send this video out to as many of your friends and family as possible .
Perhaps if there is a mass awakening , Americans can elect politicians that will shut down the Fed and will reclaim America ’s financial destiny … .
Philadelphia's
Legal proceedings are getting underway in the case of Pennsylvania 's Lower Merion School District -- you know , the one accused of remotely turning on webcams on its student 's laptops inappropriately ?
We knew that district IT folks enabled the webcams 42 times in total , capturing pictures every 15 seconds , but now we 're learning that over 400 images were retrieved of a single sophomore and that there are thousands more of other students .
There is also seeming proof of use of the webcams even when laptops were not reported stolen , like when a student failed to pay the school 's hardware insurance premiums .
The district is apparently not standing behind its two IT employees who had the necessary permissions to enable this remote viewing , technology coordinator Carol Cafiero and technician Michael Perbix , and from what little we can tell now it 's not looking particularly good for them .
In a deposition Cafiero refused to answer any questions , citing her Fifth Amendment rights , but an alleged e-mail exchange between the two saw Perbix calling the pictures " a little LMSD soap opera , " to which Cafiero replied " I know , I love it ! "
That does n't sound entirely appropriate ...:
We 've received a few comments and e-mails about calling this " Philadelphia 's Lower Merion School District " when , in actuality , the school is outside of the city limits , and county limits too , so we 've corrected that above .
Apparently nobody wants to be associated with these guys .
Bored guests at a certain Crowne Plaza hotel can now skip the pricey mini-bar and hop on an exercise bike , generate some electricity , and earn some meal vouchers .

The US ambassador to Australia Jeff Bleich has criticised the Rudd government 's plan to filter the internet , saying the same goals can be achieved without censorship .
The federal government 's $ 128.8 million Cyber Safety policy includes forcing ISPs to block access to certain websites and blacklist offensive material .
Legislation to enable the scheme is set to be introduced this year .
" Internet has to be free " ... US Ambassador to Australia Jeff Bleich
On ABC 's Q&A program last night , Mr Bleich said the " internet has to be free " and that there were other means of combating nasty content such as child pornography .
" We have been able to accomplish the goals that Australia has described , which is to capture and prosecute child pornographers ... without having to use internet filters , " he said .
March 2 , 2010  --
When Doug Wood lost his job managing a Ruby Tuesday restaurant near Los Angeles in late 2008 , he figured on collecting unemployment for only a couple of months until he found another job .
He 's still looking .
" In a few weeks the benefits completely run out , " said Wood , 47 , a resident of Norco , Calif .
" I 'm trying to look on the bright side of things , but I 'm running out of time , and options . "
Wood is one of more than 11 million Americans currently collecting unemployment insurance benefits , paid for by a mix of state and federal money .
Some 40 percent of the nation 's jobless , like Wood , have collected benefits for at least the past six months .
With the national jobless rate still near 10 percent , the recession grinding onward and benefits claims continuing to mount , the entire unemployment system is being stretched beyond capacity .
Since the end of 2008 , some 29 states , including California , have completely run out of funds to pay unemployment claims , and have resorted to borrowing federal money .
It comes to about $ 33 billion , according to George Wentworth , a policy analyst with the New York - based National Employment Law Project .
If jobless claims continue at current rates , the Federal Unemployment Account ( FUA ) , part of the Unemployment Trust Fund ( UTF ) , which is administered by the Department of Labor , could , by 2012 , be facing billions in shortfalls .
By that time , a projected 40 states will have borrowed approximately $ 90 billion , twice as much as what the government earmarked last year for the entire UTF .
Private employers will likely face higher state and federal taxes to keep the Labor Department 's trust funds solvent , Wentworth explained .
Pushed to the Limit
" This recession is pushing the country 's unemployment system to the limits , " Wentworth said .
" With the majority of state trust funds insolvent it 's time for Congress to get involved . "
This weekend Congress was unable to provide even a basic stopgap measure that would have extended federal benefits , due to staunch opposition from Republican Sen. Jim Bunning of Kentucky .
But Bunning now seems ready to negotiate , and today told ABC News that he is working on a deal to allow the unemployment extension bill to pass .
Sen . Judd Gregg , R - N.H. , tells ABC the deal would allow for a vote on off - setting the bill 's $ 10 billion price tag with cuts in other programs followed by a vote on the bill itself .
This was an offer Bunning rejected last Thursday .
Bunning , who is set to retire , had repeatedly resorted to a filibuster , objecting to the addition of $ 10 billion to the deficit without Congress having identified a way to pay for the measure .
The bill would extend jobless benefits for as many as 400,000 people , among other things .
States Short Billions
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has vowed to move ahead with efforts to get the temporary measure passed , as well as proceed with a separate plan to shore up the federal extended benefits program permanently , at a cost of $ 100 million .
" We 'll keep pressing this until GOP leaders talk some sense into Bunning , " said Jim Manley , a spokesman for Reid .
Among the 29 states that have run through their own unemployment insurance benefit funds , incidentally , is Bunning 's home state of Kentucky , which has borrowed around $ 700 million from the Federal Unemployment Account .
California , Florida , Illinois , Indiana , Michigan , New Jersey , New York , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Texas all have borrowed more than $ 1 billion from the federal government since 2008 ; in fact , California alone has borrowed more than $ 7 billion .
Currently , there are three unemployment benefits programs .
First , there are state - paid benefits .
These usually last 26 weeks , and vary , depending on the state , usually averaging out to no more than a few hundred dollars per week .
When the state benefits run out , the unemployed can qualify for federally funded emergency unemployment compensation , followed , finally , by an extended benefits program , for up to 20 weeks .
Some unemployment benefits , depending on the state , can run as long as 99 weeks .
During the last extended recession , in the early 1980s , most unemployment programs lasted no longer than 55 weeks .
Cher Horner , 62 , lost her job at a Naples , Fla. , newspaper where she sold classified ads .
That was in November 2008 .
Since that time , her husband has been diagnosed with cancer .
She had never filed an unemployment claim in her life , but she figured she had no other choice .
Horner 's unemployment benefits , around $ 175 per week , run out in a few weeks unless she can get a federal extension -- which now may not be possible if Congress can't figure out a way to secure funding .
" I 'm at age when I 'd like to retire , " Horner sighed .
" It 's to the point where we 'll have to walk away from our home and move in with our daughter .
I literally do not know what to do next .
No one will hire me . "
As for Wood , he 's gone through all possible extensions of benefits and is not sure what he will do next .
He has sent resumes to every restaurant in the area and hopes for the best .
" If my benefits could be extended , sure , that would be great , " he said .
" But I 'm certainly not counting on the government to help me . "
Sleeping in a room with a fan lowers a baby ’s risk of sudden infant death syndrome by 72 percent , a new study has found .
The finding , published Monday in The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine , is the latest evidence to suggest that a baby ’s sleep environment is a critical factor in the risk of SIDS , which is diagnosed when an infant ’s sudden death cannot be explained by other factors .
The study was not designed to identify why fans make a difference , but researchers said they thought that by circulating air , fans lowered the risk of “ rebreathing ” exhaled carbon dioxide .
That risk has been suggested as a reason the rate of SIDS is higher when children sleep on their stomach , in a soft bed or without a pacifier .
Since 1992 the rate of SIDS deaths has dropped by more than half , to about one death per 2,000 live births from 2.4 per 1,000 .
The decline is linked to a national “ Back to Sleep ” campaign that promotes putting babies on their back instead of their stomach , which has been shown to lower the risk of sudden death .
It ’s two a.m. , and we ’re barreling down a deeply pocked dirt road in Southern Sudan .
In the cool of night , the temperature is nearly 100 degrees .
Sam Childers , 46 , is behind the wheel of a chrome - tinted Mitsubishi truck .
Christian rock blares on the speakers .
He has a Bible on the dash and a shotgun that he calls his “ widow - maker ” leaning against his left knee .
His top sergeant , Santino Deng , 34 , a Dinka tribesman with an anthracite complexion and radiant black eyes , sits in the passenger seat , an AK - 47 across his lap .
I sit in the back .
Since leaving the town of Mundri , headed toward the Congolese border , we ’ve been driving for two bone - jarring days on roads littered with the charred wrecks of armored vehicles and fuel tankers , remnants of battles past .
A truck follows close behind , carrying 15 men from the small militia group under Childers ’s personal command .
The convoy is on its way to a Sudanese town called Maridi .
In the area we ’re passing through , just hours ago soldiers from the Lord ’s Resistance Army ( L.R.A. ) hacked 15 villagers to death with machetes , then disappeared into the bush .
Intelligence sources from the Sudan People ’s Liberation Army — the ragtag military wing of the breakaway government of Southern Sudan — have indicated that elements of the L.R.A. are now headed to Maridi .
Childers wants to intercept them , and kill their leader .
The unflappable Ugandan driving the militia truck wears a torn white pro-life T - shirt emblazoned with a picture of a fetus , a gift from Childers .
Most members of his militia are born - again Christians whom Childers has baptized himself .
Childers switches from Christian rock to Aerosmith ’s “ Livin ’ on the Edge , ” turning up the volume .
He ’s getting close to his prey .
“ Let ’s do this , ” he says .
To remove the L.R.A. ’s cover , villagers have set fire to the elephant grass on either side of the road .
Behind us , the past disappears in a cloud of dust .
Ahead , the headlights peer down a fiery tunnel .
Sergeant Deng , in the passenger seat , turns around to me and says , “ God ’s assassins . ”
Sam Childers is known in these parts , and back home in Pennsylvania , simply as the Reverend Sam .
He is not your typical evangelical Christian missionary , nor , as a white American , is he your typical African warlord .
Childers is a former drug dealer and outlaw biker , with tired eyes framed by grizzly muttonchops and a walrus mustache .
He claims divine justification for what he does .
In firefights , he says , God sometimes tells him when to shoot .
He speaks country - singer American , with plenty of grit , and he recounts , over and over , the same stories from his bar - brawling days .
He lifts weights , favors army fatigues , and keeps a . 44 Magnum tucked in the small of his back .
Harley tattoos stretch down his thick arms , and “ Freedom Fighter ” is airbrushed on the back of his truck .
He once owned 15 pit bulls .
He seems suited more to bending steel in a motorcycle shop than to saving souls in Sudanese villages .
In 1992 , Childers was born again , having promised his wife he would come to Jesus if God granted them a child .
A child was born .
Leaving behind a life of drugs and crime , Childers set up a hardscrabble church in rural Pennsylvania .
In 1998 he used his meager savings to take his first missionary trip to Sudan .
He ended up near the border with Uganda , where a complicated and bloody conflict — one of Africa ’s so - called forgotten wars — has been raging since 1987 .
At the center of the fighting is the Lord ’s Resistance Army , a guerrilla group led by a Ugandan named Joseph Kony .
The L.R.A. ’s stated goal is to overthrow the Ugandan government and install a theocratic state based on the Ten Commandments .
That effort has entailed systematically ignoring at least one of the commandments , Thou Shalt Not Kill .
Most of the others have been breached as well .
This forgotten war is the continent ’s longest running .
It spills across the border from Uganda into Southern Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo as the L.R.A. scours the region for conscripts and supplies .

The Russian and Indian leaders pledged co-operation
Russia has announced it will build 16 nuclear reactors in India as part of defence and energy deals .
The long - anticipated nuclear agreement came as Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin visited India .
He said nuclear co-operation was one of the most important aspects in the partnership between the two countries which have strong trade ties .
Russia 's state - owned nuclear company earlier said six of the reactors would be built by 2017 .
Russia is already building two reactors in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu .
" The agreement sees construction of up to 16 nuclear reactors in three locations , " Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov , accompanying Mr Putin , said .
Russia is competing with French and US firms for contracts to build nuclear power plants in Asia 's third - largest economy which is looking to increase its energy supply to sustain rapid economic growth .
The increased competition began after India 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the US in 2005 which ended the isolation India had experienced since it tested an atom bomb in 1974 .
" This is one of our most important and promising areas of co-operation , " Mr Putin said in New Delhi on Friday .
Coal still accounts for more than 50 % of India 's energy use - but a substantial expansion of nuclear power reactors is proposed over the next few decades .
Fighter aircraft
Over the next decade alone , the contribution of nuclear energy is expected to rise from just 3 % to 6 % of India 's total needs .
The two countries have had close links since Soviet times , with India remaining a top buyer of Russian weaponry .
However , the relationship faces new challenges , including competition from the West and the growing economic and military might of China .
As part of the deals signed during Mr Putin 's visit , Russia will refit an aircraft carrier , supply an additional 29 fighter aircraft to India and jointly develop transport aircraft .
Russian and Indian officials also discussed boosting bilateral trade , which is currently worth $ 8bn .
( In April 19 story , corrects paragraph 5 to ... about 85 percent by 2020 ... not 80 percent )
TOKYO , April 19 ( Reuters ) - Japan ’s Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry issued a draft action plan on energy usage for 2030 on Monday , including boosting zero-emission electricity output , including nuclear power , to 70 percent from 34 percent now .
Laws set to be passed by mid-June outline plans for Japan to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , once a global climate deal is reached .
[ ID :nTOE62A091 ]
Following are points from METI ’s proposed action plan to be finalised by the end of May :
-- Halving carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions from homes and passenger cars by 2030 .
-- Adding nine nuclear reactors and boosting the average nuclear plant operation rate to about 85 percent by 2020 .
-- Adding at least 14 nuclear reactors and boosting the average nuclear plant operation rate to about 90 percent by 2030 .

Prof Wyatt says the discovery is one of the most significant in years Scientists say they have identified a potential treatment for sleeping sickness , a killer disease that infects about 60,000 people in Africa a year .
British and Canadian experts say drugs could attack an enzyme the parasite causing the illness needs to survive .
They say the orally - administered drug could be ready for human clinical trials in about 18 months .
The disease , spread by the bite of a tsetse fly , is caused by a parasite attacking the central nervous system .
It has similar symptoms to malaria , making it difficult to diagnose .
Left untreated , it moves to the spinal column and brain , resulting in mental confusion and eventual death .
Fatal side effects
The deadly parasite survives inside the gut of tsetse flies
The " breakthrough " came at the University of Dundee in Scotland , where scientists were funded to research diseases neglected by major drugs companies .
Professor Paul Wyatt , director of the programme , said : " This is one of the most significant findings made in recent years in terms of drug discovery and development for neglected diseases . "
He said the research , published in the journal Nature , represented " significant strides " in the development of a full blown drug against the disease .
The World Health Organization estimates there are between 50,000 and 70,000 cases of the disease a year , with a further 60 million people at risk of infection .

The research in Dundee was backed by partners at the University of York in England and the Structural Genomics Consortium in Toronto , Canada .
The two drugs currently available to treat sleeping sickness both have associated problems .
One is arsenic - based with side effects that kill one in 20 patients and the other - eflornithine - is costly , only partially effective and requires prolonged hospital treatment , the scientists said .

Bangkok , Thailand ( CNN ) --
Political tensions in Thailand exploded into a major outbreak of violence this week as police opened fire on anti-government protesters near Bangkok .
Thailand 's capital has been at standstill during the past few weeks as the protesters seek to unseat a leadership -- led by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva -- they say is illegitimate and undemocratic .
The demonstrators support Thaksin Shinawatra , who was prime minister from 2001 to 2006 , before he was ousted in a bloodless coup .
After his removal , he continued to play a role in Thai politics -- even from outside of the Southeast Asian nation .
What is the background to the current protests ?
Abhisit declared a state of emergency on April 7 , hours after anti-government demonstrators ( known as " red shirts " for the clothes they wear ) stormed the country 's parliament .
Three days later , the deadliest clash in more than a decade between protesters ( in this case the red shirts ) and the military erupted , leading to the deaths of more than two dozen demonstrators and military forces .
Media and analysts in Thailand say civil war may be looming , with another group called the " multi- colored shirts " emerging .
They are displeased with the disruption caused by the red shirt protests .
They are generally middle - class city dwellers .
They are not pro- or anti-government , they simply want the government to shut down the reds to end the violence and interruptions to daily life .
The red and multi-colored shirts have clashed in Silom Road , Bangkok 's business and financial district .
Meanwhile , Thailand 's independent election commission has recommended the dissolution of Abhisit 's Democrat Party after accusing the party of accepting an $ 8 million campaign donation from a private company and mishandling funds allocated to it by the commission .
The ruling still must be reviewed by the country 's attorney general 's office and its Constitution Court .
A democrat party spokesman maintains the party has fully complied with all laws concerning the uses of funds during the election campaign and the party says it will fight the recommendation .
Have n't these protests been going on for a long time ?
Yes , Thailand has been embroiled in political chaos for years and many here are growing weary with the instability .
Ever since Thaksin came to power , there have been protesters opposing his allegedly corrupt and autocratic rule .
Those protesters donned yellow shirts ( the color of the king ) and occupied the two main airports in Bangkok , until finally the pro-Thaksin government was brought down by a court ruling .
In revenge Thaksin 's supporters copied the yellow shirt tactics and took to the streets in red shirts .
Why do the sides divide on colors ?
It 's an easy way for them to create an identity .
It all started with the yellow shirts wearing a color associated with Monday , the day of the week that Thailand 's revered king was born on .
That was designed to show their allegiance to the king , and more broadly the traditional elite which has dominated Thai politics for years .
Thaksin 's supporters then picked a color to distinguish themselves from the yellow - shirts .
Why are they arguing ?
Essentially this is a classic power struggle .
It 's easy to portray this as simply rich against poor , but it is much more complicated than that , as illustrated by the fact that the reds ' leader is in fact a multi-billionaire .
Thaksin rode to power by enacting populist policies which gained huge support from the rural poor .
His radical approach ruffled a lot of feathers among the elite , who felt he was in danger of becoming too big for his boots , and could erode their position .
The " civil society " also become concerned over allegations of corruption and his brutal war on drugs , which saw summary executions .
He was also criticized for his heavy handed response to violence in the Muslim - dominated south .
Finally the army decided to oust him in a coup , which had the backing of the aristocratic elite and much of the middle class , who were becoming uneasy with the cult of personality growing around Thaksin .
That set the stage for an embittered power struggle , between Thaksin loyalists and those loyal to the army , aristocracy and their traditional Democrat Party .
What are the wider implications of the protests ?
If the divisions in Thailand can't be healed it could lead to a deteriorating security situation which would have wider implications for the region .
Thailand 's relations with Cambodia are especially frosty since Thaksin was appointed economic adviser to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen .
The worst case scenario would see Cambodia drawn into the dispute , with Thaksin using the country as a political base , adding to the already considerable tensions on the border .
So who is Thaksin ?
Visionary leader or venal despot : Opinions vary , like the color of the shirts his supporters and detractors wear .
If you sport red , you think Thaksin was the only prime minister to offer the rural poor a voice and real benefits ; if you wear yellow , you view him as akin to Ferdinand Marcos : greedy , self - serving and dangerous .
What is not in dispute is that he won two elections , was the only Thai prime minister to serve a full - term in office and is still hugely popular .
But critics say he bought his support and was only in politics to help himself .
What is he accused of ?
In 2008 he was found guilty and sentenced in absentia to two years in prison for a land deal that enabled his wife to buy a valuable city plot for a fraction of its true value .
The case currently being considered by the Supreme Court relates to the transfer of shares in his communications company Shin Corporation .
The prosecution alleges he illegally transferred the shares to his family , who then sold them to the Singapore government 's Temasek without paying tax .
The court will also rule on whether Thaksin 's government implemented policies that benefited his businesses , including a low interest loan from the Thai government to the Myanmar government to buy equipment from Shin Corp , a change in tax laws that benefited Shin Corp and changes to satellite laws that helped Shin Corp .
What does Thaksin 's defense team say ?
The defense team argues that neither Thaksin nor his wife owned the Shin Corp shares while he was prime minister , selling them to their son before he took office .
It was their son who decided to sell Shin Corp to the Singaporeans .
The defense also claims that the Assets Scrutiny Committee -- which has led the investigation in this case -- was politically motivated , having been appointed after the coup that ousted Thaksin , and therefore was biased against him .
How much money is at stake ?
76.6 billion baht ( about $ 2.3 billion ) .
That is the total value of his and his family 's assets that are currently frozen in Thailand .
But there is speculation that he has a great deal more money elsewhere .
Why bother going after Thaksin when so many other Thai leaders have been perceived to be corrupt ?
Well , Thailand certainly has had a checkered history .
But current Premier Abhisit Vejjajiva is widely believed to be honest and free from any taint of corruption .
He wants to give the country a fresh start by showing no one is above the rule of law and that means ensuring Thaksin is n't allowed to get away with his alleged corruption , even though he is in exile .
However , many analysts say this case is not just about corruption , but more about Thaksin 's challenge to the Thai political elite that has ruled for decades .
The theory goes that Thaksin was dangerously popular and refused to submit to powerful factions in the army , privy council and aristocracy -- hence the 2006 coup and the lengthy efforts to shut him down .
CNN Producer Kocha Olarn contributed to this report from Bangkok
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said he would consider introducing an internet ombudsman after Facebook tributes to two dead children were defaced with pornography .
Rudd said he would look into an idea put forward by Independent Senator Nick Xenophon to appoint an official who would be responsible for taking complaints and action against such material .
" We actually need to do everything we can to combat cyber crime , " Rudd said .
" The role of cyber crime and internet bullying on children is , frankly , frightening and we need to be deploying all practical measures . "
Memorial pages on the social networking site for eight - year - old Trinity Bates and Elliott Fletcher , 12 , who were allegedly murdered in separate incidents this month , have been vandalised with offensive material .
Jaimee Alkinani and her husband had just bought their first home in a quiet suburb of Salt Lake City , Utah .
The three - bedroom house was in a nice neighborhood : tree - lined street , kids riding their bikes down the sidewalk , and friendly neighbors who waved when they passed .
The family was on their way — they 'd also just opened a small business near their home , had an 11 - month - old child , and Jaimee was eight months pregnant .
Life had officially started for the Alkinanis .
But soon things turned for the worse .
A few days after they had moved in , a neighbor welcomed them with disturbing news .
" Your house used to be a meth lab , " he said — a fact that the seller had never disclosed .
So they called their realtor .
He told them not to worry , that the house had been decontaminated .
He even produced a certificate from the local health department to prove it .
Then the family started getting sick .
Within five months , Jaimee and her husband developed sinus problems that required surgery .
When their baby was born , he had serious lung issues that caused him to stop breathing a few times .
He also was n’t gaining weight , and was in and out of the hospital .
So the Alkinanis had their house tested for methamphetamine .
The results made Jaimee put her kids in the car and immediately abandon her new home , with all the family ’s possessions still inside .
The house ’s level of methamphetamine contamination was 63 times higher than the level at which the Utah Department of Health condemns a house .
Houses formerly used as meth labs , called meth houses , put their residents at risk of serious health consequences , says Stan Smith , a doctoral student at the University of California , Los Angeles , and director of the Drug Endangered Children Task Force , a division of the California Drug Enforcement Agency .
Upon moving into a meth house , people have experienced short - term health problems ranging from migraines and respiratory difficulties to skin irritation and burns .
Long - term problems are less well known , but the results from a 2009 study in Toxicological Sciences suggest that methamphetamine chemicals may cause cancer in humans .
And because children have small , developing bodies and a tendency to play on the ground and put things in their mouths , they are especially susceptible to adverse health effects from meth toxins .
" When we go into a lab , if there are children , the first thing we do is take the children to the hospital and assess them for contamination , " Smith says .
The chemicals used in methamphetamine production are highly toxic and range from pseudoephedrine — the main ingredient in meth and the active ingredient in decongestants — to any one of 32 other precursor chemicals .
These include acetone , the active ingredient in nail polish remover , and phosphine , a widely used insecticide .
Home - cooking meth spreads toxins to every inch of the room where the meth was cooked and beyond .
Nothing escapes contamination — the carpet , walls , furniture , drapes , air ducts , and even the air itself becomes toxic .
" Ingesting some of these chemicals , even a tiny drop , can cause immediate death , " Smith says .
" When we go into a meth lab , we have on respirators , Tyvec suits , shoe coverings , gloves and eye goggles , " says Sgt. Cory Craig , a state highway patrolman and narcotics specialist based in northern Missouri .
Police treat methamphetamine labs as hazardous waste sites .
They remove meth - making hardware and chemicals , and often hire professional cleaning companies to sanitize the house .
The sheer amount of chemicals removed from labs is staggering .
Consider Missouri alone .
" Since 1998 we 've seized 12,354 meth labs , 251,000 pounds of solid waste , and 118,000 pounds of toxic waste , " Craig says .
In dealing with toxic chemicals , most meth lab clean - up crews follow general guidelines .
In the room where the meth was made , they scrub all surfaces , repaint the walls , replace the carpets and air filters , and air out the property .
However , there are no national standards for meth lab cleanups — regulations differ from state to state .
And in some states , getting a license to decontaminate a house is as easy as taking a few hours of class and a written test .
" There are some bad certification methods out there .
You could be a pizza delivery guy , study for a month , pay $ 250 and be certified , " said Joe Mazzuca , a methamphetamine contamination expert and CEO of Meth Lab Cleanup , a nationwide meth - lab - specific cleanup company based in Boise , Idaho .
In the Alkinanis ’ case , the person who decontaminated their house shirked his responsibility by cleaning too quickly and not using the correct cleaning agents .
And although some states , such as Colorado , Washington and North Carolina , employ effective regulations , some experts think that many may not .
In Idaho , for example , a former lab is deemed " clean " when there is less than one tenth of a microgram of methamphetamine per square centimeter in the room where the drug was cooked .
If the amount of meth detected is at such a low level , some state regulators think , the precursor chemicals are at low levels too .
" We just check for meth , " says Jim Faust of Idaho 's statewide Clandestine Drug Lab Cleanup Program , based in Boise .
Like Idaho , many states only check for meth in the room where the drug was cooked .
This method does n't account for toxic dust or harmful chemicals that may have traveled to other parts of the house .
Another compounding factor is that many states do not require that the person cleaning be professionally trained or licensed in methamphetamine or hazardous waste cleanup .
Of all the toxic chemicals in a meth house , the drug itself is probably the hardest to clean up , but it 's actually the least toxic .
The precursor chemicals pose the greatest health risk to residents of a former meth lab .
When people smoke or shoot meth they face serious health risks , but they usually do n't die — they just get high .
Many of meth 's toxic precursors , if smoked or injected , are lethal .
Even if a meth house is cleaned properly , some contamination experts worry that the toxins may hang around .
Glenn Morrison , an engineering professor at the Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla , questions the adequacy of current meth house cleanup standards , emphasizing their failure to ensure the removal of toxins that are absorbed by the home .
" These clean - ups tend to be somewhat superficial when it comes to permanent building materials , " he says .
Morrison recently received funding from the National Institute of Standards and Technology to investigate exactly how methamphetamine contamination resides in buildings .
He hopes to figure out whether current meth lab cleanup protocols properly address contamination .
" Building materials absorb pollutants , even if the materials are not obviously porous or fleecy .
This contamination can be re-released , even after the building has been cleaned , " Morrison says .
Professional meth house cleanup contractors estimate that about 90 percent of meth houses are never uncovered , and their tenants will likely never know about their homes ’ toxicity .
Many of the meth houses that are discovered are listed on the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 's ( DEA ) National Clandestine Laboratory Register or on other state databases .
The DEA 's registry lists 113,464 meth labs that were uncovered from 1999 to 2008 .
But this figure does n't account for any undiscovered meth labs and many meth experts think it 's an underestimate .
" The record keeping is horrific .
The DEA 's list ca n’t be relied upon because it 's completely voluntary , ” says Dawn Turner , who started methlabhomes.com , a free , web - based resource for people who have unknowingly purchased a meth house .
" I 've heard estimates that there are a million to a million and a half meth homes and most of them are never found by the police department , " she adds .
In the area where the Alkinanis lived , there were 250 known meth houses and most of their owners had no clue about their homes ' nefarious past .
The exact number of meth houses in U.S. is still unknown .
And although meth houses are more concentrated in certain states —
Missouri is the meth capitol of the world , with 1,471 labs discovered in 2008 alone — there are meth houses in all fifty states .
Consider a lab found in Framingham , Mass. , a town with an average home price of around $ 350,000 .
Or one found in Norwalk , Conn. , where the average home is valued at $ 694,000 .
" There is a misconception that these houses are crack houses .
They are absolutely not .
A meth house in Kentucky recently went on the market for $ 700,000 dollars , " Turner says .
With so many homes potentially contaminated by methamphetamine production , Turner estimates that thousands to tens of thousands of people have discovered that what they thought was the American dream — a nice home for the family — is actually an American nightmare — the potential cause of a range of health problems and a stack of medical bills .
But is the issue receiving enough attention ?
Not for people like Turner .
" States are really dragging their feet on this issue , " she says .
The Alkinanis agree .
Because there were no meth lab disclosure laws in Utah at the time they bought their house , they have no financial or legal recourse .
" We are paying the price for what one person did , " says Jaimee Alkinani .
" My child will likely have a lifetime of permanent medical issues because of this house , and we are going into bankruptcy because we can't sell the house . "

Broadmoor Hospital is a high - security psychiatric hospital at Crowthorne in the Borough of Bracknell Forest in Berkshire , England .
It is the best known of the three high - security psychiatric hospitals in England , the other two being Ashworth and Rampton .
The hospital was built in 1863 to a design by Sir Joshua Jebb , and covers 210,000 square metres ( 53 acres ) within its secure perimeter .
After the escape of John Straffen ( see below ) in 1952 , who murdered a local child , the hospital set up an alarm system .
The hospital has seen some prolific inmates since its inception , and this list describes 10 of its most famous tenants .
Note :
If you ’re just interested in Charles Bronson , we ’ve got an entire list dedicated to the most insane prisoner in England .
10 Robert Napper
Robert Clive Napper is a convicted British murderer and rapist who was remanded in Broadmoor Hospital indefinitely on 18 December 2008 for the manslaughter of Rachel Nickell .
He is a paranoid schizophrenic who has also been diagnosed with Asperger ’s syndrome .
The marriage of Napper ’s parents was violent ; Napper witnessed violent attacks on his mother which ended in divorce when he was 10 .
Napper and his siblings ( two brothers and a sister ) were placed in foster care and underwent psychiatric treatment .
Meanwhile , Napper underwent a personality change after a family friend assaulted him on a camping holiday when he was 12 .
The offender was jailed , but Napper became introverted , obsessively tidy and reclusive according to his mother .
He also bullied his siblings and spied on his sister while she undressed .
Napper ’s convictions include an offense with an air - gun , stabbing a young mother forty - nine times in front of her two year - old son , killing then sexually assaulting a woman and smothering her four - year - old daughter , and admitted to two rapes , but it is believed he is the ‘ Green Chain Rapist ’ who carried out at least 70 savage attacks across south - east London over a four - year period ending in 1994
9 Graham Young
Graham Frederick
Young is notable for his obsession with the use of poison , and for having been imprisoned for murder in his teens , only to kill again after his release .
Born in Neasden , north London , he was fascinated from a young age by poisons and their effects .
In 1961 at 14 he started to test poisons on his family , enough to make them violently ill .
He amassed large quantities of antimony and digitalis by repeatedly buying small amounts , lying about his age and claiming they were for science experiments at school .
In 1962 Young ’s stepmother Molly died from poison .
He had been poisoning his father , sister , and a school friend .
Young ’s aunt Winnie , who knew of his fascination with chemistry and poisons , became suspicious .
He might have escaped suspicion as he suffered the same nausea and sicknesses as his family , however he sometimes forgot which foods he had laced .
He was sent to a psychiatrist , who recommended contacting the police .
Young was arrested on May 23 , 1962 .
He confessed to the attempted murders of his father , sister , and friend .
The remains of his stepmother could not be analyzed because she had been cremated .
Young was sentenced to 15 years in Broadmoor but was released after nine years , having been deemed “ fully recovered ” .
After release from hospital in 1971 , he began work as a storekeeper at John Hadland Laboratories , which manufactured thallium bromide - iodide infrared lenses used in military equipment .
Soon after he began work , his foreman , Bob Egle , grew ill and died .
Young had been making tea laced with poisons for his colleagues .
A sickness swept through his workplace and , mistaken for a virus , was nicknamed the Bovingdon Bug .
These cases of nausea and illness , sometimes severe enough to require hospitalization , were later attributed to Young and his tea .
Young poisoned about 70 people during the next few months , although none fatally .
Young is the subject of an extremely good film called The Young Poisoner ’s Handbook
8 Kenneth Erskine
Kenneth Erskine is an English serial killer who became known as the Stockwell Strangler .
During 1986 , Erskine murdered seven elderly people , breaking into their homes and strangling them ; most often they were sexually assaulted .
The crimes took place in London .
A homeless drifter and solvent abuser , Erskine was 24 years old when he committed the crimes , but had the mental age of a 12 - year - old .
Police suspected Erskine of four others murders but Erskine has never been charged with any of these murders .
Erskine was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommended minimum term of 40 years , but has since been found to be suffering from mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983 , and is therefore now held at Broadmoor .
He is unlikely to be freed until at least 2028 and the age of 66 .
Some 20 years later , the trial judge ’s recommendation is still one of the heaviest ever handed out in British legal history .
In February 1996 , Erskine was again in the news , this time for preventing the possible murder of Peter Sutcliffe ( see below ) , by raising the alarm as a fellow inmate , Paul Wilson , attempted to strangle Sutcliffe with the flex from a pair of stereo headphones .
7 David Copeland
David John Copeland is a former member of the British National Party and the National Socialist Movement , who became known as the “ London Nail Bomber , ” after a 13 - day bombing campaign in April 1999 aimed at London ’s black , Bangladeshi and gay communities .
The bombs killed three , including a pregnant woman , and injured 129 , four of whom lost limbs .
No warnings were given .
After his arrest , he told psychiatrists that he had started having sadistic dreams when he was about 12 , including dreams or fantasies that he had been reincarnated as an SS officer with access to women as slaves .
Copeland wrote to BBC correspondent Graeme McLagan , denying that he had schizophrenia , and telling McLagan that the “ ZOG , ” or Zionist Occupation Government , was pumping him full of drugs in order to sweep him under the carpet .
He wrote , “ I bomb the blacks , Pakis , degenerates .
I would have bombed the Jews as well if I ’d got a chance ” .
When asked by police why he had targeted ethnic minorities , he replied : “ Because I do n’t like them , I want them out of this country , I believe in the master race .
Although Copeland was diagnosed by five psychiatrists as having paranoid schizophrenia , and a consultant concluded he had a personality disorder , his plea of diminished responsibility was not accepted by the prosecution , which was under pressure not to concede to his pleas of guilty to manslaughter .
He was convicted of murder on June 30 , 2000 , and given six concurrent life sentences .
6 Peter Sutcliffe
Peter William Sutcliffe is an English serial killer who was dubbed The Yorkshire Ripper .
Sutcliffe was convicted in 1981 of murdering 13 women and attacking several others .
He is currently serving life imprisonment in Broadmoor .
Reportedly a loner at school , he left at the age of 15 and took a series of menial jobs , including two stints as a grave digger during the 1960s .
He frequented prostitutes as a young man and it has been speculated that a bad experience with one ( during which he was allegedly conned out of money ) helped fuel his violent hatred against women .
In 1981 , Sutcliffe was stopped by the police with a 24 year old prostitute .
A police check revealed the car was fitted with false number plates and Sutcliffe was arrested for this offence and transferred to Dewsbury Police Station , West Yorkshire .
At Dewsbury he was questioned in relation to the Yorkshire Ripper case as he matched so many of the physical characteristics known .
The next day police returned to the scene of the arrest and discovered a knife , hammer and rope he discarded when he briefly slipped away from police during the arrest .
After two days of intensive questioning , on the afternoon of 4 January 1981 Sutcliffe suddenly declared he was the Ripper .
Over the next day , Sutcliffe calmly described his many attacks .
Weeks later he claimed God told him to murder the women .
He displayed emotion only when telling of the murder of his youngest victim , Jayne MacDonald .
At his trial , Sutcliffe pleaded not guilty to 13 counts of murder , but guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility .
The basis of this defence was his claim that he was the tool of God ’s will .
Sutcliffe first claimed to have heard voices while working as a gravedigger , that ultimately ordered him to kill prostitutes .
He claimed that the voices originated from a headstone of a deceased Polish man , Bronislaw Zapolski , and that the voices were that of God .
In the years of Sutcliffe ’s incarceration , there have been numerous attempts on his life from other inmates .
The first was during his stay at HMP Parkhurst when James Costello , a 35 - year - old career criminal from Glasgow plunged a broken coffee jar twice into the left side of Sutcliffe ’s face .
Whilst at Broadmoor he was subject to an attempted strangulation ( thwarted by Kenneth Erskine , above ) and lost the vision in his left eye after being attacked with a pen .
5 John Straffen
John Thomas Straffen was a British serial killer who was the longest - serving prisoner in British legal history .
Straffen killed two young girls in the summer of 1951 .
He was found to be unfit to plead and committed to Broadmoor ; during a brief escape in 1952 he killed again .
This time he was convicted of murder .
Respited due to his mental state , his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he remained in prison until his death more than 50 years later .
Aged 8 , Straffen was referred to a Child Guidance Clinic for stealing and truancy .
In 1939 he first came before a Juvenile Court for stealing a purse from a girl , and was given two years ’ probation .
His probation officer found that Straffen did not understand the difference between right and wrong , or the meaning of probation .
The family was living in crowded lodgings at the time and Straffen ’s mother had no time to help , so the probation officer took the boy to a psychiatrist .
As a result , Straffen was certified as a mental defective under the Mental Deficiency Act 1927 .
A report was compiled on him in 1940 which gave his Intelligence Quotient as 58 and placed his mental age at six .
When Straffen was 14 , he was strongly suspected of being responsible for strangling two prize geese owned by one of the officers of his school ; however , no proof was found and it was not noted on his records .
At the age of 16 the school authorities undertook a review which found his I.Q. was 64 and his mental age 9 years 6 months and recommended his discharge .
In 1951 , Straffen killed two young girls for which he was sent to Broadmoor .
In 1952 whilst cleaning some outbuildings , he escaped over a perimeter wall , and within 2 hours had killed another young girl .
It was this escape and subsequent murder that urged the government to install an alarm system .
To this day , the alarm is tested every Monday morning at 10 am for two minutes , and then sounded again to give the ‘ all clear ’ .
With hooters located in several locations round Surrey and Berkshire , the alarm can be heard for up to 15 miles in each direction from Broadmoor .
4 Charles Bronson
Charles “ Charlie ” Bronson ( born Michael Gordon Peterson ) is an English criminal often referred to in the British press as the “ most violent prisoner in Britain ” .
Born in Luton , England , Michael often found his way into fights before he began a bare - knuckle boxing career in the East End of London .
His promoter was not happy with his name and suggested he change it to Charles Bronson .
In 1974 he was imprisoned for a robbery and sentenced to seven years .
While in prison he began making a name for himself as a loose cannon often fighting convicts and prison guards .
These fights added years onto his sentence .
Regarded as a problem prisoner , he was moved 120 times throughout Her Majesty ’s Prison Service and spent all but 4 years of his imprisoned life in solitary confinement .
What was originally a seven year term stretched out to fourteen year sentence that resulted in his first wife Irene , with whom he had a son , leaving him .
He was released on October 30 , 1988 but only spent 69 days free before he was arrested again .
Bronson has spent a total of just four months and nine days out of custody since 1974 .
Known as one of the hardest criminals in England , Bronson has written many books about his experiences and famous prisoners he has met throughout his internment .
Bronson has been involved in over a dozen hostage incidents , one of which includes taking hostages and staging a 47 - hour rooftop protest at Broadmoor in 1983 , causing £ 750,000 ( nearly $ 1.5 m ) worth of damage .
Bronson has spent time at all three of England ’s high - security psychiatric hospitals .
3 Richard Dadd
Richard Dadd was an English painter of the Victorian era , noted for his depictions of fairies and other supernatural subjects , Orientalist scenes , and enigmatic genre scenes , rendered with obsessively minuscule detail .
Most of the works for which he is best known were created while he was incarcerated in Broadmoor hospital .
In 1842 , Sir Thomas Phillips , the former mayor of Newport , chose Dadd to accompany him as his draftsman on an expedition through Europe to Greece , Turkey , Palestine and finally Egypt .
In November of that year they spent a grueling two weeks in Palestine , passing from Jerusalem to Jordan and returning across the Engaddi wilderness .
Toward the end of December , while traveling up the Nile by boat , Dadd underwent a dramatic personality change , becoming delusional and increasingly violent , and believing himself to be under the influence of the Egyptian god Osiris .
His condition was initially thought to be sunstroke .
On his return in the spring of 1843 , he was diagnosed to be of unsound mind and was taken by his family to recuperate in the countryside village of Cobham , Kent .
In August of that year , having become convinced that his father was the Devil in disguise , Dadd killed him with a knife and fled for France .
En route to Paris Dadd attempted to kill another tourist with a razor , but was overpowered and was arrested by the police .
Dadd confessed to the killing of his father and was returned to England , where he was committed to the criminal department of Bethlem psychiatric hospital ( also known as Bedlam ) .
Here and subsequently at the newly created Broadmoor , Dadd was cared for and encouraged to continue painting .
Dadd probably suffered from a form of paranoid schizophrenia .
He appears to have been genetically predisposed to mental illness ; two of his siblings were similarly afflicted , while a third had “ a private attendant ” for unknown reasons .
2 Daniel M’Naghten
Daniel M’Naghten ( pronounced , and sometimes spelled , McNaughton ) was a Scottish woodturner who assassinated English civil servant Edward Drummond while suffering from paranoid delusions .
Through his trial and its aftermath , he has given his name to the legal test of criminal insanity in England and other common law jurisdictions known as the M’Naghten Rules .
In 1840 M’Naghten sold his wood turning business and spent two years in London and Glasgow .
Whilst in Glasgow in 1841 he complained to various people , including his father , the Glasgow commissioner of police , and an MP , that he was being persecuted by the Tories and followed by their spies .
No - one took him seriously , believing him to be deluded .
In January 1843 , M’Naghten was noticed acting suspiciously around Whitehall in London .
On the afternoon of 20 January the Prime Minister ’s private secretary , civil servant Edward Drummond , was walking towards Downing Street from Charing Cross when M’Naghten approached him from behind , drew a pistol and fired at point - blank range into his back .
M’Naghten was overpowered by a police constable before he could fire a second pistol .
M’Naghten appeared at Bow Street magistrates ’ court the morning after the assassination attempt .
He made a brief statement in which he described how persecution by the Tories had driven him to act : “ The Tories in my native city have compelled me to do this .
They follow , persecute me wherever I go , and have entirely destroyed my peace of mind …
It can be proved by evidence .
That is all I have to say ”
1 Ronald Kray
Ronald Kray along with his twin brother Reginald , were the foremost perpetrators of organized crime in London ’s East End during the 1950s and 1960s .
Ronald , commonly referred to as Ron or Ronnie , suffered from paranoid schizophrenia .
The Krays were involved in armed robberies , arson , protection rackets , violent assaults including torture and the murders of Jack “ The Hat ” McVitie and George Cornell .
As West End nightclub owners they mixed with prominent entertainers including Diana Dors , Frank Sinatra , Judy Garland and politicians , which gave the Krays a veneer of respectability .
In the 1960s they became celebrities in their own right , being photographed by David Bailey and interviewed on television .
The Kray twins became famous locally for their gang and the mayhem they caused .
They narrowly avoided prison several times and in early 1952 they were called up for National Service .
They deserted several times , each time being recaptured .
It was during this period that Ron started to show the first signs of mental illness .
He would refuse to eat , shave only one side of his face and suffer wild mood swings , sitting still for hours before erupting into a violent frenzy .
On one occasion , Ron climbed into the prison rafters and , according to one guard , refused to come down for some six hours in spite of brother Reggie ’s pleas .
It is not clear whether at this stage it was another prank to annoy their guards , or if Ron had become unbalanced .
Guards at the Canterbury military holding prison were convinced he was dangerously psychotic .
They were arrested in May 1968 and convicted in 1969 by the efforts of a squad of detectives led by Detective Superintendent Leonard “ Nipper ” Read , and were both sentenced to life imprisonment .
Ronnie was eventually certified insane and lived the remainder of his life in Broadmoor , dying on 17 March 1995 of a massive heart attack , aged 61 .
His funeral on 29 March 1995 was a huge event with people lining the streets .
Reggie was released from prison on compassionate grounds in August 2000 , a few weeks before his death from cancer .
Via Twitter , Infinity Ward 's Robert Bowling just mentioned that Modern Warfare 2 gamers have logged more than 1.75 billion hours in the game , just on Xbox Live .
That 's nearly 200,000 years .

• The combined lifespan of everyone living in Hettinger Co. , North Dakota ( population 2,564 , 2006 Census estimates ) , assuming an average life expectancy of 78 years .
So , take an entire county out in the middle of nowhere , hook them up to an Xbox 360 and have them do nothing but play this game from birth to death , that 's how much gaming has been done .

Two Hundred Thousand Years Ago :
• Was the Middle Paleolithic Era , and the earliest evidence of behavioral modernity - i.e.
Neanderthals painting cave walls and burying their dead .
So the combined playtime on this game would be older than even basic civilized behavior .
Which is , frankly , not surprising .

Two Hundred Thousand Light Years
Is :
• Roughly twice the diameter of the Milky Way .
If an alien on Planet Zantrar 5 on the opposite side of the galaxy hosted a match over a connection traveling at the speed of light , you could fit the entire Xbox Live multiplayer history of this game within the lag , twice .

Protestors gathered early on the West Front of the Capitol to plead with Democrats to abandon their push for a sweeping health care bill .
Dems say protesters used N - word
It was a tense scene outside a meeting of Democratic lawmakers as a 100 or so protesters chanted " kill the bill , " and one man launching a homophobic slur at Rep. Barney Frank .
Frank , who is gay , was leaving the Longworth House Office Building when a man yelled a charged homophobic slur at the Massachusetts lawmaker .

Other protesters quickly admonished the shouter , with one woman yelling back , " We do n't need that . "
When Rep. John Lewis said he was voting for the bill , someone yelled , " Baby killer . "
Later , House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn said that he heard from Lewis that another protestor later called him the N - word .
A Lewis staffer confirmed that Lewis had been the target of that slur .
Clyburn decried that language to a group of reporters after President Barack Obama spoke to House Democrats .
“ I heard people saying things today I have not heard since March 15 , 1960 , when I was marching to try to get off the back of the bus , ” Clyburn said , responding to a question about epithets uttered at his colleagues .
“ It was shocking to me . ”
Cyburn said that he had also engaged with a few conservative hecklers , and told one of them : “ ‘ I ’m the hardest person in the world to intimidate . ’
So they better go somewhere else . ”
Pivoting to the thousands of protesters there to register their opposition to the health bill , Clyburn painted them broadly as a reactionary force , and the bill as an extension of other movements to grant basic rights :
“ Well , a lot of us have been saying ( for ) a long time that much of this , much of this , is not about health care at all , and I think a lot of those people today demonstrated that this is not about health care , ” he said .
“ It ’s about trying to extend a basic fundamental right to people who are less powerful . ”
A spokesman for Rep. Emanuel Cleaver ( D - Mo. ) issued a statement Saturday evening confirming earlier second - hand reports that the Congressman had been spit on , and again equating the health care bill with the civil rights movement :
“ For many of the members of the CBC , like John Lewis and Emanuel Cleaver who worked in the civil rights movement , and for Mr. Frank who has struggled in the cause of equality , this is not the first time they have been spit on during turbulent times .
“ This afternoon , the Congressman was walking into the Capitol to vote , when one protester spat on him .
The Congressman would like to thank the US Capitol Police officer who quickly escorted the other Members and him into the Capitol , and defused the tense situation with professionalism and care .
After all the Members were safe , a full report was taken and the matter was handled by the US Capitol Police .
The man who spat on the Congressman was arrested , but the Congressman has chosen not to press charges .
He has left the matter with the Capitol Police .
“ This is not the first time the Congressman has been called the " n " word and certainly not the worst assault he has endured in his years fighting for equal rights for all Americans .
That being said , he is disappointed that in the 21st century our national discourse has devolved to the point of name calling and spitting .
He looks forward to taking a historic vote on health care reform legislation tomorrow , for the residents of the Fifth District of Missouri and for all Americans .
He believes deeply that tomorrow 's vote is , in fact , a vote for equality and to secure health care as a right for all .
Our nation has a history of struggling each time we expand rights .
Today 's protests are no different , but the Congressman believes this is worth fighting for . ”

Evidence seems to be mounting that we are headed towards some sort of implosion in the paper Gold market , and perhaps the currency / bond markets in general .
Let ’s take a look :
Jacksonville , FL based EverBank – a bank with approximately $ 8 billion in assets and 1800 employees according to the company website – recently sent this notice to customers ( courtesy of Warren Bevan ) :
" Non-FDIC Insured Metals Select Changes " - Section 6.3.7 .
General Terms :
We have added language clarifying our right to close your account .
We may close your Metals Select Account at anytime upon reasonable notice to you .
If we believe that it is necessary to close your account immediately in order to limit losses by you or us [ GG :
We really do n’t give a s**t about you ; it ’s us that we care about ] , we may close your account prior to providing notice to you .
Notice from us to one of you is notice to all of you [ GG : the nerve of these people ! ] .
If we close your account , we reserve the right to convert your Precious Metals to U.S. dollars and tender the balance to you by mail [ GG : I am willing to bet my entire Gold stash that when you receive these " converted " dollars , they will be nowhere near the market price of physical .
What did you think that whole " limit losses " thing meant ? ] .
If you have a " Non FDIC Insured Metals Select " account with these people , you can pretty much say goodbye to any chances of ever seeing your metal .
This is a clear sign that the ( already tight ) availability of physical metal at the manipulated Comex futures paper price is in danger of vanishing altogether .
Think about it .
What is the scenario in which they avoid catastrophic losses while at the same time sending you the US dollar value of the metal ?
When the official or Comex price has fully decoupled from the physical price .
Expect to see more such notices from banks offering Metals " Investments " .
Citibank recently issued this notice to its checking account ( remember the type of account where you thought you could withdraw your money whenever you wanted ?
Well , not anymore ) customers ( via Market Ticker ) :
Withdrawal Notice :
We reserve the right to require seven ( 7 ) days advance notice before permitting a withdrawal from all checking , savings and money market accounts .
We currently do not exercise this right and have not exercised it in the past .
Hmm …let me see .
Why would a bank need to impose withdrawal restrictions ?
Has this kind of a thing happened before somewhere ?
Could it be because of the danger of a bank run/capital flight from the United States ?
Why would Citibank fear bank runs ?
Why would money flee the US banking system / US ?
Could it be because the entire US banking system and the US Government is INSOLVENT and people - fearing a collapse in the dollar ’s value ( in terms of real goods i.e. for all you Prechterites out there ) - rush to withdraw money convert it into real goods such as precious metals ?
You tell me .
Also , could they maybe increase this notice period from seven to whatever the hell they want whenever they want ?
What will you do then ?
Even if you do n’t buy Gold with it , withdrawing your cash from America ’s insolvent banks is a very wise strategy at this point .
One of Mish ’s readers Construction Insider recently sent him this little nugget :
Hi Mish I work in the construction business and something has been creeping to the forefront of my attention for the past few weeks and now it seems to be moving full steam ahead .
Banks are forcing developers / builders ( especially smaller ones ) to give up their properties ( unsold homes and lots ) .
Banks say the reason is that the properties in question are no longer performing assets .
I am sure there are some loans out there that are not performing and the owners are going under .
I am equally sure that there are plenty of developers that are still selling homes - just not at the pace originally planned on the pro formas .
Having inside information on one of these scenarios that happened today , I cannot help but wonder what is really going on ?
The bank told a small developer / builder I work for that they were taking back his ongoing subdivision .
He is selling houses and updated pro formas would indicate that the current sales pace would exhaust all remaining lots within 33 months .
Yet the bank stated they would only give him until April 15 to find alternative financing .
The bank is also willing to let him buy the subdivision at a 33 % discount to what is currently owed .
If he is unable to obtain this backing , the bank will let him walk away without penalty or consequence so they can write it off .
I have been on the phone trying to put some of these pieces together .
It seems there are many banks doing the same thing .
However , there is apparently no interest [ or ability - Mish ] from anyone wanting to pick up land / lots at 30 % - 50 % discounts to today 's prices .
Another interesting point is that the banks all state that they must have these situations written off or taken care of by the end of Q2 .
Looks to me like DaBoyz are calling in the loans while the currency still has some value .
Does the government plan some type of overt currency devaluation or expect the dollar to collapse on the currency markets of its own sorry weight ?
The cracks are already appearing in the Bond market .
Foreigners are increasingly fleeing the Treasury auctions .
The only thing keeping them going is manufactured " deflation " fears from time - to - time .
A recent 30 year auction ( 10th February , 2010 to be precise ) practically failed .
This is what Mr. Denninger had to say about it :
Bad .
Actually , let 's go worse than bad and call it what it is - by any definition this is just one step off from " Failed . "
The more - worrying factor here is that we 've got this " mystery " direct buyers out here again taking nearly 25 % of the offered amount ( who is bidding for that undisclosed ? ) and another 11 % taken down by The Fed for the SOMA account .
Yet even with this Treasury had to pay up to get it to go and the bid - to - cover was anemic at best .
Given the Primary Dealer system we have in this country , any BTC under 2.0 is an effective fail .
To get an auction that behaves in this sort of fashion , complete with mystery direct bidders and heavy SOMA ( Fed ) participation , yet Treasury has to pay up in the form of a significantly higher coupon is not a good sign at all .
And this is what happened on 23rd February , 2010 for a 4 - week $ 37 billion Treasury Bill auction ( Per Graham Summers ) :
There are times in life when one witnesses something so outside the scope of normal experience , that at first you do n’t see it .
Captain Cook ’s diaries tell us that upon first seeing his ships offshore in Australia , the aborigines expressed “ neither surprise nor concern . ”
Cook notes that it was not until he and his men approached the shore in smaller , more familiar vessels that the villagers reacted , arming themselves as “ the sight of men in small boats was comprehensible to them : it meant invasion . ”
Well , I had a similar experience during yesterday ’s bond auction .
Roughly , 27 % of the auction took place at the highest rate .
This means nearly one third of the demand from competitive bidders ( those who care about yield ) came at the HIGHEST yield that was accepted .
In plain terms , this alone tells you that investors want higher yields from Treasuries since nearly a full third of the debt issuance took place at the highest REQUIRED yield .
Of the competitive bids ( meaning those bids coming from folks who care about yield ) , roughly 70 % went to Primary Dealers ( investors who HAVE to buy the debt and who usually turn around and try to sell it afterwards ) .
To put this number into perspective here is the percentage of competitive purchases made by Primary Dealers in the last four 4 - week Treasury issuances : ... yesterday ’s auction featured MORE buys from Primary Dealers than almost any of those occurring in 2010 .
Remember , Primary Dealers HAVE to buy Treasuries .
So to see them buying a high percentage of Treasuries at debt auctions means that few investors who can pick and choose what to buy are actually looking to buy US debt .
Of the remaining competitive buys ( about $ 8.86 billion ) , only 32 % came from Direct Bidders or those who bought debt directly from the Treasury : orders that can easily be tracked .
The other 68 % ( $ 5.9 billion ) came from Indirect Bidders : folks who we cannot track .
Even more bizarre , only $ 5.9 billion in Indirect Bidder competitive buys were ACTUALLY OFFERED .
So we had a 100 % acceptance rate for Indirect Bidder competitive buys .
Let ’s put this in perspective :
This means that the Treasury took up EVERY single cent of competitive bids coming from indirect buyers .
Remember , indirect buyers are usually assumed to be foreign governments ( even the Treasury website admits this ) .
If this was the case yesterday , then foreign governments barely bought much of anything in yesterday ’s auction ( only 19 % of total debt issued ) .
Moreover , it implies that Primary Dealers ( those having to buy ) had to gorge on the auction to make up for the fact that few if any foreign governments are interested in buying our debt anymore ( including even short - term debt ) .
So basically the demand from the indirects ( i.e. foreigners ) for US Debt is drying up and the Treasury is taking all of whatever miniscule amounts they are offering .
As if that was not enough , we had another similar auction on 9th Match , 2010 ( via zerohedge ) :
Two weeks after the indirect hit ratio in the 4 week auction came at a record 100 % , today it was once again at almost at the all time possible high , with Indirect Bids of just $ 6.744 billion taking down $ 6.683 billion , resulting in a 99.1 % hit ratio .
The chart of the recent Indirect hit ratio in recent 4 week bill auctions is attached :
What ’s more , the yield doubled from two weeks ago .
What we are witnessing here , in my opinion , is the beginning moves of a complete and total repudiation of the US Bond market , and indeed , all dollar denominated paper financial assets .
The dam will rise to 3,260 meters , on Yarlung Zangbo River ( Brahmaputra , for Indians ) using special materials and techniques .
But India notes that the river is essential to the lives of millions of people and calls for assurances that Beijing does not seem to want to give .
For that zone a war was fought that has never officially ended .
Beijing ( AsiaNews / Agencies ) - China has admitted that it is building a dam on the Yarlung Zangbo River .
The river originates in Tibet , but then flows into India where it is called Brahmaputra and is a major water source for millions of people .
Moreover , the dam will be built in the area near the border disputed between the two countries .
China outlined the project this month , in a private meeting with Indian Foreign Minister S M Krishna .
The dam will be built in Zangmu at a height of 3,260 meters , in the Shannan Prefecture in Tibet and nearby four other dams will also be built in the valley between Jiacha and Sangro counties .
Official sources said yesterday that the overall capacity of the dams will be " several times " more than the gigantic Three Gorges Dam .
Because of its altitude , the area is often subjected to extreme weather conditions and special materials and technologies will be used , developed by the Chinese space agency .
For example special cement made at the laboratories of the Xichang satellite launch Centre .
Beijing plans to draw from the Dangmu dam no less than 500 megawatts of electricity to meet the growing demand for Guangdong and Hong Kong and sell it to neighbouring countries like Myanmar , Thailand , Bangladesh , Laos and Cambodia .
India is however very worried about the plan , fearing a decrease in the flow of the river water in India and the destruction of the Himalayas ecosystem .
Above all the agriculture and industry of the north - eastern states of India depend heavily on the Brahmaputra river .
In addition , with this project China will directly control more than 90 thousand square meters of land the sovereignty of which is disputed between India and China , who fought a war that has never formally ended and who still station armed forces in the area .
China responds that the dam will allow it to develop clean energy and reduce carbon dioxide emissions resulting from coal fired power plants .
Experts say that , however , Beijing has not responded to Indian concerns over the decline of the Brahmaputra river .
Indian sources have observed that even if the dam is located in Chinese territory , however , international law provides that the work should not diminish the course of the river .
Similarly , Beijing has never responded to the concerns of Thailand , Laos , Vietnam and Cambodia over the Chinese dams on the Mekong River in Yunnan .
India appears on the brink of raising its concerns at an international level .

Patent system supporters regularly point ( slightly misleadingly ) to the claim that the patent system gives patent holders the right to exclude others from using their inventions .
And , thus , most lawsuits we see around patents revolve around cases involving a company manufacturing a product that includes a patented invention .
But what about a lawsuit for a company that deliberately chose not to licensea patented technology , because it was too expensive ?
Welcome to today 's world .
A few years back , there was a lot of attention paid to videos from a company called SawStop that made a pretty cool product that protected your fingers from a table saw .
You may have seen the videos :
The company tried to license the invention to various table saw makers , but after evaluating the technology , many were not convinced how well it worked and felt that the cost was way too high ( both for themselves , and for consumers ) .
In fact , some appeared to fear that if they did adopt this technology and then someone still got hurt , they were asking for a big lawsuit for promoting this technology as a safety feature .
But what about the other way around ?
Could someone be so bold as to actually sue for using a table saw thathave this technology ?
ChurchHatesTucker alerts us to the story of a lawsuit in Boston that involved a guy whose hand was damaged in a table saw accident while using a table saw from Ryobi .
The guy 's complaint was that Ryobi should have included this technology and that it should be required to protect hands .
And , amazingly , the jury sided with the guy .
Yes , you read that right .
The jury effectively claimed that any table saw maker is liable for injuries if it does not license this technology and build it into its table saws .
That , of course , conflicts with that basic " exclusivity " part of patent law -- and would effectively mean that SawStop has now been given total defacto control over who can be allowed to sell table saws in the US .
That clearly is not what the law was intended to do .
The government should never require companies to have to purchase a patent license for a technology they do n't believe the market wants .
And , in this case , the ruling has resulted in numerous other lawsuits against other table saw makers -- and a near guarantee that the price of table saws will go way up .
Old saws can't be retrofitted , and table saw makers need to totally change their manufacturing process and greatly increase costs to offer this technology .
This seems blatantly wrong .
If the government is going to require companies to use a patented technology , it seems that the only reasonable solution is to remove the patent on it and allow competition in the market place .

Companies : ryobi , sawstop
Near death experiences ( NDEs ) , reported to include sensations such as life flashing before the eyes , feelings of peace and joy , and apparent encounters with mystical entities , may be caused by raised levels of carbon dioxide in the blood .
Researchers writing in BioMed Central 's open access journal Critical Care investigated the unexplained events in 52 cardiac arrest patients .
Zalika Klemenc - Ketis worked with a team of researchers from the University of Maribor , Slovenia , to examine patients who reported NDEs .
She said , " Several theories explaining the mechanisms of NDEs exist .
We found that in those patients who experienced the phenomenon , blood carbon dioxide levels were significantly higher than in those who did not . "
Of the 52 patients , 11 reported NDEs .
Their occurrence did not correlate with patients ' sex , age , level of education , religious belief , fear of death , time to recovery or drugs given during resuscitation .
They were more common in people who had previously experienced NDEs .
According to Klemenc - Ketis , " Our study adds new and important information to the field of NDE phenomena .
The association with carbon dioxide has never been reported before , and deserves further study . "
In a well - meaning attempt to be tolerant of other cultures and religions we often blithely subvert our values and morality , says Sam Harris , the outspoken critic of blind religious faith .
We do this because we think that questions about good and evil or right and wrong cannot be answered definitively .
But they can , he told a rapt audience at the Technology , Entertainment and Design conference Thursday — and they should .
Harris is no stranger to the argument that , to put it more mildly than he might , religion does more harm than good .
His 2005 New York Times bestseller The End of Faith attempted to draw a straight line from faith to human atrocities .
His subsequent Letter to a Christian Nation took on the fierce pushback he received from writing his first book .
So it should come as no surprise that Harris ran with this theme at TED , expanding his argument beyond the faithful to the secular - leaning .
Scientists and academics , who are wedded to facts and empiricism , he said , do something different when they talk about morality .
" We value differences of opinion in a way that we do n't in other areas , " Harris said .
We know that there are fundamentally right and wrong answers to certain questions and issues , but do not trust our instincts , he said .
These cast - aside tenets should respected and should be the basis of a universal morality , regardless of variations in cultures and belief .
Even within a single culture it 's easy to fall into a morally relativistic trap , he said .
For example , Harris noted , there are 21 states in the U.S. where it 's legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board to the point of leaving bruises and breaking skin .
The rationale for this behavior is the Biblical quote about sparing the rod and spoiling the child .
The obvious question , Harris said , is whether it is actually a sound idea to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior .
He also pointed to the issue of women in the Muslim world who cover themselves in burqas .
" I 'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil .
Women should be able to wear whatever they want , " he said .
But it 's not an option when not wearing a burqa is a punishable offense .
And even more importantly , he said , what of those cultures which punish a brutalized woman , where " when a girl gets raped , her father 's first impulse , rather often , is to murder her out of shame ? "
We should not feel constrained to assert what we think is an objective truth — that such behavior is wrong — for fear that it will be taken as subjective meddling or demagoguery , Harris argued .
There is a moral imperative not to hold one 's tongue but rather to speak out .
" Who are we not to say [ that it 's wrong ] ? " he asked .
" Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well being that we have to be nonjudgmental about a practice like this ? "
We can no longer respect and tolerate vast differences of opinion of what constitutes basic humanity any more than we can take seriously different opinions about how disease spreads or what it takes to make buildings and airplanes safe , Harris insisted .
We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important question in human life , Harris concluded .
And to do that we have to admit that there are answers .
Gizmodo reports that police officers entered the home of its editor Jason Chen last Friday night , seizing four computers , two servers , and other items as authorized by a search warrant related to the site 's purchase of a next - generation iPhone lost by an Apple employee in a Redwood City , California bar .
A total of 24 items related to the investigation were seized by officers , who broke down the door to Chen 's unoccupied residence to execute the search warrant .
Chen , who returned home from a dinner out to find the police in his home , notes that he discussed with the officers claims made by Gaby Darbyshire , Chief Operating Officer of Gizmodo 's parent company Gawker Media that such a search warrant should be considered illegal under journalist protection statutes .
Officers proceeded , however , with their search and seizure .
According to Gaby Darbyshire , COO of Gawker Media LLC , the search warrant to remove these computers was invalid under section 1524 ( g ) of the California Penal Code .
Gawker has filed its objection with the police department and requested an immediate return of the seized items .
Update : TechCrunch provides some additional color on the situation , reporting that the authorities have temporarily put the investigation on hold as they study whether they agree with Gizmodo 's claims that journalist shield laws should apply to the situation .
Consequently , police have not yet begun to examine the evidence seized from Chen 's residence .
I just spoke to Stephen Wagstaffe , Chief Deputy at San Mateo County District Attorney 's Office , who told me that nobody has yet been charged in the case , and at this point it is " just an investigation " .
He says the investigation is " looking at any hand that touched or had something to do with this phone " but that the investigation is not currently targeting either Gawker or the person who originally found the phone -- rather , police are collecting every fact they can to present to the DA , who will then make a decision .
Here ’s a business concept poised for takeoff in centuries to come , with our rising sea levels .
The floating island business .
The Dutch ( would n’t you know it ! ) company Dutch Docklands has come up with the concept of The Floating Beach® .
Now 22nd century tourists need n’t ever worry about their favorite island getaway being underwater .
Floating beaches will always stay above sea level .
Island nations , already too close to sea levels , that depend on tourism for income , are likely to be the first customers .
Indeed ; the Maldives have just signed an agreement with the innovative company to develop several floating islands to replace the islands that are soon to be underwater .
Island nations like The Maldives and Tuvalu till now have had only a terrible Hobson ’s choice – with the failure of the rest of us to believe that their plight is real , and that it requires action on our part to reduce our fossil fuel use that causes global warming and sea level rise .
Their choice ?
Emigrate or die .
But the floating land option opens up new possible solutions : using Lateral Thinking .
Much easier than tipping the gigantic scale of political action needed .
Once the Maldives recoups its investment in the tourist facilities , its next project will be the floating housing it needs for its people .
Congratulations to its leaders for a very out - of - the - box solution to a very tragic situation .

As you may or may not know , India only recently changed its patent laws ( under sever pressure from foreign countries and pharmaceutical companies ) to allow pharmaceutical patents .
Before that , pharmaceuticals ( for the most part ) were unpatentable there .
Of course , contrary to what patent system supporters would tell you , India had a thriving pharma industry .
Yes , a lot of it was in generic drugs , but according to patent system supporters if people can just copy each other , no one will even bother to get into that business .
Reality shows that was n't true .
But , of course , the big pharma companies were quite upset by all of this , and got their governments to put pressure on India to " join the world community . "
In 2005 , India 's new patent laws went into effect , and while the results of all of this are still being analyzed , one thing that politicians smartly put into the law were sections 3 ( d ) and ( e ) , " which restrict protection being granted to already known and long - ago patented drugs and their combinations . "
This upset pharma industry sympathisers , but it's hard to fathom who could reasonably be against such a rule .
You simply should not be able to patent things that are already known or patent the simple combinations of drugs that are already known .
This is just common sense to prevent pharmaceutical firms from getting monopolies on drugs already out there .
However , Jamie Love points us to the news of a new report that found that the Indian patent office has gone against this law and issued such patents quite frequently and , no surprise , the main recipients are among the world 's largest pharma companies , including Pfizer , Novartis and Eli Lilly .
Is it any wonder that they 've all been pushing to dump sections 3 ( d ) and ( e ) all along ?
Remember , pharma patents are not about drug discovery , but about jacking up the prices on drugs .

" Found staff and doctor to be very helpful and attentive and the rooms were also very nice .
I am 64 years old or should I say young , and wanted to look fresher .
Even though there is still swelling I can already see the difference particularly on the neck area which showed tell tale signs of aging .
What surgery I had done here for about $ 7,300 would have cost me over $ 20,000 in Australia .
So I am delighted that I decided to have this done here .
It is not an easy roller - coaster ride as there is pain and swelling after the operation but the nursing staff are close by .
Great trip , staff and surgery ! "

“ I was impressed from the moment I arrived and reassured by the many pre-op precautions / preparations .
It was also reassuring to note the strict procedures followed by each and every department to identify me , ensuring I was who I was and what procedures I was undergoing .
My doctor explained everything I needed to know and he ensured I understood what was being said .
The follow - up by my doctor was again reassuring with clear explanations and thorough check - ups to ensure the best possible outcome and to allay any concerns I may have had .
He was very professional , kind and courteous .
The nurses that attended to me were also very friendly and processional .
No request went unanswered and they could not have done more .
I especially liked it when monitoring vital signs that they would let me know if I had not fever or if my blood pressure was normal or a little bit high .
Also they would inform me what medication I was being given . ”

A video has been posted on the website TheUnjustMedia.com purportedly showing that soldier Robert Bergdahl , who was captured in Afghanistan last June , is still alive .
In the video Bergdahl has a beard .
Towards the end of it he does exercises to prove that he ’s still physically fit .
During the video Bergdahl pleads to be released , not to his captors but to what appears to be the US government ( though he does n’t address any specific person or organization ) .
“ … get me to be released .
This war is n’t worth the waste of human life that it has cost both Afghanistan and US .
It ’s not worth the amount of lives that have been wasted and the amount of life that has been wasted in prisons …
Guantanamo Bay , Bagrahm …all those places where we are keeping prisoners .
I ’m a prisoner .
I want to go home .
The Afghanistan men who are in our prisons , they want to go home too . “
Last summer when Bergdahl was captured and a video was released of him , Neocons at Fox News scrambled to dilute any sympathy for the soldier by implying that he was a deserter and turncoat who was collaborating with the enemy .
Ralph Peters , a Fox News analyst and a Lieutenant Colonel in the Army , implied on the air that if the facts proved Bergdahl was a deserter the Taliban should save the US s a lot of legal bills and kill him .
Later , he went on Bill O’Reilly to try and justify his sentiments :
“ … my anger is that the media has been turning this guy who ’s a probable … an alleged deserter …certainly AWOL in a combat zone … into some kind of hero .
Now why does it make me angry ?
Because we know Bergdahl ’s name … how many of us know the names of the soldiers and marines , navy corps .
men , fighting through crippling injuries in our military hospitals .
The names of those who came home with flags over their coffins because they did their duty .
The names of the decorated heroes … they get no media attention . ”
What ’s interesting is how Peters quickly corrected his words from probable to alleged when slapping the deserter title on Bergdahl , showing that the accusation , in his mind at least , still was n’t certain .
What ’s also interesting is the fact that Peters was so concerned about the media ignoring the soldiers who come home in flag draped coffins while the Pentagon , backed by President George Bush , sought to ban the release of photos of flag draped soldier coffins coming back from the Iraq war .
Earlier this week Wikileaks released video of soldiers shooting civilians and a Reuters reporter in Iraq .
This , along with the Bergdahl video illustrate that despite the war machine ’s fleeting attempt to control the perception of its bloody and lucrative conflicts overseas , reality and the internet are winning out .
Lashing out at what people like Peters call “ enemy propaganda ” highlights the frustration of our supposed military leaders over the fact that their own propaganda is no longer working .

Location : body of water between 60 degrees south latitude and Antarctica
Geographic coordinates : 65 00 S , 0 00 E ( nominally ) , but the Southern Ocean has the unique distinction of being a large circumpolar body of water totally encircling the continent of Antarctica ; this ring of water lies between 60 degrees south latitude and the coast of Antarctica , and encompasses 360 degrees of longitude
Map references : Antarctic Region
Area : total : 20.327 million sq km
note : includes Amundsen Sea , Bellingshausen Sea , part of the Drake Passage , Ross Sea , a small part of the Scotia Sea , Weddell Sea , and other tributary water bodies
Area - comparative : slightly more than twice the size of the US
Coastline : 17,968 km
Climate : sea temperatures vary from about 10 degrees Celsius to - 2 degrees Celsius ; cyclonic storms travel eastward around the continent and frequently are intense because of the temperature contrast between ice and open ocean ; the ocean area from about latitude 40 south to the Antarctic Circle has the strongest average winds found anywhere on Earth ; in winter the ocean freezes outward to 65 degrees south latitude in the Pacific sector and 55 degrees south latitude in the Atlantic sector , lowering surface temperatures well below 0 degrees Celsius ; at some coastal points intense persistent drainage winds from the interior keep the shoreline ice - free throughout the winter
Terrain : the Southern Ocean is deep , 4,000 to 5,000 meters over most of its extent with only limited areas of shallow water ; the Antarctic continental shelf is generally narrow and unusually deep - its edge lying at depths of 400 to 800 meters ( the global mean is 133 meters ) ; the Antarctic icepack grows from an average minimum of 2.6 million square kilometers in March to about 18.8 million square kilometers in September , better than a sixfold increase in area ; the Antarctic Circumpolar Current ( 21,000 km in length ) moves perpetually eastward ; it is the world 's largest ocean current , transporting 130 million cubic meters of water per second - 100 times the flow of all the world 's rivers
Elevation extremes : lowest point : - 7,235 m at the southern end of the South Sandwich Trench
highest point : sea level 0 m
Natural resources : probable large and possible giant oil and gas fields on the continental margin , manganese nodules , possible placer deposits , sand and gravel , fresh water as icebergs , squid , whales , and seals - none exploited ; krill , fishes
Natural hazards : huge icebergs with drafts up to several hundred meters ; smaller bergs and iceberg fragments ; sea ice ( generally 0.5 to 1 meter thick ) with sometimes dynamic short - term variations and with large annual and interannual variations ; deep continental shelf floored by glacial deposits varying widely over short distances ; high winds and large waves much of the year ; ship icing , especially May - October ; most of region is remote from sources of search and rescue
Environment - current issues : increased solar ultraviolet radiation resulting from the Antarctic ozone hole in recent years , reducing marine primary productivity ( phytoplankton ) by as much as 15 % and damaging the DNA of some fish ; illegal , unreported , and unregulated fishing in recent years , especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery , which is likely to affect the sustainability of the stock ; large amount of incidental mortality of seabirds resulting from long - line fishing for toothfish
note : the now - protected fur seal population is making a strong comeback after severe overexploitation in the 18th and 19th centuries
Environment - international agreements : the Southern Ocean is subject to all international agreements regarding the world 's oceans ; in addition , it is subject to these agreements specific to the Antarctic region : International Whaling Commission ( prohibits commercial whaling south of 40 degrees south [ south of 60 degrees south between 50 degrees and 130 degrees west ] ) ; Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals ( limits sealing ) ; Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources ( regulates fishing )
note : many nations ( including the US ) prohibit mineral resource exploration and exploitation south of the fluctuating Polar Front ( Antarctic Convergence ) which is in the middle of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and serves as the dividing line between the very cold polar surface waters to the south and the warmer waters to the north
( I ’m in the middle of traveling , but I know that a lot of people will be interested in the news that Google is incorporating site speed as one of the over 200 signals that we use in determining search rankings .
I wanted to jot down some quick thoughts . )
The main thing I want to get across is : do n’t panic .
We mentioned site speed as early as last year , and you can watch this video from February where I pointed out that we still put much more weight on factors like relevance , topicality , reputation , value - add , etc. — all the factors that you probably think about all the time .
Compared to those signals , site speed will carry much less weight .
In fact , if you read the official blog post , you ’ll notice that the current implementation mentions that fewer than 1 % of search queries will change as a result of incorporating site speed into our ranking .
That means that even fewer search results are affected , since the average search query is returning 10 or so search results on each page .
So please do n’t worry that the effect of this change will be huge .
In fact , I believe the official blog post mentioned that “ We launched this change a few weeks back after rigorous testing . ”
The fact that not too many people noticed the change is another reason not to stress out disproportionately over this change .
There are lots of tools to help you identify ways to improve the speed of your site .
The official blog post gives lots of links , and some of the links lead to even more tools .
But just to highlight a few , Google ’s webmaster console provides information very close to the information that we ’re actually using in our ranking .
In addition , various free - to - use tools offer things like in - depth analysis of individual pages .
Google also provides an entire speed - related mini-site with tons of resources and videos about speeding up websites .
I want to pre-debunk another misconception , which is that this change will somehow help “ big sites ” who can affect to pay more for hosting .
In my experience , small sites can often react and respond faster than large companies to changes on the web .
Often even a little bit of work can make big differences for site speed .
So I think the average smaller web site can really benefit from this change , because a smaller website can often implement the best practices that speed up a site more easily than a larger organization that might move slower or be hindered by bureaucracy .
Also take a step back for a minute and consider the intent of this change : a faster web is great for everyone , but especially for users .
Lots of websites have demonstrated that speeding up the user experience results in more usage .
So speeding up your website is n’t just something that can affect your search rankings –it ’s a fantastic idea for your users .
I know this change will be popular with some people and unpopular with others .
Let me reiterate a point to the search engine optimizers ( SEOs ) out there : SEO is a field that changes over time , and the most successful SEOs embrace change and turn it into an opportunity .
SEOs in 1999 did n’t think about social media , but there ’s clearly a lot of interesting things going on in that space in 2010 .
I would love if SEOs dive into improving website speed , because ( unlike a few facets of SEO ) decreasing the latency of a website is something that is easily measurable and controllable .
A # 1 ranking might not always be achievable , but most websites can be made noticeably faster , which can improve ROI and conversion rates .
In that sense , this change represents an opportunity for SEOs and developers who can help other websites improve their speediness .
I know that there will be a lot of discussion about this change , and some people wo n’t like it .
But I ’m glad that Google is making this step , both for the sake of transparency ( letting webmasters know more about how to do better in Google ) and because I think this change will make the web better .
My takeaway messages would be three - fold : first , this is actually a relatively small - impact change , so you do n’t need to panic .
Second , speeding up your website is a great thing to do in general .
Visitors to your site will be happier ( and might convert more or use your site more ) , and a faster web will be better for all .
Third , this change highlights that there are very constructive things that can directly improve your website ’s user experience .
Instead of wasting time on keyword meta tags , you can focus on some very easy , straightforward , small steps that can really improve how users perceive your site .
For most of the 20th century , a soldier in the field could only communicate with his / her family and friends via letters that might take weeks or months to make their way to the recipient .
But as the battlefield goes high tech , so has the ways soldiers can talk to the outside world .
Managing how social media interacts with the military is the job of Price Floyd , Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs .
Floyd , a speaker at O’Reilly ’s upcoming Gov 2.0 Expo , discusses how the public face of the military is changing in the following interview .
The role of the Public Affairs office :
Price Floyd :
We ’re responsible not just for external , but also internal communication .
There ’s about , depending on how you count it , 2.5 million members of the Defense Department at large , all of the civilian employees , contractors , the men and women in service .
And if you count those who retired and their families , it comes to about 10 million .
Then there ’s the external audiences that could be U.S. and foreign - based .
How social media is being used by the Defense Department :
PF : At the Defense Department , what we have done is embraced social media , and the technology behind it , to engage with all our audiences .
That ’s everything from veteran ’s groups to foreign publics to people who follow me on Twitter .
And it ’s a two - way engagement .
The idea that social media is a better way to reach a broader audience with our message , that kind of one - way communication idea , is not what we want to do .
We want to engage with our audience , all of them , on the whole host of issues and policies that we deal with .
Does social media mean losing control of the message ?
PF : I think that we need to become much more comfortable with taking risk , much more comfortable with having multiple spokesmen out there , thousands of spokesmen in essence .
But , for me , there ’s nothing more credible than the men and women who are out there on the front lines fighting the wars that we ’re in to send messages back to their family and friends .
As you know , you send a tweet or a make a post on Facebook , it does n’t necessarily stay there .
That could be forwarded around .
Other people that you never thought could see it will see it , even the media .
And I ’m okay with that .
I ’m okay with us no longer controlling exactly what people say to the media and then trying to work with the media to make sure they get their story exactly the way we may want it .
The trade - off between open communications and operational security :
PF : This is not a new problem .
What ’s new about it may be the number of people who may see information they ’re not supposed to see because of the ability to communicate to a bigger group of people than you could in the past with a letter .
Now it ’s Twitter or Facebook or YouTube or MySpace , whatever social media outlet they ’re on .
But Operational Security , OPSEC as we call it here , concerns are still around .
We still need to worry about them .
We still need to focus on them .
We still need to educate to them .
We have a campaign here called Net Smart .
A lot of that is how to use social media responsibly .
With this technology , there are benefits , but there are responsibilities , obligations by the users .
You need to remember OPSEC .
You need to know that people are watching , reading , and listening all the time .
And do n’t say or do anything on these social media platforms or sites that you would n’t say or do in front of your boss or your grandmother .
It seems like common sense stuff , but it ’s stuff that we need to educate to the force and we ’re working to do that .
How the Department of Defense uses social media as a communications tool :
Price Floyd :
We have it , but who wants to follow the Defense Department Facebook page ?
I ’m not sure that ’s the best way to do it .
I think what ’s better than that is to follow a person .
Like Chairman Mullen on Twitter or your unit commander ’s Facebook page .
It ’s personal .
You know who it is .
I think people who follow certain bloggers follow them because of that blogger ’s insight , the way they frame issues .
It ’s not an institution .
It ’s a person doing it .
So they build up a relationship .
I have about 2,700 followers of my Twitter site .
That ’s not that big compared to some .
The Chairman ’s is much bigger .
But I engage with them back - and - forth everyday .
The thing about this , it ’s not an institution doing this .
It ’s about thousands of people in the institution doing it for us .
Since we ’re so big , thousands of Facebook and Twitter accounts , thousands of MySpace accounts .
What social media will bring to the military in the future :
PF : What actually excites me is the possibility of the unknown .
In other words , people being able to do things they ’ve never done before .
Just in the last year or so , as we were looking at this policy review on social media and whether to have a policy of open or closed or something in between , I heard stories from the men and women on the front lines , and I learned things I did n’t know were going on .
Mothers and fathers on the front lines doing homework with their children back home in real - time .
It ’s just amazing , all of the ramifications that may come from that .
Transitions could become easier because they were n’t completely gone ; the kids still saw dad or mom once or twice a week through Skype .
The technology today has changed the way the men and women overseas are able to communicate back home with their family and friends .
I do n’t know what ’s going to come next , but if past is prologue , there will be both risks and benefits to it .
And we need to accept that and try to responsibly deal with it .

First , let 's be clear on what cancer is and how it may hurt your health .
The building blocks of your brain , lungs , liver , heart , skin , and other organs are one or more of the following types of tissue :
Nervous tissue - forms your brain , cranial nerves , spinal cord , and all of the peripheral nerves that supply your body .
Connective tissue - fibrous tissues that often provide a supportive role .
Examples include cartilage , ligaments , and tendons .
Your bones and blood are specialized types of connective tissue .
Epithelial tissue - specialized layers of cells that provide a protective coating over the surfaces of your organs .
Examples include the outer lining of your skin and the inner linings of your breathing airways , digestive tract , and urinary tract .
Muscle tissue - layers of cells that provide contractile ability .
Three distinct types of muscle tissue found in your body are : Skeletal muscles - allow voluntary movements of your body , including your eyes and facial muscles .
Smooth muscles - allow involuntary contractions within your body .
Examples include contractions that propel food through your digestive tract and contractions that push blood through your blood vessels .
Cardiac muscle - specialized tissue found only in your heart .
All of these tissues have one thing in common :
They are composed of cells .
Lots and lots of cells .
This is why one of the first lessons in grade seven biology class is on the structure and function of your cells .
Remember learning about mitochondria , endoplasmic reticula , ribosomes , and nucleoli ?
These organelles and the plasmic fluid ( cytoplasm ) that they are suspended in are found in all of your cells .
Each cell in your body is a living unit that receives oxygen and nutrients from your blood , converts oxygen and nutrients to energy that helps sustain you , and expels waste products that your blood carries away and deposits into one of five eliminative channels .
Whenever anything goes wrong in your body , it begins at a cellular level .
Genetic material found in the core of all of your cells regulate cellular reproduction , which is really a process of division where one cell splits to become two , two split to become four , and so on .
In a growing child , cellular division is necessary for growth .
In both children and adults , cellular division is an ongoing process that creates new cells to replace cells that die of old age or injury - the average adult loses somewhere between 50 to 70 billion cells per day , and this steady loss of cells is perfectly balanced with new cell formation to keep things in balance .
Cancer , no matter where it occurs in your body , involves a loss of control of cellular division .
Cancerous cells do n't divide in a controlled manner and under the direction of healthy genes .
Rather , cancerous cells divide in an out - of - control manner and are capable of invading nearby tissues and even spreading to other parts of your body .
We may never identify all factors that trigger and fuel malignant tumor growth .
Excessive exposure to certain drugs ( recreational and prescription ) , electromagnetic radiation , harmful chemicals in highly processed foods - these are just a few of countless potential causes of malignant cellular division .
We know that excessive exposure to some types of hormones can also disrupt cellular division .
So all factors that affect the production and secretion of hormones in your body - including how well and often you sleep and how much emotional stress you experience - certainly represent potential causes of cancerous growth .
How do malignant cells hurt your health ?
When enough of them cluster together in a lump , they can interfere with vital functions .
For example , a growing malignant mass in the stomach can lead to problems with digestion and nutrient absorption .
A malignant tumor in the brain can compress and affect cranial nerves that are responsible for regulating hearing , swallowing , and breathing rate .
If cancerous cells begin to crowd out healthy lung tissue , you may have trouble getting enough oxygen into your blood to fuel energy production .
In some cases , cancer in the lungs can cause a segment of lung tissue to collapse , which can lead to a fatal infection .
If cancerous cells invade the liver , kidneys , or bones , the danger is in losing the capacity to regulate levels of minerals , toxins , waste products , and other substances in your body that need to be finely buffered and balanced at all times .
Malignant tumors do their damage primarily through crowding .
They create dysfunction by pressing on things , blocking things , and if their causes remain in place , they do more pressing and blocking .
If cancerous masses would just stop growing before affecting vital functions , you could live with them without grave risk to your health .
In fact , such masses exist in a lot of people - we call them cysts , fibroids , polyps , and benign tumors .
Malignant tumors are problematic because eventually , they tend to grow and spread to a point where they create significant dysfunction somewhere in the body .
Breast cancer by itself does n't pose a serious threat in most cases - breast cancer needs to be addressed because if left unchecked , it will eventually spread to another part of the body where it can compromise vital functions .
So what should you do if you are diagnosed with cancer ?
Let me preface my thoughts here by making it clear that I do not specialize in helping people deal with cancer .
I am a board - certified chiropractor in Canada and the United States with over 20 years of education and experience helping people get and stay well through dietary and lifestyle choices .
My thoughts on cancer and how to address it have taken form over many years .
My thoughts are based on what I know of human physiology , nutrition , and experience working closely with people who have asked me for guidance as they looked to overcome different types and stages of cancer .
Through my experiences , I have come to firmly believe that whenever possible , it is best to allow the body to heal itself with nourishing foods and plenty of physical and emotional rest .
At the same time , I think it 's important to remain open minded to the potential benefits of conventional medical treatments .
And I think this idea gets muted in some natural and alternative health circles by those who proselytize with a little too much philosophy and hype and perhaps not enough consideration for each person 's unique circumstances and knowledge of what conventional medical treatments have to offer .
There 's nothing wrong with preventing and addressing cancer and other forms of illness with diet , lifestyle , and non -toxic , non-invasive therapies .
In some cases , a fully natural approach may be enough to lead to a full recovery .
But in some cases , my experience has been that it definitely pays to integrate surgery or other allopathic treatments with a natural approach - doing so can sometimes dramatically improve long term outcomes .
Very generally , I support and encourage surgical excision of malignant masses when a surgeon or group of surgeons have done due diligence with a comprehensive diagnostic workup and strongly feel that the potential benefits of surgical excision outweigh the potential risks of not excising a malignant tumor .
I know that there are some people who are deeply committed to natural healing , so much so that they would rather pass on naturally than to undergo surgery where it is strongly recommended after a thorough diagnostic workup .
I would n't make this choice for myself .
I would surgically excise a malignant tumor every time under the care of a surgeon who I felt good about .
Do I believe that malignant cells can be destroyed and washed away by our self healing mechanisms ?
Yes .
And I think it 's safe to say that it happens in all of us to some degree every day .
Each of us has many trillions - that 's many thousands of billions - of cells with many millions dividing and being replaced every hour .
In my mind , it 's almost an absolute certainty that all of us have some cancerous cells at all times , but in a relatively healthy state , our bodies are able to destroy and remove such cells before they cluster together in enough numbers to create a mass that 's significant enough to create trouble .
( Apoptosis is the medical term for cellular self destruction or programmed cell death that occurs with aged and / or diseased cells . )
Still , a palpable mass or one that is visible to the naked eye with imaging is a far greater challenge to overcome than a few cancerous cells scattered here and there .
Click here for part two of this look at what to do about cancer where I share thoughts on radiation , chemotherapy , and dietary and lifestyle measures that I feel are helpful to people looking to overcome cancer .
Every once in a while , I think its important for us ( the core MongoDB team ) to give a broad picture of where we think MongoDB is and where we ’re hoping to take it .
This is useful both as a gut check for us , to give the community some insight into what we ’re thinking , and to make sure we ’re all on the same page .
MongoDB has made great strides in the last year .
The first public release was just over a year ago ( 2/11/2009 ) and since then we ’ve seen tremendous support and interest from the developer community .
We ’ve made a lot of great progress on the core database , drivers and tools .
The community has contributed a large and growing number of great drivers and tools , as well as invaluable testing and feedback .
We ’ve also seen a really great amount of production MongoDB installations coming online in the last year .
MongoDB got 2 stable releases ( 1.0 and 1.2 ) and there is a third coming ( 1.4 ) which has many things we ’re very proud of : better concurrency , geospatial indexing , “ usability ” enhancements and speed enhancements to name a few .
We ’re planning on a stable release every 3 months as a way to balance speed , carefulness , and practicality .
So , where are we in our grand view of the world : about half done .
MongoDB is in a great place today , but we have a long way to go .
MongoDB was never designed nor intended to be a niche database for a small subset of problems , but a new type of database , that solves lots of real world problems for a large subset of the developer community .
We ’re getting there , and we ’re suitable for a lot of problems , but there are lots of things we still need to do .
So if you ’re looking at MongoDB and saying “ its not good enough for this ” or “ it would be great if only it had X , ” its very likely we agree with you .
Some major things we ’re thinking about for the next 6 - 12 months
better replication : real time , replica sets , more options for data durability
production ready sharding
more features for working with embedded documents
flushing out more atomic update operators
single server durability
full text search
Talking about embedded objects as one example , we added support for this very early on because we think its often a better way to model your data in the database .
Being able to store addresses for a user , or tags for a blog post inside of the main document is great for many reasons , particularly speed and manageability .
This is a very different paradigm than relational , and we ’ve had to add a lot of features to make it work nicely : indexed embedded fields , in - place incremental updates , etc …
We still have many features we want to add that people have asked for to make it even nicer to program with embedded documents .
I ’ve recently changed the way I describe MongoDB when I first talk to people that I think sheds some light on how we ’re thinking .
MongoDB was n’t designed in a lab .
We built MongoDB from our own experiences building large scale , high availability , robust systems .
We did n’t start from scratch , we really tried to figure out what was broken , and tackle that .
So the way I think about MongoDB is that if you take MySql , and change the data model from relational to document based , you get a lot of great features : embedded docs for speed , manageability , agile development with schema - less databases , easier horizontal scalability because joins are n’t as important .
There are lots of things that work great in relational databases : indexes , dynamic queries and updates to name a few , and we have n’t changed much there .
For example , the way you design your indexes in MongoDB should be exactly the way you do it in MySql or Oracle , you just have the option of indexing an embedded field .
So in conclusion , I hope you find MongoDB useful and productive now , we hope to make great strides in the next year , and are grateful for the community ’s support , advice , debugging and interest .

ROME – The Knesset ’s Christian Allies Caucus signed a partnership agreement with pro-Israel Italian parliament members at Rome ’s Fleming Hotel on Wednesday night , in a move that is expected to improve ties between Israel and Italy and eventually also with the Vatican .
Italy ’s became the 18th foreign parliament with a pro-Israel caucus that has signed a pact expressing support for keeping Jerusalem the undivided capital of Israel and opposing “ futile ” attempts to pressure Israel to make concessions in the diplomatic process .
But while most of the pacts have been with mainly Evangelical Protestant Israel - supporters , the majority of the MPs in the Italian caucus are Catholic .
The powerful secretary of the Italian Senate , Lucio Malan , signed the accord from his hospital bed in Rome due to a heart condition .
A member of the Waldensian Evangelical Church , Milan said he was heading the caucus because Israel ’s future was vital to Italy and the entire Western world .
Milan expressed hope that Israel ’s bond with the Italian parliament could serve as a springboard for improved relations with the Vatican and make up for episodes like the scandal surrounding Pope Benedict XVI ’s personal preacher , the Rev. Raniero Cantalamessa , and his recent comparison of scrutiny over clerical abuse to anti-Semitism .
“ Reaching out to the Vatican must be handled carefully and cautiously but fearlessly , ” Milan said .
“ The Cantalamessa episode will be less likely to happen when we understand each other ’s sensibilities .
This caucus is a good way to prevent incidents like this one .
” Rocco Buttiglione , vice chairman of the Italian council of deputies and a Catholic , said that all Christians had a historical duty to prevent another Holocaust , especially because Christians participated in past attempts to destroy the Jewish people .
Jewish Italian parliament member Fiamma Nirenstein spoke about the need for Jews and Christians to unite in defending democracy from Islamic fundamentalism .
“ Religious dialogue is not my cup of tea , but we have a political task to defend Israel and the Western world , and we ca n’t do that without strong support from the Christians , ” Nirenstein said .
A group of Italian parliamentarians met at the Senate in Rome on Wednesday with Israeli caucus chairman MK David Rotem ( Israel Beiteinu ) , Labor MK Orit Noked and former tourism minister Benny Elon , who chairs the International Israeli Allied Caucuses .
Israeli Ambassador Gideon Meir addressed the crowd in Italian at the event .
Elon ’s speech at the Senate was greeted with calls of “ hallelujah .
” Rotem said that protecting Israel from Iranian President MahmoudAhmadinejad was part of being a good Christian .
Caucus director JoshReinstein said that the 18 caucuses have prevented anti-Israel votesaround the world , including on the controversial Goldstone Report .
“ It is symbolic that this is our 18th caucus , because 18 is chai [ lifein Hebrew ] and Christians and Jews value life over everything , ” Reinstein said .
“ [ Signing this pact ] is especially inspirational , because Christianity has its foundations in Rome and Israel is a Jewishstate .
It is miraculous that we are working together . ”

Two people have been killed and six injured as giant waves slammed into a cruise ship in the Mediterranean , the ship 's owners have said .
The 26ft ( 8 m ) high rogue waves hit the Cypriot - owned Louis Majesty off the coast of north - east Spain .
A spokesman for owner Louis Cruises said three " abnormally high " waves broke windows in the front of the ship .
The Louis Majesty was heading to Genoa on a 12 - day Mediterranean cruise but has now returned to Barcelona .
" A wave broke the glass in the area of the saloon and water was taken on board , " said a spokesman for Spain 's coast guard .
Cruise continues
The victims have been identified as a German and an Italian man .
" Louis Cruises extends its sincere condolences to the families of the two victims and its full support to the injured passengers while expressing its deep sorrow for the incident , " a statement from the company said .
The ship was carrying 1,350 passengers and 580 crew .
A French naval official said there had been " no signs of the least problem with the Louis Majesty " .
But Cmdr Bernard Celier said there had been winds of more than 100 km /h ( 60 mph ) in the area .
The ship is expected to resume its voyage to its final destination , Genoa , once the victims have been taken off the ship and the injured have received treatment .
Tuberculosis is a serious public health challenge in the developing world , where the infection claims roughly two million lives each year , according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
Yet the disease , which is a leading killer of patients with HIV / AIDS , is cumbersome to detect , resulting in delayed or inappropriate treatment , greater spread of the infection and preventable deaths .
So , researchers in Colorado are developing a portable , rapid TB sensor that could help reduce the death toll and make treatment more efficient .
This " field friendly " device relies on readily available and relatively low - cost components and can find the lethal pathogen in blood in just 20 minutes , says Diego Krapf , an applied physicist and assistant professor of engineering at Colorado State University in Fort Collins , who designed the new device .
That is far faster than conventional methods such as sputum tests , which examine secretions from the lungs and bronchi and can take days — sometimes weeks — to return results .
The new detector can identify active infection as well as dormant , or latent , microbes that might one day flare up into full - blown illness , the developers say .
It also can distinguish between patients who carry TB and those who once were infected but have successfully fought off the illness .
" Our detector senses proteins , not an immune response against them , " Krapf says .
" The benefit of doing this is that while proteins mark the presence of disease , antibodies remain in the organism after the disease is long gone . "
So the new approach greatly reduces the chances of false positives .
A portable detector would greatly aid efforts to fight the infection in developing countries , particularly parts of Asia and Africa where as much as 40 percent of the population carries the microbe , says Robert Belknap , a physician and TB expert at the Denver Health Medical Center in Colorado .
" If it works , it 's truly portable and does n't require special conditions , it would be a tremendous advance , " he adds .
The device could overcome a few key failings of conventional TB screening .
Long delays , in some cases up to six weeks , between test and result often force public health workers to waste time and resources on people suspected of having the infection but who , in fact , do not .
Potential patients are frequently isolated — from their children , colleagues and others — for fear that they may spread the disease .
Those suspected of having TB may also be given potent antibiotics as a precaution — drugs that can cause serious side effects , including vomiting , headaches , rash and drug - induced hepatitis ( liver inflammation ) .
For these drugs to be effective , and to prevent the body 's development of resistant bacteria , patients must take the medications on a strict schedule and complete the regime .
The consequences of straying from the regimen are so high that public health authorities try to monitor TB patients to make sure they take their pills , an approach called directly observed therapy .
Such programs require substantial money and manpower , and often fail for lack of both .
" An accurate , rapid , point - of - care test would help public health workers better focus resources quickly on the individuals who need it — including providing directly observed therapy — and avoid unnecessary medications and isolation in those who don't , " Belknap says .
Krapf and his colleagues built a shoe box–size prototype with off - the - shelf parts including diode lasers from CD and DVD players , photodiode detectors , and other low - cost electronics .
A handheld version could easily be made from somewhat more expensive components , he says .
The detector works by a capture - illuminate process :
It first analyzes a blood sample in search of two TB proteins — antigen 85 b and alpha-crystallin .
If either is present , it will bind to a specific molecular brush linked to immune molecules , called antibodies , which affix to antigen 85 b and alpha - crystallin but reject all other proteins .
Then a bath of additional TB - sensitive antibodies , modified with a gene that produces fluorescence , is added .
The result is in effect a glowing antibody –TB–antibody protein sandwich .
Eventually , signature proteins from drug - resistant strains of the bacteria could be incorporated into the device , Krapf says .
According to WHO , an estimated 511,000 cases of multidrug - resistant TB were reported in 2007 .
Most of these occurred in China , India and the Russian Federation .
The detector research , which will be presented at a meeting this month of the American Physical Society , is of primary benefit for people in the developing world , yet it could help in the U.S. , too .
Although the disease is largely under control in humans there , it still poses a threat to the cattle industry — as well as those who depend on it for food .
Kathy Orloski ( pdf ) , a veterinary epidemiologist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's National Tuberculosis Eradication Program in Fort Collins , Colo. , says the country 's cattle industry would welcome a rapid test for bovine TB .
Cows currently are screened for the disease with skin tests like those used in people , a process that requires animals to be handled twice in three days , driving up costs for ranchers .
Dairy or beef cattle infected with TB are euthanized , she says .
Government inspectors at slaughterhouses would likewise benefit from an immediate on - site detection method , helping them identify carcasses of infected cows faster than current laboratory testing , which takes up to 48 hours to process tissue samples .
" A test used in this capacity would have to be very accurate , " Orloski says , " because the United States slaughters 33 million cattle each year . "
The government also would like to see a speedier way of testing the million - odd cows imported each year from Mexico , which has had a problem with bovine TB in its beef and dairy stock for several years , Orloski says .
Whereas Mexico and Canada are the two leading exporters of cattle to the U.S. , Canadian cattle have for the most part been TB - free ( pdf ) for the past decade , with the exception of certain areas of Manitoba ( pdf ) .
* Correction ( 3/24/10 ) :
This article originally stated that the researchers were from the University of Colorado .
As China and Europe implement policies to encourage clean energy market growth , US clean energy companies are focusing their efforts overseas – resulting in lost jobs and opportunities in the US .
Analysts believe that unless the US government does more to encourage job and market growth in the clean energy sector , that the country will fall behind China and Europe in achieving a global leadership position in this growing market sector .
See the following article from Money Morning for more on this .
![ filekey = |6293| align=|right| caption=|| alt=|US clean energy investment| ]
If the United States does n’t take drastic measures to engineer new clean energy policies and investment initiatives , it will continue to take a back seat to China and Europe , which are driving the clean energy market toward a profitable future .
Both clean energy companies and a skilled workforce are heading overseas , where government policies are creating a more welcoming and promising market for clean energy products .
Take Massachusetts - based Evergreen Solar , Inc ( Nasdaq : ESLR ) .
In 2008 , it used $ 58 million in government aid to open a new Massachusetts factory to build silicon wafers and cells and assemble solar panels .
But in November 2009 , it announced the assembly of solar panels would be moved to Wuhan , China , where solar panel manufacturing will cost far less than in the United States .
Evergreen earlier this month said it would expand its European sales division to cater to the robust government incentive programs in Europe , which are encouraging businesses to adopt more renewable energy practices .
NatCore Technology Inc. in New Jersey discovered how to make solar panels thinner , making them more cost efficient to manufacture .
No American companies showed interest in the technology , so it reached a deal to finish developing and producing the technology in Changsha , China .
" The United States ’ competitive position is at risk in the emerging clean energy economy , " Phyllis Cuttino , director of the Pew Environment Group ’s Global Warming Campaign , said in a statement .
" Even in the midst of a global recession , the clean energy market has experienced impressive growth .
Countries are jockeying for leadership .
They know that investing in clean energy can renew manufacturing bases , and create export opportunities , jobs and businesses . "
Overall 2009 global renewable energy investment came in at $ 162 billion .
Investment only fell 6.6 % from 2008 – small potatoes compared to the 19 % decrease in the oil and gas industry .
Investment next year should reverse and make a huge leap forward .
Global renewable energy investment expectations for 2010 are $ 200 billion , up 25 % from last year , according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance .
It ’s not a passionate movement to save the earth that ’s behind the clean energy market ; it ’s market competition and job creation driving the clean energy race – and the United States is losing .
Prices of renewable technologies are decreasing , making them more competitive .
If climate concern is n’t enough motivation to encourage use , economic and employment benefits will .
The city of Baoding , China is a perfect example .
The city ’s pristine water quality made film production one of its top industries .
But when digital cameras put an end to that era , the city needed new industries to thrive .
Baoding saw an opportunity in clean energy , and now it is one of the world ’s largest manufacturers of solar products .
China is also enlisted Arizona - based solar panel manufacturer First Solar , Inc ( Nasdaq : FSLR ) to build the world ’s largest solar plant in the Gobi Desert .
Onshore wind energy is China ’s other clean energy focus :
It ’s wind capacity doubled in each of the past four years .
China catches flack for the amount of greenhouse gases its plants release , but it has steps in place to reduce emissions while creating jobs and enjoying corporate growth .
" We may spend the next few years pushing China to do more , but will then spend all the years after that chasing them as they hurtle profitably down the road to the low - carbon transformation , " said Todd Stern , the U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change .
The Money Follows the Market
In 2009 , China overtook the United States in renewable energy investments for the first time ever .
China pushed $ 34.6 billion into renewable energy projects – mostly wind farms – while the United States only spent $ 18.6 billion .
Wind energy and solar power are the most popular renewables , nabbing billions of investment dollars .
Wind energy constitutes over 50 % of global clean energy investment .
Bloomberg New Energy
Finance is expecting a 9 % increase in global installations of wind turbines this year – the equivalent of 34 new nuclear power stations – with a price tag of $ 65 billion .
That ’s partly because turbine prices have declined 15 % over the past two years .
Still , solar energy has a smaller piece of the market than wind , and prices have sharply declined in recent years , positioning solar power for significant growth .
Compared to other Group of 20 ( G20 ) nations , the United States falls short in the rankings , with 0.13 % of its gross domestic product ( GDP ) invested in clean energy products , ranking it 11th against its G20 counterparts .
Spain invested five times more as a percentage of GDP in renewable energy projects than the United States ; The United Kingdom , China and Brazil invested three times as much .
So why ’s the money moving so swiftly in China and Europe ?
Foreign governments are implementing policies to encourage clean energy market growth by punishing carbon emissions and subsidizing renewable energy usage .
Instead of talking about change – like the United States – they are already changing , shifting their businesses to acknowledge a more environmentally friendly market .
And the cash is pouring in .
Companies are recognizing the need to move to where the consumer base is developing for the clean energy market – and that is not the United States .
" If you want to have the same size of company that you have today , then you need to start the shift , " said Katrina Landis , chief executive of the London - based BP Plc. ’s ( NYSE : BP ) alternative energy unit .
" It means to some degree giving up what you ’ve done for the last 100 years . "
General Electric Company ( NYSE : GE ) last week said it would invest $ 453 million in wind - turbine operations in the U.K , Norway , Germany and Sweden .
" What you see going on in Europe is long - term , predictable policy around renewables , " Steve Bolze , head of GE ’s power and water divisions , told Bloomberg .
The European Union ( EU ) aims to drive 20 % of its produced energy from renewable resources by 2020 , and has the initiatives in place to meet that goal .
The European Wind Energy Association said Europe ’s offshore wind industry could grow by 70 % in 2010 .
Once completed , those projects could account for up to 10 % of the EU ’s yearly electricity output , while decreasing carbon emissions by 200 million tons .
The U.K. government is establishing a $ 3 billion Green Investment Bank for promoting low - carbon energy technologies .
Funds will go to developing ports that support offshore wind turbine makers .
Another clean energy winner , Germany , offers a per-kilowatt subsidy for solar panel use .
As soon as solar panels are put online , the panel users start earning money .
The government pays per-kilowatt subsidies for 20 years – instead of a one - time payment like the United States .
The more energy produced by the solar panels , the more money earned by the users .
Other countries have adopted feed - in tariffs , carbon - reduction targets , financial incentives for investment and energy production , and energy efficiency goals .
Meanwhile , the United States has talked a lot about needed changes , but has yet to move much through Congress .
" Our nation has a critical choice to make : pass the federal policies necessary to position us as the world leader in the large and growing global clean energy market or continue to watch as China and other countries race ahead , " said Pew Environment Group ’s Cuttino .
Too Much Talk , Not Enough Action
While most of the country has had its eyes on healthcare reform , Senators John Kerry , D - MA , Joe Lieberman , R-SC , and Lindsey Graham , I - CT , have been outlining a climate and energy proposal .
Until now , Washington ’s way of handling climate change policies was to enforce cap - and - trade laws .
" Cap " places limits via permits on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed by companies ; " trade " gives the companies a market to exchange their permits .
The cap - and - trade legislation has stalled in Congress , and is of little interest to companies because it does n’t do enough to encourage growth .
The House ’s Waxman - Markey bill focused on cap - and - trade policies , but they will be a small part of a proposal by the Senate .
A new energy bill has to do more than punish carbon emissions if it ’s going to get support ; it has to create jobs .
After surviving the recession and facing stagnant job growth , people want to see the country move forward and enact policies that promote employment .
The private sector will be hesitant to increase clean energy investment , until a bill creating a job market is proposed , .
The government ’s next steps will be key in creating a U.S. market impressive enough to compete with China and Europe .
" What the U.S. needs , which Europe , China and other countries have , is a stable , long - term policy , " said GE ’s Bolze .
" Our view is that you need a federal , renewable portfolio standard , or have that as part of a clean energy bill , to really restart and move forward . "
Some of the proposals being talked about in Washington include a monthly auction for carbon share bidding , and business - friendly practices to encourage fewer foreign oils and fossil fuels .
President Barack Obama ’s goal is to make the United States the world ’s leading renewable energy exporter – but right now its businesses and employees are what ’s leaving the country .
" We ’re very good at creating companies , " John Woolard , chief executive at solar power firm BrightSource Energy , said on a conference call .
" We ’re not doing a very good job creating markets . "
Get Out in Front in the Clean Energy Race
Companies with stakes in the promising clean energy lands of China and Europe , and companies that come out with innovative designs are in the best position to collect clean energy profits .
First Solar is a huge player in the solar industry and has a patented thin - film technology sought after by many companies globally .
Its patented designs will be used in its largest free - field solar power plant being constructed in Spain .
Vestas Wind Systems , a Denmark - based wind - turbine maker that trades on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange , is the world ’s biggest turbine manufacture and is poised to profit handsomely from Europe ’s growing investment in onshore and offshore wind energy projects .
And for a more balanced play on clean energy , the Market Vectors Global Alternative Energy ETF ( NYSE : GEX ) includes 30 companies worldwide invested in alternative energies and related technologies .
Investments like these will will reap the rewards as the industry gets more government and private sector investment .

WASHINGTON —
As the United States military steadily reduces its presence in Haiti , President Obama pledged on Wednesday to remain committed to providing financial assistance and humanitarian relief to help Haitians rebuild and recover from their devastating earthquake two months ago .
“ The situation on the ground remains dire and people should be under no illusions that the crisis is over , ” Mr. Obama said after meeting with President René Préval of Haiti .
With spring rains ahead , he added , “ the challenge is now to prevent a second disaster . ”
The two leaders stood side by side in a ceremony in the Rose Garden , after a private meeting in the Oval Office , where Mr. Obama received an update on conditions in Haiti .
The Navy said the hospital ship Comfort left Haiti on Wednesday for its home port , Baltimore .
Mr. Préval offered his gratitude to the United States for its “ massive , spontaneous , generous help ” after the earthquake on Jan. 12 that killed more than 230,000 people and left more than one million homeless .
He said the tragedy should serve as a warning for the world that the effectiveness of relief efforts “ must be improved . ”
On today ’s front page of my local paper , the Warren Weekly , there is a picture of a dejected - looking man named Tom Turmel .
The reason he is sad is because the city may allow a trucking company to pave over some greenspace to make a storage lot for tractor - trailers .
In this greenspace , which has been there for decades , Mr. Turmel built a secret garden .
I have been walking around my part of the City of Warren for over a year , and have become quite familiar with the local sights , secret paths , and hidden mysteries .
Never did I realize there is a natural greenbelt with some natural wetlands , a mere 5 blocks from my house .
In all my walking adventures over the past two years , I never once walked back behind the metal shops , trucking yards , and other industrial buildings to see Tom Turmel ’s secret garden .
The greenbelt in question had originally been wetlands and an 18 acre pond , according to residents who remember it from the 1960s .
In 1968 , the pond was plowed in by the city in response to mosquito concerns by residents along the street behind it .
After that , it became prairie with a few acres of natural wetlands .
Many birds and animals make their homes in the greenbelt .
Now , many animals including squirrels , rabbits , woodchucks , and feral cats make their home in the natural refuge .
Two days ago , I took a walk with my girlfriend and my kids .
As we were walking towards Mound Road , I got inspired and said , “ there ’s woods or something back here , let ’s go this way , ” and we turned towards the greenbelt .
As we walked through the last of the parking lots to get to the green area , my son noted , “ this looks like an industrial wasteland , like in a video game , ” but when we hit the greenspace , they were thrilled .
“ I had no idea there was nature this close to our house ! ”
We traversed the greenbelt and noted that some people along Blackmar ( the residential street backing the greenbelt ) had made gardens or horseshoe pits , or simply put two lawn chairs back there to enjoy a tiny bit of peace and quiet , a natural refuge in a city where trains , factories , parking lot sweepers , and construction go on all night and silence is rare and precious .
Then we came upon what I now know is Mr. Turmel ’s garden .
It ’s incredible .
It ’s a mystical space with vine - covered arches , welcoming willows , rock cairns , and magic .
This is the kind of place fairies and toads meet , a refuge where long - buried imagination and wonder spring forth — the kind of places that makes an adult want to take his shoes off and lay in the grass under the trees and tell stories .
So badly did I want to go in there , and my kids were fairly dancing to sneak in , but we knew it was private , and moved on after admiring it for a few minutes .
Today I got the paper and read the cover story .
I became so angry that I was nearly shaking .
I have a very hard time being an ambassador for my region .
Over the last six years , I have brought hundreds of people to Warren and the Detroit area every year for the Expo Icrontic and various other reasons .
Each time a new person comes , they are skeptical .
They see the blight , they see that a great deal of Warren is actually just an industrial wasteland .
They see that the roads are pothole - ridden and many of the houses are foreclosed and there are liquor and check cashing places every block .
They see that there is nowhere to walk , no downtown , and no pedestrian - friendly businesses .
They notice that not once have I ever taken a group of 50 people to a restaurant in my own hometown for the annual Tastes of Detroit Food Tour , because there are no worthy restaurants .
They say “ Royal Oak is nice ! ” or “ Ferndale is cool ! ” but nobody in all my years of trying , has ever said “ Warren is a nice town . ”
At this point , Warren is merely “ where I live ” .
I ’m stuck here , because I owe over $ 120,000 on a house that is worth about $ 60,000 now , due to the massive decline of property values in my city .
Certainly this is mostly due to the major economic recession and real estate crash that is a national problem , but of course some of that has to do with declining quality of life in the City of Warren .
Warren is the third largest city in the State of Michigan .
At over 34 square miles , there is not one nature preserve .
I ’ll tell you what there are a lot of though : parking lots and storage areas .
I went to interview Tom , and he graciously showed me around his wonderful garden , enthusiastically pointing out different artifacts and trinkets .
Each flagstone , each brick , each wooden post had a story .
Turmel can tell you where they came from , when he brought them there , and why he moved them .
A rotting wooden window frame from an old farmhouse is supporting some vines .
“ I ’m just gonna let that return to the earth , ” he says with a wistful look on his face .
Tom ’s philosophy is one of gentle nurturing .
He lets nature take its course , and merely suggests that perhaps this tree should be here , or these vines should come up here , or perhaps this flowering bush would like less shade .
He cringes at using anything unnatural in the garden .
“ These planters , I normally would n’t have these because they ’re old tires turned inside out , and I hate rubber .
But they belonged to my neighbor and she liked them so much and gave them to me , I just had to use them .
So I painted them green and in the summer , the flowers hang over and you ca n’t really see the planter anyway .
They ’re from the 1950s . ”
Feral cats have taken residence in the bole of a tree .
“ I let the cats go free , and they pay me back by taking care of rats and rabbits .
That one , she ’s about 15 years old , but she has a litter every year .
I promised my mother on her deathbed that I would take care of the cats .
I know she was worried about them . ”
I stared down into the hollow , and a fuzzy head and bright blue eye peered back at me with a tiny mewl .
The trees are spectacular .
A massive weeping willow that is something of a centerpiece in the garden is a mere 26 years old .
“ I stuck a willow branch in the ground in 1984 , and here it is today .
Willows grow fast and die young . ”
Other willows in the yard are equally impressive and beautiful , and some are only 10 years old .
My girlfriend , originally from Traverse City , just moved in to Warren .
We were walking the other night , exploring her new city , and we walked by a giant empty lot , surrounded by a long barbed wire fence .
“ What is this ? ” she asked .
“ A storage lot that ’s been empty for my entire adult life , ” I replied .
On 10 Mile Road , between Mound and Sherwood , there is a giant empty lot .
It is acres upon acres of nothing but dusty , weed - choked broken concrete , with a few rusty trailers parked way in the back , next to a spare , decrepit block building of some sort .
It has been empty for as long as I can remember .
This is the City of Warren .
Decrepit , with a veneer of progress in the form of a shiny new City Hall and some new cop cars , but anyone can see the giant pink elephant : Square miles of vacant , destitute and unused space .
This is the future of a city that makes bad choices .
When I read in the paper that some business wants to tear down Tom Turmel ’s garden to build a driveway that leads to yet another storage lot for trailers , it makes me want to give up hope .
I can imagine the scene : “ economic development ” in the form of destructive and needless paving , and yet another spot where old and rusty , graffiti - ridden trailers will be stored for some company whose owner has probably never set foot in Warren , Michigan .
Residents along Blackmar , including Mr. Turmel , will have the joy of even further declining property values , noise , and a new place for people to loiter and cause trouble .
Broken glass , spray paint , trash , and worse will end up taking over a space where birds , frogs , rabbits , squirrels , and human beings used to go for a bit of peace and joy .
I will say that our mayor , Jim Fouts , has gone on record stating that he is absolutely opposed to the idea , although he has n’t visited the site or Tom personally yet .
Still , this gives me a modicum of hope and makes me think there is at least some beacon of human decency and sanity in our city government .
However , if this happens — if our city planning commission allows this travesty , this shameful thing to happen — I will have to ask the question :
Who was bribed ?
Who would allow this ?
Only a local official in the pocket of some mogul would let something this profane happen in our community .
Icrontic HQ is in Warren , Michigan .
I own a business in and am a resident of this city .
Tom Turmel , we are behind you .
Facebook may not be the bane of workplace productivity that some employers believe , according to a report released by MailGuard on workplace Web behaviour in Australia .
The DataCurve Report shows that Australian workers only accessed Facebook for nine minutes per session on average , with each visit coming every second day .
Twitter clocked in at around five minutes per session every three days .
Craig McDonald , CEO of MailGuard and co-author of the DataCurve Report , says that social networking should be embraced by employers .
" The report clearly shows that although workers are accessing social media sites like Facebook , the majority of those people are not affecting their overall output , " he said .
Data indicates that social networking sites were the preferred destination for employees who go online during working hours .
Facebook achieved a 40 percent penetration rate , up from just 24 percent a year earlier and equating to more than 2.2 million Australians visiting the site each month while at work .
Twitter now has a 17 percent penetration rate in the workplace , up from three per cent last year .
With more than 5 million Australians online at any time during work , top news sites attracted between 900,000 and 2.1 million unique workplace visitors in any given month — less than social media websites .
However news sites strongly differed with social media in terms of engagement , with many having double the number of monthly visits as the leading social networking sites .
" The concept that the day is divided into three distinct parts — sleep , work and availability to media — is no longer true .
Work and media are now strongly intertwined , " said McDonald .
McDonald believes that social media can be a useful tool for companies to utilise and expand their business .
" It 's about building relationships with clients and social media has a large impact .
Essentially , it can be a face to the company , but the question remains — do businesses have the time and resources to invest in social media ? "
Twenty percent of the 8400 surveyed workers were " highly Web- active " employees that recorded almost two hours of Web activity over an eight hour day .
" This sort of usage does have an adverse effect on productivity , " said McDonald .
McDonald believes that it is important that employers should make it clear whether Facebook or Twitter was in the same category as smoke breaks and coffee runs , which may be seen as possible distractions .
UNITED NATIONS , United States —
A new model of decision - making among peoples of different cultures would contribute to integration " at this time of transition to a new social order , " according to a new Baha 'i statement .
The statement was prepared for the 48th United Nations Commission for Social Development , which concluded on 12 February .
The commission is the chief UN body charged with following up on the World Summit on Social Development held in 1995 in Copenhagen , where world leaders outlined principles that would characterize a new " society for all . "
These principles included respect for diversity and participation of all people .
The Baha'i International Community said in its statement that it was offering its experience in the method of consultation used by Baha 'i communities around the world – a key component in creating unity among people .
The consultative process , the Baha 'i statement said , rests on the understanding that all human beings are essentially noble – " they possess reason and conscience as well as capacities for inquiry , understanding , compassion , and service to the common good . "
Mr. Ming H. Chong of Singapore , a delegate to the commission who presented a summary of the Baha 'i statement , said afterward that understanding the nobility of all humans prevents people from dismissing others as needy rather than being in charge of their own development .
" If you start with ( this ) understanding , then you have a different perspective , one that avoids labels like ' marginalized ' and ' poor , ' " he said .
He explained that he was a child of immigrants to Singapore and had learned that such labels create the wrong impression of entire groups of people .
" Language shapes the way we think , " he said .
" It creates mental pictures of how we see the world .
Some of these mental pictures are not always positive – those that dehumanize migrants , for example . "
The Baha 'i statement to the UN commission suggested that the human body can serve as a model for comparing the integration of the world 's cultures and peoples .
" Within this organism , millions of cells , with extraordinary diversity of form and function , collaborate to make human existence possible .
Every least cell has its part to play in maintaining a healthy body , " the statement said .
This image can be used to envision the world 's peoples as one human family and understand how each culture plays a part in the functioning of the whole , Mr. Chong explained .
In consultation as practiced in Baha 'i communities , great value is placed on the diversity of perspectives and contributions that individuals bring to the discussion .
" Actively soliciting views from those traditionally excluded from decision - making not only increases the pool of intellectual resources but also fosters the trust , inclusion , and mutual commitment needed for collective action , " the Baha 'i statement said .
A key feature of Baha 'i consultation is that ideas belong to the group rather than to individuals .
" Detachment from one 's positions and opinions regarding the matter under discussion is imperative – once an idea has been shared , it is no longer associated with the individual who expressed it , but becomes a resource for the group to adopt , modify , or discard , " the statement said .
A diversity of opinions , however , is not sufficient – it " does not provide communities with a means to bridge differences or to resolve social tensions , " it continued .
" In consultation , the value of diversity is inextricably linked to the goal of unity .
This is not an idealized unity , but one that acknowledges differences and strives to transcend them through a process of principled deliberation , " the statement said .
" It is unity in diversity . "
The Baha'i International Community participated in or cosponsored several other activities during the Commission for Social Development , which ran from 3 February to12 February .
Among other things , Baha 'is sponsored a panel discussion on freedom of religion or belief , offered a presentation on " Child Participation for Social Integration " featuring the New York - based Children 's Theater Company , and contributed to NGO consultations leading to a Civil Society Declaration to the Commission .
The panel discussion – titled " Freedom of religion or belief : A forgotten pillar of social integration ? " – was held at Baha 'i offices on 5 February .
It featured presentations by Brian Grim , a senior researcher at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life ; Dr. Anupam Ray of the mission of India to the UN ; John Mosoti of the mission of Kenya to UN ; and Azza Karam , a senior researcher with the United Nations Population Fund .
Participants discussed how freedom of religion contributes to social integration , focusing in part on the success of multi-ethnic and multi-religious societies like India and Kenya in achieving relative harmony .
" To the extent that efforts towards social integration will reflect the diverse voices and aspirations of the world 's people , governments will need to tackle one of the most challenging and neglected issues of our time – ensuring every individual 's freedom of conscience , religion or belief , " said Bani Dugal , the principal representative of the Baha'i International Community to the UN , who introduced the discussion .
KNOXVILLE – East Tennessee is now home to two of the world ’s three fastest computers , according to new rankings released today .
The Top500 list of the world ’s fastest supercomputers places University of Tennessee supercomputer Kraken in third place , where it also holds the title of world ’s fastest academic supercomputer , while Oak Ridge National Laboratory ’s Jaguar computer took first place overall .
“ This is just the latest in a series of successes for the University of Tennessee as it progresses toward achieving world - class research status , ” said Governor Phil Bredesen .
“ The combined resources of UT and its partners in Oak Ridge are positioning Tennessee as a global epicenter for supercomputing .
I ’m very proud of the state ’s role in supporting UT ’s drive to compete and succeed in this very select arena . ”
Kraken , the result of a $ 65 million grant to UT from the National Science Foundation , recently became only the fourth computer in history to perform more than 1,000 trillion calculations per second , known as a petaflop .
“ Winning a $ 65 million NSF award put the University of Tennessee among the supercomputing elite , and now we have reached the pinnacle in having the world ’s fastest academic supercomputer , ” said Jan Simek , interim UT president .
“ This is a phenomenal achievement and is among growing distinctions that enable us to continue attracting the best faculty and the best students we have ever had , and to make our university the best it has ever been . ”
The twice - yearly Top500 is published by Jack Dongarra , a UT Knoxville distinguished professor of computer science and the director of the Innovative Computing Laboratory along with colleagues at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of Mannheim .
Since its creation in 2007 , Kraken has been used for nearly 300 scientific projects addressing vital questions in areas from climate and weather modeling to applications in genetics and medicine .
“ The beauty of Kraken is not just its computing power , but its problem - solving power , ” said UT Knoxville Chancellor Jimmy G. Cheek .
“ Scientists from universities around the country , including many here at UT Knoxville , have put Kraken to use to attack humanity ’s most pressing problems .
It is an invaluable resource to this university to be home to such a powerful asset . ”
With the combined computing power of UT and ORNL , East Tennessee is now firmly ensconced as a center for supercomputing activities , a fact which is continuing to draw even more resources to the area .
“ Kraken is the result of a powerful and expanding partnership between the University of Tennessee and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to advance the frontier of scientific discovery and innovation from climate change to energy technologies and from basic to applied sciences , ” said Thomas Zacharia , deputy director for science and technology at ORNL and a UT Knoxville professor .
“ When NSF made the award to UT Knoxville to develop Kraken just over a year ago I said that ‘ like the gargantuan sea monster Kraken , which inspired the naming of this supercomputer , the possibilities in scientific and engineering advances it enables are enormous , limited only by the confines of human imagination and vision beyond the frontiers of science , ' ” said NSF Director Arden L. Bement .
“ Today , Kraken is working to realize that vision .
Consistent with ORNL ’s leadership in building what many would consider to be one of the most diverse and valuable computation centers in the world , Kraken will address some of the most complex problems of our era . ”
In October , the NSF awarded UT Knoxville an additional $ 10 million grant to create a new computer called Nautilus designed to help analyze and process the complex data created by massive computers like Kraken and Jaguar .
Nautilus and its accompanying research center will be part of UT ’s National Institute for Computational Sciences ( NICS ) , which also manages Kraken .
Both Kraken and Jaguar are Cray XT5 supercomputers .
Kraken alone has 100,000 processors that work simultaneously to produce the high speeds at which the computer is capable to address major scientific questions .
Jaguar clocked in at a sustained speed of 1.759 petaflops , while Kraken registered 831 teraflops .
In the most recent version of the list , Kraken ranked sixth while Jaguar was in second place .
In addition to Kraken and Jaguar , East Tennessee also is home to two more machines ranked in the world ’s top 30 , with ORNL ’s original Jaguar Cray XT4 system at 16th and UT ’s Athena in 30th .

Battle for Wesnoth 1.8 Release Notes
April 2010 .
It is once again time for that thrill you 've all been waiting for , a Wesnoth stable release .
The Battle for Wesnoth team is proud to release version 1.8 of The Battle for Wesnoth , a free open - source turn - based strategy game with a fantasy theme and roleplaying elements .
The game is available for download now for Windows , Mac OS X and various GNU / Linux distributions .
What 's new in Wesnoth 1.8
The improvements this time around include one entire new full - length campaign , hundreds of new and revised unit portraits , five new music tracks , some UI redesign , and substantial improvements in the game 's AI .
For Players
To help the player keep those who are loyal to him alive , these units are now marked with an overlay symbol that looks like a bronze ring .
The names on maps and other images can now be localized to the player 's language ; several languages already use this new feature .
For more information and tutorials , look at the wiki article on Image Localization .
Campaigns
A new campaign , Delfador 's Memoirs , tells the tale of how a mage - apprentice rose to become Delfador the Great .
This campaign was imported from the Wesnoth - UMC - Dev project , where it spent almost a year being adapted for mainline .
We 've continued to polish and improve the mainline campaigns .
The hero Kaleh 's custom advancements in Under the Burning Suns , long a source of problems , have been redesigned in a more robust and streamlined fashion .
Significant continuity problems in Heir to the Throne 's " Cliffs of Thoria " scenario have been fixed .
Some scenarios in Legend of Wesmere have been rewritten and significantly enhanced .
An early version of its multiplayer port is available to test Wesnoth 's multiplayer campaign feature .
There are five new full - orchestral music tracks : Casualties of War , Into the Shadows , Journey 's End , Over the Northern Mountains , and Weight of Revenge .
The game AI has been significantly debugged and improved ; it chooses recruits / recalls better , and does smarter target selection .
Multiplayer
The operating system 's GUI can be told to notify the player that it's his turn to play .
The multiplayer lobby has been completely redesigned for improved ease of play and better appearance .
Random numbers are generated on the Wesnoth multiplayer server during MP combats .
This makes certain kinds of cheats and out - of - sync conditions impossible , at the cost of breaking compatibility with versions before 1.7.13 .
General
The right sidebar on the main game display has been tuned for usability .
It now gives more prominence to the selected unit 's terrain defence percentage and time - of - day modifier .
There is a new monster unit : the Water Serpent .
Additionally , the Dwarvish Scout from Under the Burning Suns is now part of normal Dwarvish sides in campaigns .
Several other unit lines — most notably the Drakes — have been completely redone with improved art and animations .
A remake of the merfolk units out of our Art Director 's virtual pencil has been completed in this release cycle .
( But most animations are still missing for them . )
Add - on descriptions are now accessible from the add - on download dialog via a button .
Most translations have been updated .
In addition , Vietnamese has returned , and we have a new transliteration , English in the Shavian alphabet .
For Content Developers
This year Wesnoth was once again a Google " Summer of Code " program ; one of its major results was a complete rework of Wesnoth 's support for multiplayer campaigns .
Sides in multiplayer games are now persistent and can be carried over from one multiplayer scenario to the next .
The leaders of AI sides are now able to recall from their side 's list .
As a side effect it is now possible to have more than one leader with the ability to recruit per side .
Another Summer of Code result is a new framework for Wesnoth 's artificial intelligence .
The AI can now be scripted to significantly change its behavior in different story settings and in response to campaign events , give enemy sides more distinct tactical personalities .
It is possible , though not easy , to use scripting languages ( formula_ai , lua ) to create alternate AIs that are also scriptable .
A new tool called the " gamestate inspector " allows a content developer to view the values of the WML variables , ai configuration , and the recall list while a game is in progress .
New Orcish Village and Orcish Keep terrain graphics improve the options available to map designers .
We 've also achieved excellent results with our inaugural ' Summer Art Scholarship ' program .
This has led to dozens of new portraits , as well as a complete rework of the Drake sprites .
We hope to continue this program in coming years .
We paid a lot of attention to world continuity , from small details like replacing earth - human names for characters up through larger ones like putting many new placenames on the main map .
The main Wesnoth history timeline has been tweaked to eliminate various minor inconsistencies .
We kept the promise we made in 1.6 when we had to remove Python for technical reasons ; WML events and AI components can now be written in lua .
The integration of lua in the wesnoth game engine is advanced enough to even allow the coding of WML action tags with lua definitions that can read and modify game state variables in the C++ core .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The retired general whose opposition deflected the last serious bid to let homosexuals serve openly in the U.S. military , Colin Powell , reversed himself on Wednesday and backed President Barack Obama ’s move to repeal the restrictions on gays .
Powell ’s intervention followed by one day an announcement of support for Obama ’s proposal by Pentagon chief Robert Gates and a strong appeal to let gays serve openly by the nation ’s top uniformed officer , Admiral Michael Mullen .
Gates and Mullen spent part of Wednesday trying to defuse opposition in Congress to the move .
Mullen , who says allowing gays to serve openly is “ an issue of integrity , ” is chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the job Powell held in 1993 , when he resisted President Clinton ’s efforts to lift the ban on gays in the U.S. armed forces .
That year , Congress struck a compromise “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy allowing gays to serve in the military only if they remained silent about their homosexuality .
This is what Obama wants to change , and Powell said on Wednesday he now favored changing it too .
“ In the almost 17 years since the ‘ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ’ legislation was passed , attitudes and circumstances have changed , ” Powell said in a statement .
“ I fully support the new approach presented ... this week by Secretary of Defense ( Robert ) Gates and Admiral Mullen . ”
Powell ’s endorsement could give a boost to Obama ’s efforts to lift the current restrictions .
Obama has come under pressure from some gay activists who backed him as a presidential candidate but were disappointed that he had not acted sooner on major gay rights issues .
But ultimately the policy can only be changed by Congress , and some lawmakers in both parties strongly oppose Obama ’s move , saying it could hurt morale and discipline .
Gates and Mullen on Wednesday assured them they would only move forward on the plan with plenty of consultation within the ranks .
Gates , who once ran the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency , told lawmakers in the House Armed Services Committee that he had learned from experience it was “ stupid to try to impose a policy from the top without any regard for the views of the people who were going to be affected . ”
He and Mullen said consultation with ordinary servicemembers was part of the review they had ordered to examine how the change might affect unit cohesion , recruitment and retention , as well as the possibility of extending marriage and bereavement benefits to the partners of gay soldiers .
They also denied that they were trying to delay the policy by giving the review up to a year to be completed .
“ I think rushing into it , mandating it by fiat with a very short timer on it , would be a very serious mistake , ” Gates said .
But the Armed Services Committee ’s top Republican , Representative Howard McKeon , was critical .
He noted that Gates and Mullen made it clear a day earlier that they were “ ready to implement a repeal ” before the consultation took place .
“ It seems that your path places the cart before the horse , ” McKeon said .
The policy bans openly gay people from serving but prohibits military officials from initiating inquiries on sexual orientation when soldiers are abiding by the rules .
KOSCIUSKO , Miss . —
An ailing , 84 - year - old World War II veteran is making a desperate plea to Oprah Winfrey : Please admit I ’m your father !
Norh Robinson , a dirt - poor Mississippi farmer now living in a rural VA hospital , wants Oprah to submit to a paternity test that he says would once and for all prove that he sired her in 1954 .
Robinson said he dreams of just once speaking with Oprah as father and daughter before he dies — and revealed that , years ago , he tried to reach the talk - show queen to beg her to agree to a DNA test .
“ I told her [ in a letter ] , if she wanted , I ’d give her one , ” Robinson told The Post in an exclusive interview this week .
In the letter , he placed mementos from his life , including his Social Security number and a picture of him from the Navy in World War II , he said .
“ I never got no answer , ” Robinson told The Post .
“ I never did get no answer .
If I did , it did n’t get to me . ”
The vet insisted he was n’t looking to get his hands on Oprah ’s millions .
“ I ’d like her to call me , ” he said .
Oprah ’s spokeswoman said the TV host was n’t available to comment on Robinson ’s claims .
Oprah was raised by her mother , Vernita Lee , 75 , and Lee ’s longtime boyfriend , Vernon Winfrey .
She considers Vernon her father but has figured out he is n’t her biological dad .

This week , the National Enquirer reported Robinson ’s alleged tie to Oprah .
When reached in Kosciusko — the small town Winfrey ditched a half - century ago — Robinson insisted , “ I ’m her real father .
I have n’t seen her since she was a kid .
She was a little bitty thing . ”
During a half - hour chat at his hospital , Robinson said that he met Oprah ’s mom when they worked in the same part of Kosciusko and that he often drove her to and from work .
“ I had to get by her house to get to my daddy ’s house because it was on the same road , ” he said .
Robinson said he ’s looking forward to the day he gets to meet his world - famous daughter .
“ She ’s taken after her daddy , ” he said .
“ I was a handsome man growing up at that time . ”

Sony camera with Linux and WiFi integrated .
At the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show Sony presented the new camera from its Cyber - shot product line .
The DSC - G3 comes with a Zeiss lens with 4 x zoom , a large 3.5 " touch display and 4 GBytes of internal memory .
Most interesting is the camera 's software that includes , among other things , face and scene recognition , based on Busybox and Kernel 2.6.11 for the Access Linux Platform ( ALP ) .
The kernel code makefile reveals further :
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 6
SUBLEVEL = 11
EXTRAVERSION := $( EXTRAVERSION )- alp
NAME=Woozy Beaver
ALP is successor to the Palm OS , for which there have been few devices produced up to now , but notably the Emblaze Edelweiss mobile phone .
The camera 's additional WLAN module and integrated browser allow photos to go directly on the web or to be sent over e-mail , via a deal in the U.S. with AT&T .
Unlike competitor products from Nikon or Kodak that have their own Wi-Fi functions , the Sony camera works with AT&T hotspots so that external access point software is n't necessary .
The Sony webpage has a general overview of the camera 's features .
Sony DSC G3 Interface
Source code for the kernel , Busybox and other components are available for free download here .
The DSC - G3 costs about $ 500 in the U.S .
What is Wikileaks ?
By Jonathan Fildes
Technology reporter , BBC News Published duration 7 December 2010
image caption Wikileaks has established a reputation for publishing sensitive materials
Whistle - blowing website Wikileaks has dominated the news , both because of its steady drip feed of secret documents , but also because of the dealings of its enigmatic front man Julian Assange .
The recent release of thousands of sensitive diplomatic cables is just the latest in a long list of " leaks " published by the secretive site , which has established a reputation for publishing sensitive material from governments and other high - profile organisations .
In October the site released almost 400,000 secret US military logs detailing its operations in Iraq .
They followed hot on the heels of nearly 90,000 classified military records , which gave an insight into the military strategy in Afghanistan .
And in April 2010 , for example , Wikileaks posted a video on its website that shows a US Apache helicopter killing at least 12 people - including two Reuters journalists - during an attack in Baghdad in 2007 .
A US military analyst is currently awaiting trial , on charges of leaking the material along with the cables and military documents .
Legal wrangles
However , the site 's recent prominence is part of a longer and controversial history that started in December 2006 , when it first hit the net .
Since that time it has split opinion .
For some it is lauded as the future of investigative journalism ; it has been described as the world 's first stateless news organisation .
For others - particularly the governments and corporations whose secrets it exposes - it is a risk .
In October 2009 , it posted a list of names and addresses of people it claimed belonged to the British National Party ( BNP ) .
The BNP said the list was a " malicious forgery " .
And during the 2008 US elections , it published screenshots of the e-mail inbox , pictures and address book of vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin .
Other controversial documents hosted on the site include a copy of the Standard Operating Procedures for Camp Delta , a document that detailed restrictions placed on prisoners at Guantanamo Bay .
Many of these were uploaded to the website , which allows anyone to submit documents anonymously .
However , a team of reviewers - volunteers from the mainstream press , journalists and Wikileaks staff - decides what is published .
" We use advanced cryptographic techniques and legal techniques to protect sources , " Mr Assange told the BBC in February .
The site says that it accepts " classified , censored or otherwise restricted material of political , diplomatic or ethical significance " but does not take " rumour , opinion or other kinds of first hand reporting or material that is already publicly available " .
" We specialise in allowing whistle - blowers and journalists who have been censored to get material out to the public , " said Mr Assange .
It is operated by an organisation known as the Sunshine Press and claims to be " funded by human rights campaigners , investigative journalists , technologists and the general public " .
Since Wikileaks first appeared on the net , it has faced various legal challenges to take it offline .
Prior to the most recent leaks , it said it had fought off more than 100 legal challenges successfully .
In 2008 , for example , the Swiss bank Julius Baer won a court ruling to block the site after Wikileaks posted " several hundred " documents about its offshore activities .
It was eventually overturned .
Money matters
But more recently , the site has faced new challenges .
The private life of Mr Assange , its editor - in - chief , has been laid bare and it has lost key staff and supporters .
The site has also been targeted in a series of cyber attacks .
Various firms - including web giant Amazon - have also terminated agreements to host the site and provide services to it .
In addition , companies - including Mastercard , Visa and PayPal - have withdrawn the ability that allows people to donate to the site .
Its Swiss bank account has also been closed .
But it is not the first time that the site has faced financial problems .
In February 2010 it suspended operations as it could not afford its own running costs .
Donations from individuals and organisations saved the site .
Only time will tell , if it can do it again with many sources of funding now cut off .
Despite all of these setbacks , Wikileaks has largely remained defiantly online .
It has moved its operations between various companies and countries .
It has also encouraged volunteers to set up " mirrors " of the site - hosted on different servers around the world .
" [ To ] keep our sources safe , we have had to spread assets , encrypt everything , and move telecommunications and people around the world to activate protective laws in different national jurisdictions , " Mr Assange said earlier this year .
Throughout its history , the site has been supported and hosted by the Swedish ISP PeRiQuito ( PRQ ) , which became famous for hosting file - sharing website The Pirate Bay .
" If it is legal in Sweden , we will host it , and will keep it up regardless of any pressure to take it down , " the ISP 's site says .
The ISP continues to host its most recent - and most controversial - documents .
The site also hosts documents in other jurisdictions , including France .
Its experience of different laws around the world meant that it was drafted to help Icelandic MPs draw up plans for its Icelandic Modern Media Initiative ( IMMI ) earlier this year
The plan calls on the country 's government to adopt laws protecting journalists and their sources .
Expansion plan
Its involvement in the IMMI gave the site a new credibility .
At the same time , it has grown and gained more notoriety .
The site 's rapid expansion - and the amount of material it has recently received - has meant that it has had to change its tactics .
In the past , it was able to verify and publish documents itself .
But for its most recent leaks it has adopted a new tactic - partnering with news organisations such as the Guardian , Der Spiegel and the New York Times - to help check and distribute the material .
" We take care of the source and act as a neutral intermediary and then we also take care of the publication of the material whilst the journalist that has been communicated with takes care of the verification , " Mr Assange said earlier this year .
Robin Dunbar explains Dunbar 's Number to Aleks Krotoski guardian.co.uk
Not many people have a number named after them , but Robin Dunbar lays claim to the Dunbar Number .
Confusingly , no precise value has been attached to this figure , but a commonly cited approximation is 150 – and this is the number of people with whom we can maintain a meaningful relationship , whether in a hunter - gatherer society or on Facebook .
The director of the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology at Oxford University is also the author of How Many Friends Does One Person Need ? ( Faber ) .
It 's no surprise he's an engaging companion .
What is evolutionary anthroplogy ?
Evolutionary anthropology is the generic study of how we came to be modern humans – how our bodies came to be the shape they are , how our minds came to be the way they are .
So how much of our social behaviour is rooted in our biology ?
All of it !
[ But ] by that you must be clear that you do n't mean genetically rooted – so that we have no choice about the way we behave , we 're programmed in the way that an an amoeba is .
If you look at any bird or mammal , never mind things as smart as primates , never mind things as doubly smart as humans … any bird or mammal has its biological inheritance , as it were , which gives the rules of how to play the game of life .
But how those rules get played out on a day - to - day basis depends on how the the animal assesses the particular circumstances – it has a lot of flexibility in how it should behave , it just has some guidelines provided by evolution , and some constraints .
If you do n't have wings , you can't fly …
[ But there 's still ] lots of scope for social , environmental , demographic circumstances … and grim economics .
What does your work tell us about the way we interact socially ?
The way in which our social world is constructed is part and parcel of our biological inheritance .
Together with apes and monkeys , we 're members of the primate family – and within the primates there is a general relationship between the size of the brain and the size of the social group .
We fit in a pattern .
There are social circles beyond it and layers within – but there is a natural grouping of 150 .
This is the number of people you can have a relationship with involving trust and obligation – there 's some personal history , not just names and faces .
And this is is the Dunbar number !
How did you come up with this concept ?
I was working on the arcane question of why primates spend so much time grooming one another , and I tested another hypothesis – which says the reason why primates have big brains is because they live in complex social worlds .
Because grooming is social , all these things ought to map together , so I started plotting brain size and group size and grooming time against one another .
You get a nice set of relationships .
It was about 3 am , and I thought , hmm , what happens if you plug humans into this ?
And you get this number of 150 .
This looked implausibly small , given that we all live in cities now , but it turned out that this was the size of a typical community in hunter - gatherer societies .
And the average village size in the Domesday Book is 150 [ people ] .
It 's the same when we have much better data – in the 18th century , for example , thanks to parish registers .
County by county , the average size of a village is again 150 .
Except in Kent , where it was 100 .
I 've no idea why .
Has this number evolved at all ?
The Dunbar number probably dates back to the appearance of anatomically modern humans 250,000 years ago .
If you go back in time , by estimating brain size , you can see community size declining steadily .
Why did we evolve as a social species ?
Simply , it 's the key evolutionary strategy of primates .
Group living and explicitly communal solutions to the problem of survival out there on the plains or in the forests … that 's a primate adaptation , and they evolved that very early on .
Most species of birds and animals are n't as intensely social .
Sociality for most species hovers around pair - bonds , that 's as complicated as it gets .
The species with big brains are the ones who mate monogamously …
The lesson is that there is something computationally very demanding about maintaining close relationships over a very long period of time – as we all know !
How can we grow the Dunbar number ?
We 're caught in a bind : community sizes were designed for hunter - gatherer - type societies where people were n't living on top of one another .
Your 150 were scattered over a wide are , but everybody shared the same 150 .
This made for a very densely interconnected community , and this means the community polices itself .
You do n't need lawyers and policemen .
If you step out of line , granny will wag her finger at you .
Our problem now is the sheer density of folk – our networks are n't compact .
You have clumps of friends scattered around the world who do n't know one another : now you do n't have an interwoven network .
It leads to a less well integrated society .
How to re-create that old sense of community in these new circumstances ?
That 's an engineering problem .
How do we work around it ?
The alternative solution , of course , is that we could evolve bigger brains .
But they'd have to be much bigger , and it takes a long time .
What about the role of the web in this ?
Can we manage to have meaningful relationships with more than just the old numbers ?
Yes , I can find out what you had for breakfast from your tweet , but can I really get to know you better ?
These digital developments help us keep in touch , when in the past a relationship might just have died ; but in the end , we actually have to get together to make a relationship work .
In the end , we rely heavily on touch and we still have n't figured out how to do virtual touch .
Maybe once we can do that we will have cracked a big nut .
Words are slippery , a touch is worth a 1,000 words any day .

Formula 1 fans have been promised the most immersive experience ever produced in a grand prix game by Codemasters , the makers of F1 2010 , as the company revealed the first details of its forthcoming multi-platform title - set to be released to the public in September .
During the official reveal of the game in London on Wednesday , the company unveiled its innovative new career system as well as a new dynamic weather aspect and a brand new approach to car handling , in F1 's first true HD simulation to be made available on Xbox 360 , PC and PlayStation 3 .
Based on Codemasters '
Ego physics engine , used to power its successful Grid and Dirt titles , graphically the game already promises to be a step ahead of anything previously seen in F1 consumer simulation .
Using the mantra
' Be the driver , live the life ' , the game 's senior producer Paul Jeal explained that the development team had not focused on specifically building a simulator or an arcade game , but concentrated on creating an " immersive experience that gave the player a deeper , richer experience of what it 's like to be an F1 driver " .
Early code available at the event indicated that the cars ' handling is simple to grasp but hard to master and will allow players to build on their experience and therefore an understanding of where their mistakes had cost them time .
In addition to that the ' Active Track ' system the game employs will deepen the realism significantly and take into account key aspects of race - changing factors such as tyre degradation and flat spots , green to rubbered - in circuits and dynamic weather that will re-calculate the saturation of a wet track every 30 cm .
The detail level is matched during pit stops with all 24 cars featuring motion captured crews , that populate the pits and paddock constantly adding the ' live ' feel of the game .
Off the circuit the realism continues with a comprehensive career system that approaches a Formula 1 season from a driver 's perspective .
Chief game designer Stephen Hood explained : " We wanted to give players a insight into what it feels like to be in the paddock , and take part in some of the things you seen on television but never get to play a part in . "
These things includes interacting with the press , including post - race press conferences , dealing with agents , team engineers and negotiating with rival teams for better drives .
Significant emphasis is also placed on car development and the player is pitted against his team - mate , with success measured by which car receives the latest updates and whether the driver is given further tasks to improve the car .
The player is actively encouraged to win the team 's favour over to their side of the garage .
A multiple - year career also allows players to carry the benefits of this development through to the next season , with the amount of resource available based on previous success .
Codemasters promises to include an in - depth multiplayer system with upwards of 12 players per race , and the game will include all the 2010 drivers and teams .
Download packs are being considered for future release but details were not available at Codesmasters ' event .
The company has already confirmed that the game will not feature safety cars , formation laps or a feeder series .

named parameter default value
How to make named parameters optional by providing a default value in the definition .
ocaml :
For a named parameter to be optional , it must be following by an unnamed parameter in the definition .
This permits the parser to unambiguously determine if the optional parameter has been provided or not .
If the optional parameter is not followed by an unnamed parameter in the definition , then named parameter is not optional .

keywords used to define types by language pascal c c++ ocaml scala haskell type synonym type typedef typedef type type type sum type type enum or union type abstract class data tuple product type type data record product type record struct struct or class type … of class data
Examples of algebraic sum types are the enumerated type of Pascal and the enum of C .
The definition of the type lists a set of values which variables which have the type can contain .
The values are called variants .
The enumerated type of Pascal and the enum of C are implemented as integers , and one can recover the underlying integer value associated with each variant .
In Pascal one uses the ord function to do this .
One can use the equality test operator to determine whether two variables hold the same variant .
One can also use the less than ( <) operator to determine if a variable holds a variant which occurs earlier in the type definition list than another .
An enumerated type is thus similar to defining a sequence of integer constants like this :
typedef int month ; const month JANUARY = 1 ; const month FEBRUARY = 2 ; . . . const month DECEMBER = 12 ;
An enumerated type gives the compiler the ability to ensure that only variants listed in the type definition list are actually stored in variables with the enumerated type however .
BETTER EXPLANATION AND MOTIVATION OF UNARY TYPES .
OTHER THAN VARIANTS : UNIT .
ARE
UNARY TYPES USEFUL ?
Algebraic sum types are more general than enumerated types , because the variants are not restricted to being unary types .
By a unary type we mean a type whose variables can only contain a single value .
EXAMPLE OF SUCH AND ALGEBRAIC SUM TYPE .
Because of this generality , one cannot assume that a general algebraic sum type variant has an integer representation .
Some languages nevertheless define an order on the variants .
SUM TYPE : NUMBER OF VALUES IS THE SUM OF THE VALUES OF EACH OF THE VARIANTS
C UNION TYPE AS ALGEBRAIC SUM TYPE
Examples of algebraic product types are the record of Pascal and the struct of C .
An algebraic product type wraps several values into a single " super " value .
The components of an algebraic product type are called fields , and each has a type which constrains the values which can be stored in it .
The type of each field is normally a pre-existing type , but see the note on recursive types below .
To extract a field from a product value , each field must be identified .
In the case of the Pascal and the C struct the fields are given names .
Product types can also be defined in which the fields are identified by position like a tuple .
OCaml and Haskell support both types of product type .
Since OCaml and Haskell have both tuples and tuple product types , it is worthwhile to consider the differences .
One could represent represent coordinates on plane with a simple pair tuple with this type :
( float , float )
However , all 2 - tuples in which the components are both floats are the same type .
With tuple product types , we could define two distinct types :
type cartesian = Cartestion of float * float ; type polar =
Polar of float * float ;
The compiler will now prevent us from using cartesian coordinates in a place where polar coordinates are expected .
It is also instructive to consider the difference between a type synonym and a product type with a single field .
In the former case the two types are interchangeable .
Type synonyms are useful as a shorthand for a long type , such as a 10 - tuple or a function type .
Functions which operate on variables of the original type will also operate on variables with the type synonym .
In fact , it should be noted that type synonyms do n't create a constructor , so the constructor for the original type must be used .
A product type with a single field creates a new type and provides a constructor for it which accepts the original type as an argument .
Functions which take the original type as an argument cannot be used on the new type .
COMBINED ALGEBRAIC TYPES .
Algebraic product types first appeared in 1966 in Algol W. Algol W extended Algol 60 by adding a record type .
The idea was due to Niklaus Wirth and C. A. R. Hoare .
Pascal , which appeared in 1970 , had both a record type and an enumerated type as already noted , and the Pascal enumerated type seems to be the first example of a type that could be called an algebraic sum type .
Algebraic types first appeared in their full generality in the programming language called Hope , circa 1980 .
Algebraic types were soon borrowed into ML .
Hope introduced the terms algebraic data type , product type , and sum type .
It also introduced pattern matching .

FARR WEST --
A suspicious substance discovered at an Internal Revenue Service building in Farr West Monday morning severely disrupted operations , but turned out to be non-hazardous .
That 's what the U.S. Postal Inspection Service said after a hazmat response that lasted several hours .
The FBI has released very little information and no details on the substance .
The U.S. Postal Inspection Service called it " non-hazardous , " but two people left the building on stretchers .
A worker told KSL News the building went to " code yellow , " and for the first time in his employment , they had to call in hazmat to resolve the incident .
He said a " code yellow " means all employees must remain in the building because of possible contamination .
Shortly before noon , the FBI responded to the possible hazardous material threat at the IRS building at 1973 N. Rulon White Blvd .
The Weber County Fire Department and the Weber County Sheriff 's Office also responded .
The FBI said it isolated the area and cleared out workers .
Holly Williams lives in the area and heard many sirens .
She did not even know there was an IRS building in the industrial park .
" It 's scary to know that we live that close , and it 's maybe a target area , " she said .
Chopper 5 shot video of emergency crews wheeling at least two people out of the building on stretchers , bundled up in protective bags .
In a statement Monday afternoon , the FBI said : " Some individuals did suffer medical emergencies which , at this time , do not appear to be related to this incident .
The investigation continues and no further details can be released . "
A county fire official said two people who already had medical issues happened to have episodes while crews were there .
An employee who did not want to be identified heard that at least three people had seizures .
He said , one woman had a previous history of seizures ; another did not .
He said " code yellows " are uncommon , but in the past have been handled without outside help .
This incident happens less than two weeks after a man furious at the IRS crashed his small plane into an office building housing federal tax employees in Austin , Texas .
That crash and fire killed one and injured dozens .
The worker told us about 300 people work in that area of the building receiving and processing mail for the IRS .
We have no updates on the people who were taken from the building .

A New York theatre company has put off plans to stage a play about an American activist killed by an Israeli bulldozer in Gaza because of the current " political climate " - a decision the play 's British director , Alan Rickman , denounced yesterday as " censorship " .
James Nicola , the artistic director of the New York Theatre Workshop , said it had never formally announced it would be staging the play , My Name is Rachel Corrie , but it had been considering staging it in March .
" In our pre-production planning and our talking around and listening in our communities in New York , what we heard was that after Ariel Sharon 's illness and the election of Hamas , we had a very edgy situation , " Mr Nicola said .
" We found that our plan to present a work of art would be seen as us taking a stand in a political conflict , that we did n't want to take . "
He said he had suggested a postponement until next year .
Mr Rickman , best known for his film acting roles in Love , Actually and the Harry Potter series and who directed the play at London 's Royal Court Theatre , denounced the decision .
" I can only guess at the pressures of funding an independent theatre company in New York , but calling this production " postponed " does not disguise the fact that it has been cancelled , " Mr Rickman said in a statement .
" This is censorship born out of fear , and the New York Theatre Workshop , the Royal Court , New York audiences - all of us are the losers . "
Rachel Corrie was a 23 - year - old activist from Washington state crushed in March 2003 when she put herself between an Israeli army bulldozer and a Palestinian home it was about to demolish in Rafah , on the Egyptian border .
The International Solidarity Movement , of which she was a member , claimed the bulldozer driver ran her over deliberately .
The Israeli Defence Forces said it was an accident , and that she was killed by falling debris .
The Israeli government said the demolitions were aimed at creating a " security zone " along the border .
The Palestinians say they are a form of collective punishment .
" Rachel Corrie lived in nobody 's pocket but her own .
Whether one is sympathetic with her or not , her voice is like a clarion in the fog and should be heard , " Mr Rickman said .
My Name is Rachel Corrie consists of her diary entries and emails home , edited by Mr Rickman and Katharine Viner , features editor of The Guardian .
It won the best new play prize at this year 's Theatregoers ' Choice Awards in London .

Sunday Seasoning # 16
Every week we select a photo from the Londonist Flickr pool , taken in the last seven days , that illustrates this season or time of year in London .
This week , an Olympic - sized storm is brewing in Stratford , shot by Scott Cadman .
Scott Baio has had some issues of late .
He 's mad .
Mad at liberals , mad at uninformed fans , and really mad at the Internet .
Crazy mad .
But a recent history of Baio 's insanity reveals that his fall was all but inevitable .

The warning signs were everywhere , be it according to the all - too - common fate of fallen stars , or Baio 's uncomfortable reality show .
But his Internet meltdown started gaining momentum on October 27 , 2009 .
This was when we first took note of Scott Baio 's interesting Twitter contributions .
Granted , back in these early days , Scott was less of an angry guy and more the type to remind pro-choicers to be kind to their mothers .

Harmless !
But by October 30 , Baio 's gentle reminders quickly morphed into incoherent anger .

Baio had calmed down on November 9 , choosing instead to redirect his energies towards his speciality : international border control .

Scott Baio , however , is not just a man of rage , and he had moments of sensitivity .

In January , however , Baio marked the new year by a return to his natural state : Not Awesome .
He tweeted this picture of Michelle Obama with some intelligent commentary :

Shortly thereafter , on January 20 , Baio — under fire for being , you know , totally cruel — explained himself :
His ( wife 's ) best friend is black !

The next day ( January 21 ) , Baio continued to go on the defensive — while also noting that it was everyone else 's fault for getting upset about his comments .

See what he did there ?
He 's like the Sun - Tzu of Twitter .
Then things were quiet ( relatively speaking ) for a few months .
We decided to look away : move along , people , nothing to see here .
That is , until April 7th , when Baio got very upset at the Twitterverse for not realizing that he 's more than an 80s acting legend — he 's a director .
In fact , he directed 41 episodes of Charles in Charge .
Show the man some respect .

On April 12 , he stuck it to the tax man — and all you lazy , poor people .

On April 16 , Baio — mad as hell and not going to take it anymore — reminded us ladies that " the broom and the dustpan are in the closet . "
He did this in Italian , because why not ?

Then , this past weekend , Scott 's wife Renee joined the party on Facebook , coming to her husband 's defense by dropping some poignant homophobia :

Yesterday , April 19 , we posted Renee 's contribution — and she responded in kind , resorting to a defensive tactic similar to that preferred by her husband :

That same day , the website Scott Baio Ruins Everything was born .
Baio also entered the the Urban Dictionary canon .

Meanwhile , Renee was getting all First Amendment on us , claiming that Jezebel was n't allowing comments from anyone who defended her husband .

Mr. Holder , if you 're reading ( and we 're sure you are , as you totally have time for this stuff ) , please note :
This is untrue .
There are no unapproved comments in our system pertaining to this matter .

Since then , ABC News has picked up on Baio's " bizarre blog war " ( and indeed it is ! ) ; the Huffington Post is also covering the " anti-lesbian rant " , as is Newser and E !.
Renee , for her part , is responding to Facebook messages with threats to our publisher .

Meanwhile , Scott 's blocked a good handful of the Jezebel staff from his Twitter feed , but he 's still got thoughts that he wants to share .

Also , he 'll get his revenge yet .

By using a novel prototype drug , researchers have discovered more about the mechanisms underlying female sexual arousal .
These findings are published today in the British Journal of Pharmacology .
A team of researchers based at Pfizer 's labs in Sandwich , Kent , found that electrically stimulating the pelvic nerve increases blood flow to the genitalia , and that this effect was enhanced if they also gave a prototype drug ( UK - 414,495 ) .
They believe that the drug acts by blocking the breakdown of an internal chemical messenger that plays a key role in increasing blood flow during sexual arousal .
When women become aroused , blood flow increases to the vagina , labia and clitoris .
This causes the organs to swell , and the vagina to relax , as well as increasing vaginal lubrication and the sensitivity of the genitalia .
Female sexual arousal disorder ( FSAD ) affects up to 40 % of women irrespective of age .
These women find that their genital organs do not respond to sexual stimulation , they find arousal difficult and this causes them to become distressed .
" Before this work , we knew surprisingly little about the processes that control all of these changes , " says the lead researcher in the project Chris Wayman .
" Now we are beginning to establish the pathways involved in sexual arousal scientists may be able to find ways of helping women who would like to overcome FSAD . "
This is early stage research involving experimental studies using an animal model of sexual arousal .
In it researchers stimulated the pelvic nerve and measured changes in genital organs .
They believed the genital arousal occurred because stimulation of the nerve triggered the release of vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) , a well - known neurotransmitter .
VIP has only a short - lived effect , because it is soon broken down by an enzyme called Neutral Endopeptidase ( NEP ) .
The researchers believe that their prototype drug increased the arousal because it blocked NEP 's ability to break down VIP , therefore letting the VIP have a more powerful and prolonged effect increasing arousal .
The results look all the more exciting because , while the drug did increase the level of sexual arousal , it did n't affect arousal in the absence of stimulation or the rest of the body 's cardiovascular system .
This suggests that this sort of drug would have a good chance of being safe to use in women , and would only work when combined with sexual stimulation .
" While the particular chemical compound studied in this research did not prove appropriate for further development , the implications of the research could lead to the development of a product in future , although Pfizer has no current plans to develop medicines for FSAD , " added Wayman .

The most pernicious lie in politics is that the press is a democratising force .
Journalists congratulate themselves for promoting democracy even as they seek to shut it down .
Witness the frantic campaigns in the Mail , Telegraph , Sun and Express to crush Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats .
He 's no firebrand , but the rightwing press knows the Lib Dems would introduce proportional representation and a fairer party funding system .
The press barons would no longer be able to push an unrepresentative party into office or easily manipulate it once it 's there .
The liberal press claims to provide an antidote to these powers , but it still allows them to frame the question .
It is obsessed by Westminster politics and the narrow range of issues that divide the two main parties , while neglecting both the external forces that limit political choice and the grassroots movements that seek to confront them .
The true home of most political coverage is the gossip column .
The media 's monopoly on debate kept the political doors locked .
New technologies are blowing them open .
Politics , like the media , has just gone plural .
The public assault on the corrupt old powers , made possible by the internet and mobile phones , is a raw , uncertain movement .
It ebbs and flows , launches new adventures then soon loses interest .
This reflects the wider public mood : we do n't have our forebears ' patience for politics .
Gone is the stubborn loyalty to parties and leaders , which guaranteed corruption and complacency .
Gone too is the sustained mobilisation without which the old order can't be dislodged .
The party machines that crushed initiative and bullied dissenters are crumbling .
So is the sense of shared purpose required to confront wealth and power .
Somehow we must build a movement that sticks around but remains exciting : a 30 - year mobilisation that can survive the 30 - second culture .
There is no shortage of initiatives .
I have come across three campaigns , Hang 'em , Vote for a Change and Progressive Parliament , which have the same aim – to help people vote strategically for a hung parliament – and almost identical tactics .
Three others – Power 2010 , 38 degrees and Blank Vote – are pursuing similar reforms .
For the most part they do n't acknowledge each other 's existence , let alone seek to join forces : how many times does this wheel have to be invented ?
But despite these familiar failings , they could , if they stick with it , inflict grave damage .
Hang 'em , for example , asks its followers to vote for candidates who belong to a smaller party or have a record of defying their party machines and have a realistic chance of winning .
You might have to swallow hard , but if a hung parliament introduces a fair system of proportional representation , this will be the last tactical vote you 'll ever have to cast .
The Liberal Democrats , who have the most to gain from a hung parliament , have boneheadedly failed to grasp this opportunity .
Instead of supporting Hang 'em 's proposal for a single list of Lib Dems , Greens , nationalists and independents , they 're campaigning against plausible candidates from the smaller parties , even where the Lib Dems have no hope of winning .
If , for instance , they urged their supporters to vote Green in Brighton Pavilion , Caroline Lucas would clean up .
His failure to recognise his party 's wider interests suggests that Clegg is no better than Brown and Cameron at seeing how politics has changed .
Of the other grassroots campaigns , two stand out .
Power 2010 is a demonstration in two senses : a demonstration against the old politics , and a demonstration of how it could be reformed .
It asked the public to make suggestions for changing politics in this country , ran a two - day public convention to pare down the ideas , and then asked people to vote for the five best policies .
The voters chose a proportional voting system , scrapping ID cards , an elected second chamber , allowing only English MPs to vote on English laws and a written constitution .
The democratic process Power 2010 used to create its manifesto grants it , when it lobbies candidates for these reforms , a moral authority the parties do n't possess .
Even more interesting is the issue - based campaign , Give Your Vote .
It makes the point that key political concerns do n't stop at national borders .
Life in poorer nations is often dominated by decisions made elsewhere .
The UK , Give Your Vote argues , has particular influence in Afghanistan , Bangladesh and Ghana .
We are fighting a war ostensibly for the good of Afghanistan but without the consent of its people .
Climate change means that decisions made in the UK , the world 's seventh - biggest carbon emitter , rip through Bangladesh ; but Bangladeshis are not consulted .
Trade liberalisation imposed on Ghana by the IMF and the World Bank has kept its people in poverty .
Yet Ghana has no significant voice in these bodies : they are controlled by rich nations such as the US and UK .
Give Your Vote helps citizens in those countries to question candidates here .
Having got their answers , they decide who they want to elect and text their decision ( via a local number ) to someone in the UK who has pledged to vote in our general election on their behalf .
Afghans , Bangladeshis and Ghanaians will be casting their votes this Friday in the world 's first cross - border election .
This is a small sample of tactics used by grassroots movements to promote neglected issues and change the political system here .
It is the beginning of a new politics , in which party loyalties are breaking down and elections could be fought over issues , not identities .
It threatens to curb the excessive powers of the press , party fixers and prime minister .
Alternatively , if it remains fickle and fragmented , it will disappear on 7 May and have to be invented all over again at the next election .
There 's a good chance that this election will produce a wildly unrepresentative outcome : a majority of the seats won by a party with a minority of the vote .
If this happens , the new movements will face their first major test .
If they are serious about confronting power , they will come together ; perhaps to create a British colour revolution .
I suggest ginger – its purpose would be to ginger up British politics , while the campaigns that formed it would function as ginger groups : vanguards seeking to radicalise wider constituencies .
If they are not serious , they will let the moment pass ; yet another puff of public anger that dissipates without result .
So I challenge the campaigns I 've mentioned – and the 400 others doubtless lurking in cyberspace – to prove the cynics wrong this week by contacting each other and deciding what to do in the event of an unfair outcome , then publishing a brief joint plan for a colour revolution before the election .
Then we will know that these movements mean business and can put their divisions aside .
In the weeks following this election , if we channel our anger into these campaigns , we could break our rotten system .
Alternatively , we could roll our eyes , grumble that politicians are all as bad as each other and , once again , turn in on ourselves .
Which is it to be ?

Fewer than 2,000 people reside in the mountain town of Nederland , Colorado — located west of Boulder .
Nonetheless , Tuesday ’s ‘ small town ’ vote in favor of a local ordinance eliminating all criminal and civil penalties for the adult personal use of marijuana is no doubt representative of the rising tide of national popular opinion in favor of cannabis legalization .
For the record , Nederland is the third Colorado city in recent memory to vote to remove marijuana possession penalties — following Breckenridge in 2009 and Denver ( 2007 and 2005 ) — and it most certainly wo n’t be the last .
Nederland votes to remove penalties for marijuana
via Fox News
NEDERLAND , COLO . — Voters in the town of Nederland voted on Tuesday and approved a ballot measure that removed all local penalties for private adult marijuana possession , making the mountain town the third Colorado locality to legalize marijuana in the past five years .
Denver voters adopted a citizen - initiative to do so in November 2005 , and voters in Breckenridge approved a similar measure in November 2009 .
More than 54 percent of Nederland voters supported the measure in what Town Clerk Christi Icenogle said was a high turn - out election .
Voters also ousted incumbent Mayor Martin Cheshes , who had vocally opposed the measure and referred to it as “ foolish , ” replacing him with Trustee Sumaya Abu - Haidar .
Prior to the announcement of the vote , the Boulder District Attorney Stan Garnett told The Daily Camera : “ I ’ll pay attention if it passes .
Marijuana enforcement is a sensitive issue , and it ’s important to gauge public sentiment . ”
… Durango , which voted largely in support of the statewide initiative to legalize marijuana in 2006 , will likely to vote on a similar local marijuana legalization initiative this November .
A recent poll of likely Colorado voters found that 50 percent now support making marijuana legal for adults and regulating it like alcohol .
Phoenix , Arizona ( CNN ) -- Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed a bill Friday that requires police in her state to determine whether a person is in the United States legally , which critics say will foster racial profiling but supporters say will crack down on illegal immigration .
The bill requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect that they 're in the United States illegally .
It also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them .
The Republican governor also issued an executive order that requires additional training for local officers on how to implement the law without engaging in racial profiling or discrimination .
" This training will include what does and does not constitute reasonable suspicion that a person is not legally present in the United States , " Brewer said after signing the bill .
" Racial profiling is illegal .
It is illegal in America , and it 's certainly illegal in Arizona , " Brewer said .
The rules , to be established in by the Arizona Peace Officers Standards and Training Board , are due back to her in May .
The law goes into effect 90 days after the close of the legislative session , which has not been determined .
What will Arizona 's immigration law do ?
Previously , officers could check someone 's immigration status only if that person was suspected in another crime .
Brewer 's executive order was in response to critics who argue that the new law will lead to racial profiling , saying that most police officers do n't have enough training to look past race while investigating a person 's legal status .
" As committed as I am to protecting our state from crime associated with illegal immigration , I am equally committed to holding law enforcement accountable should this stature ever be misused to violate an individual 's rights , " Brewer said .
She added that the law would probably be challenged in courts and that there are those outside Arizona who have an interest in seeing the state fail with the new measure .
" We can not give them that chance .
We must use this new tool wisely and fight for our safety with the honor Arizona deserves . "
The bill is considered to be among the toughest immigration measures in the nation .
Supporters say the measure is needed to fill a void left by the federal government 's failure to enforce its immigration laws .
Read the full text of Arizona Senate Bill 1070 ( PDF )
Its leading sponsor , state Sen. Russell Pearce , said this week , " Illegal is not a race ; it 's a crime . "
" We 're going to take the handcuffs off of law enforcement .
We 're going to put them on the bad guy , " said Pearce , a Republican .
Fellow Republican state Sen. Frank Antenori said the biggest reason he supported the bill was because a rancher in one of the counties he represents was murdered by someone who crossed the U.S. border with Mexico illegally .
He said the person of interest in the killing had crossed the border numerous times and cited other similar violent crimes .
" The citizens of this state are tired of the catch and release that is going on by the federal government where they grab people , they process them , and they take them back and drop them on the other side of the border , " Antenori said .
" They just come back , and we have no border security down here . "
After the signing , the Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police , which had opposed the measure , issued a statement saying , " law enforcement professionals in the State of Arizona will enforce the provisions of the new law to the best of their abilities . "
The state 's largest police union , the Arizona Police Association , is in favor of the law .
In the hours leading up to the bill 's signing , about 2,000 people rallied at the Arizona capital , and President Barack Obama , in the nation 's capital , called the legislation " misguided " but said the federal government must act on the immigration issue .
Read excerpts from remarks Friday by Obama and Brewer
" Our failure to act responsible at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others .
That includes , for example , the recent efforts in Arizona , which threaten to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans , as well as the trust between police and their communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe , " the president said at a naturalization ceremony for 24 members of the military .
Brewer 's counterpart in neighboring New Mexico , Gov. Bill Richardson , called the new law " a terrible piece of legislation . "
" It 's against the democratic ideals of this country , " he told CNN's " Situation Room . "
" It 's a step backwards .
It 's impractical . "
He said the law would not combat the problem of illegal immigration or take the place of comprehensive reform .
i Report : Share your thoughts on immigration policy
Latino members of Congress also slammed the bill .
" When you institutionalize a law like this one , you are targeting and discriminating at a wholesale level against a group of people , " Rep. Raul Grijalva , D - Arizona , said Tuesday .
Grijalva closed his two district offices Friday when an unidentified caller threatened to blow up his Tucson office and kill his staff members .
The caller also said he was going to be " exercising my civil liberties , and I 'm shooting Mexicans at the border , " according to Grijalva 's district director , Ruben Reyes , who fielded one of the calls .
Grijalva and Rep. Luis Gutierrez , chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Task Force on Immigration Reform , had called on Brewer to veto the measure .
Gutierrez is a leading supporter of a proposed overhaul of U.S. immigration laws and said the Arizona issue shows why an overhaul is necessary .
He has urged Obama to " put his back into the push " and to let Arizona know that federal law trumps state legislation on immigration .
Challenges expected - Coverage from CNN affiliate KPHO
The Virginia - based Hispanic Leadership
Fund also criticized the law , saying in a written statement , " Having to ' carry your papers ' is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes -- not of the Constitutional Republic that our Founding Fathers wisely passed on to us .
Arizonans and all Americans deserve an immigration system that works , not a draconian big government desecration of the Bill of Rights . "
Brewer said that " decades of federal inaction and misguided policies " have created " a dangerous and unacceptable situation . "
The governor said Arizona 's law mirrors federal statutes on immigration enforcement , " despite the erroneous and misleading statements suggesting otherwise . "
Asked what criteria will be used to establish reasonable suspicion of someone 's legal status , Brewer said , " I do n't know .
I do not know what an illegal immigrant looks like . "
However , she added , her executive order requires the Arizona Peace Officers Standards and Training Board to address the issue .
" I know that if AZPOST gets [ itself ] together , works on this law , puts down the description , that the law will be enforced civilly , fairly and without discriminatory points to it . "
The foam insulators are still going great guns – spray guns , that is – at Sheep Dog Hollow , our green renovation experiment .
And as I mentioned in my most recent post , it ’s a sign that the renovation is winding down .
Once the insulation is done , then it ’s on to sheet - rocking , painting , trimming , and getting all of the bathroom , kitchen , and lighting fixtures installed .
It ’s almost done !
OK , OK , maybe may not quite “ almost done ” but we ’re further along than I expected .
So , I ’m looking to the future – the electrical future .
Since we ’ve installed a geothermal system , we plan on using it for a year or so to get a sense of how many kilowatts we ’ll use on a regular basis .
Then we ’ll decide on what kind of green supplemental electrical power we ’ll use .
I ’ve looked into solar as a viable alternative and am now exploring wind .
What has become quite evident is that anyone serious about wind in New England needs to be a self - starter – more so than if one lived in , say , Iowa or Texas .
That ’s because wind energy and its state of development is dependent , like almost every other green technology , on the weather , geography , and mindset of a region .
In places with abundant breezes and an experimental mindset – say , California – wind has been a viable option for the past few decades .
This Department of Energy website , Wind Powering America , has an informative time - elapse map that shows where and when wind began generating noticeable amounts of electricity in the past decade .
It took me a while to figure the site out , but click on this link and patiently wait for the animation to go through a 10 - year cycle , and you ’ll see where wind has taken wing , as it were .
Many of those states have fairly sophisticated wind energy programs , including university - based systems to rent out anemometers , which are used to estimate wind speeds .
An anemometer , by the way , is a device that measures wind speed and its potential to turn that energy into power .
It is crucial to determining whether your property is appropriate for wind power .
Unfortunately , Connecticut , a rather more conservative clime where Sheep Dog Hollow resides , is not one the states that offer a state - of - the - art anemometer loan program to help homeowners understand if they could benefit from wind power .
When I Googled “ windpower New England ” I came across several companies , but each one I called had the same advice :
Get ready to investigate and then , do battle .
What that entails will be the subject of my next blog post .

Frandroid is reporting that a new ROM is in the works which will give Tattoo owners the much anticipated Android 2.1 update .
Kindly note we understand that now that a phone running Android OS 2.1 is available that you are excited to get an update for your Tattoo .
We are still working hard to building Sense for this new version but we expect to have the upgrade finished and ready to go soon .
Please understand that it takes time to customize any Android version to ensure you have the intuitive experience Sense provides , and we hope you can be patient for just a little while longer .
Since the HTC Tattoo is note sold here in the U.S. market , we do n’t have a real grasp on how well the handset is selling .
We would find it hard to believe that the Tattoo is more popular than the HTC Magic even with its lower price and interchangeable face / back plates .
We ’re still hoping to hear something from HTC in regards to the Magic and the Dream , but at what point does out hope turn into a delusion ?

With HP ’s $ 1.2 billion planned acquisition of Palm ( s palm ) , the computer giant hopes to turn Palm ’s webOS operating system into a platform to rival Apple ’s ( s aapl ) mobile computing franchise .
“ Ultimately the Palm webOS and Apple are the two that can scale best over multiple devices and we are going to compete with Apple going forward in the broader mobile category , ” said Brian Humphries , SVP of corporate strategy and development at HP ( s hpq ) .
I spoke with Humphries last night after the deal was announced , but he declined repeatedly to give details as to when or what devices may get webOS .
So we have no idea if the HP Slate that Steve Ballmer , the CEO of Microsoft ( s msft ) , was waving about at CES will continue to have Windows or webOS , but we do know that HP has a big vision for webOS — it hopes to put it across an array of mobile devices , creating a platform backed by the power of HP ’s sales and distribution channels to which developers will flock .
A huge portion of HP ’s message around this deal is aimed at reassuring developers that webOS is n’t a dying platform and that HP is willing to invest .
Humphries was adamant that developers will find a supportive HP ( GigaOM Pro , sub req ’d ) .
“ We ’re clearly giving them dev tools , a platform they can port to , an easy financial model that ’s viable to them and confidence that the OS will be scaled globally and on many different form factors , ” Humphries said .
It ’s clear that HP is modeling its mobile computing vision on Apple ’s ( s aapl ) platform , and when I asked how many mobile operating systems the world has room for , Humphries hedged for a bit saying the market is large and that it was difficult to see how things might develop , however when pressed he said that only webOS and Apple really have the ability to scale across many devices and many markets .
As for HP ’s willingness to be more open than Apple , perhaps taking a page from its personal computing heritage , it does n’t look good .
“ Apple is proprietary but it also has a tremendous relationship with the app developer , ” Humphries said .
“ And it may have a closed OS on which the app community can sit , but the apps make it open . ”
Republican critics are continuing to pummel health care reform .
Their newest charge is that the elimination of one generous tax deduction for retiree benefits would take such a bite out of corporate profits that companies may have to cut back on hiring , drop that retiree benefit , and shift added costs onto the taxpayer .
What is really going on ?
It is true that , starting in 2013 , the new law eliminates a corporate tax advantage on retiree drug benefits that amounts to double - dipping .
It is also true that accounting rules require that the present value of the entire additional tax that companies will have to pay over the next several decades be put on the books now .
That led AT&T to declare a charge of about $ 1 billion in the first quarter of 2010 and Verizon to declare $ 970 million .
Those look like staggering amounts until one understands that they do n’t require any immediate cash payments and that the added taxes will be paid out slowly  over perhaps 30 , 40 or more years , depending on a company ’s retiree plan .

Via : Scientific American :
It is because I have such high hopes for neuroscience that I ’m so upset by two trends in financing of the field .
One involves neuroscience ’s growing dependence on the Pentagon , which is seeking new ways to help our soldiers and harm our enemies .
For a still - timely overview of neuroweapons research , check out the 2006 book Mind Wars by bioethicist Jonathan Moreno of the University of Pennsylvania .
( PR disclosure : I brought Moreno to my school to give a talk on March 10 . )
Potential neuroweapons include drugs , transcranial magnetic stimulators and implanted brain chips that soup up the sensory capacities and memories of soldiers , as well as brain - scanners and electromagnetic beams that read , control or scramble the thoughts of bad guys .
When Moreno was writing his book , neuroscientists were reluctant to talk about their affair with the Pentagon and seemed embarrassed by it .
No longer .
Last year the National Academy of Sciences published a 136 - page report , Opportunities in Neuroscience for Future Army Applications , that makes an unabashed pitch for militarizing brain research .
The authors include the neuroluminaries Floyd Bloom of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla , Calif. , past president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and editor - in - chief of Science ; and Michael Gazzaniga of the University of California at Santa Barbara .
Both are members of the U.S. Council on Bioethics .
Here are some ethical questions :
Will the militarization of neuroscience really make the world safer , or just trigger a new arms race ?
Have researchers considered how non-Americans are likely to perceive our neuroweapons program ?
Some neuroscientists dismiss bionic warriors as a sci- fi fantasy unlikely to be realized soon , if ever .
But then should researchers exploit the U.S. military ’s gullibility ?
I appreciate your respect for my ownership of my work .

To emancipate all slaves born after passing the act .
The bill reported by the revisors does not itself contain this proposition ; but an amendment containing it was prepared , to be offered to the legislature whenever the bill should be taken up , and further directing , that they should continue with their parents to a certain age , then be brought up , at the public expence , to tillage , arts or sciences , according to their geniusses , till the females should be eighteen , and the males twenty - one years of age , when they should be colonized to such place as the circumstances of the time should render most proper , sending them out with arms , implements of houshold and of the handicraft arts , seeds , pairs of the useful domestic animals , &c. to declare them a free and independant people , and extend to them our alliance and protection , till they shall have acquired strength ; and to send vessels at the same time to other parts of the world for an equal number of white inhabitants ; to induce whom to migrate hither , proper encouragements were to be proposed .
It will probably be asked , Why not retain and incorporate the blacks into the state , and thus save the expence of supplying , by importation of white settlers , the vacancies they will leave ?
Deep rooted prejudices entertained by the whites ; ten thousand recollections , by the blacks , of the injuries they have sustained ; new provocations ; the real distinctions which nature has made ; and many other circumstances , will divide us into parties , and produce convulsions which will probably never end but in the extermination of the one or the other race .
-- To these objections , which are political , may be added others , which are physical and moral .
The first difference which strikes us is that of colour .
Whether the black of the negro resides in the reticular membrane between the skin and scarf - skin , or in the scarfskin itself ; whether it proceeds from the colour of the blood , the colour of the bile , or from that of some other secretion , the difference is fixed in nature , and is as real as if its seat and cause were better known to us .
And is this difference of no importance ?
Is it not the foundation of a greater or less share of beauty in the two races ?
Are not the fine mixtures of red and white , the expressions of every passion by greater or less suffusions of colour in the one , preferable to that eternal monotony , which reigns in the countenances , that immoveable veil of black which covers all the emotions of the other race ?
Add to these , flowing hair , a more elegant symmetry of form , their own judgment in favour of the whites , declared by their preference of them , as uniformly as is the preference of the Oran - ootan for the black women over those of his own species .
The circumstance of superior beauty , is thought worthy attention in the propagation of our horses , dogs , and other domestic animals ; why not in that of man ?
Besides those of colour , figure , and hair , there are other physical distinctions proving a difference of race .
They have less hair on the face and body .
They secrete less by the kidnies , and more by the glands of the skin , which gives them a very strong and disagreeable odour .
This greater degree of transpiration renders them more tolerant of heat , and less so of cold , than the whites .
Perhaps too a difference of structure in the pulmonary apparatus , which a late ingenious experimentalist has discovered to be the principal regulator of animal heat , may have disabled them from extricating , in the act of inspiration , so much of that fluid from the outer air , or obliged them in expiration , to part with more of it .
They seem to require less sleep .
A black , after hard labour through the day , will be induced by the slightest amusements to sit up till midnight , or later , though knowing he must be out with the first dawn of the morning .
They are at least as brave , and more adventuresome .
But this may perhaps proceed from a want of forethought , which prevents their seeing a danger till it be present .
When present , they do not go through it with more coolness or steadiness than the whites .
They are more ardent after their female : but love seems with them to be more an eager desire , than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation .
Their griefs are transient .
Those numberless afflictions , which render it doubtful whether heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath , are less felt , and sooner forgotten with them .
In general , their existence appears to participate more of sensation than reflection .
To this must be ascribed their disposition to sleep when abstracted from their diversions , and unemployed in labour .
An animal whose body is at rest , and who does not reflect , must be disposed to sleep of course .
Comparing them by their faculties of memory , reason , and imagination , it appears to me , that in memory they are equal to the whites ; in reason much inferior , as I think one could scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of Euclid ; and that in imagination they are dull , tasteless , and anomalous .
It would be unfair to follow them to Africa for this investigation .
We will consider them here , on the same stage with the whites , and where the facts are not apocryphal on which a judgment is to be formed .
It will be right to make great allowances for the difference of condition , of education , of conversation , of the sphere in which they move .
Many millions of them have been brought to , and born in America .
Most of them indeed have been confined to tillage , to their own homes , and their own society : yet many have been so situated , that they might have availed themselves of the conversation of their masters ; many have been brought up to the handicraft arts , and from that circumstance have always been associated with the whites .
Some have been liberally educated , and all have lived in countries where the arts and sciences are cultivated to a considerable degree , and have had before their eyes samples of the best works from abroad .
The Indians , with no advantages of this kind , will often carve figures on their pipes not destitute of design and merit .
They will crayon out an animal , a plant , or a country , so as to prove the existence of a germ in their minds which only wants cultivation .
They astonish you with strokes of the most sublime oratory ; such as prove their reason and sentiment strong , their imagination glowing and elevated .
But never yet could I find that a black had uttered a thought above the level of plain narration ; never see even an elementary trait of painting or sculpture .
In music they are more generally gifted than the whites with accurate ears for tune and time , and they have been found capable of imagining a small catch .
Whether they will be equal to the composition of a more extensive run of melody , or of complicated harmony , is yet to be proved .
Misery is often the parent of the most affecting touches in poetry .-- Among the blacks is misery enough , God knows , but no poetry .
Love is the peculiar oestrum of the poet .
Their love is ardent , but it kindles the senses only , not the imagination .
Religion indeed has produced a Phyllis Whately ; but it could not produce a poet .
The compositions published under her name are below the dignity of criticism .
The heroes of the Dunciad are to her , as Hercules to the author of that poem .
Ignatius Sancho has approached nearer to merit in composition ; yet his letters do more honour to the heart than the head .
They breathe the purest effusions of friendship and general philanthropy , and shew how great a degree of the latter may be compounded with strong religious zeal .
He is often happy in the turn of his compliments , and his stile is easy and familiar , except when he affects a Shandean fabrication of words .
But his imagination is wild and extravagant , escapes incessantly from every restraint of reason and taste , and , in the course of its vagaries , leaves a tract of thought as incoherent and eccentric , as is the course of a meteor through the sky .
His subjects should often have led him to a process of sober reasoning : yet we find him always substituting sentiment for demonstration .
Upon the whole , though we admit him to the first place among those of his own colour who have presented themselves to the public judgment , yet when we compare him with the writers of the race among whom he lived , and particularly with the epistolary class , in which he has taken his own stand , we are compelled to enroll him at the bottom of the column .
This criticism supposes the letters published under his name to be genuine , and to have received amendment from no other hand ; points which would not be of easy investigation .
The improvement of the blacks in body and mind , in the first instance of their mixture with the whites , has been observed by every one , and proves that their inferiority is not the effect merely of their condition of life .
We know that among the Romans , about the Augustan age especially , the condition of their slaves was much more deplorable than that of the blacks on the continent of America .
The two sexes were confined in separate apartments , because to raise a child cost the master more than to buy one .
Cato , for a very restricted indulgence to his slaves in this particular , took from them a certain price .
But in this country the slaves multiply as fast as the free inhabitants .
Their situation and manners place the commerce between the two sexes almost without restraint .
-- The same Cato , on a principle of oeconomy , always sold his sick and superannuated slaves .
He gives it as a standing precept to a master visiting his farm , to sell his old oxen , old waggons , old tools , old and diseased servants , and every thing else become useless .
" Vendat boves vetulos , plaustrum vetus , ferramenta , vetera , servum senem , servum morbosum , & si quid aliud supersit vendat . "
The American slaves cannot enumerate this among the injuries and insults they receive .
It was the common practice to expose in the island of Aesculapius , in the Tyber , diseased slaves , whose cure was like to become tedious .
The Emperor Claudius , by an edict , gave freedom to such of them as should recover , and first declared , that if any person chose to kill rather than to expose them , it should be deemed homicide .
The exposing them is a crime of which no instance has existed with us ; and were it to be followed by death , it would be punished capitally .
We are told of a certain Vedius Pollio , who , in the presence of Augustus , would have given a slave as food to his fish , for having broken a glass .
With the Romans , the regular method of taking the evidence of their slaves was under torture .
Here it has been thought better never to resort to their evidence .
When a master was murdered , all his slaves , in the same house , or within hearing , were condemned to death .
Here punishment falls on the guilty only , and as precise proof is required against him as against a freeman .
Yet notwithstanding these and other discouraging circumstances among the Romans , their slaves were often their rarest artists .
They excelled too in science , insomuch as to be usually employed as tutors to their master 's children .
Epictetus , Diogenes , Phaedon , Terence , and Phaedrus , were slaves .
But they were of the race of whites .
It is not their condition then , but nature , which has produced the distinction .
-- Whether further observation will or will not verify the conjecture , that nature has been less bountiful to them in the endowments of the head , I believe that in those of the heart she will be found to have done them justice .
That disposition to theft with which they have been branded , must be ascribed to their situation , and not to any depravity of the moral sense .
The man , in whose favour no laws of property exist , probably feels himself less bound to respect those made in favour of others .
When arguing for ourselves , we lay it down as a fundamental , that laws , to be just , must give a reciprocation of right : that , without this , they are mere arbitrary rules of conduct , founded in force , and not in conscience : and it is a problem which I give to the master to solve , whether the religious precepts against the violation of property were not framed for him as well as his slave ?
And whether the slave may not as justifiably take a little from one , who has taken all from him , as he may slay one who would slay him ?
That a change in the relations in which a man is placed should change his ideas of moral right and wrong , is neither new , nor peculiar to the colour of the blacks .
Homer tells us it was so 2600 years ago .
( Od. 17 . 323 . )
Jove fix'd it certain , that whatever day
Makes man a slave , takes half his worth away .
But the slaves of which Homer speaks were whites .
Notwithstanding these considerations which must weaken their respect for the laws of property , we find among them numerous instances of the most rigid integrity , and as many as among their better instructed masters , of benevolence , gratitude , and unshaken fidelity .
-- The opinion , that they are inferior in the faculties of reason and imagination , must be hazarded with great diffidence .
To justify a general conclusion , requires many observations , even where the subject may be submitted to the Anatomical knife , to Optical glasses , to analysis by fire , or by solvents .
How much more then where it is a faculty , not a substance , we are examining ; where it eludes the research of all the senses ; where the conditions of its existence are various and variously combined ; where the effects of those which are present or absent bid defiance to calculation ; let me add too , as a circumstance of great tenderness , where our conclusion would degrade a whole race of men from the rank in the scale of beings which their Creator may perhaps have given them .
To our reproach it must be said , that though for a century and a half we have had under our eyes the races of black and of red men , they have never yet been viewed by us as subjects of natural history .
I advance it therefore as a suspicion only , that the blacks , whether originally a distinct race , or made distinct by time and circumstances , are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind .
It is not against experience to suppose , that different species of the same genus , or varieties of the same species , may possess different qualifications .
Will not a lover of natural history then , one who views the gradations in all the races of animals with the eye of philosophy , excuse an effort to keep those in the department of man as distinct as nature has formed them ?
This unfortunate difference of colour , and perhaps of faculty , is a powerful obstacle to the emancipation of these people .
Many of their advocates , while they wish to vindicate the liberty of human nature , are anxious also to preserve its dignity and beauty .
Some of these , embarrassed by the question " What further is to be done with them ? " join themselves in opposition with those who are actuated by sordid avarice only .
Among the Romans emancipation required but one effort .
The slave , when made free , might mix with , without staining the blood of his master .
But with us a second is necessary , unknown to history .
When freed , he is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture .
. . . . .
It is difficult to determine on the standard by which the manners of a nation may be tried , whether catholic , or particular .
It is more difficult for a native to bring to that standard the manners of his own nation , familiarized to him by habit .
There must doubtless be an unhappy influence on the manners of our people produced by the existence of slavery among us .
The whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise of the most boisterous passions , the most unremitting despotism on the one part , and degrading submissions on the other .
Our children see this , and learn to imitate it ; for man is an imitative animal .
This quality is the germ of all education in him .
From his cradle to his grave he is learning to do what he sees others do .
If a parent could find no motive either in his philanthropy or his self - love , for restraining the intemperance of passion towards his slave , it should always be a sufficient one that his child is present .
But generally it is not sufficient .
The parent storms , the child looks on , catches the lineaments of wrath , puts on the same airs in the circle of smaller slaves , gives a loose to his worst of passions , and thus nursed , educated , and daily exercised in tyranny , cannot but be stamped by it with odious peculiarities .
The man must be a prodigy who can retain his manners and morals undepraved by such circumstances .
And with what execration should the statesman be loaded , who permitting one half the citizens thus to trample on the rights of the other , transforms those into despots , and these into enemies , destroys the morals of the one part , and the amor patriae of the other .
For if a slave can have a country in this world , it must be any other in preference to that in which he is born to live and labour for another : in which he must lock up the faculties of his nature , contribute as far as depends on his individual endeavours to the evanishment of the human race , or entail his own miserable condition on the endless generations proceeding from him .
With the morals of the people , their industry also is destroyed .
For in a warm climate , no man will labour for himself who can make another labour for him .
This is so true , that of the proprietors of slaves a very small proportion indeed are ever seen to labour .
And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis , a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God ?
That they are not to be violated but with his wrath ?
Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just : that his justice cannot sleep for ever : that considering numbers , nature and natural means only , a revolution of the wheel of fortune , an exchange of situation , is among possible events : that it may become probable by supernatural interference !
The Almighty has no attribute which can take side with us in such a contest .-- But it is impossible to be temperate and to pursue this subject through the various considerations of policy , of morals , of history natural and civil .
We must be contented to hope they will force their way into every one 's mind .
I think a change already perceptible , since the origin of the present revolution .
The spirit of the master is abating , that of the slave rising from the dust , his condition mollifying , the way I hope preparing , under the auspices of heaven , for a total emancipation , and that this is disposed , in the order of events , to be with the consent of the masters , rather than by their extirpation .

i Ad pits Apple against search and advertising giant Google Apple has shown off some of the 100 new features to be included in the iPhone operating system later this year .
The update includes a mobile advertising platform called iAd that will be used to place adverts in applications made by third parties .
Apple founder Steve Jobs also showcased a long - awaited multi-tasking feature , which will allow users to run more than one program at a time .
The feature is already included in many other smartphones .
iAd marks
Apple 's first foray into a potentially lucrative new market , and pits it directly against Google 's search engine advertising model .
Apple will allow external developers to pocket 60 % of ad revenue from iAd .
The Apple boss said the iPhone OS 4.0 update will be released first for the iPhone and iPod touch , and then the iPad , later this year .
' Ad - sense '
Mr Jobs gave a demonstration of the multi-tasking feature showed the online radio station Pandora running in the background playing music while a user could either read news online or deal with e-mail .
Apple believes advertising inside applications is the future " We were n't the first to this party but we 're going to be the best , " he said .
Some of the other features unveiled at the presentation at Apple 's headquarters in California include being able to create specific folders to store third party applications downloaded from iTunes , enhanced mail , which will gather e-mail from multiple accounts into one " unified " inbox and iBooks , which is already on the iPad .
Mr Jobs said mobile users spend more time inside applications than searching the internet .
Therefore it made sense to have adverts within the applications - or apps as they are commonly known .
" It 's very clear that [ Mr ] Jobs believes that ads in the context of apps makes more sense than generic mobile search , " said Tim Bajarin at consulting company Creative Strategies .
Mobile sales
Apple 's move into mobile advertising was widely expected after it bought Quattro Wireless mobile advertising network for almost $ 300 m ( £ 196 m ) in January .
Multi-tasking is a long awaited feature Analysts say revenue from mobile advertising will jump dramatically this year .
" It has huge potential to really change mobile commerce , " said Van Baker , Vice president of research at Gartner .
" The evidence so far is that very few transactions really happen in this space .
Mobile is used to compare prices , find restaurants , movie times and the like but very little in the way of commerce . "
Apple bought mobile ad company Quattro after failing to buy the market leader AdMob , which was purchased by Google .
In a slight to the search giant , Mr Jobs said " Google came in and snatched them ( AdMob ) because they did n't want us to have them " .
Google 's deal is currently being investigated by US regulators .
i Pad demand During the packed press event , Mr Jobs revealed that to date Apple has sold 50 m iPhones .
That number rises to 85 m when the iPod touch is included .
Mr Jobs also gave an update on the iPad , which went on sale in the US only at the weekend .
It is expected in stores in the UK and part of Europe , as well as Canada and Australia at the end of the month .
Apple said it had sold 450,000 iPads as of 8 April .
Mr Jobs added that 600,000 electronic books and 3.5 m applications had been downloaded for the iPad in the previous five days .
" We 're making them as fast as we can , " Mr Jobs said .
" Evidently we can't make enough of them yet so we are going to have to try harder . "

The transfer of scientific data has emerged as a significant challenge , as datasets continue to grow in size and demand for open access sharing increases .
Current methods for file transfer do not scale well for large files and can cause long transfer times .
In this study we present BioTorrents , a website that allows open access sharing of scientific data and uses the popular BitTorrent peer - to - peer file sharing technology .
BioTorrents allows files to be transferred rapidly due to the sharing of bandwidth across multiple institutions and provides more reliable file transfers due to the built - in error checking of the file sharing technology .
BioTorrents contains multiple features , including keyword searching , category browsing , RSS feeds , torrent comments , and a discussion forum .
BioTorrents is available at http://www.biotorrents.net .
Introduction
The amount of data being produced in the sciences continues to expand at a tremendous rate [ 1 ] .
In parallel , and also at an increasing rate , is the demand to make this data openly available to other researchers , both pre-publication [ 2 ] and post- publication [ 3 ] .
Considerable effort and attention has been given to improving the portability of data by developing data format standards [ 4 ] , minimal information for experiment reporting [ 5 ] –[ 8 ] , data sharing polices [ 9 ] , and data management [ 10 ] – [ 13 ] .
However , the practical aspect of moving data from one location to another has relatively stayed the same ; that being the use of Hypertext Transfer Protocol ( HTTP ) [ 14 ] or File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) [ 15 ] .
These protocols require that a single server be the source of the data and that all requests for data be handled from that single location ( Fig. 1A ) .
In addition , the server of the data has to have a large amount of bandwidth to provide adequate download speeds for all data requests .
Unfortunately , as the number of requests for data increases and the provider 's bandwidth becomes saturated , the access time for each data request can increase rapidly .
Even if bandwidth limitations are very large , these file transfer methods require that the data is centrally stored , making the data inaccessible if the server malfunctions .

Illustration of differences between traditional and peer to peer file transfer protocols .
A ) Traditional file transfer protocols such as HTTP and FTP use a single host for obtaining a dataset ( grey filled black box ) , even though other computers contain the same file or partial copies while downloading ( partially filled black box ) .
This can cause transfers to be slow due to bandwidth limitations or if the host fails .
B )
The peer - to - peer file transfer protocol , BitTorrent , breaks up the dataset into small pieces ( shown as pattern blocks within black box ) , and allows sharing among computers with full copies or partial copies of the dataset .
This allows faster transfer times and decentralization of the data .
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010071.g001
Many different solutions have been proposed to help with many of the challenges of moving large amounts of data .
Bio-Mirror ( http://www.bio-mirror.net/) was started in 1999 and consists of several servers sharing the same identical datasets in various countries .
Bio -mirror improves on download speeds , but requires that the data be replicated across all servers , is restricted to only very popular genomic datasets , and does not include the fast growing datasets such as the Sequence Read Archive ( SRA ) ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).
The Tranche Project ( https://trancheproject.org/) is the software behind the Proteome Commons ( https://proteomecommons.org/) proteomics repository .
The focus of the Tranche Project is to provide a secure repository that can be shared across multiple servers .
Considering that all bandwidth is provided by these dedicated Tranche servers , considerable administration and funding is necessary in order to maintain such a service .
An alternative to these repository - like resources is to use a peer - to - peer file transfer protocol .
These peer - to - peer networks allow the sharing of datasets directly with each other without the need for a central repository to provide the data hosting or bandwidth for downloading .
One of the earliest and most popular peer - to - peer protocols is Gnutella ( http://rfc-gnutella.sourceforge.net/) which is the protocol behind many popular file sharing clients such as LimeWire ( http://www.limewire.com/), Shareaza ( http://shareaza.sourceforge.net/), and BearShare ( http://www.bearshare.com/).
Unfortunately , this protocol was centered on sharing individual files and does scale well for sharing very large files .
In comparison , the BitTorrent protocol [ 16 ] handles large files very well , is actively being developed , and is a very popular method for data transfer .
For example , BitTorrent can be used to transfer data from the Amazon Simple Storage Service ( S3 ) ( http://aws.amazon.com/s3/), is used by Twitter ( http://twitter.com/) as a method to distribute files to a large number of servers ( http://github.com/lg/murder), and for distributing numerous types of media .
The BitTorrent protocol works by first splitting the data into small pieces ( usually 514 Kb to 2 Mb in size ) , allowing the large dataset to be distributed in pieces and downloaded from various sources ( Fig. 1B ) .
A checksum is created for each file piece to verify the integrity of the data being received and these are stored within a small “ torrent ” file .
The torrent file also contains the address of one or more “ trackers ” .
The tracker is responsible for maintaining a list of clients that are currently sharing the torrent , so that clients can make direct connections with other clients to obtain the data .
A BitTorrent software client ( see Table 1 ) uses the data in the torrent file to contact the tracker and allow transferring of the data between computers containing either full or partial copies of the dataset .
Therefore , bandwidth is shared and distributed among all computers in the transaction instead of a single source providing all of the required bandwidth .
The sum of available bandwidth grows as the number of file transfers increases , and thus scales indefinitely .
The end result is faster transfer times , less bandwidth requirements from a single source , and decentralization of the data .
Torrent files have been hosted on numerous websites and in theory scientific data can be currently transferred using any one of these BitTorrent trackers .
However , many of these websites contain materials that violate copyright laws and are prone to being shut down due to copyright infringement .
In addition , the vast majority of data on these trackers is non-science related and makes searching or browsing for legitimate scientific data nearly impossible .
Therefore , to improve upon the open sharing of scientific data we created BioTorrents , a legal BitTorrent tracker that hosts scientific data and software .
WASHINGTON , April 21 ( Reuters ) - A newly designed $ 100 note aims to thwart counterfeiters with advanced security features , top U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve officials said on Wednesday .
The “ new Benjamins ” to be released in February 2011 retain the traditional look of the U.S. currency , with Benjamin Franklin ’s portrait .
They aim to foil counterfeiters with difficult and costly to reproduce features such as a blue three - dimensional security ribbon with alternating images of bells and the number 100 that move and change as the viewing angle is tilted .
The new notes , which cost slightly more to produce , also feature a bell image inside a picture of an inkwell that changes from copper to green when tilted , as well as a large “ 100 ” that does the same .
“ As with previous U.S. currency redesigns , this note incorporates the best technology available to ensure we ’re staying ahead of counterfeiters , ” U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said at a Treasury Department unveiling ceremony .
“ Welcome to the new Benjamins . ”
The $ 100 note is the most often counterfeited denomination of U.S. currency outside the United States due to its broad circulation overseas .
It is the highest - denominated note issued by the Federal Reserve .
The approximately 6.5 billion older design $ 100s already in circulation will remain legal tender after the new notes are released next year .
BEATING THE SUPERNOTE
In recent years , U.S. officials have been trying to combat the continued production of extremely high - quality counterfeit $ 100 notes they say are produced in North Korea , dubbed the “ supernote , ” which are undetectable to nearly all but the most sophisticated currency experts .
The U.S. Secret Service , the agency charged with policing the cash dollar ’s integrity , maintains that less than 1/100th of one percent of the $ 890 billion in physical U.S. currency in circulation is counterfeit .
But Secret Service officials say they still encounter supernotes and other highly sophisticated fakes from overseas .
In the United States , the $ 20 note is the most frequently counterfeited denomination .
The new Benjamins have been in development since 2003 .
The blue security ribbon is woven into the note ’s fabric -- not printed on .
Another security strip , visible to the left of Franklin ’s head when the note is held up to light , is embedded into the fabric .
Like the old note , the new one has a watermark of Franklin ’s portrait , also visible when held up to light .
The old notes will be destroyed and replaced as they pass through the Federal Reserve system .
John Lange , special agent in charge of the Secret Service ’s criminal investigations division , said the features were designed to make it easy for merchants and consumers to verify the $ 100 note ’s authenticity with a quick examination .
“ The best defense against counterfeiters we have is an educated public that can easily authenticate the new $ 100 note , ” Lange said .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said U.S. officials will work to educate people around the world about the new design .
Unlike in the past , when most cash dollars were held domestically , as many as two thirds of Federal Reserve notes now in circulation are outside the United States , he added .

Una c�lula criminal integrada por aproximadamente 10 sujetos sustrajo 37 millones de pesos de la Secretar�a de Finanzas y Administraci�n ( SFA ) .
El inusitado asalto dej� como saldo un polic�a ca�do .
De acuerdo a las primeras versiones , los delincuentes viajaban a bordo de un veh�culo tipo Voyager con placas de circulaci�n de Michoac�n .
Durante la noche de este jueves se registr� una intensa balacera , justo en el momento que un par de unidades de traslado de valores arrib� a la tesorer�a de la SFA - ubicada en la colonia Azc�rate de esta ciudad - para transportar el monto .
La Procuradur�a General de Justicia ( PGJ ) inform� que agentes investigadores de
la Polic�a Ministerial del Estado , as� como del Ministerio P�blico , se constituyeron con inmediatez en el lugar de los hechos .
Pese a iniciarse un operativo a fin de capturar a los responsables , hasta el momento no existe el menor indicio sobre ellos .
La dependencia sostuvo que ser� en las pr�ximas horas cuando el resultado de las diligencias permita abundar detalles sobre la investigaci�n , aunque presuntamente el dinero corresponde a la recaudaci�n de tenencia vehicular 2010 .

" The LHC is on its way again .
First beam of 2010 circulated in each direction by 04.10 CET ( 0310 GMT ) , " said CERN in a tweet on its website on Sunday .
The 3.9 billion euro ( 5.6 billion dollars ) Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) was shut down in December to ready it for collisions at unfathomed energy levels .
It was run for a few weeks after being successfully revived from a 14 month breakdown .
The particle collider -- inside a 27 - kilometre ( 16.8 - mile ) tunnel straddling the Franco - Swiss border near Geneva -- is aimed at understanding the origins of the universe by recreating the conditions that followed the Big Bang .
In the weeks before the technical shutdown in December , the collider achieved over a million particle collisions and accelerated proton beams to energy levels never reached before , according to CERN .
Collisions reached a world record energy level of 2.36 teraelectronvolts ( TeV ) , already allowing scientists to gather data .
But CERN now wants to reach 7.0 TeV to try to recreate conditions close to the Big Bang , and run it at those levels for 18 to 24 months .
Subsequently the scientists aim to reach the LHC 's design energy of 14 TeV , but only following another long technical shutdown in the second half of 2011 .
Before the LHC experiment , no particle accelerator had exceeded 0.98 TeV .
One TeV is the equivalent to the energy of motion achieved by a flying mosquito .
The LHC , a global effort , aims to resolve physics problems including " dark matter " and " dark energy " , thought to account for 96 percent of the cosmos .
The scientists ' Holy Grail is to find a theorised component called the Higgs Boson , commonly called the " God Particle " , which would explain how particles acquire mass .
The experiment , the fruit of decades of experiments and research by physicists from around the world , has even attracted Hollywood in recent years with the fictional blockbuster " Angels and Demons " .

Volcano Hysteria Does the Aviation Industry Share the Blame for the Chaos ?
The shutting down of Europe 's airspace was an overreaction to the volcanic eruption in Iceland .
The ash cloud soon dissipated so that it no longer posed a danger .
Yet the chaos was caused because for years the airlines and manufacturers failed to agree on an efficient warning system .

Easy Egg Cracker Cracks Eggs and Creates Clutter [ uberreview ]
JK Rowling has written a stirring Times editorial rebutting the UK Conservative party 's new kinder , gentler face .
The Tories are trying to shake their reputation as the " nasty party , " and to downplay their commitment to eroding services and projects that encourage social mobility and a decent standard of life for all people , but Rowling is n't buying it :
I had become a single mother when my first marriage split up in 1993 .
In one devastating stroke , I became a hate figure to a certain section of the press , and a bogeyman to the Tory Government .
Peter Lilley , then Secretary of State at the DSS , had recently entertained the Conservative Party conference with a spoof Gilbert and Sullivan number , in which he decried " young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing list " .
The Secretary of State for Wales , John Redwood , castigated single - parent families from St Mellons , Cardiff , as " one of the biggest social problems of our day " .
( John Redwood has since divorced the mother of his children . )
Women like me ( for it is a curious fact that lone male parents are generally portrayed as heroes , whereas women left holding the baby are vilified ) were , according to popular myth , a prime cause of social breakdown , and in it for all we could get : free money , state - funded accommodation , an easy life .
An easy life .
Between 1993 and 1997 I did the job of two parents , qualified and then worked as a secondary school teacher , wrote one and a half novels and did the planning for a further five .
For a while , I was clinically depressed .
To be told , over and over again , that I was feckless , lazy — even immoral — did not help …
Nobody who has ever experienced the reality of poverty could say " it 's not the money , it 's the message " .
When your flat has been broken into , and you cannot afford a locksmith , it is the money .
When you are two pence short of a tin of baked beans , and your child is hungry , it is the money .
When you find yourself contemplating shoplifting to get nappies , it is the money .
If Mr Cameron 's only practical advice to women living in poverty , the sole carers of their children , is " get married , and we 'll give you £ 150 " , he reveals himself to be completely ignorant of their true situation .

My name is Riis – Bjarne Riis ( Image credit : Brecht Decaluwé / Cyclingnews.com ) Image 2 of 3 Fabian Cancellara ( Saxo Bank ) kisses his cobblestone trophy ( Image credit : www.ispaphoto.com)
Image 3 of 3 Paris - Roubaix winner Fabian Cancellara ( Saxo Bank ) ( Image credit : Sirotti )
Saxo Bank team manager Bjarne Riis does n't often show his emotions but even he could n't stop smiling as he watched Fabian Cancellara climb on the podium in the centre of the Roubaix velodrome and lift the winner 's cobblestone prize .
Riis carefully directed Cancellara during the race from the passenger seat of the Saxo Bank team car .
He revealed that he told Cancellara to attack when he did , after noticing that Tom Boonen was too far down the line of riders .
Cancellara trusted his boss , did n't look back and opened up the after - burners , even though there was still 50 kilometres left to race .
Before Boonen even realised what had happened and moved out of the line to look up the road , Cancellara had already opened a gap that would have been impossible for him to close .
" I told him to attack on the radio .
As soon as I saw that Boonen was not on his wheel , I said : ' Now you go ' , " Riis explained .
" A rider like him , when he goes , it 's because he goes to win , not for fun .
I knew it was the right moment and that he was riding to win the race .
Otherwise I 'd have stopped him immediately . "
Pressed by several Belgian journalists , Riis could not resist having a dig at Tom Boonen .
" Boonen is strong but Cancellara is better .
He 's great , " he said with total admiration .
" Boonen made mistakes during the race .
How many ?
Two can be too many .
I think if you want to win this race you have to stay calm , relaxed and not stressed .
Then go when you have to go .
" The problem for the others is that Fabian goes fast , even on his own .
We know that and it's a bonus to have .
We know he can go from far away , too , so we use this as part of our strategy .
Not many riders can do that . "
Hoping for a call from a sponsor
Saxo Bank will end their sponsorship of Riis ' team at the end of the season .
There are rumours that BMC would like to sign Cancellara and the Schleck brothers .
The Schlecks are also reported to be working on creating their own team with a Luxembourg sponsor and former Astana manager Marc Biver .
Riis knows that Cancellara 's success at the Tour of Flanders and Paris - Roubaix , plus the solid performance by the whole team this spring , could help him find a new sponsor and fight off the vultures that are beginning to circle above his team .
His smile widened even more when asked if he was hoping for a phone call this week .
" Well , it 's a good period for us at the moment , " he said .
" If we 're not able to find a sponsor now , it 's going to difficult .
Who does n't want to be a part of this ? "
Our goal , as Cthulhu , is to support initiatives designed to rise from the dark depths of R’lyeh ( metaphorically speaking ! ) and end up destroying or at least disrupting , some market paradigm .
We also strive , in our weak moments , to generate some sort of meaningful “ good ” for humanity ( whom we would like to see at least survive until the day that we , ourselves , rise from those same dark depths to act as the harbinger of mankind ’s final doom ) .
Flat solar photovoltaic panels are becoming more widespread , but the power they produce varies over the course of the day as the sun ’s position changes — unless the panels are mounted on tracking systems to keep them pointed sunward , which adds complexity and expense .
Jeffrey Grossman , the Carl Richard Soderberg Associate Professor of Power Engineering at MIT ’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering ( DMSE ) , was inspired by the way trees spread their leaves to capture sunlight and wondered how efficient a three - dimensional shape covered in solar cells could be , and what its optimal shape would look like .
He worked with a second - year DMSE graduate student , Marco Bernardi , to create a computer program that mimics biological evolution , starting with basic shapes and letting them evolve , changing slightly each time and selecting those that perform best to start the next generation .
He found that such systems could produce relatively constant power throughout the day without the need for tracking , and produce significantly more power overall for a given area — for example two and a half times as much as a flat array when the height equals the length and width .
He is continuing to work on finding the best shapes and teaming up with Professors Vladimir Bulović and David Perreault ( EECS ) to build a prototype system .
The team believes that solar panels based on this concept could be shipped flat and then unfolded at the site to their complex shapes .
These images show some of the varied shapes with improved efficiency that emerged from the evolving simulation .
By integrating itself into Facebook ’s social network , Farmville magnifies a sense of accomplishment because the challenges come from the way that you are perceived by a community , rather than on the whims of an unknown developer .
Laura sez , " Mark Fiore just won a Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning for his animated works appearing on SFGate.com .
I spoke with Fiore about what 's next for him , and he said he'd like to take his freelance shop mobile .
Only problem : Apple denied his iPhone app because it ' ridicules public figures , ' a violation of the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement .
If he can get his app past the Apple satire police , he should be good to go . "
How 's that benevolent dictatorship working out for ya ?
Mark Fiore can win a Pulitzer Prize , but he can't get his iPhone cartoon app past Apple 's satire police

Many people use the internet to find health information Typing your child 's medical problem into Google is unlikely to deliver much in the way of good advice , UK researchers have said .
The Nottingham - based team used the search engine to find UK - based advice on five common issues , including breastfeeding and autism .
Only about 200 of 500 sites offered correct information , Archives of Disease in Childhood reports .
Government - run sites were the only completely reliable source , they found .
It is now estimated that 70 % of UK households have access to the internet , and increasingly , parents are turning to search engines for a second opinion - or even a sole one - on medical matters .
Healthcare professionals should continue to strive to be the main source of information for patients but we should be aware that most will continue to use the internet to gather information
Study researchers
Many doctors , however , are concerned that the huge quantity of information and advice is at best unreliable , and in some cases misleading or even dangerous .
One earlier study looking at advice for children with a fever found only three out of 22 sites visited gave information which matched current " best practice " guidelines .
The researchers from Nottingham University Hospitals NHS
Trust tested this by typing key words from commonly - asked questions into Google , restricting results to UK - based sites only .
The five chosen were " MMR autism " , " HIV breastfeeding " , " mastitis breastfeeding " , " baby sleeping position " and " green vomit " .
They found the quality of advice varied significantly , with half the search results failing to answer the intended question .
In total , 11 % of the 500 results gave inaccurate information , and 39 % gave the right answer .
The most incorrect replies were given to search results about MMR and autism , and HIV and breastfeeding .
News websites were accurate 55 % of the time .
Vaccine sales Particularly poor at answering the question were " sponsored links " which appeared prominently , even though the information they contained was not closely related to the search terms .
In the case of the " MMR / autism " search , many of the sponsored links offered single vaccination as an alternative to MMR .
However , the accuracy of governmental websites such as NHS Direct or NHS Choices meant that they should be recommended more widely by doctors , the researchers said .
" Healthcare professionals should continue to strive to be the main source of information for patients but we should be aware that most will continue to use the internet to gather information , " they wrote in the journal .
" We suggest that in addition to verbal and written information , patients and parents should be signposted to NHS , governmental or other pre-approved websites . "
A spokesman for the Department of Health said NHS Choices was now the most popular health website in the UK , receiving nearly nine million hits a month .
He said : " It offers a range of health information on over 800 treatments and conditions , waiting times and survival rates for elective procedures .
Patients using the site are also able to post feedback on hospitals and GP surgeries . "

Microsoft has confirmed that a rootkit is responsible for the blue screen problems currently occurring with Windows XP following a recent update intended to fix a 17 - year old security vulnerability in the virtual DOS machine .
According to a post on Microsoft's Security Response Center blog , all of the affected systems were infected with the Alureon rootkit .
The company says that the rootkit made several modifications to the system 's behaviour , which caused the systems to become unstable .
It also determined that 64 - bit systems are not affected .
Apparently , however , not all 32 - bit systems with the Alureon rootkit were affected : the " chain of events " relating to when the machine was infected and when the update was installed played a role .
Microsoft went on to say that it had " not found quality issues with security update MS10 - 015 " .
Only a few days ago , based on its own analysis , Symantec had suspected that a rootkit was responsible for the blue screen of death ( BSOD ) issues .

Democratics Sens. Charles Chumer , Michael Bennett , Mark Begich and Al Franken unveiled a letter on Tuesday expressing concern about Facebook 's privacy policy .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Senators ' letter to Facebook
Four Democratic U.S. senators — Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) , Michael Bennet ( D - Col. ) , Mark Begich ( Alaska ) and Al Franken ( D - Minn . ) — on Tuesday were unveiling this letter to Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg :
April 27 , 2010

Dear Mr. Zuckerberg ,
We are writing to express our concern regarding recent changes to the Facebook privacy policy and the use of personal data on third party websites .
While Facebook provides a valuable service to users by keeping them connected with friends and family and reconnecting them with long - lost friends and colleagues , the expansion of Facebook – both in the number of users and applications – raises new concerns for users who want to maintain control over their information .
The following three changes have raised concerns :
1. Publicly available data .
Facebook ’s expansion of publicly available data to include a user ’s current city , hometown , education , work , likes , interests , and friends has raised concerns for users who would like to have an opt - in option to share this profile information .
Through the expanded use of “ connections , ” Facebook now obligates users to make publicly available certain parts of their profile that were previously private .
If the user does not want to connect to a page with other users from their current town or university , the user will have that information deleted altogether from their profile .
We appreciate that Facebook allows users to type this information into the “ Bio ” section of their profiles , and privatize it , but we believe that users should have more control over these very personal and very common data points .
These personal details should remain private unless a user decides that he / she would like to make a connection and share this information with a community .
2 . Third party data storage .
Previously , Facebook allowed third - party advertisers to store profile data for 24 hours .
We are concerned that recent changes allow that data to be stored indefinitely .
We believe that Facebook should reverse this policy , or at a minimum require users to opt in to allowing third parties to store data for more than 24 hours .
3. Instant personalization .
We appreciate that Facebook is attempting to integrate the functionality of several popular websites , and that Facebook has carefully selected its initial partners for its new “ instant personalization ” feature .
We are concerned , however , that this feature will now allow certain third party partners to have access not only to a user ’s publicly available profile information , but also to the user ’s friend list and the publicly available information about those friends .
As a result of the other changes noted above , this class of information now includes significant and personal data points that should be kept private unless the user chooses to share them .
Although we are pleased that Facebook allows users to opt - out of sharing private data , many users are unaware of this option and , moreover , find it complicated and confusing to navigate .
Facebook should offer users the ability to opt-in to sharing such information , instead of opting out , and should make the process for doing so more clear and coherent .
We hope that Facebook will stand by its goal of creating open and transparent communities by working to ensure that its policies protect the sensitive personal biographical data of its users and provide them with full control over their personal information .
We look forward to the FTC examining this issue , but in the meantime we believe Facebook can take swift and productive steps to alleviate the concerns of its users .
Providing opt - in mechanisms for information sharing instead of expecting users to go through long and complicated opt - out processes is a critical step towards maintaining clarity and transparency .
Sincerely ,
U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer ( D - NY )
U.S. Senator Michael Bennet ( D - CO )
U.S. Senator Mark Begich ( D - AK )
U.S. Senator Al Franken ( D - MN )
* Current bill estimated at $ 278 billion to $ 329 billion
* Pentagon ’s costliest arms procurement program ( Adds Lockheed comment , last paragraphs )
WASHINGTON , March 19 ( Reuters ) -
The estimated total cost of Lockheed Martin Corp's LMT.N F - 35 fighter jets being bought by the Pentagon may be nearly twice as high as originally forecast , the U.S. Defense Department said Friday .
The bill for 2,443 F - 35s is currently estimated at $ 278 billion to $ 329 billion , up from the $ 197 billion projected when the development program began in October 2001 , taking into account inflation , a one - page Pentagon F - 35 “ unit cost ” report said .
The percentage hike per aircraft is even higher than for the fleet overall because the Pentagon now plans to buy 409 fewer F - 35s than the 2,852 it originally planned .
The single - seat , single - engine F - 35 is built to evade detection by radar .
Also known as the Joint Strike Fighter , it is the Pentagon ’s costliest arms procurement program .
Three highly common models are being built for the U.S. Air Force , Marine Corps and Navy as well as eight international partners and other prospective foreign buyers .
The eight U.S. co-development partners are Britain , Italy , the Netherlands , Turkey , Canada , Australia , Denmark and Norway .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates fired the Pentagon ’s F - 35 program manager in February .
He also added 13 months and $ 2.8 billion to the development phase plus four more test aircraft .
The Government Accountability Office , in a report to Congress Friday , said the latest Pentagon steps should “ improve outcomes and provide more realistic cost and schedule estimates . ”
But further cost growth and schedule extensions are likely , the Congress ’s non-partisan audit and investigative arm said .
Lockheed Martin , the Pentagon ’s No. 1 supplier by sales , said it had no insight into how the Pentagon established its estimate averaging up to $ 112 million per F - 35 .
That figure was up from a baseline projection of $ 59 million in real , inflation - adjusted terms .
“ We expect the average unit cost of the F - 35 to be far below that number , ” Christian Geisel , a company spokesman said , replying in an email .
