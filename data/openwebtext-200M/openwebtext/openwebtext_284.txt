An analysis by Morgan Stanley of Apple 's spending on R&D and travel expenses found two things :
1 ) The company is throwing more and more money at research and development , and 2 ) Steve Jobs is spending a lot of time in his company - granted Gulfstream V .
A research note from analyst Kathryn Huberty says that the $ 550,000 spent on Jobs ' air travel during the last quarter of 2007 is about three times as much as the average amount spent over the past year and a half .
Additionally , the cost of simply maintaining the ' JobsJet ' went up 170 percent .
Similarly , overall spending on R&D at Apple has jumped 34 percent year - over - year , which suggests the company may be devoting more time and effort to developing entirely new products and eking out additional iPhone deals , according to Morgan Stanley .
Indeed , rather than characterizing this splurge as a anomaly , Huberty says these spending increases have actually been fairly consistent , up roughly 32 percent for the past three quarters .
Nevertheless , Apple still trails Microsoft in R&D spending .
According to FinancialWeek , Apple typically spends only 3 percent of its sales on R&D , while Microsoft spends almost 5 times more , proportionally ( 14 percent ) .
Lord knows
Apple certainly has enough cash on hand ( $ 18.4 billion ) to handle these kinds of investments and travel expenses , but FinancialWeek 's analysis of Apple 's cash reserves claims the company wo n't be dipping into that particular pool of money for its research .
R&D , of course , does n't automatically translate into better products , but it will be interesting to see if Apple 's spending push has a measurable effect on the company 's product line in the coming year .

Over the last few decades , the Leno - Letterman dialectic has grown from a humdrum tussle over ratings into one of our all - time great pop-cultural binaries , right up there with Lennon - McCartney , Zeppelin - Floyd , and Faulkner - Hemingway .
It ’s more than a clash of styles — it ’s a deep existential rift , a fracture running the length of America ’s funny bone .
The differences are obvious and visceral .
Letterman is the sour , gap - toothed renegade devoted to absurdist conceptual comedy — non sequiturs , impromptu Dada street theater , suffocating irony .
Leno is the bland , slab - faced , corporate - friendly panderer with the comedic temperament of an eighth - grade boy circa 1989 : Blondes are dumb , gay men are silly , and Michael Jackson is hilarious in every single context the human mind could ever hope to imagine .
To anyone with even minimal comedy standards — those who do n’t , e.g. , hyperventilate over the riddles printed on Popsicle sticks ( a Jelly - copter ! ) —
Leno ’s long - standing dominance of the ratings must rank as one of the world ’s inexplicable cultural tragedies .
The last moment of late - night sanity came way back in 1993 , when Letterman , having been denied his rightful place as heir to Johnny Carson ’s Tonight Show , decided to thrash his usurper by defecting to CBS , where his victory was both instant and total , critical and popular .
It was also short - lived .
Within a couple of years ( critics usually finger , as the tipping point , Hugh Grant ’s 1995 apology on the Tonight Show for soliciting a prostitute ) , Leno owned every major demographic .

One of the great promises of the writers ’ strike was that it would correct this injustice .
The strike knocked both hosts off the air for two months , and they returned on opposite sides of the karmic fence .
Letterman had worked out a separate peace with the strikers , so he came back with a full writing staff , all - you - can - eat access to a buffet of suddenly underexposed A - list guests , a fetching gray beard , and the moral high ground .
Leno , meanwhile , hobbled back onstage with his comedic kneecaps broken : starved of picket - conscious Hollywood stars , forced to write his own monologues , and if not exactly a scab , then at least a slightly discolored skein of flesh growing over the surface of an open wound .
Letterman got Denzel , Stallone , and Katherine Heigl ; Leno had Bill Maher , the judges from Dancing With the Stars ( opening line of interview : “ I do n’t know anything about you ” ) , and a comedian discovered five years ago on Star Search .
Everything was in place for Letterman to reclaim his stolen throne .
Except , as it turns out , none of that mattered .
Leno won , despite the handicaps , as handily as he always has , by more than a million viewers a night .
This raises a series of difficult questions .
How has the prince of pandering attained such a chokehold on the American viewer ?
What dark magic does he wield ?
After all these years , is it time for comedy snobs to accept that Leno ’s reign is not a fluke — that his combination of skills and style is , in some baffling but real way , better than Letterman’s ?
To find out , I watched , more closely than I ever wanted to , a recent week of strike - era Leno .
Some of his jokes were so bad they made me flinch like I ’d just downed a strong shot of liquor ( “ It was so windy , on Hollywood Boulevard I saw a guy take the chain out of his nostril and tie it to a lamppost just to keep from blowing away ” ) ; others made me shake my head gravely like you do when you see someone mistreating a pet ( people thought Huckabee ’s admission that he ate fried squirrel in college would hurt him in the polls , “ but in South Carolina he went up 30 points ! ” ) .
Leno did n’t seem to mind , though :
He just put his hands in his pockets , waggled his head , chuckled to the band — and immediately told another joke .
One night , Bill Maher called Leno “ virtually the only person I know … who could write an entire monologue by himself ” — which sounded ridiculously overblown at the time , but on further reflection might actually be true .
By all accounts , Leno works on monologues obsessively — seven days a week , in the middle of the night , in comedy clubs , and on his days off .
More than any other comic , he has devoted his life to that opening blitz of rapid - fire topical groaners .
It ’s his signature achievement .
The Leno monologue is always impressively long and covers lots of ground .
On a recent night , before he sat down at his desk , he told jokes about 24 different subjects , from botany to Britney to the production of Japanese electricity .
Letterman covered only five .
Pundits who thought the strike would cripple Leno misunderstood something fundamental about his art :
His act is already essentially crippled .
Real stand - up comedy is famously time - intensive ; it converts months of solid work into minutes of material , and its tiniest successes depend on superhumanly precise calibrations of tone , pace , and gesture — a discipline antithetical to the relentless , workaday schedule of a talk show .
A monologue is , by definition , wounded comedy .
We should assess late - night hosts , then , not by their rare bursts of excellence but by how they cope with mediocrity .
Leno and Letterman both , at this point , deal mainly in terrible jokes .
The question for viewers is what attitude — what existential garnish — do you want on top of them ?
Letterman seems to loathe his monologue .
He performs it grumpily , as a duty , and most of the humor comes out of his apparent disdain for the jokes , half of which seem to send him into acute liver failure — he squints , grimaces , chokes back vomit , very nearly dies .
This irony insulates him from the material :
He did n’t write the jokes , he wants us to understand , and he ’s not really behind them , he ’s just the one stuck up there reading them .
He ’s a failed idealist ; it can be painful , night after night , to watch him betray his own high standards .
Leno , on the other hand , is a realist .
He does n’t pretend to be better than his material or his audience .
He ’s a virtuoso of the mediocre , resigned to the staggering failure rate of late - night comedy and proud of whatever success he manages to bring off .
Unlike Letterman , he tells his jokes straight , with the implication that they are actually funny and worthwhile .
His only protective mechanism is his legendary work ethic :
Since striving for quality in a late - night monologue is hopeless , he invests all his talent in quantity .
This is the secret of Leno ’s success :
He ’s not trying to be the funniest guy in the world ; he ’s trying to be the most dependably serviceable at monologuing — an equally difficult task that carries almost none of the turkey - cocking street cred of revolutionary art comedy .
Like many Americans , Jay Leno works as hard as he can under impossible conditions ( he even knows he ’s losing his job next year ) , and he refuses to beat himself up for it — a position that is , in the end , riskier , more vulnerable , and easier to identify with than that of his nearest rival .
And , if you can manage to think about it without irony , very nearly heroic .
( Adds interview with Nader )
WASHINGTON , Feb 24 ( Reuters ) - Consumer advocate Ralph Nader , blamed by many Democrats for their loss of the White House in the 2000 election , said on Sunday he is launching another independent campaign for the White House .
Nader , who will turn 74 this week , announced his longshot presidential bid on NBC's " Meet the Press " saying that neither the Democrats nor the Republicans were addressing problems facing Americans .
Nader called Washington " corporate occupied territory " that turns the government against the interests of the people .
" In that context , I have decided to run for president , " he said .
Democrats said they do not expect Nader , who also ran as an independent in 2004 , to have much of an impact .
" When you get into running for your third or fourth time , I do n't think people will pay that much attention to it , and I would n't see it having any effect on the race , " Virginia Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine said on " Fox News Sunday . "
In an interview with Reuters , Nader said he will push the candidates on a number of issues including health care and changing the tax system to shift the burden away from wage earners and put it on things like pollution , tobacco and " Wall Street speculation " and reduce taxes on wages .
Nader dismissed Democratic criticism of his latest bid for the White House .
" For anybody who thinks that the third try is something that should be demeaned , it represents persistence , it represents never giving up the struggle for justice , " Nader said .
" The forces of injustice never take a holiday . "
Nader ran for president in 2000 , when he got about 2.7 percent of the national vote as the Green Party candidate .
Many Democrats blamed Nader for draining votes from Democrat Al Gore and tipping the election in favor of Republican George W. Bush .
He also ran as an independent in 2004 , but got only a tiny fraction of the vote .
Nader said he expects to do better this time and will work to get his name on the ballot in all 50 states .
Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee , appearing on CNN's " Late Edition , " said he thought Nader could pull votes away from the Democratic nominee .
" Naturally Republicans would welcome his entry into the race and hope that maybe a few more will join in , " Huckabee said .
Democratic candidates Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama criticized the independent candidate .
" That 's really unfortunate .
I remember when he did this before , it did n't turn out to well , for anyone , especially our country , " she said .
" I hope it 's kind of a just a passing fancy that people wo n't take too seriously . "
Obama , Clinton 's rival for the Democratic presidential nomination , was asked on Saturday about a Nader candidacy .
" My sense is that Mr. Nader is somebody who , if you do n't listen and adopt all of his policies , thinks you 're not substantive , " he said .

The Best Software Development Books of 2007 November 30 , 2007
Posted by Imran Ghory in Books
[ This list is just based upon my personal opinion and therefore only includes the books I ’ve read .
Any suggestions for books I ’ve missed are welcome .
All of the books below were published in 2007 ]
1 ) Code Craft by Peter Goodliffe
This is the book every compsci student should read before starting life as a professional developer .
It covers the gap between the programming a student does at university and then real - life work of a professional software development .
It covers many practical topics such as version control , static analysis tools , and variable naming conventions , all areas which are often not covered in academia but are essential in professional life ( Peter actually writes an excellent column in C Vu magazine called “ Professionalism in programming ” ) .
At the risk of sounding like a heretic , for new programmers this book is a better “ Code Complete ” .
Do n’t get me wrong , “ Code Complete ” is a fantastic book and it ’s content is well researched and referenced .
However Code Craft is a far more readable book , it ’s emphasis is much more on the day - to - day practical elements ( as opposed to McConnell ‘s more academic style ) and is much more conversational in style .
I know at least 20 people who own a copy of Code Complete and almost none of them have actually read it beyond the first couple of chapters ( which are unfortunately among the worst ) .
Code Craft begins on the topic of defensive programming , which while not the most titillating of topics means the content is immediately applicable to most developers .
Code Complete begins on metaphors for software development .
If you ’ve been a professional software developer for more than a few years then you probably already know most of the material covered ( although it may still be worth reading to discover any gaps ) and you ’ll probably be better off with “ Code Complete ” due to it ’s greater coverage of topics , but if you ’re a new developer then this book is a gold mine of information .
There are only two significant gripes I have with this book , firstly the quality of the binding is not great .
It ’s a standard “ no starch press ” paperback – I suspect the binding will come apart with frequent use .
Secondly there are a number of minor errors throughout the text , they ’re not significant enough to take away from the overall quality of the text but they can be distracting and potentially misleading .
A corrected second edition printed in hard - back would be most welcome .
2 ) Smart and Gets Things Done by Joel Spolsky
This is in a slightly different category to the others , it ’s not about software development per se , but rather about the recruitment and retention of the best technical talent .
I actually disagree with a lot of Joel ’s opinions on recruiting , but that ’s not to say his opinions are n’t worth reading and considering .
Like him or hate him Joel is probably the most influential figure in technical recruitment at the top end of the software development talent market .
You can go for an interview at pretty much any top technical firm knowing with near certainty that interviewers at that firm are familiar with Spolsky ’s essays on the topic
And that more than anything makes his new book worth reading .
3 ) Programming Erlang by Joe Armstrong
Probably the most anticipated software development book of the year .
If you have n’t been hiding under a rock for the past year you ’ll almost certainly have heard of Erlang , a language which originally came out of Ericsson that is rapidly popularizing the concurrent programming style that it champions .
It ’s a functional language that originated out of industry rather than academia .
Armstrong started working on Erlang in 1986 – twenty - one years later his book “ Programming Erlang ” is introducing the language into the mainstream and attracting many developers who have never coded in a functional language before .
The book is almost certainly destined to be a classic , at the very least rivalling the Camel Book in terms of influence .
Put basically : this is the book that all the cool kids are reading .
4 ) The Complete Guide to Capital Markets for Quantitative Professionals by Alex Kuznetsov
When someone says “ Investment Bank ” people inevitably think of traders on an open - outcry floor .
At the average investment bank there are five software developers for every one trader .
The finance industry probably swallows more developers than any industry outside of the tech industry itself ; in major financial cities ( New York , London ) more software developers are employed in finance than in any other industry .
It ’s not unusual for a large bank to have several thousand developers on the payroll .
Yet almost no - one outside the industry knows anything about what these software developers get upto .
Even within the industry most people only know their little part of the world , living in complete ignorance to even what the developers down the aisle from them are working on .
This is the problem that this book aims to solve , and does it reasonably successfully .
It gives a broad overview of the financial markets and the industry players from the point of view of a developer .
Despite the fact it has “ quantitative professional ” tacked on the end of it ’s title the book is probably more appropriate for software developers than anyone else .
While the book tries to explain everything without making any assumptions about the readers background knowledge of finance , it does on occasion fail , throwing in basic financial vocabulary without explanation .
However these occasions are rare and on the most part unexplained terms can be quickly looked up on Wikipedia .
If you ’re working in the financial industry as a developer , or perhaps are looking to enter the industry then this book is well worth the read for the broader picture it will give you .
Even for the curious passerby this book may make interesting reading , however it is clearly targeted at those who are in or want to be in the financial sector .

A rogue trader at MF Global Ltd. rang up $ 141.5 million in losses on the broker ’s account this week , the company said Thursday , a black eye that cost the company almost a fifth of its market value .
The Bermuda - based broker said on Wednesday morning it discovered Evan Dooley , a trader at the company ’s Memphis , Tenn. , branch , trading wheat contracts in amounts that exceeded how much he was allowed to trade .
MF Global said it fired Mr. Dooley and liquidated the wheat contracts , which led to a $ 141.5 million loss .
An entry - order system that should have blocked the trades failed , the company said .
Attempts to locate an Evan Dooley in the Memphis area for comment were unsuccessful .
MF Global brokers options and futures contracts for 130,000 clients at 70 exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , the Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The company said the trading loss does not threaten the $ 19.5 billion clients have in their accounts .
ABU DHABI DIALOGUES ON PROTECTION OF WORKER RIGHTS PRODUCE AGREEMENT —BUT it ’s just a start !
By Kevin A. Stoda
This week in Abu Dhabi 20 nations met to discuss ways to improve labor protections for the great number of foreign workers in the UAE and other neighboring countries .
These countries were Afghanistan , Bahrain , Bangladesh , China , India , Indonesia , Kuwait , Malaysia , Nepal , Oman , Pakistan , the Philippines , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Singapore , Sri Lanka , Thailand , United Arab Emirates , Vietnam and Yemen .
The agreement is an initial step in a long journey to improve the rights and legal system in the Gulf region , specifically in the area of protecting laborers from Asia , especially those from South Asia .
Here are the main facets of the new agreement .
They focus on creating a strong partnership among the twenty states involved :
(1) Enhance knowledge in the areas of the labor market trends , skills profiles , temporary contractual laborers and remittance policies and flows anther interplay with development in the region .
(2) Build capacity for effective matching of labor demand and supply .
(3) Prevent illegal recruitment practices and promoting welfare and protection measures for contractual workers , supportive of their well being and preventing their exploitation at origin and destination .
(4) Developing a framework for a comprehensive approach to managing the entire cycle of temporary contractual mobility that foster the mutual interests of countries and destination of the laborers .

Customs agents have the prerogative to examine and even copy data from travelling citizens ' laptops they search , CNN's American Morning reports .
" A new alert for travellers : be careful what you store on your laptop or your BlackBerry when entering the United States , " warns CNN 's John Roberts .
" Customs agents can examine your computer and even keep your private information . "
CNN reporter Jeanne Meserve adds ominously , " Your banking records , your music choices , your emails , your business contacts -- all can be examined , copied and stored by the government when you enter the country , if they 're in an electronic device . "
One Pakistani -American IT consultant says that U.S. agents searched his computer on five occasions upon returning from overseas trips , even forcing him to give them access to confidential corporate information .

My last post explained my frustration trying to get pyrex to do * anything * .
Since then , several people posted solutions and e-mailed me with more ideas ( thanks allefant and Filip Wasilewski ) .
My review was focused on the usability of pyrex as a python ->C translator , since that ’s what I was working on with both shed - skin and pypy / rpython .
It did n’t hold up so well .
This is because … pyrex ISN ’T a python ->C translator .
pyrex is its own special language that contains both python and C stuff .
pyrex does not do type inference .
What pyrex provides is a way to mix both python and python - like C code together in the same files .
The trick to understanding pyrex is to know where the line between python and C is in pyrex .
Here are some of the gotchas I experienced .
I was n’t able to detail them in my previous post because I did n’t really “ get it ” .
Now I think I do , so I ’ll explain some stuff so you can try out pyrex without getting confused the way I did :
Gotcha # 1 : float ( ) is a python function
cdef int a cdef float b a = 3 b = float ( a )
Solution : use pyrex ’s casting to avoid massive object - conversion speed penalties
b = < float >a
Gotcha # 2 : pyrex does n’t do type inference
def set_video ( int w , int h ) : s = Surface ( ) s.surf = SDL_SetVideoMode ( w, h, 32,0 ) return s
pyrex : Cannot convert ' SDL_Surface *' to Python object
Solution : to access your C - members you must declare the variable ’s type first
def set_video ( int w , int h ) : cdef Surface s s = Surface ( ) s.surf = SDL_SetVideoMode ( w, h, 32,0 ) return s
Gotcha # 3 : def makes python functions – which are slow
def set_pixel ( self , int x , int y , int color )
Solution :
To be able to access a fast version of a method in C and be able to access the same method in python you must define two versions of it
cdef _set_pixel ( self , int x , int y , int color ) : pass # do this really fast
def set_pixel ( self , int x , int y , int color ) : return self._set_pixel(x , y , color )
All that said , I think pyrex is really neat for writing extensions !
Â
One of the best features it has is properties ( which are like descriptors , only easier ) .
Â
Just be careful if you use it to not mistake it for python .
Â
Lastly , by using those tips I was able to get my julia example to be full speed .
Struggling candidates reach for ' 9/11 cards '
Well they 're off - officially - in the race for the White House , and one - time frontrunners Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton have stumbled out of the gates .
What 's a struggling New York pol to do ?
Never Forget .
Clinton and Giuliani both broke out 9/11 references a day after the Iowa Caucuses upended the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns .
" None of this worries me - Sept. 11 , there were times I was worried , " Giuliani told the New York Daily News , brushing off his sub -Ron Paul finish in a state he virtually ignored .
The former mayor , who left office three months after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , is an old hand at going to the 9/11 well when his political fortunes need a boost .
He was joined Friday , though , by Hillary Clinton , New York 's junior senator , elected just less than a year before the attacks .
" We have people who are plotting against us right now , getting ready to repeat the atrocity of Sept 11 .
We know it , I see the intelligence reports , " Clinton told voters Friday morning in New Hampshire , which is being seen as a must - win state for the former First Lady .
Clinton has said she 's prepared for a long national campaign , and Giuliani is counting on wins in Florida and later states , so each could survive if they fail to win New Hampshire .
Bill Clinton only took 2nd in the 1992 New Hampshire primary , so victory there is hardly a requirement .
Satire blog Wonkette panned Clinton for " pulling a page from Rudy Giulianis thus - far resoundingly successful campaign . "
This business plan template and guide is the result of 20 years of research into the types of business plans that help entrepreneurs and executives raise funding and build thriving companies .
It ’s primarily for those who have never created a business plan , but there ’s plenty of advice for those who have written one or many plans before .
I wrote this guide because , even in 2020 , much of the online advice on business planning is misleading or flat - out wrong .
I ca n’t blame bloggers for it because many of the facts herein are not widely known .
It required me and my company to spend 20 + years writing thousands of business plans to really know what works .
Below you ’ll learn how to develop the best business plan with information including :
What are the keys to a great business plan
How to create your financial projections
What to do if you ’re writing a business plan for funding
You ’ll also be able to download multiple business plan templates and see sample business plans .

Business Plan Template Sections
I. Executive Summary
Why This is Important
The Executive Summary is the most important part of your business plan .
It gives the reader an overview of your business and the opportunity to get involved in it .
If they ’re not impressed or excited , the reader wo n’t make it any further in your plan .
In fact , most readers never get beyond the first page of your Executive Summary so , spend time making it great .
What to Include
Your Executive Summary should include 3 parts : Business Overview , Success Factors and Financial Plan
Business Overview
The business overview tells the reader what type of business you ’re in .
Are you a restaurant , a software company , a dry- cleaning business , etc . ?
Importantly , do n’t start your business overview with a long story .
Rather , clearly and concisely state what your company does .
For example , “ We are an organic restaurant located in Miami , FL ” or “ We operate a social networking website for working mothers ” are good , concise overviews .
Success Factors
Your Success Factors are the most important part of your business plan .
And unfortunately , every other business plan template I ’ve seen ignores this ( that ’s because , unlike Growthink , they have n’t gotten feedback from literally thousands of investors on plans we ’ve written ) .
Your success factors are simply the reasons why your company is uniquely qualified to succeed .
Conversely , if you have no unique qualifications , you will fail .
It ’s important to think about and figure out your success factors .
Is there anything about your products and services that are unique ?
For example , maybe you have patents or a unique distribution partnership that allows you and only you to offer a certain product .
Is there anything unique about your management team ?
For example , maybe you have more experience , or special relationships with vendors or customers ?
There are many reasons why your organization could be unique .
Spend time identifying these reasons and documenting them in this section of your plan .
Financial Plan
In this section of your Executive Summary , you should show an overview of your expected financial performance over the next five years .
This “ overview ” includes your Revenues , Direct Expenses , Gross Profit , Other Expenses , EBITDA ( Earnings Before Interest , Taxes , Depreciation and Amortization ) , and Net Income projections for the next five years .
II .
Company Overview
Why This is Important
In this section of your plan , you need to give a snapshot of your company ’s structure and history .
This is important since readers need to know , for example , if you are a new company or an existing one .
And they need to understand what your company has accomplished to date .
As mentioned earlier , the greatest predictor of future success is past accomplishments .
What to Include
In the Company Overview section of your business plan , start by stating when your company was formed and where you are located .
Location is very important since most investors like to invest in companies that are local to them .
Next , mention your legal structure .
The most common options here are : C Corporation , S Corporation , Limited Liability Company , Sole Proprietorship , Non-Profit Organization , or Not Yet Incorporated .
Finally , specify what your company has achieved to date .
These achievements or milestones might include :
Sales ( e.g. , reached $ 100,000 in sales on [ enter date ] )
Number of customers served
Prototypes or products built
Location built out and / or lease secured
Employees hired
III .
Industry Analysis
Why This is Important
The Industry Analysis section of your business plan tells the reader about your industry / marketplace .
It is important since readers want to know a ) that you are an expert in your market and b ) that the market is large enough to support your company and industry trends are working in your favor .
What to Include
The Industry Analysis section has two sub-sections : Market Overview and Relevant Market Size .
Market Overview
Here you will discuss the characteristics of your market .
How big is it in units and / or revenues ?
Is the market growing ?
What are the trends facing your market ?
As much as possible , cite established organizations to lend validity to your research .
For example , you can say that according to XYZ Research firm or the National Restaurant Association , restaurant sales were $ X billion last year and are expected to grow to $ Y billion next year .
Importantly , show how the research supports your success .
For example , a growing market size clearly supports you .
But for example , if research shows customer needs are shifting in a way that makes them more likely to buy from your company , this is something you want to highlight .
Relevant Market Size
Your relevant market size is the annual revenue that your company could attain if we owned 100 % market share .
The formula is simple .
First , enter the number of customers who might be interested in purchasing your products and / or services each year .
Then enter the monetary amount these customers might be willing to spend , on an annual basis , on your products and / or services .
The product of these two figures is your relevant market size .
Calculate this figure here so your readers understand the size of your market opportunity and can confirm it ’s big enough ( particularly if you are seeking debt or equity capital ) .
IV .
Customer Analysis
Why This is Important
In this section , you will describe your target customers and their core needs .
It is important since readers want to be sure you 1 ) precisely know who your target customers are and what they want , and 2 ) your strategy ( products / services , promotions strategy , etc. ) aligns with your customers ’ preferences .
What to Include
The Customer Analysis section has two sub-sections : Target Customers and Customer Needs .
Target Customers
In the Target Customers section of your plan , you should provide a profile of your target customers .
For instance , how old are they ?
Are they married ?
Where do they live / work ?
Below are several demographic ( e.g. , age ) and psychographic ( e.g. , values ) variables you can use to describe your target customers .
Some are for B2C ( business to consumer ) and others are for B2B ( business to business ) companies :
Age
Income
Gender
Location
Marital Status
Family size
Occupation
Language
Education
Values / Beliefs
Activities Engaged In
Business Size
Customer Needs
Here you will profile the needs of your target customers .
Do they care most about speed ?
Price ?
Comfort ?
Below are several reasons why customers might want or need your products and / or services :
Speed
Quality
Location
Reliability
Comfort
Price
Value
Customer service
Convenience
Ease of use
Identify which of these ( or other ) reasons are relevant and then explain them further .
For example , you can discuss that customers dislike the fact that getting gasoline takes so long ( driving to the station and waiting on line ) and how your solution saves them time .
V. Competitive Analysis
Why This is Important
In this section of your plan , you need to provide an overview of your competitors .
This is important since readers want to know 1 ) you understand your competitive environment , and 2 ) have competitive advantages that will allow you to succeed .
Importantly , when entrepreneurs tell investors they have no competition , it often raises a red flag .
This is because if there ’s no competition , it signals that a market does not exist .
Sometimes competition is indirect ( as detailed below , this is when a different solution solves the customer ’s needs than yours ) .
For instance , when washing machines were invented , while there were no direct competitors ( other washing machine brands ) , there was indirect competition ( consumers manually washing their clothing ) .
What to Include
The Competitive Analysis section of your plan has three sub-sections : Direct Competitors , Indirect Competitors and Competitive Advantages .
Direct Competitors
Direct competitors are companies that fill the same customer need you do with the same or a similar solution .
For example , direct competitors of a pizza shop would be other local pizza shops .
Detail your direct competitors here .
What products / services do they offer ?
At what price points ?
Below is the information checklist to include for each competitor :
Competitor ’s Name Overview of Competitor ( where are they located ; how long have they been operating ) Products / services offered Pricing Revenues Location (s )
Customer segments / geographies served Competitor ’s key strengths Competitor ’s key weaknesses
Indirect Competitors
Direct competitors are companies that fill the same customer need you do with a different solution .
For example , a supermarket that sells frozen pizzas would be an indirect competitor to a pizza shop .
Detail your indirect competitors in this section .
What products / services do they offer ?
At what price points ?
Use the same 9 - point checklist mentioned above for direct competitors .
Competitive Advantages
In this section of your plan , you need to detail the reasons your company is positioned to outperform both direct and indirect competitors .
Below is a list of areas in which you might have competitive advantage .
Review each and expand upon the relevant ones :
Products and / or Services
Human Resources
Location
Operational Systems
Intellectual Property
Customers
Marketing
For instance , you could say that your [ enter any of the bullets from above ] is better than your competitors because [ insert reason ] .
VI . Marketing Plan
Why This is Important
Your marketing plan details your products and / or services , pricing and promotions plans .
It is important since ideally it proves you 1 ) have a solid plan for reaching new customers , and 2 ) can attain new customers profitably ( i.e. , the customer acquisition cost is significantly less than the customer lifetime value ) .
What to Include
The Marketing Plan section of your plan has three sub-sections : Products , Services & Pricing , Promotions Plan and Distribution Plan .
Products , Services & Pricing
Here you should list each of your key products , detail their features and benefits and discuss their pricing ( are they priced competitively or are they high - priced ( premium ) or low - priced ( discount ) .
If your product / service is a restaurant or cafe , provide details on your menu items .
Promotions Plan
Here you should discuss which of the promotional tactics you will use to attract new customers and how .
For example , if radio advertising is a tactic you will employ , detail the radio shows on which you will have ads .
Likewise , if you plan to advertise in trade journals , detail which ones you will target .
Distribution Plan
If you operate a retail store and / or an online store , and your storefront is the only way in which customers can buy from you , you do not have to complete this section of your plan .
However , if customers can buy from you via other methods ( e.g. , other retailers , distributors , etc. ) , detail these methods here .
In such cases , you have two customers ( your distribution partners and your end - customers / users ) and you need to be sure you can satisfy the needs of both .
VII .
Operations Plan
Why This is Important
Your Operations Plan must detail 1 ) the key day - to - day processes that your business performs to serve customers and 2 ) the key business milestones that your company expects to accomplish as you grow .
Anyone can have lofty goals ( e.g. , we will reach $ X million in revenue in year X ) .
The Operations Plan proves to the reader that you have thought through and devised a plan to achieve your goals .
What to Include
The Operations Plan section of your plan has two sub-sections : Key Operational Processes and Milestones .
Key Operational Processes
Detail the key day - to - day processes that your business performs to serve customers such as marketing , product development , etc .
Below are key operational functions that your business may need to fulfill .
In your plan , identify each of these areas that are relevant to your business and what the role of that function is .
For example , our Customer Service team will ensure our customers are satisfied .
We will provide 24/7 customer service and post product updates on social media each week .
Product Development
Sales
Marketing
Finance
Customer Service
Manufacturing
Administration
Accounting / Payroll
Human Resources
Legal
Purchasing
Milestones
Here you will detail the key business milestones that your company expects to accomplish as you grow and when you expect to accomplish them .
Sample milestones include :
New products and services introductions
Store opening date
Revenue milestones ( date when sales exceed $ X , when sales exceed $ Y , etc . )
Key partnerships executed
Key customer contracts secured
Key financial events ( future funding rounds , IPO , etc. )
Key employee hires
VIII .
Management Team
Why This is Important
The Management Team section of your plan details your team members .
This section is critical since the best plans in the world will not be executed if the team is incapable .
By proving you have a strong team , you are signaling to investors that you can in fact achieve the plans and milestones included in your plan .
What to Include
The Management Team section of your plan has three sub-sections : Management Team Members , Management Team Gaps and Board Members .
Management Team Members
For each team member , detail their name , title and background .
Their backgrounds are most important .
Detail what positions they ’ve held and what they accomplished in those positions .
For example , by saying Jane Smith was the former Vice President of Manufacturing for XYZ company where she scaled manufacturing from 1,000 to 10 million products per month would be very impressive if your company was a startup manufacturer .
Management Team Gaps
If your management team has gaps ( key people you expect to hire in the future ) , detail what position (s ) is / are missing and who will fill the positions .
This could read like a job description .
For instance , you might say that we will soon hire a VP of Sales .
This person will have 10 years ’ experience selling to big box retailers and has managed at least 100 sales representatives at a time in their career .
Board Members
If you have a Board of Directors or Board of Advisors , include the bios of your Board members here .
IX . Financial Plan
Why This is Important
The Financial Plan section of your plan details the financial implications of running your business .
It is absolutely critical to investors and lenders since it indicates whether you will be able to repay your loans and / or provide a nice Return on Investment upon exit .
For your own use , your financial plan helps you understand how much outside funding is required , when your levels of cash might fall low , and what sales and other goals you need to hit to become financially viable .
What to Include
The Financial Plan section has four sub-sections : Revenue Model , Financial Highlights , Funding Requirements / Use of Funds and Exit Strategy .
Revenue Model
Here you will detail how your company generates revenues .
Oftentimes this is very straightforward , for instance , if you sell products .
Other times , your answer might be more complex , such as if you ’re selling subscriptions ( particularly at different price / service levels ) or if you are selling multiple products and services .
Financial Highlights
In developing your plan , you need to create a full financial forecast including a 5 - year Projected Income Statement , Projected Balance Sheet , and Projected Cash Flow Statement .
While your full financial projections will go in your Appendix , highlights of your projections will go in your Financial Plan section .
These highlights include your Revenues , Direct Expenses , Gross Profit , Other Expenses , EBITDA ( Earnings Before Interest , Taxes , Depreciation and Amortization ) , and Net Income projections .
Also include key assumptions used in creating these projections such as revenue and cost growth rates .
Funding Requirements / Use of Funds
In this section , you will detail how much outside funding you require , if any , and the core uses of these funds .
For example , detail how much of the funding you need for :
Product Development
Marketing
Product Manufacturing
Staffing
Rent or Office / Building Build - Out
Etc .
Exit Strategy
If you are seeking equity capital , you need to explain your “ exit strategy ” here or how investors will “ cash out ” from their investment .
To add credibility to your exit strategy , conduct market research .
Specifically , find other companies in your market who have exited in the past few years .
Mention how they exited and the amounts of the exit ( e.g. , XYZ Corp. bought ABC Corp. for $ Y ) .
X. Appendix
Why This is Important
The Appendix is used to support and give more credibility to the rest of the business plan .
What to Include
Your Appendix should include any information that supports the claims in your plan such as patents , store designs , customer lists / contracts , partnership agreements , employee contracts , etc .
In addition , your Appendix must include your full financial forecasts ( Projected Income Statements , Projected Balance Sheet , Projected Cash Flow Statements ) .
Be sure to document all the assumptions used in creating your financial projections .
For instance , for product / service revenues and gross profit , you need to specify assumptions including :
What is your expected sales growth rate ?
What is the average price you will charge per product / service unit sold ?
How much do you expect to raise your prices each year ?
How much does it cost you to produce or deliver each unit sold ?
How much ( if at all ) , do you expect your direct product costs to grow each year ?
For company costs , specify assumptions including :
Your salary ( assuming you ’re the owner / president / CEO ) and annual growth rate in your salary
Salaries for your team members and growth rates
Monthly marketing expense and growth rates
Rent and utilities expenses
Insurance expense
Office supplies expense
Other expenses

Business Plan Template Frequently Asked Questions
As you may recall , we have written thousands of business plans for clients for over 20 + years .
I say this not to brag , but to assure you that much information online about business plans is false .
Below you will find the correct answers to the most common business planning questions .
Why do you need a business plan ?
A business plan is important in that it serves two core purposes ; it provides 1 ) financial validation and 2 ) serves as a roadmap .
Financial Validation :
With regard to financial validation , your business plan gives a strong indication , to both you and outside funding sources , as to whether your venture will be financially successful .
Your financial projections , if completed properly ( more on this below ) , allow financing sources to calculate whether you ’ll be able to repay your loan or provide an appropriate Return on Investment .
Importantly , the written sections of your business plan support your financial projections .
For instance , the Industry Analysis section must prove that your market size is large enough to support your success .
And , your Marketing Plan section must show that you ’ll be employing promotional tactics that allow you to attract customers at a reasonable cost .
Serves as a Roadmap :
In particular , the Operations Plan section of your plan lays out your action plan .
It details the key accomplishments and milestones you have established and when you expect to complete this .
The roadmap gives you and your team a clear path to follow .
It keeps you focused and improves your odds of reaching the goals you ’ve set .
When do you need to create your plan ?
When you are conceiving a new business or new product or service , you should at least create a basic business plan ( see our simple business plan template below ) .
This plan should cover the basics of your plan .
For instance , it should include the reasons you think the business , product or service will be successful .
It should prove that the market is big enough to support your business .
And , it must validate that financially it makes sense .
For example , while you might be able to get a million people to pay you $ 20 for a new computer , if you ca n’t manufacture the computers for significantly less than $ 20 , the business is n’t viable .
If you are seeking outside funding or are looking to grow your business to the next level , it is also time to create a plan .
What are the types of business plans ?
There are several types of business plans , but they are all similar .
For example , there are 3 types of business plans depending on the goal of your plan .
These three types are for funding , for strategy , and for both .
A plan for strategy focuses on ensuring you have the right strategy ( marketing strategy , operations strategy , HR strategy , etc. ) to grow a successful company .
When you add the need for funding to this , you must also spend time convincing funding sources why your company will succeed .
There are also 2 types of plans based on the level of comprehensiveness .
One is a simple business plan , as previously mentioned , that covers just the basic items to give a preliminary assessment regarding whether or not the company is viable .
On the other hand , a full or standard business plan includes all of the key 10 business planning sections .
There are also 2 types of plans based on the company ’s stage of growth .
There are startup business plans for companies that are just forming , and there are established plans for those that are already operating .
In addition , there are 2 plan types based on the company ’s size .
There are small business plans that generally cover companies up to 50 employees .
Medium and large company plans are usually for companies with 51 - 250 employees and 250 + employees respectively .
Finally , there are hundreds of business plan types based on the sector in which the business is operating .
For instance , you may need a nonprofit business plan , a salon business plan , a catering business plan , a coffee shop business plan , a bar business plan , a record label business plan , an app business plan , or many other plans depending on your industry .
Importantly , each of these plans are essentially the same : they must prove the financial viability of the business and provide a roadmap for success .
What is a business plan template ?
A business plan template is a template for a business plan ; specifically it ’s a document that is already formatted for your business plan needs .
It lays out the key sections and sub-sections to include in your plan , and for each , poses the questions you must answer .
If you are using the best business plan template , you are essentially typing in your answers to questions , and then your plan is done .
That ’s not to say it ’s quick and easy .
Some questions ( e.g. , what trends are affecting your market ? ) will require research to be conducted .
While others ( e.g. , what promotional tactics will you use to acquire customers inexpensively ? ) will force you to think and come up with optimal strategies .
If you ’d like to quickly and easily complete your business plan , download Growthink ’s Ultimate Business Plan Template and complete your business plan and financial model in hours .
Who is a business plan written for ?
Your business plan may have one or many audiences .
In many cases , your plan will be written for outside funding sources including banks , alternative lenders , angel investors , venture capitalists or private equity firms .
Sometimes your plan is only written for yourself to confirm the venture is worth investing your time and / or money .
And finally , there are often other constituents to which you ’ll want to show your plan .
These include potential :
Employees : who will want to see it before joining
Landlords : who often want to see a plan to feel comfortable you ’ll be able to pay your lease long - term
Vendors : who want to confirm it ’s worth selling to your company
Partners : who need to assess whether or not a partnership could be profitable
Customers : who want to see your plan before leaving their current product / service provider
Is a business plan a legal document ?
No , a business plan is not a legal document .
Unfortunately , there are several websites that promote their “ legal plan template ” and say you can use it to create an easy business plan .
It is important to note that a business plan is NOT considered a legal document in the United States .
And there are no state laws with regards to business plans .
How do I share my plan with someone without letting him copy the whole idea ?
The best practice when sharing your plan is to ask the reader to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement ( NDA ) .
As the name indicates , an NDA is a document that prevents the reader from disclosing , or sharing , the information included in the document .
This being said , most investors and lenders will not sign an NDA .
They simply see too many plans , many of which are quite similar , and doing so would disrupt their businesses .
For such investors , we suggest sending a “ teaser email ” ( an email with just basic information on the company ) to confirm they are interested before sending your full plan .
What are the 10 components of a business plan ?
The 10 components of a business plan are as follows :
Executive Summary Company Overview Industry Analysis Customer Analysis Competitive Analysis Marketing Plan Operations Plan Management Team Financial Plan Appendix
Each of these components are discussed in detail below .
What are the most important parts of a business plan ?
By far , the most important part of your plan is your Executive Summary .
This is what people read first , and if they are not impressed or excited after literally just 30 seconds , they often wo n’t read any further .
Within the Executive Summary , the keys are to 1 ) concisely explain what your business does , 2 ) explain your Unique Success Factors ( detailed later on this page ) , 3 ) and provide a summary of your financial projections ( also detailed later on this page ) .
These three items are the most important to readers , particularly investors and lenders .
What should you include on the cover page of your plan ?
Your business plan cover page should include your company ’s name and contact information including your name , address , email address and phone number .
Your cover page should graphically look nice , as you want to set the tone that you and your company are professional .
How long should your plan be ?
Entrepreneurs , business owners and executives often ask me how long should a business plan be .
The answer is that your plan must be long enough to answer all the key questions you and / or investors have in determining whether you company is a viable investment opportunity or not .
And it must be short enough that people will actually read it ( since clearly , no one ’s going to be psyched to read a 100 - page document ) .
This being said , we ’ve found that 15 - 25 pages is the ideal length for a business plan .
In this amount of space , you can convey your business ’ story in a digestible format for readers .
What is the difference between a business proposal and plan ?
In the United States and most countries , a business plan is a document in which you present your company ’s growth plan for the next five years .
Oftentimes the plan is created to present to funding sources to raise outside capital .
In some countries , business people use the term “ business proposal ” synonymously with “ business plan . ”
However , in the United States the term “ business proposal ” simply means a business offer .
Most “ business proposals ” are offers to buy a product or service , partner with a firm , work for a company , etc .
In the US , the term “ business proposal ” rarely relates specially to an offer to invest money in a business .
Rather , the term “ business plan ” is used for the document seeking others to invest money in a business .
What are the characteristics of a good business plan ?
A good plan has the following characteristics .
First , the plan is professional .
Investors often think if a company can’t even put together a professional business plan , how could they possibly build a professional and successful company .
Professional business plans are ones that visually look good , are concise and easy to read , and are free of typos .
The second characteristic of a good business plan is that it clearly explains why the company is uniquely qualified to succeed .
It shows past accomplishments the company has achieved and why it is likely to attain the milestones laid out in the plan .
The third quality of a solid plan is that it is backed up by third - party research .
This research should cover your industry , competitors and customers and show that the market supports the type of business you have .
The final quality of great business plan is that it includes realistic growth and financial projections that show , as accurately as possible , how the company might progress in the coming years .
What is the biggest mistake seen in business plans ?
The biggest mistake is that most writers do n’t understand that their business plan is a marketing document .
That is , your plan should convince others to invest in and / or otherwise get involved in your company .
That ’s not to say that your plan should n’t include hard facts and figures , a step - by - step growth plan , and realistic financial projections .
It should .
But it should also , if you are using your plan to seek outside funding , present your company in the best possible light .
It should NOT read like a boring document .
Rather , it should inspire and excite readers .
What must you avoid doing in business planning ?
Most investors and lenders are skeptical when reading business plans .
Since , if they ’ve been doing their jobs for a while , they ’ve seen thousands upon thousands of growth claims that were never realized .
Two ways to combat seeming overzealous are to limit or avoid superlatives and make reasonable financial growth projections .
With regards to superlatives , if you say we are the “ best ” management team , for example , you need to back that up with facts and figures .
Using phrases like best , world class and disruptive are great if they are true and can be backed up .
If not , avoid using them since readers most likely will have been burned by such false claims in past plans they ’ve funded .
In regard to reasonable financial growth projections , if , for example , no company has ever grown to $ 1 billion in revenues in 2 years , the likelihood that your company is going to do it is very small .
As such , temper your financial assumptions .
As much as possible , base your assumptions on actual fast - growth companies that have come before you .
In doing so , they will have much more credibility in the eyes of readers .
How does a startup business plan differ from a plan for an established company ?
Both startup business plans and plans for established companies must include the same sections and sub-sections outlined below .
The key difference is that , since they have longer operating histories , established companies should have more milestones / accomplishments to document .
Since the best indicator of future success is past success , it is critical to document such accomplishments in your plan .
Startups should also document the milestones they ’ve achieved to date , but this list clearly is going to be shorter than a company that ’s been operating for several years .
Is there anyone that can help me write my business plan ?
Yes , there are firms that specialize in writing business plans .
Our company , Growthink , has been a business plan consultant for over 20 years .
We specialize in writing business plans that ensure our clients have the best growth strategies and can help them raise funding if needed .

How can a business plan help raise funding ?
The two core tools used by entrepreneurs to raise funding are business plans and business or “ pitch ” presentations .
Oftentimes , entrepreneurs will send the Executive Summary portion of their plan to investors first .
If the investor is interested , they will then set up a meeting to discuss .
During that meeting , the entrepreneur will give a presentation to the investor .
After the presentation , if interested , the investor will generally request the full business plan from the entrepreneur .
This is so they can share the plan with their partners and fully vet it .
Does my plan differ if I ’m seeking business funding ?
Business plans that seek funding have three additional requirements that others do not .
These are as follows :
Clearly explain how much funding they are seeking and for what purposes Present realistic financial projections that show loan interest and principle can easily be repaid ( if the funding source is loan )
Present a reasonable exit plan for equity investors .
An exit plan details how the company will exit ( e.g. , IPO , sale to another company ) .
This is important as exits are how and when equity investors earn their returns .
What is best to attract investors , a business plan or a pitch deck ?
To attract investors , you need BOTH a business plan and a pitch desk .
As mentioned above , most commonly entrepreneurs submit the Executive Summary of their plan to get initial investor interest .
Then , the investor meets with the entrepreneur , during which the entrepreneur presents their pitch deck .
If still interested , the investor commonly requests the full plan so they can review it in detail themselves and with their partners ( who may not have been able to attend the pitch meeting ) .
What is the difference between a plan to show angel / seed / venture capital investors versus banks ?
Both business plans to show equity investors ( which include angel , seed and venture capital investors ) and plans to show banks must prove the viability of the company to grow and earn profits .
The key difference between the two is that banks care that the company will be able to successfully make interest payments and eventually pay off the principle .
Equity investors , on the other hand are interested in the company exiting ( IPO , selling the company ) since this is how they get paid on their investment .
As such , these investors want you to show likely exit opportunities ( e.g. , listing other companies in your industry who have been acquired and at what multiples of revenues or earning ) .
Such facts help paint the picture that your company will eventually exit , and they will earn a high Return on Investment on you .

The software will allow the sharing of music bought on iTunes
Jon Lech Johansen became the " enfant terrible " of the DRM industry when he released software which cracked the encryption codes on DVDs , aged just 15 .
His firm , DoubleTwist , has now released software allowing users to share digital media files across devices .
It would allow songs bought on Apple 's iTunes to be shared on other devices .
At the moment , the only portable music player which can store content downloaded from the iTunes store is Apple 's iPod .
Users can copy downloaded songs to a CD and then copy the disc back on to the computer so that the songs can then be moved to other portable devices - but the quality of the music is affected .
In 2003 Mr Johansen distributed a program which bypassed Apple 's Fairplay system , the software that enforces this relationship between iTunes and the iPod .
Since then he has had several other well - publicised run-ins with the firm .
Tower of Babel
The new software from his San Francisco - based company DoubleTwist will allow users to share both user - generated and professionally created music , photos and video clips between computers , mobiles and game consoles .
Media which lives on a computer can be moved to a variety of mobile devices by dragging and dropping the files to a desktop folder which then drops copies on the external device over the web .
Initially the system will allow file - sharing with Sony 's PSP games console , Nokia 's N - series mobile , Sony Ericsson 's Walkman and Cybershot handsets and Microsoft 's Windows Mobile smartphones .
The software converts media stored in one file format to those used by the other devices in a system that mimics the process of ripping a CD onto a computer .
One hundred songs can be converted in about half an hour , with a slight degradation in sound quality , according to the firm .
" With digital media such as video from a friend 's cell phone or your own iTunes playlists , it 's a jungle out there , " said Monique Farantzos , co-founder of DoubleTwist .
" The digital media landscape has become a tower of Babel , alienating and frustrating consumers .
Our goal is to provide a simple and well integrated solution that the average consumer can use to eliminate the headaches associated with their expanding digital universe , " she said .
The company is confident there will not be any legal challenges from Apple .
" All we are facilitating are friends sending things to one another , " Ms Farantzos told the Reuters news agency .
The software is available as a free download from the company 's website .
" We ca n't find Phil , " said Steve Prilliman of Dallas - based Hanson Robotics , which created the futuristic robot with the FedEx Institute of Technology at the University of Memphis , the Automation and Robotics Research Institute at the University of Texas at Arlington and Dick 's friend Paul Williams .
" We 're very worried because it 's been a few weeks now , " said Prilliman .
" We 're pressing hard to find Phil . "
Robotics wizard and lead designer David Hanson built the robot as a memorial to Dick , whose 1968 book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ?
inspired the 1982 classic Blade Runner starring Harrison Ford .
Short stories by Dick , who died in 1982 , served as inspiration for other hit films including the 1990 Total Recall , starring Arnold Schwarzenegger , and the 2002 Minority Report , starring Tom Cruise .
In Blade Runner , set in a Los Angeles of 2019 , Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckhard , a Blade Runner or policeman whose job is to track down and terminate escaped human clones known as " replicants . "
The irony of the situation -- a missing replica of the very author who championed " replicant " freedom -- is not lost on Phil 's creators .
But they still want him back .
" We really need to find him soon because the Smithsonian wants to put him in a travelling collection in the autumn , " said Prilliman referring to Washington 's Smithsonian Institute , an organisation of museums and art galleries .
Along with an eerie likeness to the author , the robot features award - winning artificial intelligence that mimics the writer 's mannerisms and lifelike skin material to affect realistic expressions .
Top - of - the - line voice software loaded with data from Dick 's vast body of writing allows the robot to carry on natural - sounding conversations , although it does come off as a bit doddering at times .
Biometric - identification software and advanced machine vision allows the robot to recognise people -- even in a crowd -- read their expressions and body language and talk to them sounding a lot like a normal , albeit slightly senile , author who likes to quote his own books when he gets confused .
Prilliman and others close to Phil baulked at giving too many details about his disappearance including the name of the airline that was transporting the robot when he went missing .
Hanson officials said news of Phil 's disappearance could hamper the ongoing investigation and search for the robot .
The company officials said they feared ransom demands might be made or Phil could turn up listed for sale on an internet auction house such as eBay .
A spokeswoman , Elaine Hanson , said the company is considering building a new android if the original Phil does not turn up .

SAN FRANCISCO 
The California Supreme Court ruled Monday that privately owned shopping malls cannot stop protesters from demonstrating there to urge a boycott of one of the tenants .
In a 4 - to - 3 decision , the court said a San Diego mall violated California law protecting free speech when its owners barred protesters from distributing leaflets in front of one of the mall ’s stores , asking shoppers not to give the store their business .
“ A shopping mall is a public forum in which persons may reasonably exercise their right to free speech , ” Justice Carlos R. Moreno wrote in the majority opinion .
Justice Moreno said shopping malls were entitled to enact and enforce “ reasonable regulations of the time , place and manner of such free expression , ” to avoid a disruption of business .
" We owe a great deal to Dr. Freeman - even if trouble does tend to follow in his wake . "

Gordon Freeman : Worst .
Scientist .
Ever .
The opening train ride of Half - Life may include several moments of quiet humor , but surely none of them have the slow payoff like Gordon 's Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from MIT and his " Level 3 " clearance .
He 's got a " big day ahead , " says the security guard who greets him at the lab entrance .
Yes , he does , the player soon realizes : put on a fancy radiation suit and push a cart a few feet into the dangerous energy beam , then take lunch .
Apparently Gordon just barely beat out a chimp with an English degree from Patrick Henry College for the job .
But hey , those student loans wo n't pay for themselves .
To its credit , Valve 's writing staff appears to be fully aware of the humor inherent in Gordon 's highly low - tech exploits .
In HL2 , for example , Barney jokes about Gordon 's education while the player performs the difficult task of flipping a switch .
But beneath this running gag , the Half - Life series ( and its crazy little sister , Portal ) betrays a kind of warm ambivalence toward scientific pursuits .
As an unapologetic fan of the Enlightenment , I find there 's a lot to admire about their implicit statements on the subject .
The Scientific Narrative
Frankenstein 's monster kills the good doctor in the end , just as the golem eventually slips from its maker 's control in the old Jewish tales .
The theme of progress gone awry has often been taken up by pulp fiction - a category happily inhabited by most game narratives .
And certainly , Half - Life and its sequels fall broadly into this category .
Following Gordon 's misguided attempt at manual labor and its disastrous consequences , the Earth is flooded with hostile alien creatures that eventually turn the world into the U.S.S.R. , circa 1963 .
The price of blue jeans no doubt skyrockets .
Yet while past tales of mad science have simplistically implied that there are places man was not meant to go , Black Mesa 's experiment does n't seem to set its scientists aback .
The staff that survives into Half - Life 2 - Drs. Kleiner , Vance , Magnusson and Mossman - continue their research , working to learn from the Combine invaders .
One has to wonder how the average City 17 citizen feels about that - the same scientists that brought the whole thing on ( even if they were prompted by the G - Man ) are still playing around with teleportation and zero - point energy fields ?
Perhaps they figure things can't get any worse , or maybe they just can't find their pitchforks and torches .
In any case , the game 's storyline does n't condemn science for its misuse by malevolent forces , which is kind of refreshing .
Wow , some friends .
Blackmail of an entire country ?
Saudi Arabia ’s rulers threatened to make it easier for terrorists to attack London unless corruption investigations into their arms deals were halted , according to court documents revealed yesterday .
Previously secret files describe how investigators were told they faced “ another 7/7 ” and the loss of “ British lives on British streets ” if they pressed on with their inquiries and the Saudis carried out their threat to cut off intelligence .
Prince Bandar , the head of the Saudi national security council , and son of the crown prince , was alleged in court to be the man behind the threats to hold back information about suicide bombers and terrorists .
He faces accusations that he himself took more than £ 1bn in secret payments from the arms company BAE .

A few days before Senator Barack Obama swept the Democratic primaries in Virginia , Maryland , and the District of Columbia , people across the country , picking up their favorite newspaper , were greeted with the following headline :
OLD FRIENDS SAY DRUGS PLAYED BIG PART IN OBAMA’S YOUNG LIFE
In any event , that ’s what some readers thought they read .
On second glance , they realized their mistake .
The headline actually said this :>
OLD FRIENDS SAY DRUGS PLAYED BIT PART IN OBAMA’S YOUNG LIFE
Maybe , though , the mistake was n’t just the readers ’ , especially the bleary - eyed among them who had n’t yet had their morning coffee .
After all , it was n’t exactly news that “ drugs ” had played a part ( and only a “ bit part ” at that ) in the adolescence of the junior senator from Illinois .
That particular factoid had been on the public record for more than twelve years .
And if it was n’t news , what was it doing on the front page of the New York Times ?
The big news , or bit news , about Obama and drugs had been broken by the future Presidential candidate himself , in “ Dreams from My Father , ” published in 1995 , when he was thirty - three years old .
In “ Dreams , ” Obama treats his teen - age chemical indulgences the way he treats pretty much everything else in his coming - of - age story : subtly , with impressive emotional acuity , against a richly drawn personal , cultural , and social background .
Ripped from their context like the heart of an Aztec sacrifice , the facts Obama presents are these :
He smoked pot during his last couple of years of high school , in Hawaii , and his first couple of years of college , at Occidental , in California .
Once in a while , he treated himself to “ a little blow . ”
After his sophomore year , he transferred east , to Columbia , where he took up running ( three miles a day ) , stopped hanging out in bars , and started keeping a journal .
Also , he writes , “ I quit getting high . ”
That ’s about all .
Substance , apparently , became more interesting to him than substance abuse .
But it ’s not as if the Times ’ nearly two thousand words had nothing to add to this .
“ Mr. Obama ’s account of his younger self and drugs , though , significantly differs from the recollections of others , ” the paper ’s story teases , as if promising scandal .
Is a Perry Mason moment at hand ?
Not really : >
In more than three dozen interviews , friends , classmates and mentors from his high school and Occidental recalled Mr. Obama as being grounded , motivated and poised , someone who did not appear to be grappling with any drug problems and seemed to dabble only with marijuana .
The news here is — what , exactly ?
That Obama , who now appears grounded , motivated , and poised , formerly appeared grounded , motivated , and poised ?
That his inner uncertainties , such as they were , were more apparent to himself than to others ?
That he was marginally less of a pothead than he has made himself out to be ?
If this last was the point , it at least shows that times have — to use the past participle of Obama ’s favorite word — changed .
For a candidate to stand accused of exaggerating his youthful drug use is something new indeed .
Yet the overall cultural trend is unmistakable .
In 1987 , Douglas H. Ginsburg ’s disclosure that ( as the Times reported ) “ he had smoked marijuana a number of times after becoming a professor at the Harvard Law School ” sank his Supreme Court nomination faster than you could just say no .
In 1992 , making an early foray into verbal hairsplitting , Bill Clinton said he had “ never broken a state law , ” meaning that England was where he had n’t inhaled .
By 2000 , we were well into the age of the “ experimented with marijuana ” dodge , with getting zonked spun as a science project .
But in 2004 the three leading Democratic hopefuls — John Kerry , Howard Dean , and John Edwards — all acknowledged without quibbling that they ’d smoked pot .
As for the two other senators who currently stand a chance of being elected President , Hillary Clinton and John McCain have issued denials , though McCain seemed downright apologetic about it .
Asked the question in 2000 , he pointed out that he was in a North Vietnamese prison camp by the time pot became the Navy ’s weed of choice when the smoking lamp was lit .
“ Also , ” he added sheepishly , “ remember my age : sixty - three . ”
And the current occupier of the Oval Office ?
Well , George W. Bush announced in 1999 that he had been drug free since 1974 .
None of this ought to matter , of course .
Voters , rightly , do n’t much seem to care .
But there is a glaring discontinuity between the lived experience of Americans and the drug policies of their governments .
Nearly a hundred million of us — forty per cent of the adult population , including pillars of the nation ’s political , financial , academic , and media élites — have smoked ( and , therefore , possessed ) marijuana at some point , thereby committing an offense that , with a bit of bad luck , could have resulted in humiliation , the loss of benefits such as college loans and scholarships , or worse .
More than forty thousand people are in jail for marijuana offenses , and some seven hundred thousand are arrested annually merely for possession .
Meanwhile , the percentage of high - school seniors who have used pot has remained steady , between forty and fifty per cent .
Nor have the prices of illicit drugs — which would rise sharply if the drug war were having any success — changed appreciably .
Indeed , according to the government ’s “ National Drug Threat Assessment ” for 2008 , increases in domestic pot production , combined with the continued flow from abroad , point to a future of “ market saturation , ” which “ could reduce the price of the drug significantly . ”
Meanwhile , potency has “ reached its highest recorded level . ”
Of all our country ’s ongoing wars — poverty , cancer , Iraq , Afghanistan — none is a more comprehensive disaster than the war on drugs .
Unlike McCain , Obama and Clinton have at least promised to stop the feds from harassing medical marijuana patients and dispensaries in the dozen states whose laws permit marijuana to be used for medical purposes .
But neither has given any indication of a willingness to rescue us from the larger disgrace of the drug war — the billions wasted , the millions harmed , the utter futility of it .
On this point , hesitancy trumps hope , and expedience trumps experience . ♦
' Crack ' nicotine in cigarettes varies widely
" Free - base " nicotine is a particularly potent form of the naturally - occurring tobacco drug because it is in an extremely volatile , uncombined form .
This means it can be much more rapidly absorbed by the lungs and brain than nicotine derivatives such as nornicotine or its salts .
The new study is the first into the amount of " free - base " nicotine contained in common brands of cigarettes and found wide - ranging differences .
The researchers at Oregon Health and Science University used a laboratory smoking device and a gas chromatograph - mass spectrometer to collect and analyse smoke from 11 brands of cigarettes .
The study measured the first three puffs of smoke from each cigarette .
" Measurements ranged from about one per cent free - base nicotine in the first few puffs to 36 per cent for a specialty US brand , " says lead researcher James Pankow .
" One type of Marlboro , the leading US brand of king - sized filter cigarettes , contained about 10 per cent free - base nicotine . "
Crack cocaine
" The study shows that the modern cigarette does to nicotine what crack does to cocaine , " says addiction expert Jack Henningfield , at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine .
The notorious addictiveness of smoking crack results from the vapourised cocaine reaching the brain almost immediately .
Ian Jones , a nicotine expert at Bath University , UK , adds : " Free - base nicotine is the most damaging form because it is the optimal configuration for binding to the nicotine receptors in the brain , heart and rest of the body .
If the binding efficiency is increased , it means the concentration of nicotine at the receptors is higher and so it is very addictive . "
" The first few puffs are the most important in terms of addiction , because nicotine reaches the brain within seconds , " Jones told New Scientist
Ammonia and urea
" There was tremendous amount of documentation revealed during litigation in the US of manipulation of the freebase levels and the FDA certainly believed there was manipulation of cigarette chemistry , " he adds .
" What is clear is that the modern cigarette is a highly engineered nicotine delivery device and it's not just a matter of tobacco rolled - up in a piece of paper , " Pankow says .
" Even the so - called ' additive - free ' cigarettes are highly engineered . "

This weekend marks Week 17 of the NFL season , which means that the playoffs are almost here -- and not a moment too soon .
I do n't know about you , but I love the NFL playoffs .
In a single - elimination tournament like this , every game is truly a life - or - death battle , and the different conditions posed by January weather only serve to add excitement to the games .
In short , the NFL Playoffs are great , and I cannot wait for them to get underway .
In this space last year , I had a weekly series on the NFL in which I would use a complicated mathematical formula to predict the winners and losers of each game .
It turned out to do a pretty decent job of picking the games ( until the Super Bowl , that is -- remind me why I picked the Bears again ? ) , but it was also pretty boring to me .
I figure that if you want a formula to predict winners , you can go to Football Outsiders or Jeff Sagarin , both of whom do a better job of picking games than I did anyway .
So with that in mind , I 'm going to change things up for this year 's playoffs .
Namely , I 'm going to run a COM - vs - COM sim of every matchup using Tecmo Super Bowl and the rosters found here ( with some tweaks to reflect current depth charts ) .
How realistic are these going to be in picking winners ?
Probably not very .
But it 's going to be a lot more fun .
I promise .
As a warm - up , this week I 'm going to sim out the games with playoff implications : Cleveland - San Francisco ( CLE needs a loss by Tennessee , or a win or tie and a Tennessee tie ) ; Tennessee - Indy ( TEN needs a win , or a tie and a Cleveland loss ) ; Washington - Dallas ( WAS needs a win , a tie and a Minnesota loss or tie , or a loss and a Minnesota loss and a New Orleans loss ) ; New Orleans - Chicago ( NOR needs a win and a Washington loss and a Minnesota loss ) ; and Minnesota - Denver ( MIN needs a win and a Washington loss ) .
So let 's get to it !
GAME OF THE WEEK : Cleveland vs. San Francisco
This one started out slow .
San Francisco went three - and - out on their first possession , and the teams traded turnovers ( a Mark Roman interception of Derek Anderson , a Frank Gore fumble , and another Anderson pick ) on the next 3 drives .
The 49ers would draw first blood off of Anderson 's 2nd INT , converting on a big 3rd - down to get in FG range and put 3 points on the board .
3 - 0 49ers .
Cleveland struck back quickly , though , after Jamal Lewis busted off a big run and Anderson hit Joe Jurevicius in stride for a long TD pass .
7 - 3 Browns .
But on the ensuing drive , a couple of Trent Dilfer completions led to a TD connection with Vernon Davis and a 3 - point lead for San Francisco .
10 - 7 49ers .
With time winding down in the 1st half , Anderson hit Jurevicius again for a long gain , at least partially atoning for his 2 earlier interceptions by setting up a game - tying Phil Dawson field goal as time expired .
10 - 10 tie .
The second half started out just like the first -- sloppy , with plenty of turnovers .
After a Cleveland punt to begin the 2nd half , Trent Dilfer was intercepted in San Francisco territory .
But instead of capitalizing on the mistake , Cleveland gave the ball right back when Anderson threw his third pick of the game , resulting in a touchback .
After SF went 3 - &- out , Anderson promptly tossed INT number four on the game , giving the Niners great field position as the third quarter came to a close .
After struggling with Dilfer 's passing throughout the third , San Francisco finally turned to Frank Gore in the 4th -- and the results were immediate .
Gore led off the drive by picking up a critical 3rd - down conversion , and then finished it off by sprinting 20 yards to paydirt for a go - ahead TD.
17-10 49ers .
Starting their drive with 3:37 to play , Cleveland got back into the game with just two plays : a flea - flicker from Anderson to Jurevicius on first - and - 10 , and a huge Jamal Lewis run that tied the game and gave playoff hope back to the hometown faithful .
17 - 17 tie .
After a big return on the ensuing kickoff , San Francisco looked poised to retake the lead , but an untimely sack pushed them to the outer limits of Joe Nedney 's FG range .
The kick was up ...
... And no good !
New life for Cleveland !
With under a minute to go , the fans even had reason to believe that Anderson might drive the Browns downfield for a shot at a game - winning FG ...
But after a big Jamal Lewis run , Anderson threw his fifth pick of the day , forcing the game to go to overtime .
Cleveland won the toss to start OT , but some things are just not meant to be ...
On the second play of the extra frame , Lewis coughed up the ball , giving SF possession in field goal range .
An Orpheus Roye sack almost pushed the Niners outside of Nedney 's preferred distance , but in a Dawson - esque twist , he was able to bounce the ball in off the upright for the game - winning kick .
20 - 17 49ers , final score .
New Orleans vs. Chicago
In a rematch of last year 's NFC Championship Game , the Saints find themselves clinging to the last vestiges of their playoff hopes ...
If they lose , it 's over .
However , they roared out of the gates here , returning a Chicago fumble for a TD on the game 's first play , and taking a 13 - point lead at halftime thanks to the passing of Drew Brees , the running of rookie Pierre Thomas , and an uncharacteristically solid defense that hassled Brian Griese every step of the way .
After a Griese interception set up a Martin Gramatica FG , the score at the midway point was 20 - 7 , Saints .
As it turns out , that halftime score would be the high point of the game for New Orleans .
Receiving the kick to start the 3rd quarter , Brees and the Saints continued to sling the ball downfield , but Brees got careless after several completions to Marques Colston and threw an interception .
Griese capitalized quickly on the turnover , hitting Bernard Berrian with a 60 - yard touchdown strike that cut New Orleans ' lead to six .
The teams traded punts and turnovers until midway through the 4th quarter , when Griese led the Bears ' offense onto the field with 2:44 to play for what was likely their final drive .
It would be a rare success story for Chicago 's offense this season :
On a critical 3rd down , Griese scrambled 10 yards to keep the drive alive .
Adrian Peterson then broke off a long run that put the Bears in New Orleans territory .
Finally , Griese capped the drive by connecting with Muhsin Muhammad on an 11 - yard TD that gave Chicago a 21 - 20 lead .
When the smoke cleared , the Bears had used up all but 0:38 on the clock , and Brees was unable to muster more than a single first down before the game ended .
With Chicago 's stirring comeback the Saints were eliminated from the playoff picture , ending a very disappointing year for them ( for both teams , actually ) .
21 -20 Bears , final score .
Minnesota vs. Denver
This one was never even close .
Jay Cutler threw an interception on his first pass of the game , and it was all downhill from there for Denver , as is usually the case when your QB turns the ball over four times .
Adrian Peterson and Troy Williamson each had a touchdown for Minnesota , and Ryan Longwell tacked on two field goals in the second half .
20 -0 Vikings , final score .
All the Vikings had to do now was to sit back and see if Dallas could hand Washington a loss ...
Washington vs. Dallas
With Dallas coach Wade Phillips sitting many of his best players , this game turned out to be a real snoozefest .
There was promise early after the teams traded TD runs in the first quarter ( by Marion Barber and Clinton Portis ) , but the 2nd and 3rd quarters saw no scoring and many punts , as each team abandoned the running game that had been somewhat successful in the early going .
After a Washington fumble to start the 4th , Dallas took a 14 - 7 lead when Barber broke 3 tackles on a spectacular TD run , and Washington quickly countered with a field goal that brought the Cowboys within striking distance , but Todd Collins fizzled late , throwing an interception on what could have been the game - winning drive .
With the loss ( and Minnesota 's win ) , Washington was eliminated from the playoff hunt .
14-10 Cowboys , final score .
Tennessee vs. Indianapolis
Indy coach Tony Dungy also sat the three guys who had been his most important players this season -- Peyton Manning , Joseph Addai , and Reggie Wayne -- but the Colts ' regular - season finale against Tennessee was hardly a boring affair .
During the first half , Jim Sorgi did his best Manning impression , connecting for an early TD with Marvin Harrison ( who was returning from a bruised left knee after missing nine games ) and leading another long drive that would have resulted in a 10 - 0 lead if not for Adam Vinatieri 's missed field goal .
At the same time , Indy 's D shut down Vince Young and the Titans offense throughout the first half , and the Colts led Tennessee 7 - 0 at the break .
Things changed quickly , though , as the Titans took the ball to start the 3rd quarter .
LenDale
White carried the load on the ground for Tennessee as they marched downfield , and Young finished off the game - tying drive by finding White in the end zone for a touchdown .
On the next drive , the Titans intercepted Sorgi 's first pass , setting up a Young - to - Roydell Williams connection that gave Tennessee a 14 - 7 lead .
Getting the ball back at the start of the 4th , Sorgi and the Colts were forced to go for it on 4th down with 3:45 remaining , a gamble that did n't pay off for Coach Dungy when they could n't convert .
Tennessee used the good field position to move down the field and set up a field goal that probably would have put the game out of reach ... but Titans kicker Rob Bironas shanked it , giving Indy another shot at a comeback with 2:01 left in the game .
The Colts would not squander this opportunity , as Sorgi ran the 2 - minute drill to perfection , ending the drive by hitting Anthony Gonzalez in the end zone with 8 seconds to spare , for a score that knotted the game at 14 apiece .
Indy won the toss to start overtime , and you could feel the life draining out of Tennessee 's players .
On the first play of OT , Sorgi went back to Gonzalez for a huge gain through the air , and after a couple of line plunges , Vinatieri stepped in and did what he does best -- hit game - winning field goals .
The loss knocked Tennessee out of the playoffs , sending Cleveland in despite their own overtime defeat against San Francisco .
17 - 14 Colts , final score .
So , to recap , here 's how Tecmo sees the playoff races shaking out :
IN : Minnesota , Cleveland
OUT : Washington , New Orleans , Tennessee
Check back next week for a whole new batch of Tecmo sims -- playoff - style !

An almost complete human skull fossil that could date back 100,000 years was unearthed in Henan last month , Chinese archaeologists announced Tuesday .
" It is the greatest discovery in China after the Peking Man and Upper Cave Man skull fossils were found in Beijing early last century , and will shed light on a critical period of human evolution , " said Shan Jixiang , director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage .
Pieces of the ancient human skull fossil are seen in this picture provided by State Administration of Cultural Heritage .
All the fossils from Beijing were lost during the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression ( 1937 - 45 ) .
The Henan find was made after two years of excavation at the site in Xuchang .
Archaeologists have worked on an area of 260 sq m , merely one - hundredth of the Paleolithic site .
" We expect more discoveries of importance , " said Li Zhanyang , archaeologist with the Henan cultural relics and archaeology research institute , who leads the excavation .
The fossil consisted of 16 pieces of the skull with protruding eyebrows and a small forehead .
More astonishing than the completeness of the skull is that it still has a fossilized membrane on the inner side , so scientists can track the nerves of the Paleolithic ancestors , Li said .
The pieces were fossilized because they were buried 5 m near the mouth of a spring , whose water had a high content of calcium .
Besides the skull , more than 30,000 animal fossils , and stone and bone artifacts were found in the small area in the past two years .
The pieces of the human skull showed up just when archaeologists were going home for the Spring Festival .
" It was freezing cold and digging was difficult .
We planned to leave the next day when one of us saw something like part of a human skull , " said Li .
" It was 9 am , and only an hour earlier we joked and said : ' Let 's get a skull today ' .
" And there it was . "
The Paleolithic site was discovered in 1965 , when IVPP scientists found animal fossils and stone artifacts from soil dug for a well .
Excavation started in June 2005 .
Earlier , human skull fossils discovered in the country were :
Five of the Peking Man in Beijing ( dating back 200,000 to 700,000 years ) .
Three of the Upper Cave Man , also in Beijing ( about 18,000 years ) .
One Jinniushan Man in Liaoning ( 150,000 years ) .
The physical element of Wii gaming has helped make it popular
It said that holding back adverts until 2008 would be a " responsible " move .
It now expects to have sold 17.5 million of the consoles worldwide in the year to March 2008 - up from the 14 million it had earlier forecast .
Nintendo is likely to use its advertising slots to promote its handheld DS console , analysts say .
' Act responsibly '
Globally , the firm is able to make about 1.8 million of the Wii consoles every month .
But it said that the demand had been " unprecedented and higher than Nintendo could ever have anticipated " .
" We are doing everything possible to supply continued levels of stock and meet demand as quickly as possible , " the spokesman added .
" As we are keen to act responsibly we are potentially looking at moving some advertising on some products into early 2008 . "
It is understood that because the television commercials do not have a festive flavour , they will be able to be used next year .
Demand for the Wii could mean disappointment for those putting it at the top of their Christmas list .
High Street retailers are struggling to keep up with demand and websites have been set up to help shoppers find out when stock becomes available .
Last month
Sony said that it was taking advantage of Nintendo Wii shortages and a recent price cut of its PlayStation 3 console to double weekly sales of the PlayStation in the US .
Hillary Clinton has been a much better senator than Barack Obama .
She has been a serious , substantive lawmaker who has worked effectively across party lines .
Obama has some accomplishments under his belt , but many of his colleagues believe that he has not bothered to master the intricacies of legislation or the maze of Senate rules .
He talks about independence , but he has never quite bucked liberal orthodoxy or party discipline .
If Clinton were running against Obama for Senate , it would be easy to choose between them .
But they are running for president , and the presidency requires a different set of qualities .
Presidents are buffeted by sycophancy , criticism and betrayal .
They must improvise amid a thousand fluid crises .
They ’re isolated and also exposed , puffed up on the outside and hollowed out within .
With the presidency , character and self - knowledge matter more than even experience .
There are reasons to think that , among Democrats , Obama is better prepared for this madness .
Many of the best presidents in U.S. history had their character forged before they entered politics and carried to it a degree of self - possession and tranquillity that was impervious to the Sturm und Drang of White House life .
Obama is an inner-directed man in a profession filled with insecure outer - directed ones .
He was forged by the process of discovering his own identity from the scattered facts of his childhood , a process that is described in finely observed detail in “ Dreams From My Father . ”
Once he completed that process , he has been astonishingly constant .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy , facing a tide of criticism over his call for schoolchildren to “ adopt ” Jewish child victims of the Holocaust , hit back on Friday saying France had to raise children “ with open eyes ” .

In a speech praising faith that also drew fire from secularists , Sarkozy told France ’s Jewish community on Wednesday that every 10 - year - old schoolchild should be “ entrusted with the memory of a French child victim of the Holocaust ” .
The proposal unleashed a storm of protest from teachers , psychologists and his political foes who said it would unfairly burden children with the guilt of previous generations and some could be traumatized by identifying with a Holocaust victim .
More than 11,100 French Jewish children were deported from France to Auschwitz and other Nazi death camps in eastern Europe during the German World War Two occupation .
“ The emotional burden can have negative consequences for a child who is developing , ” Gilles Moindrot , general secretary of the Snuipp - FSU trade union which represents most primary school teachers , said in a statement .
“ One can not place on a child of 11 the responsibility for what happened back then . ”
The EMDH children ’s rights group said : “ No educational project should be constructed on death . ”
But Sarkozy , speaking in Perigueux in central France , brushed off the uproar .
“ It is ignorance that produces abominable situations .
It is not knowledge , ” he said in a speech .
“ Let us make our children , children with open eyes who are not complacent . ”

“ Believe me , you will not traumatize children by giving them the gift of the memory of a country ...
Any psychologist will tell you : you have to tell a child the truth , ” he said .
With Sarkozy ’s popularity ratings already at a low point , the controversy could further hurt his political standing only a month before key local elections when France will deliver its first judgment on his nine months in office .
AMMUNITION FOR FOES
The clamor gave fresh ammunition to Sarkozy ’s political foes , who charge him with erratic behavior and say his hyperactivity masks a lack of real policies .
“ Really this president is extraordinary !
One day he is preaching God to us ...
Now he has suddenly become a teacher .
He is deciding what ’s a good and what ’s a bad way to go about educating young children , ” fumed left - wing Senator Jean - Luc Melenchon .
But Sarkozy won support from opposition Socialist leader Francois Hollande and the president ’s conservative UMP party rallied in support .
Education Minister Xaviet Darcos assured people the project would be handled in a practical , low - profile way .
“ We wo n’t be putting a policeman in each classroom , ” he told reporters .
The storm around the Holocaust proposal coincided with publication of a new poll that suggested Sarkozy ’s public romancing of supermodel - turned - singer Carla Bruni was the factor that had hurt his national image most .
Sarkozy and Bruni married secretly earlier this month but his critics saw the highly - publicized affair as a distraction too early in office .
The OpinionWay poll , conducted on the Internet for le Figaro and news channel LCI , found 82 percent of respondents believed Sarkozy ’s private life fell short of that of a head of state .

The day after George Bush was re-elected , the British tabloid Daily Mirror ran an infamous headline that echoed the thoughts of a great many people .
" How can 59,054,087 people be so DUMB ? " it screamed .
The Guardian 's G2 section ran a more measured ( and , for those of us revelled in their discomfiture , infinitely funnier ) front page of funereal black , broken only by the two tiny words , " Oh , God " .
There 's no doubt , though , that the passing of Bush Jr. will be greeted with relief far beyond the narrow confines of the British left , from which both papers traditionally hail .
The good news for Americans and foreign observers alike is that most of the obvious lunatics and blowhards have now been winnowed out of the process .
Whichever of the final three candidates is elected President in November , they will , if nothing else , not be Mitt Romney .
( We all enjoyed the gratuitous swipe at France in his gloriously over - the - top concession speech last week , but does anyone outside his family really believe that only President Romney could preserve America 's superpower status ? )
What follows is a short synopsis of Dee Hon ’s great article in the November 23rd issue of Adbusters .
Hedge fund masterminds , who command salaries in the tens of millions ( for their supposed financial prescience ) did something very stupid .
They bet their investors ' multi-billions on the belief that subprime borrowers , with lower incomes and / or rotten credit histories , would miraculously find a way to pay back loans that too much exceed what they earn .
But these sub - prime borrowers failed to find that miraculous way , and now surging loan defaults are sending shockwaves through the markets .
Yet despite the turmoil that this collapse is wreaking , it 's just the first ripple to hit the shore .
America 's debt crisis is far worse than most people know .
How did it come to this ?
How did America , collectively and as individuals , become a nation addicted to debt -- pushed to , and often over , the edge of bankruptcy ?
The savings rate in America hangs below zero .
Personal bankruptcies are reaching record numbers .
America 's total debt averages more than $ 160,000 for every man , woman , and child .
China holds nearly $ 1 trillion in US debt .
Japan and other countries are also owed big .
And it seems they will be paid back in currency that is worth ever less than the currency they used to buy these many treasury certificates they hold .
=======================
The story begins with labor .
The decades following World War II were boom years .
Economic growth was strong , and powerful industrial unions made the middle - class dream attainable for working - class citizens .
Workers bought homes and cars in such volume that they gave rise to the modern suburb .
However , prosperity for wage earners reached its peak in the early 1970s .
By then , corporate America had begun shredding the implicit social contract it had with its workers , pressured by the reality of tough foreign competition to do so .
Companies cut costs by finding cheap labor overseas , thereby forcing down wages at home .
By 1972 , wages had reached their peak .
According to the US department of Labor Statistics , workers then earned $ 331 a week , in inflation - adjusted 1982 dollars .
Since then , however , it 's been a downward slide .
Today , real wages are nearly 20 % less – despite the fact that real GDP - per-capita doubled over the same period .
What this means is that instead of reducing the length of the workweek by half ( for those of us who wished to consume no more than we did in 1972 ) , we were , on average , having to work either 20 % longer or 20 % harder , just to stay even , materially , with where we were at in 1972 !
And if we wanted to exceed the consumption levels we enjoyed in 1972 , many of us needed to go heavily into debt . . by way of ever - abundant credit card offers and sub - prime mortgages . )
Even as wages fell , consumerism was encouraged to continue soaring , to unprecedented heights .
Buying stuff became a patriotic duty that distinguished us from our communist Cold War enemies .
In the eighties , consumers ' growing fearlessness towards debt , plus their hunger for goods , were met with Ronald Reagan 's deregulation of the lending industry .
Credit not only became more easily attainable , it became heavily marketed .
Credit card debt , now standing at nearly a trillion dollars , is more than triple what it was in 1988 , after adjusting for inflation .
Barbecues and TV screens are now the size of small cars .
So much the better to fill the average new home , which even in 2005 was more than 50 percent larger than the average home in 1973 .
( Keep in mind , however , that the McMansions and the large second - homes of the rich greatly drive up today ’s average home size .
Forty percent of all new homes being purchased these days are second homes for the rich . )
This is all great news for the corporate sector , which both earns money from loans to consumers , and profits from their spending .
Better still , lower wages means lower costs and higher profits .
=======================
Given a choice between working for diminishing returns and joining the leisurely riches of the rentier / investor , people tend to pursue the latter , to whatever extent they can .
People of all professions sought to have their money work for them , and poured their savings into investments .
This spurred the explosion of the finance industry , and greatly profited the people who manage money for others .
The now - $ 10 trillion mutual fund industry is 700 times the size it was in the 1970s .
Hedge funds , the money managers for the super - rich , numbered 500 companies in 1990 , managing $ 38 billion in assets .
Now there are more than 6,000 hedge fund firms handling more than $ 1 trillion dollars in assets .
In recent years , the further enticement of low interest rates has spawned a boom for two kinds of “ rentiers ” who are at the root of the current debt crisis : home buyers and private equity firms .
But it should also be noted that low interest rates are themselves the product of outsourced labor .
And why is that ?
America gets goods from China .
China gets dollars from the US .
In order to keep the value of their currency low so that exports stay cheap , China does n't spend those dollars in China , but buys US assets like bonds .
China now holds nearly a trillion American dollars in such IOUs .
This massive borrowing of money from China ( and to a lesser extent , from Japan ) sent our interest rates to record lows .
And this is what led to the trouble we are in today : Cheap borrowing costs encouraged millions of Americans to borrow more , buying homes and sending housing prices to record highs .
Soaring house prices encouraged banks to loan freely , which sent even more buyers into the market -- many believed the hype that real estate investment offered a never - ending escalator to riches , and borrowed heavily to finance their dreams of getting ahead .
They also began borrowing against the skyrocketing value of their homes , to buy furniture , appliances , and TVs .
By this means these home equity loans added $ 200 billion to the US economy in 2004 alone .
It was all so wonderful .
The boom would feed on itself .
America could produce ever less stuff of any real value , internationally -- for apparently all that needed to be done was to keep buying and selling each other 's houses and businesses , with money borrowed largely from the Chinese .
( A slight exaggeration , but still instructive . )
On Wall Street , private equity firms played a similar game : buying companies with borrowed billions , sacking employees to cut costs , and then selling the companies to someone else who did the same .
These leveraged buyouts inflated share values , producing billionaires all around .
The virtues that usually produce profit ( i.e. innovation , entrepreneurialism and good management ) stopped mattering , so long as there were bountiful capital gains .
Problem is , the party is coming to a halt .
An endless housing boom requires an endless supply of ever - greater suckers to use , all of them borrowing heavily to pay ever more for the very same homes that their parents might have purchased for much less .
( The rich , as Voltaire said , require an abundant supply of the poor .
And the more suckers among them , the better . )
Unscrupulous mortgage lenders have mined ever deeper into the ranks of these poor shlubs , to find suckers for the loans they wanted to issue .
Chief among their shady practices were teaser loans that promised low interest rates which rose nicely after the first few years .
Less - than - desirable ( sub - prime ) borrowers , suckers all , were told the future pain would never come , since they could keep re-financing against the ever - growing value of their homes .
Lenders then repackaged these shaky loans as bonds ( “ collateralized debt obligations ” ) to sell to cash - hungry investors like hedge funds .
Conveniently , the Bush - appointed heads of regulatory agencies were looking the other way .
As with any pyramid / Ponzi scheme , however , the supply of suckers inevitably ran out .
Housing prices leveled off , beginning what promises to be a long , downward slide .
And just as the housing boom fed upon itself , so too , will its collapse :
The first wave of sub - prime borrowers have already defaulted and the resulting flood of foreclosures sent housing prices falling further .
Lenders somehow got blindsided by news that , in the face of jacked - up interest rates , poor people with bad credit were n’t able to pay back fast enough on what they had borrowed .
Frightened , lenders stopped the flow of easy credit , inadvertently reducing the supply of homebuyers still further .
Hedge funds that merrily bought sub - prime loans collapsed .

The government or View results Recession - Proof Your Life
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
As anyone who 's been to the gas station or supermarket lately knows , the prices of fuel and food are on the rise .
And you have n't seen anything yet , some experts say .
Gasoline now costs an average of $ 3.15 a gallon , seven cents shy of the record set last May , according to AAA .
But with crude oil prices setting a new trading high of $ 102.08 a barrel on Wednesday , it 's only a matter of time before drivers see it hit another record at the pump .
Within a few weeks , gas could cost $ 3.50 a gallon and , by spring , the price could hit $ 4 in some locations , said Peter Beutel , an oil analyst at the consultancy Cameron Hanover .
The high cost of gas is helping fuel a surge in food prices .
Higher transportation expenses , along with growing demand for agricultural exports from the United States and increasing need for corn - based ethanol for gas supplies , has sent commodity costs soaring .
Last week , the federal government reported that the Consumer Price Index rose a greater - than - expected 0.4 % in January and 4.3 % over the past 12 months , mainly because of higher food and energy costs .
Food and beverages jumped 4.8 % for the year and transportation soared 9.4 % .
A bushel of yellow corn , for instance , cost an average of $ 5.12 in January , up 41 % from a year earlier , according to U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics .
Not only does this contribute to the higher prices of food made from corn , but it increases farmers ' cost of feeding cattle and pigs .
Though prices have been climbing for the last few years , consumers did n't feel it as much in the past because their home values were soaring .
" But now , with housing prices having gone down , credit becoming tighter and prices of necessities like food and energy going up sharply , it 's created quite a squeeze on consumers ' disposable income , " said Maria Fiorini Ramirez , head of economic consulting firm MFR Inc .
The surge in gas prices has forced Kenny Khan to cut back his weekly 100 - mile visits to his sister in Cherry Hill , N.J. , to once a month .
" It costs me $ 50 in gas to visit her , said Khan , 52 , who lives in Teaneck , N.J. , and manages a gas station in midtown Manhattan .
" As a salaried consumer , I can't afford that much for recreation . "
Economists fear a continued slowdown in consumer spending will further weaken the economy .
The Federal Reserve 's rate cuts wo n't lessen this inflation , said food price expert John Norris , managing director at Oakworth Capital Bank .
As long as the dollar remains weak , the global demand for American exports will remain high .
" Consumers should build into their budgets continued increases , " Norris said .
Later in the year , however , oil prices could ease since supplies from both OPEC and non-OPEC sources are expected to increase , said Sara Banaszak , senior economist at the American Petroleum Institute .
Staff Writers Catherine Clifford and Steve Hargreaves contributed to this report .

In The Constitution of Liberty ( Chicago : The University of Chicago Press , 1960 )
" At all times sincere friends of freedom have been rare , and its triumphs have been due to minorities , that have prevailed by associating themselves with auxiliaries whose objects often differed from their own ; and this association , which is always dangerous , has sometimes been disastrous , by giving to opponents just grounds of opposition . "
~ Lord Acton
1 . At a time when most movements that are thought to be progressive advocate further encroachments on individual liberty , [ 1 ] those who cherish freedom are likely to expend their energies in opposition .
In this they find themselves much of the time on the same side as those who habitually resist change .
In matters of current politics today they generally have little choice but to support the conservative parties .
But , though the position I have tried to define is also often described as " conservative , " it is very different from that to which this name has been traditionally attached .
There is danger in the confused condition which brings the defenders of liberty and the true conservatives together in common opposition to developments which threaten their ideals equally .
It is therefore important to distinguish clearly the position taken here from that which has long been known  perhaps more appropriately  as conservatism .
Conservatism proper is a legitimate , probably necessary , and certainly widespread attitude of opposition to drastic change .
It has , since the French Revolution , for a century and a half played an important role in European politics .
Until the rise of socialism its opposite was liberalism .
There is nothing corresponding to this conflict in the history of the United States , because what in Europe was called " liberalism " was here the common tradition on which the American polity had been built : thus the defender of the American tradition was a liberal in the European sense .
[ 2 ]
This already existing confusion was made worse by the recent attempt to transplant to America the European type of conservatism , which , being alien to the American tradition , has acquired a somewhat odd character .
And some time before this , American radicals and socialists began calling themselves " liberals . "
I will nevertheless continue for the moment to describe as liberal the position which I hold and which I believe differs as much from true conservatism as from socialism .
Let me say at once , however , that I do so with increasing misgivings , and I shall later have to consider what would be the appropriate name for the party of liberty .
The reason for this is not only that the term " liberal " in the United States is the cause of constant misunderstandings today , but also that in Europe the predominant type of rationalistic liberalism has long been one of the pacemakers of socialism .
Let me now state what seems to me the decisive objection to any conservatism which deserves to be called such .
It is that by its very nature it cannot offer an alternative to the direction in which we are moving .
It may succeed by its resistance to current tendencies in slowing down undesirable developments , but , since it does not indicate another direction , it cannot prevent their continuance .
It has , for this reason , invariably been the fate of conservatism to be dragged along a path not of its own choosing .
The tug of war between conservatives and progressives can only affect the speed , not the direction , of contemporary developments .
But , though there is a need for a " brake on the vehicle of progress , " [ 3 ]
I personally cannot be content with simply helping to apply the brake .
What the liberal must ask , first of all , is not how fast or how far we should move , but where we should move .
In fact , he differs much more from the collectivist radical of today than does the conservative .
While the last generally holds merely a mild and moderate version of the prejudices of his time , the liberal today must more positively oppose some of the basic conceptions which most conservatives share with the socialists .
2 . The picture generally given of the relative position of the three parties does more to obscure than to elucidate their true relations .
They are usually represented as different positions on a line , with the socialists on the left , the conservatives on the right , and the liberals somewhere in the middle .
Nothing could be more misleading .
If we want a diagram , it would be more appropriate to arrange them in a triangle with the conservatives occupying one corner , with the socialists pulling toward the second and the liberals toward the third .
But , as the socialists have for a long time been able to pull harder , the conservatives have tended to follow the socialist rather than the liberal direction and have adopted at appropriate intervals of time those ideas made respectable by radical propaganda .
It has been regularly the conservatives who have compromised with socialism and stolen its thunder .
Advocates of the Middle Way [ 4 ] with no goal of their own , conservatives have been guided by the belief that the truth must lie somewhere between the extremes  with the result that they have shifted their position every time a more extreme movement appeared on either wing .
The position which can be rightly described as conservative at any time depends , therefore , on the direction of existing tendencies .
Since the development during the last decades has been generally in a socialist direction , it may seem that both conservatives and liberals have been mainly intent on retarding that movement .
But the main point about liberalism is that it wants to go elsewhere , not to stand still .
Though today the contrary impression may sometimes be caused by the fact that there was a time when liberalism was more widely accepted and some of its objectives closer to being achieved , it has never been a backward - looking doctrine .
There has never been a time when liberal ideals were fully realized and when liberalism did not look forward to further improvement of institutions .
Liberalism is not averse to evolution and change ; and where spontaneous change has been smothered by government control , it wants a great deal of change of policy .
So far as much of current governmental action is concerned , there is in the present world very little reason for the liberal to wish to preserve things as they are .
It would seem to the liberal , indeed , that what is most urgently needed in most parts of the world is a thorough sweeping away of the obstacles to free growth .
This difference between liberalism and conservatism must not be obscured by the fact that in the United States it is still possible to defend individual liberty by defending long - established institutions .
To the liberal they are valuable not mainly because they are long established or because they are American but because they correspond to the ideals which he cherishes .
3 . Before I consider the main points on which the liberal attitude is sharply opposed to the conservative one , I ought to stress that there is much that the liberal might with advantage have learned from the work of some conservative thinkers .
To their loving and reverential study of the value of grown institutions we owe ( at least outside the field of economics ) some profound insights which are real contributions to our understanding of a free society .
However reactionary in politics such figures as Coleridge , Bonald , De Maistre , Justus Möser , or Donoso Cortès may have been , they did show an understanding of the meaning of spontaneously grown institutions such as language , law , morals , and conventions that anticipated modern scientific approaches and from which the liberals might have profited .
But the admiration of the conservatives for free growth generally applies only to the past .
They typically lack the courage to welcome the same undesigned change from which new tools of human endeavors will emerge .
This brings me to the first point on which the conservative and the liberal dispositions differ radically .
As has often been acknowledged by conservative writers , one of the fundamental traits of the conservative attitude is a fear of change , a timid distrust of the new as such , [ 5 ] while the liberal position is based on courage and confidence , on a preparedness to let change run its course even if we cannot predict where it will lead .
There would not be much to object to if the conservatives merely disliked too rapid change in institutions and public policy ; here the case for caution and slow process is indeed strong .
But the conservatives are inclined to use the powers of government to prevent change or to limit its rate to whatever appeals to the more timid mind .
In looking forward , they lack the faith in the spontaneous forces of adjustment which makes the liberal accept changes without apprehension , even though he does not know how the necessary adaptations will be brought about .
It is , indeed , part of the liberal attitude to assume that , especially in the economic field , the self - regulating forces of the market will somehow bring about the required adjustments to new conditions , although no one can foretell how they will do this in a particular instance .
There is perhaps no single factor contributing so much to people ’s frequent reluctance to let the market work as their inability to conceive how some necessary balance , between demand and supply , between exports and imports , or the like , will be brought about without deliberate control .
The conservative feels safe and content only if he is assured that some higher wisdom watches and supervises change , only if he knows that some authority is charged with keeping the change " orderly . "
This fear of trusting uncontrolled social forces is closely related to two other characteristics of conservatism : its fondness for authority and its lack of understanding of economic forces .
Since it distrusts both abstract theories and general principles , [ 6 ] it neither understands those spontaneous forces on which a policy of freedom relies nor possesses a basis for formulating principles of policy .
Order appears to the conservative as the result of the continuous attention of authority , which , for this purpose , must be allowed to do what is required by the particular circumstances and not be tied to rigid rule .
A commitment to principles presupposes an understanding of the general forces by which the efforts of society are co-ordinated , but it is such a theory of society and especially of the economic mechanism that conservatism conspicuously lacks .
So unproductive has conservatism been in producing a general conception of how a social order is maintained that its modern votaries , in trying to construct a theoretical foundation , invariably find themselves appealing almost exclusively to authors who regarded themselves as liberal .
Macaulay , Tocqueville , Lord Acton , and Lecky certainly considered themselves liberals , and with justice ; and even Edmund Burke remained an Old Whig to the end and would have shuddered at the thought of being regarded as a Tory .
Let me return , however , to the main point , which is the characteristic complacency of the conservative toward the action of established authority and his prime concern that this authority be not weakened , rather than that its power be kept within bounds .
This is difficult to reconcile with the preservation of liberty .
In general , it can probably be said that the conservative does not object to coercion or arbitrary power so long as it is used for what he regards as the right purposes .
He believes that if government is in the hands of decent men , it ought not to be too much restricted by rigid rules .
Since he is essentially opportunist and lacks principles , his main hope must be that the wise and the good will rule  not merely by example , as we all must wish , but by authority given to them and enforced by them . [ 7 ]
Like the socialist , he is less concerned with the problem of how the powers of government should be limited than with that of who wields them ; and , like the socialist , he regards himself as entitled to force the value he holds on other people .
When I say that the conservative lacks principles , I do not mean to suggest that he lacks moral conviction .
The typical conservative is indeed usually a man of very strong moral convictions .
What I mean is that he has no political principles which enable him to work with people whose moral values differ from his own for a political order in which both can obey their convictions .
It is the recognition of such principles that permits the coexistence of different sets of values that makes it possible to build a peaceful society with a minimum of force .
The acceptance of such principles means that we agree to tolerate much that we dislike .
There are many values of the conservative which appeal to me more than those of the socialists ; yet for a liberal the importance he personally attaches to specific goals is no sufficient justification for forcing others to serve them .
I have little doubt that some of my conservative friends will be shocked by what they will regard as " concessions " to modern views that I have made in Part III of this book .
But , though I may dislike some of the measures concerned as much as they do and might vote against them , I know of no general principles to which I could appeal to persuade those of a different view that those measures are not permissible in the general kind of society which we both desire .
To live and work successfully with others requires more than faithfulness to one ’s concrete aims .
It requires an intellectual commitment to a type of order in which , even on issues which to one are fundamental , others are allowed to pursue different ends .
It is for this reason that to the liberal neither moral nor religious ideals are proper objects of coercion , while both conservatives and socialists recognize no such limits .
I sometimes feel that the most conspicuous attribute of liberalism that distinguishes it as much from conservatism as from socialism is the view that moral beliefs concerning matters of conduct which do not directly interfere with the protected sphere of other persons do not justify coercion .
This may also explain why it seems to be so much easier for the repentant socialist to find a new spiritual home in the conservative fold than in the liberal .
In the last resort , the conservative position rests on the belief that in any society there are recognizably superior persons whose inherited standards and values and position ought to be protected and who should have a greater influence on public affairs than others .
The liberal , of course , does not deny that there are some superior people  he is not an egalitarian  but he denies that anyone has authority to decide who these superior people are .
While the conservative inclines to defend a particular established hierarchy and wishes authority to protect the status of those whom he values , the liberal feels that no respect for established values can justify the resort to privilege or monopoly or any other coercive power of the state in order to shelter such people against the forces of economic change .
Though he is fully aware of the important role that cultural and intellectual elites have played in the evolution of civilization , he also believes that these elites have to prove themselves by their capacity to maintain their position under the same rules that apply to all others .
Closely connected with this is the usual attitude of the conservative to democracy .
I have made it clear earlier that I do not regard majority rule as an end but merely as a means , or perhaps even as the least evil of those forms of government from which we have to choose .
But I believe that the conservatives deceive themselves when they blame the evils of our time on democracy .
The chief evil is unlimited government , and nobody is qualified to wield unlimited power . [ 8 ]
The powers which modern democracy possesses would be even more intolerable in the hands of some small elite .
Admittedly , it was only when power came into the hands of the majority that further limitations of the power of government was thought unnecessary .
In this sense democracy and unlimited government are connected .
But it is not democracy but unlimited government that is objectionable , and I do not see why the people should not learn to limit the scope of majority rule as well as that of any other form of government .
At any rate , the advantages of democracy as a method of peaceful change and of political education seem to be so great compared with those of any other system that I can have no sympathy with the antidemocratic strain of conservatism .
It is not who governs but what government is entitled to do that seems to me the essential problem .
That the conservative opposition to too much government control is not a matter of principle but is concerned with the particular aims of government is clearly shown in the economic sphere .
Conservatives usually oppose collectivist and directivist measures in the industrial field , and here the liberals will often find allies in them .
But at the same time conservatives are usually protectionists and have frequently supported socialist measures in agriculture .
Indeed , though the restrictions which exist today in industry and commerce are mainly the result of socialist views , the equally important restrictions in agriculture were usually introduced by conservatives at an even earlier date .
And in their efforts to discredit free enterprise many conservative leaders have vied with the socialists . [ 9 ]
4 . I have already referred to the differences between conservatism and liberalism in the purely intellectual field , but I must return to them because the characteristic conservative attitude here not only is a serious weakness of conservatism but tends to harm any cause which allies itself with it .
Conservatives feel instinctively that it is new ideas more than anything else that cause change .
But , from its point of view rightly , conservatism fears new ideas because it has no distinctive principles of its own to oppose them ; and , by its distrust of theory and its lack of imagination concerning anything except that which experience has already proved , it deprives itself of the weapons needed in the struggle of ideas .
Unlike liberalism , with its fundamental belief in the long - range power of ideas , conservatism is bound by the stock of ideas inherited at a given time .
And since it does not really believe in the power of argument , its last resort is generally a claim to superior wisdom , based on some self - arrogated superior quality .
The difference shows itself most clearly in the different attitudes of the two traditions to the advance of knowledge .
Though the liberal certainly does not regard all change as progress , he does regard the advance of knowledge as one of the chief aims of human effort and expects from it the gradual solution of such problems and difficulties as we can hope to solve .
Without preferring the new merely because it is new , the liberal is aware that it is of the essence of human achievement that it produces something new ; and he is prepared to come to terms with new knowledge , whether he likes its immediate effects or not .
Personally , I find that the most objectionable feature of the conservative attitude is its propensity to reject well - substantiated new knowledge because it dislikes some of the consequences which seem to follow from it  or , to put it bluntly , its obscurantism .
I will not deny that scientists as much as others are given to fads and fashions and that we have much reason to be cautious in accepting the conclusions that they draw from their latest theories .
But the reasons for our reluctance must themselves be rational and must be kept separate from our regret that the new theories upset our cherished beliefs .
I can have little patience with those who oppose , for instance , the theory of evolution or what are called " mechanistic " explanations of the phenomena of life because of certain moral consequences which at first seem to follow from these theories , and still less with those who regard it as irrelevant or impious to ask certain questions at all .
By refusing to face the facts , the conservative only weakens his own position .
Frequently the conclusions which rationalist presumption draws from new scientific insights do not at all follow from them .
But only by actively taking part in the elaboration of the consequences of new discoveries do we learn whether or not they fit into our world picture and , if so , how .
Should our moral beliefs really prove to be dependent on factual assumptions shown to be incorrect , it would hardly be moral to defend them by refusing to acknowledge facts .
Connected with the conservative distrust if the new and the strange is its hostility to internationalism and its proneness to a strident nationalism .
Here is another source of its weakness in the struggle of ideas .
It cannot alter the fact that the ideas which are changing our civilization respect no boundaries .
But refusal to acquaint one ’s self with new ideas merely deprives one of the power of effectively countering them when necessary .
The growth of ideas is an international process , and only those who fully take part in the discussion will be able to exercise a significant influence .
It is no real argument to say that an idea is un-American , or un -German , nor is a mistaken or vicious ideal better for having been conceived by one of our compatriots .
A great deal more might be said about the close connection between conservatism and nationalism , but I shall not dwell on this point because it might be felt that my personal position makes me unable to sympathize with any form of nationalism .
I will merely add that it is this nationalistic bias which frequently provides the bridge from conservatism to collectivism : to think in terms of " our " industry or resource is only a short step away from demanding that these national assets be directed in the national interest .
But in this respect the Continental liberalism which derives from the French Revolution is little better than conservatism .
I need hardly say that nationalism of this sort is something very different from patriotism and that an aversion to nationalism is fully compatible with a deep attachment to national traditions .
But the fact that I prefer and feel reverence for some of the traditions of my society need not be the cause of hostility to what is strange and different .
Only at first does it seem paradoxical that the anti-internationalism of conservatism is so frequently associated with imperialism .
But the more a person dislikes the strange and thinks his own ways superior , the more he tends to regard it as his mission to " civilize " other [ 10 ]  not by the voluntary and unhampered intercourse which the liberal favors , but by bringing them the blessings of efficient government .
It is significant that here again we frequently find the conservatives joining hands with the socialists against the liberals  not only in England , where the Webbs and their Fabians were outspoken imperialists , or in Germany , where state socialism and colonial expansionism went together and found the support of the same group of " socialists of the chair , " but also in the United States , where even at the time of the first Roosevelt it could be observed : " the Jingoes and the Social Reformers have gotten together ; and have formed a political party , which threatened to capture the Government and use it for their program of Caesaristic paternalism , a danger which now seems to have been averted only by the other parties having adopted their program in a somewhat milder degree and form . " [ 11 ]
5 . There is one respect , however , in which there is justification for saying that the liberal occupies a position midway between the socialist and the conservative : he is as far from the crude rationalism of the socialist , who wants to reconstruct all social institutions according to a pattern prescribed by his individual reason , as from the mysticism to which the conservative so frequently has to resort .
What I have described as the liberal position shares with conservatism a distrust of reason to the extent that the liberal is very much aware that we do not know all the answers and that he is not sure that the answers he has are certainly the rights ones or even that we can find all the answers .
He also does not disdain to seek assistance from whatever non-rational institutions or habits have proved their worth .
The liberal differs from the conservative in his willingness to face this ignorance and to admit how little we know , without claiming the authority of supernatural forces of knowledge where his reason fails him .
It has to be admitted that in some respects the liberal is fundamentally a skeptic [ 12 ]  but it seems to require a certain degree of diffidence to let others seek their happiness in their own fashion and to adhere consistently to that tolerance which is an essential characteristic of liberalism .
There is no reason why this need mean an absence of religious belief on the part of the liberal .
Unlike the rationalism of the French Revolution , true liberalism has no quarrel with religion , and I can only deplore the militant and essentially illiberal antireligionism which animated so much of nineteenth - century Continental liberalism .
That this is not essential to liberalism is clearly shown by its English ancestors , the Old Whigs , who , if anything , were much too closely allied with a particular religious belief .
What distinguishes the liberal from the conservative here is that , however profound his own spiritual beliefs , he will never regard himself as entitled to impose them on others and that for him the spiritual and the temporal are different sphere which ought not to be confused .
6 . What I have said should suffice to explain why I do not regard myself as a conservative .
Many people will feel , however , that the position which emerges is hardly what they used to call " liberal . "
I must , therefore , now face the question of whether this name is today the appropriate name for the party of liberty .
I have already indicated that , though I have all my life described myself as a liberal , I have done so recently with increasing misgivings  not only because in the United States this term constantly gives rise to misunderstandings , but also because I have become more and more aware of the great gulf that exists between my position and the rationalistic Continental liberalism or even the English liberalism of the utilitarians .
If liberalism still meant what it meant to an English historian who in 1827 could speak of the revolution of 1688 as " the triumph of those principles which in the language of the present day are denominated liberal or constitutional " [ 13 ] or if one could still , with Lord Acton , speak of Burke , Macaulay , and Gladstone as the three greatest liberals , or if one could still , with Harold Laske , regard Tocqueville and Lord Acton as " the essential liberals of the nineteenth century , " [ 14 ]
I should indeed be only too proud to describe myself by that name .
But , much as I am tempted to call their liberalism true liberalism , I must recognize that the majority of Continental liberals stood for ideas to which these men were strongly opposed , and that they were led more by a desire to impose upon the world a preconceived rational pattern than to provide opportunity for free growth .
The same is largely true of what has called itself Liberalism in England at least since the time of Lloyd George .
It is thus necessary to recognize that what I have called " liberalism " has little to do with any political movement that goes under that name today .
It is also questionable whether the historical associations which that name carries today are conducive to the success of any movement .
Whether in these circumstances one ought to make an effort to rescue the term from what one feels is its misuse is a question on which opinions may well differ .
I myself feel more and more that to use it without long explanations causes too much confusion and that as a label it has become more of a ballast than a source of strength .
In the United States , where it has become almost impossible to use " liberal " in the sense in which I have used it , the term " libertarian " has been used instead .
It may be the answer ; but for my part I find it singularly unattractive .
For my taste it carries too much the flavor of a manufactured term and of a substitute .
What I should want is a word which describes the party of life , the party that favors free growth and spontaneous evolution .
But I have racked my brain unsuccessfully to find a descriptive term which commends itself .
7 . We should remember , however , that when the ideals which I have been trying to restate first began to spread through the Western world , the party which represented them had a generally recognized name .
It was the ideals of the English Whigs that inspired what later came to be known as the liberal movement in the whole of Europe [ 15 ] and that provided the conceptions that the American colonists carried with them and which guided them in their struggle for independence and in the establishment of their constitution . [ 16 ]
Indeed , until the character of this tradition was altered by the accretions due to the French Revolution , with its totalitarian democracy and socialist leanings , " Whig " was the name by which the party of liberty was generally known .
The name died in the country of its birth partly because for a time the principles for which it stood were no longer distinctive of a particular party , and partly because the men who bore the name did not remain true to those principles .
The Whig parties of the nineteenth century , in both Britain and the United States , finally brought discredit to the name among the radicals .
But it is still true that , since liberalism took the place of Whiggism only after the movement for liberty had absorbed the crude and militant rationalism of the French Revolution , and since our task must largely be to free that tradition from the overrationalistic , nationalistic , and socialistic influences which have intruded into it , Whiggism is historically the correct name for the ideas in which I believe .
The more I learn about the evolution of ideas , the more I have become aware that I am simply an unrepentant Old Whig  with the stress on the " old . "
To confess one ’s self as an Old Whig does not mean , of course , that one wants to go back to where we were at the end of the seventeenth century .
It has been one of the purposes of this book to show that the doctrines then first stated continued to grow and develop until about seventy or eighty years ago , even though they were no longer the chief aim of a distinct party .
We have since learned much that should enable us to restate them in a more satisfactory and effective form .
But , though they require restatement in the light of our present knowledge , the basic principles are still those of the Old Whigs .
True , the later history of the party that bore that name has made some historians doubt where there was a distinct body of Whig principles ; but I can but agree with Lord Acton that , though some of " the patriarchs of the doctrine were the most infamous of men , the notion of a higher law above municipal codes , with which Whiggism began , is the supreme achievement of Englishmen and their bequest to the nation " [ 17 ]  and , we may add , to the world .
It is the doctrine which is at the basis of the common tradition of the Anglo - Saxon countries .
It is the doctrine from which Continental liberalism took what is valuable in it .
It is the doctrine on which the American system of government is based .
In its pure form it is represented in the United States , not by the radicalism of Jefferson , nor by the conservatism of Hamilton or even of John Adams , but by the ideas of James Madison , the " father of the Constitution . " [ 18 ]
I do not know whether to revive that old name is practical politics .
That to the mass of people , both in the Anglo - Saxon world and elsewhere , it is today probably a term without definite associations is perhaps more an advantage than a drawback .
To those familiar with the history of ideas it is probably the only name that quite expresses what the tradition means .
That , both for the genuine conservative and still more for the many socialists turned conservative , Whiggism is the name for their pet aversion shows a sound instinct on their part .
It has been the name for the only set of ideals that has consistently opposed all arbitrary power .
8 . It may well be asked whether the name really matters so much .
In a country like the United States , which on the whole has free institutions and where , therefore , the defense of the existing is often a defense of freedom , it might not make so much difference if the defenders of freedom call themselves conservatives , although even here the association with the conservatives by disposition will often be embarrassing .
Even when men approve of the same arrangements , it must be asked whether they approve of them because they exist or because they are desirable in themselves .
The common resistance to the collectivist tide should not be allowed to obscure the fact that the belief in integral freedom is based on an essentially forward - looking attitude and not on any nostalgic longing for the past or a romantic admiration for what has been .
The need for a clear distinction is absolutely imperative , however , where , as is true in many parts of Europe , the conservatives have already accepted a large part of the collectivist creed  a creed that has governed policy for so long that many of its institutions have come to be accepted as a matter of course and have become a source of pride to " conservative " parties who created them . [ 19 ]
Here the believer in freedom cannot but conflict with the conservative and take an essentially radical position , directed against popular prejudices , entrenched positions , and firmly established privileges .
Follies and abuses are no better for having long been established principles of folly .
Though quieta non movere may at times be a wise maxim for the statesman it cannot satisfy the political philosopher .
He may wish policy to proceed gingerly and not before public opinion is prepared to support it , but he cannot accept arrangements merely because current opinion sanctions them .
In a world where the chief need is once more , as it was at the beginning of the nineteenth century , to free the process of spontaneous growth from the obstacles and encumbrances that human folly has erected , his hopes must rest on persuading and gaining the support of those who by disposition are " progressives , " those who , though they may now be seeking change in the wrong direction , are at least willing to examine critically the existing and to change it wherever necessary .
I hope I have not misled the reader by occasionally speaking of " party " when I was thinking of groups of men defending a set of intellectual and moral principles .
Party politics of any one country has not been the concern of this book .
The question of how the principles I have tried to reconstruct by piecing together the broken fragments of a tradition can be translated into a program with mass appeal , the political philosopher must leave to " that insidious and crafty animal , vulgarly called a statesman or politician , whose councils are directed by the momentary fluctuations of affairs . " [ 20 ]
The task of the political philosopher can only be to influence public opinion , not to organize people for action .
He will do so effectively only if he is not concerned with what is now politically possible but consistently defends the " general principles which are always the same . " [ 21 ]
In this sense I doubt whether there can be such a thing as a conservative political philosophy .
Conservatism may often be a useful practical maxim , but it does not give us any guiding principles which can influence long - range developments .

The Best of F. A. Hayek
US Politics The Grand Delusion By Joel S. Hirschhorn
Published November 12 , 2007
With an endless , futile and costly Iraq war , a stinking economy and most Americans seeing the country on the wrong track , the greatest national group delusion is that electing Democrats in 2008 is what the country needs .
Keith Olbermann was praised when he called the Bush presidency a criminal conspiracy , but that missed the larger truth : the whole two - party political system is a criminal conspiracy hiding behind illusion induced delusion .
Virtually everything that Bush correctly gets condemnation for could have been prevented or negated by Democrats , if they had had courage , conviction and commitment to maintaining the rule of law and obedience to the Constitution .
Bush grabbed power from the feeble and corrupt hands of Democrats .
Democrats have failed the vast majority of Americans .
So why would sensible people think that giving Democrats more power is a good idea ?
They certainly have done little to merit respect for their recent congressional actions , or inaction when it comes to impeachment of Bush and Cheney .
One of the core reasons the two - party stranglehold on the US political system persists is that whenever one party uses its power to an extreme degree it sets the conditions for the other party – its partner in the conspiracy – to take over .
Then the other takes its turn in wielding excessive power .
Most Americans – at least those who vote – seem incapable of understanding that the Democrats and Republicans are two teams in the same league , serving the same cabal running the corporatist plutocracy .
By keeping people focused on rooting for one team or the other , the behind - the - scenes rulers ensure their invisibility and power .
The genius of the plutocrats is to create the illusion of important differences between the two parties , and the illusion of political choice in elections .
In truth , the partner parties compete superficially and dishonestly to entertain the electorate , to maintain the aura of a democracy .
Illusion creates the delusion of Americans that voting in elections will deliver political reforms , despite a long history of politicians lying in campaigns about reforms , new directions and bold new policies .
The rulers need power shifting between the teams to maintain popular trust in the political system .
Voting manifests that trust – as if changing people will fix the system .
It does n't .
So voters become co-conspirators in the grand political criminal conspiracy .
Those who vote for Democrats or Republicans perpetuate the corrupt , dishonest and elitist plutocracy that preferentially serves the interests of the Upper Class and a multitude of special interests – some aligned with the Republicans and some with the Democrats .
Voting only encourages worthless politicians and those that fund and corrupt them .
Public discontent leads to settling for less through lesser evil voting rather than bold thinking about how to reform the system to get genuine political competition and better candidates and government .
I understand why sane people would not want to vote for Republicans , based on the Bush presidency .
But I cannot understand why politically engaged people think that putting Democrats in power will restore American democracy and put the welfare of non-wealthy Americans above the interests of the wealthy and the business sector .
Bill Clinton 's administration strongly advanced globalization and the loss of good jobs to foreign countries .
Economic inequality kept rising .
Trade agreements sold us out .
And in this primary season , talk about reforming the US health care system among Democrats never gets serious about providing universal health care independent of the insurance industry .
And why should citizens be supportive of a party that favors illegal immigration – law breaking – that primarily serves business interests by keeping labor costs low ?
Nor have Democrats stood up to challenge the official 9/11 story that no longer has any credibility to anyone that takes the time to seriously examine all its inconsistencies with what really happened and the laws of physics .
Whoever wins the Democratic presidential nomination will not be free of corruption and lies .
He or she will owe paybacks to all the fat - cat campaign donors .
Voters will be choosing the lesser - evil Democratic presidential candidate .
Is that really the only choice ?
Is there no other action that can advance the national good ?
There seem to be just two other choices .
Vote for some third party presidential candidate , but the downside of that is twofold .
No such candidate can win in the current rigged system .
Worse , voting gives a stamp of credibility to the political system , as if it was fair , when it is not .
Voting says that you still believe that the political system merits your support and involvement .
The second option is to boycott voting to show total rejection of the current political system and the plutocratic cabal using the two - party duopoly to carry out its wishes .
When a democracy no longer is legitimate , no longer is honest , and no longer serves the interests of ordinary citizens , then what other than violent revolution can change it ?
When the electoral system no longer can provide honest , corruption free candidates with any chance of winning , what can citizens do ?
Either stay home or just vote in local and state races and for ballot measures .
I say remove the credibility and legitimacy of the federal government by reducing voter turnout to extremely low levels .
Show the world that the vast majority of Americans have seen the light and no longer are deluding themselves about their two - party democracy .
A boycott on voting for candidates for federal office is a form of civil disobedience that has enormous power to force true political reforms from the political system .
This is the only way to make it crystal clear that the presidency and Congress no longer represent any significant fraction of the people .
This is the only way to show that America 's representative democracy is no longer representative and , therefore , is no longer a credible democracy .
Just imagine a federal government trying to function in the usual ways when only 20 percent of the eligible voters actually voted .
It takes more courage to boycott voting than to vote for lesser evil Democrats and in the end this is the only way for people to feel proudly patriotic .
This is the only way to not contribute to the ongoing bipartisan criminal conspiracy running the federal government .
The US has a broken government because the spirit of Americans that gave the US its revolution and nation 's birth has been broken , in large measure by distractive and self - indulgent consumerism .
It is better to recognize that those who vote suffer from delusion than to criticize those who do not vote as apathetic .
Non-delusional nonvoters recognize the futility of voting .
Democrats will not restore US democracy .
That is the painful truth that most people will not readily accept , but such is the power of group delusion .
Voting produces never - ending cycles of voter dissatisfaction with those elected , both Democrats and Republicans .
It is time for Americans to break this cycle of voter despair .
Voters who moan about Congress and the White House have nobody to blame but themselves , no matter which party they voted for .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday signaled a readiness to cut interest rates again to prevent further damage to the weak U.S. economy , even as he took note of rising inflation risks .
Delivering the Fed ’s semiannual report on the economy to Congress , Bernanke made clear the central bank was worried a deepening housing slump , softening jobs market and tighter credit could dim an already bleak economic outlook .
“ It is important to recognize that downside risks to growth remain , ” Bernanke told the House of Representatives ’ Financial Services Committee .
“ The ( Fed ) will be carefully evaluating incoming information bearing on the economic outlook and will act in a timely manner as needed to support growth and to provide adequate insurance against downside risks , ” he said .
The central bank has lowered overnight interest rates to 3 percent from 5.25 percent in five steps since mid-September .
Financial markets saw Bernanke ’s testimony as validating bets on another half - percentage point cut at the Fed ’s next meeting on March 18 .
A Reuters poll of 15 Wall Street dealers found unanimous expectation of a March rate cut .
Dealers also now expect the Fed to take interest rates lower during this easing cycle than previously expected .
“ They ’re willing to inject more juice into the system , and that ’s what they need to do , ” said Firas Askari , head of currency trading at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto .
A majority of dealers expect rates to be cut to 2.5 percent at the Fed ’s next meeting .
Meanwhile , the median forecast was for rates to fall as low as 2 percent during this cycle , as opposed to a 2.5 percent trough seen in a poll taken February 1 .
The dollar hit a record low against the euro on Bernanke ’s remarks , while bond prices bounced around in reaction to zig - zagging stocks .
Stocks traded in and out of negative territory , rallying at one point when a U.S. regulator gave the green light to home finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to invest more in the mortgage market , but ending the day little changed .
DELICATE BALANCE
Bernanke said that while the Fed expects inflation to ease , risks that price pressures could stay elevated had ticked up , underscoring the difficult situation policy - makers face .
“ The further increases in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent weeks , together with the latest data on consumer prices , suggest slightly greater upside risks to the projections of both overall and core inflation than we saw last month , ” he said .
A government report last week showed consumer prices rose a steeper - than - expected 0.4 percent in January .

If the public began to doubt the Fed ’s willingness to keep inflation at bay , it could hurt the central bank ’s ability to support growth down the road , Bernanke said .
A week ago , the central bank lowered its forecast for 2008 growth by a half - point to between 1.3 percent and 2 percent , while raising its projection for unemployment and inflation .
Bernanke cautioned that monetary policy affects the economy with a lag and said the Fed needed to keep in mind the economy ’s likely path , as well as the risks it faces .

POLICY LAGS
A report on Wednesday showed single - family home sales tumbled to a 13 - year low in January , while median prices posted their biggest year - on - year drop on record .
A separate report showed weaker - than - expected demand for long - lasting goods .
Bernanke said information the Fed had reviewed since its last meeting on January 29 - 30 continued to point to a sluggish economy over the next several quarters .
Responding to questions , he said house prices may decline into 2009 .
“ Given how much ... construction has come down already , I imagine that by later this year it will stop being such a big drag directly ” on the economy , he said .
“ Prices may decline into next year , but we really do n’t know . ”
Higher energy prices , lower home and stock market values , and slowing job creation are likely to damp household spending , Bernanke warned .
Slower hiring is also likely to weigh on consumers , he added .
Bernanke said financial markets remained strained in the wake of rising mortgage delinquencies and worries about credit quality .
However , steps taken by the Fed and other central banks to ease credit market conditions appear to have helped .
Still , financial market stress has kept long - term interest rates -- such as mortgage rates -- at high levels relative to shorter - dated debt , he said .
“ Even as the Fed has lowered interest rates and the general pattern of interest rates have declined , pressures in the credit markets have caused greater and greater spreads , ” offsetting to some degree the impact of the Fed ’s interest - rate cuts , Bernanke said .

Susan B. Anthony , in an address to the National American Woman Suffrage Association ( 1896 )
God is the most noble of beings .
Now it is impossible for a body to be the most noble of beings ; for a body must be either animate or inanimate ; and an animate body is manifestly nobler than any inanimate body .
But an animate body is not animate precisely as body ; otherwise all bodies would be animate .
Therefore its animation depends upon some other thing , as our body depends for its animation on the soul .
Hence that by which a body becomes animated must be nobler than the body .
Therefore it is impossible that God should be a body .

Nor are we told anything of his reasons for tempting Abraham so terribly .
He has not , like Zeus , discussed them in set speeches with other gods gathered in council ; nor have the deliberations in his own heart been presented to us ; unexpected and mysterious , he enters the scene from some unknown height or depth and calls : Abraham !
It will at once be said that this is to be explained by the particular concept of God which the Jews held and which was wholly different from that of the Greeks .
True enough — but this constitutes no objection .
For how is the Jewish concept of God to be explained ?
Even their earlier
God of the desert was not fixed in form and content , and was alone ; his lack of form , his lack of local habitation , his singleness , was in the end not only maintained but developed even further in competition with the comparatively far more manifest gods of the surrounding Near Eastern world .
The concept of God held by the Jews is less a cause than a symptom of their manner of comprehending and representing things .

For
He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills , not on account of His suffering what He wills not ; for if that should befall Him , He would by no means be omnipotent .
Wherefore ,
He can not do some things for the very reason that He is omnipotent .

God , the supreme being , is neither circumscribed by space , nor touched by time ; he cannot be found in a particular direction , and his essence cannot change .

All of God but also to speak to him .
~ names of God remain hallowed because they have been used not only to speakGod but also to speakhim .
~ Martin Buber
At certain great moments down the ages , God drew nearer to His people and humanity at the same time made great , though oft unconscious efforts to draw near to God .
From one angle , it might be regarded as God transcendent recognizing God immanent , and God in man reaching out to God in the Whole and greater than the Whole .
On the part of God , working through the Head of the spiritual Hierarchy and its Membership , this effort was intentional , conscious and deliberate ; on the part of man , it has been in the past largely unconscious , forced upon humanity by the tragedy of circumstances , by desperate need and by the driving urge of the immanent Christ consciousness .
Alice Bailey , Problems Of Humanity , Chapter V The Problem of the Churches - Part 2 , ( 1944 )
The Eastern faiths have ever emphasised God Immanent , deep within the human heart , " nearer than hands and feet " , the Self , the One , the Atma , smaller than the small , yet all - comprehensive .
The Western faiths have presented God Transcendent , Outside His universe , an Onlooker .
God transcendent , first of all , conditioned men's concept of Deity , for the action of this transcendent God appeared in the process of nature ; later , in the Jewish dispensation , God appeared as the tribal Jehovah , as the soul ( the rather unpleasant soul ) of a nation .
Next , God was seen as a perfected man , and the divine God-man walked the Earth in the Person of the Christ .
Alice Bailey The Reappearance of the Christ p. 144 , ( 1947 )
Today we have a rapidly growing emphasis upon God immanent in every human being , and in every created form .
Today , we should have the churches presenting a synthesis of these two ideas , which have been summed up for us in the statement of Shri Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita : " Having pervaded this whole universe with a fragment of Myself , I remain . "
God , greater than the created whole , yet God present also in the part ; God Transcendent guarantees the Plan of our world , and is the Purpose conditioning all lives from the minutest atom , up through all the kingdoms of nature , to man .
Alice Bailey in The Reappearance of the Christ p. 145 , ( 1947 )
True religion is again emerging in the hearts of men in every land ; this recognition of a divine hope and background may possibly take people back into the church and into the world faiths , but it will most certainly take them back to God.
Alice Bailey The Reappearance of the Christ , Chapter Three ( 1947 )
Religion is the name , surely , which we give to the invocative appeal of humanity which leads to the evocative response of the Spirit of God .
This Spirit works in every human heart and in all groups .
Alice Bailey The Reappearance of the Christ , Chapter Three ( 1947 )
Slowly , there is dawning upon the awakening consciousness of humanity the great paralleling truth of God Immanent – divinely " pervading " all forms , conditioning from within all kingdoms in nature , expressing innate divinity through human beings .
. . .
There is a growing and developing belief that Christ is in us , as He was in the Master Jesus , and this belief will alter world affairs and mankind 's entire attitude to life .
( 13 – 592 ) .
Alice Bailey in The Externalization of the Hierarchy p. 592 , ( 1957 )
God Transcendent , greater , vaster and more inclusive than His created world , is universally recognised and has been generally emphasised ; all faiths can say with Shri Krishna ( speaking as God , the Creator ) that " having pervaded the whole universe with a fragment of Myself , I remain . "
This God Transcendent has dominated the religious thinking of millions of simple and spiritually - minded people down the centuries which have elapsed since humanity began to press forward towards divinity .

The glory of God is not contingent on man 's good will , but all existence subserves his purposes .
The system of the universe is as a celestial poem , whose beauty is from all eternity , and must not be marred by human interpolations .
Things proceed as they were ordered , in their nice , and well - adjusted , and perfect harmony ; so that as the hand of the skilful artist gathers music from the harp - strings , history calls it forth from the well - tuned chords of time .
Not that this harmony can be heard during the tumult of action .
Philosophy comes after events , and gives the reason of them , and describes the nature of their results .
The great mind of collective man may , one day , so improve in self - consciousness as to interpret the present and foretell the future ; but as yet , the end of what is now happening , though we ourselves partake in it , seems to fall out by chance .
All is nevertheless one whole ; individuals , families , peoples , the race , march in accord with the Divine will ; and when any part of the destiny of humanity is fulfilled , we see the ways of Providence vindicated .
The antagonisms of imperfect matter and the perfect idea , of liberty and necessary law , become reconciled .
What seemed irrational confusion , appears as the web woven by light , liberty and love .
But this is not perceived till a great act in the drama of life is finished .
The prayer of the patriarch , when he desired to behold the Divinity face to face , was denied ; but he was able to catch a glimpse of Jehovah , after He had passed by ; and so it fares with our search for Him in the wrestlings of the world .
It is when the hour of conflict is over , that history comes to a right understanding of the strife , and is ready to exclaim : " Lo !
God is here , and we knew it not . "
George Bancroft Literary and Historical Miscellanies ( 1855 ) , p. 491

When the mind is not dissipated upon extraneous things , nor diffused over the world about us through the senses , it withdraws within itself , and of its own accord ascends to the contemplation of God.

How many questions arise in this place !
Constantly the question comes up :
Where was God in those days ?
Why was he silent ?
How could he permit this endless slaughter , this triumph of evil ? . . .
We must continue to cry out humbly yet insistently to God : Rouse yourself !
Do not forget mankind , your creature !

The true Mystic , realising God , has no need of any Scriptures , for he has touched the source whence all Scriptures flow .
Annie Besant in The Theosophical Writings of Annie Besant
Mysticism is the realisation of God , of the Universal Self .
It is attained either as a realisation of God outside the Mystic , or within himself .
In the first case , it is usually reached from within a religion , by exceptionally intense love and devotion , accompanied by purity of life , for only " the pure in heart shall see God " .
Annie Besant in Annie Besant Quotes ISBN - 13 : 978-1535078498 ( 2016 )
It is patent to every student of the closing forty years of the last century , that crowds of thoughtful and moral people have slipped away from the churches , because the teachings they received there outraged their intelligence and shocked their moral sense .
It is idle to pretend that the widespread agnosticism of this period had its root either in lack of morality or in deliberate crookedness of mind .
Everyone who carefully studies the phenomena presented will admit that men of strong intellect have been driven out of Christianity by the crudity of the religious ideas set before them , the contradictions in the authoritative teachings , the views as to God , man , and the universe that no trained intelligence could possibly admit .
Nor can it be said that any kind of moral degradation lay at the root of the revolt against the dogmas of the Church .
The rebels were not too bad for their religion ; on the contrary , it was the religion that was too bad for them .
The rebellion against popular Christianity was due to the awakening and the growth of conscience ; it was the conscience that revolted , as well as the intelligence , against teachings dishonouring to God and man alike , that represented God as a tyrant , and man as essentially evil , gaining salvation by slavish submission .
Annie Besant in Esoteric Christianity ( The Lesser Mysteries ) , Theosophical publishing , ( 1914 )
Another precept of Jesus which remains as " a hard saying " to his followers is : " Be ye therefore perfect , even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect " .
[ S. Matt. , v , 48 . ]
The ordinary Christian knows that he cannot possibly obey this command ; full of ordinary human frailties and weaknesses , how can he become perfect as God is perfect ?
Seeing the impossibility of the achievement set before him , he quietly puts it aside , and thinks no more about it .
But seen as the crowning effort of many lives of steady improvement , as the triumph of the God within us over the lower nature , it comes within calculable distance , and we recall the words of Porphyry , how the man who achieves " the paradigmatic virtues is the Father of the Gods " , and that in the Mysteries these virtues were acquired .
Annie Besant in Esoteric Christianity ( The Lesser Mysteries ) , Theosophical publishing , ( 1914 )
For so reverent is God to that Spirit which is Himself in man , that He will not even pour into the human soul a flood of strength and life unless that soul is willing to receive it .
There must be an opening from below as well as an outpouring from above , the receptiveness of the lower nature as well as the willingness of the higher to give .
That is the link between the Christ and the man ; that is what the churches have called the outpouring of " divine grace " ; that is what is meant by the " faith " necessary to make the grace effective .
As Giordano Bruno once put it — the human soul has windows , and can shut those windows close .
The sun outside is shining , the light is unchanging ; let the windows be opened and the sunlight must stream in .
The light of God is beating against the windows of every human soul , and when the windows are thrown open , the soul becomes illuminated .
There is no change in God , but there is a change in man ; and man 's will may not be forced , else were the divine Life in him blocked in its due evolution .
Thus in every Christ that rises , all humanity is lifted a step higher , and by His wisdom the ignorance of the whole world is lessened .

We reject the idea of a personal , or an extra-cosmic and anthropomorphic God , who is but the gigantic shadow of man , and not of man at his best , either .
The God of theology , we say — and prove it — is a bundle of contradictions and a logical impossibility ...
Our DEITY is neither in a paradise , nor in a particular tree , building , or mountain ; it is everywhere , in every atom of the visible as of the invisible Cosmos , in , over , and around every invisible atom and divisible molecule ; for IT is the mysterious power of evolution and involution , the omnipresent , omnipotent , and even omniscient creative potentiality .
Helena Petrovna Blavatsky , The Key to Theosophy ( 1889 )
If we have to believe in a divine principle at all , it must be in one which is as absolute harmony , logic , and justice , as it is absolute love , wisdom , and impartiality ; and a God who would create every soul for the space of one brief span of life , regardless of the fact whether it has to animate the body of a wealthy , happy man , or that of a poor suffering wretch , hapless from birth to death though he has done nothing to deserve his cruel fate — would be rather a senseless fiend than a God. H.P. Blavatsky , The Key to Theosophy ( 1889 )
It is not the One unknown ever - present God in Nature , or Nature in abscondito , that is rejected , but the “ God ” of human dogma , and his humanized “ Word . ”
Man , in his infinite conceit and inherent pride and vanity , shaped it himself with his sacrilegious hand out of the material he found in his own small brain - fabric , and forced it upon his fellows as a direct revelation from the one unrevealed Space .

How wrong it is to use God as a stop - gap for the incompleteness of our knowledge .
If in fact the frontiers of knowledge are being pushed further and further back ( and that is bound to be the case ) , then God is being pushed back with them , and is therefore continually in retreat .

God but also to speak him .
Some would deny any legitimate use of the word God because it has been misused so much .
Certainly it is the most burdened of all human words .
Precisely for that reason it is the most imperishable and unavoidable .
And how much weight has all erroneous talk about God 's nature and works ( although there never has been nor can be any such talk that is not erroneous ) compared with the one truth that all men who have addressed God really meant him ?
For whoever pronounces the word God and really means
Thou , addresses , no matter what his delusion , the true
Thou of his life that cannot be restricted by any other and to whom he stands in a relationship that includes all others .

According to mythological thinking , God has his domicile in heaven .
What is the meaning of this statement ?
The meaning is quite clear .
In a crude manner it expresses the idea that God is beyond the world , that He is transcendent .
The thinking which is not yet capable of forming the abstract idea of transcendence expresses its intention in the category of space .

Our feeling of ignorance , vanity , want , weakness , in short , depravity and corruption , reminds us ... that in the Lord , and none but He , dwell the true light of wisdom , solid virtue , exuberant goodness .

For what man is not disposed to rest in himself ?
Who , in fact , does not thus rest , so long as he is unknown to himself ; that is , so long as he is contented with his own endowments , and unconscious or unmindful of his misery ?

Except during my childhood , when I was probably influenced by Michelangelo 's Sistine Chapel depiction of God with a flowing white beard , I have never tried to project the Creator in any kind of human likeness .
The vociferous debates about whether God is male or female seem ridiculous to me .
I think of God as an omnipotent and omniscient presence , a spirit that permeates the universe , the essence of truth , nature , being , and life .
To me , these are profound and indescribable concepts that seem to be trivialized when expressed in words .
Jimmy Carter , Living Faith ( 2001 ) , p. 222
Although every believing Christian understands that God guides our steps , fewer and fewer emphasize the point .
A God working actively in the world makes us uneasy .

We are really gods in incarnation .
We need to recognize our threefold constitution :
We are a spark of God ; every religion has postulated this and has kept the idea of our divinity before humanity for thousands of years .
But it can be seen more scientifically and still correctly .
Speaking as an esotericist , I would say that the divine spark is so refined in vibration that it cannot manifest directly on the physical plane .
It reflects itself , therefore , as the individualized human soul .
The soul , in its turn , reflects itself in the human personality , with its physical , emotional , and mental bodies .
Through the physical plane personality , the soul enacts its reincarnational process , until finally the individual on the physical plane , the man or woman , reflects perfectly the quality of the soul , which is the divine quality of the spark of God. Benjamin Creme in The Ageless Wisdom ,
An introduction to humanity 's spiritual legacy , 'Share International ( 1996 ) p.3-4
God , in the esoteric meaning , is the sum total of all the Laws and all the energies governed by these Laws in the manifested and unmanifested universe .
So God is impersonal .
Nevertheless , that transcendent God is manifest in every aspect of creation , including ourselves .
We are not separate from that creation — from God .
Every human being has the potential of the knowledge , the awareness , of all in creation that we can think of as meaning God .
The Masters [ of Wisdom ] are God-realized , which is a very specific state , in that They have brought Their consciousness , in terms of the divine spark , the Absolute , the Self , into complete at - one - ment with Themselves as men on the physical plane — the personality and the divine aspect are totally integrated ...
God is everything that exists , and all space between that which exists ... and around everything .
All of that is God ...
Modern science has been able to break down cellular structures and show that at the centre of every atom is a nucleus with electrons around it , vibrating at a specific rate , and that every atom in the universe is made in the same way .
There is nothing but energy in all of the manifested universe .
The difference between that totally scientific view and that which an esotericist would hold is that the esotericist goes further and says , indeed , all is energy , but energy follows thought , is acted upon by thought .
Thought is the agency by which creation takes place .

Clarence Darrow as quoted in The New York Times ( 19 April 1936 )
I am an Agnostic because I am not afraid to think .
I am not afraid of any god in the universe who would send me or any other man or woman to hell .
If there were such a being , he would not be a god ; he would be a devil .
Clarence Darrow as quoted in a eulogy for Darrow by Emanuel Haldeman - Julius ( 1938 )
I am an agnostic as to the question of God .
I think that it is impossible for the human mind to believe in an object or thing unless it can form a mental picture of such object or thing .
Since man ceased to worship openly an anthropomorphic God and talked vaguely and not intelligently about some force in the universe , higher than man , that is responsible for the existence of man and the universe , he can not be said to believe in God .
One cannot believe in a force excepting as a force that pervades matter and is not an individual entity .
To believe in a thing , an image of the thing must be stamped on the mind .
If one is asked if he believes in such an animal as a camel , there immediately arises in his mind an image of the camel .
This image has come from experience or knowledge of the animal gathered in some way or other .
No such image comes , or can come , with the idea of a God who is described as a force .

To say that God made the universe gives us no explanation of the beginnings of things .
If we are told that God made the universe , the question immediately arises : Who made God ?
Did he always exist , or was there some power back of that ?
Did he create matter out of nothing , or is his existence coextensive with matter ?
The problem is still there .
What is the origin of it all ?
If , on the other hand , one says that the universe was not made by God , that it always existed , he has the same difficulty to confront .
To say that the universe was here last year , or millions of years ago , does not explain its origin .
This is still a mystery .
As to the question of the origin of things , man can only wonder and doubt and guess .
Clarence Darrow , Why I Am An Agnostic ( 1929 ) Full text online
Many Christians base the belief of a soul and God upon the Bible .
Strictly speaking , there is no such book .
To make the Bible , sixty - six books are bound into one volume .
These books are written by many people at different times , and no one knows the time or the identity of any author .
Some of the books were written by several authors at various times .
These books contain all sorts of contradictory concepts of life and morals and the origin of things .
Between the first and the last nearly a thousand years intervened , a longer time than has passed since the discovery of America by Columbus .

If you see yourself as God and then you come back from this state and somebody says , “ Hey , Sam , empty the garbage ! ” it catches you back into the model of “ I'm Sam who empties the garbage . ”
You can't maintain these new kinds of structures .
It takes a while to realize that God can empty garbage .

A man who recognizes no God is probably placing an inordinate value on himself .
Robertson Davies in Conversations
The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction : jealous and proud of it ; a petty , unjust , unforgiving control - freak ; a vindictive , bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser ; a misogynistic , homophobic , racist , infanticidal , genocidal , filicidal , pestilential , megalomaniacal , sadomasochistic , capriciously malevolent bully .
Richard Dawkins , The God Delusion ( 2006 ) , p. 31
The trouble is that God in this sophisticated , physicist 's sense bears no resemblance to the God of the Bible or any other religion .
If a physicist says God is another name for Planck 's constant , or God is a superstring , we should take it as a picturesque metaphorical way of saying that the nature of superstrings or the value of Planck 's constant is a profound mystery .
It has obviously not the smallest connection with a being capable of forgiving sins , a being who might listen to prayers , who cares about whether or not the Sabbath begins at 5 pm or 6 pm , whether you wear a veil or have a bit of arm showing ; and no connection whatever with a being capable of imposing a death penalty on His son to expiate the sins of the world before and after he was born .
Richard Dawkins , from a lecture , extracted from The Nullifidian ( December 1994 )
Is but the Shadow of the Brain which casts it — ~
It is solemn to remember that Vastness — Is but the Shadow of the Brain which casts it — ~ Emily Dickinson
If man is created by an external source , then he must belong to that source and not to himself .
According to Buddhism , man is responsible for everything he does .
Thus Buddhists have no reason to believe that man came into existence in the human form through any external sources .
They believe that man is here today because of his own action .
He is neither punished nor rewarded by anyone but himself according to his own good and bad action .
In the process of evolution , the human being came into existence .
However , there are no Buddha - words to support the belief that the world was created by anybody .
The scientific discovery of gradual development of the world - system conforms with the Buddha 's Teachings .
K. Sri Dhammananda Maha Thera , What Buddhists Believe ( 1993 )
They say that God is everywhere , and yet we always think of Him as somewhat of a recluse .

Charles Hartshorne ... informed me that my theological standpoint is Socinian .
... The main tenet of the Socinian heresy is that God is neither omniscient nor omnipotent .
He learns and grows as the universe unfolds .
... I ... find it congenial , and consistent with scientific common sense .
I do not make any clear distinction between mind and God. ... We are the chief inlets of God on this planet at the present stage ...
We may later grow with him as he grows , or we may be left behind .
... If we are left behind , it is an end .
If we keep on growing , it is a beginning .
Freeman Dyson , Infinite in All Directions ( 1988 )
I do not make any clear distinction between mind and God .
God is what mind becomes when it has passed beyond the scale of our comprehension .
God may be either a world - soul or a collection of world - souls .
So I am thinking that atoms and humans and God may have minds that differ in degree but not in kind .
We stand , in a manner of speaking , midway between the unpredictability of atoms and the unpredictability of God .
Atoms are small pieces of our mental apparatus , and we are small pieces of God 's mental apparatus .
Our minds may receive inputs equally from atoms and from God .
This view of our place in the cosmos may not be true , but it is compatible with the active nature of atoms as revealed in the experiments of modern physics .
I do n't say that this personal theology is supported or proved by scientific evidence .
I only say that it is consistent with scientific evidence .

I do not claim any ability to read God 's mind .
I am sure of only one thing .
When we look at the glory of stars and galaxies in the sky and the glory of forests and flowers in the living world around us , it is evident that God loves diversity .
Perhaps the universe is constructed according to a principle of maximum diversity .

Meister Eckhart , as quoted in Christianity ( 1995 ) by Joe Jenkins , p. 27
Where the human being in obedience goes out from his “ I ” and dismisses what is his own , God must necessarily enter in precisely there ; for when someone does not will anything for himself , God must will for that person in the same ay as He wills for himself .

If we pray to God as a corporeal person , this will prevent us from relinquishing the human doubts and fears which attend such a belief , and so we cannot grasp the wonders wrought by infinite , incorporeal Love , to whom all things are possible .

Nature is what we know .

Posing the question : does the god of love use underarm deodorant , vaginal spray and fluoride toothpaste ?
Deathbird Stories , by Harlan Ellison [ 1 ]
It is not by accident that the enormous popularity of the “ death of God ” was born in our world of images : the impossibility of representing God visually leads inevitably in our day to the impossibility of his existence .
God is dead — but beyond all the explicit reasons generally offered , he is dead because he is not visible .
We can have confidence only in a visible God who is clearly manifested , exclusively in the visual dimension .
Jacques Ellul , The Humiliation of the Word ( 1981 ) , J. Hanks , trans . ( 1985 ) , p. 198
Throughout the Old Testament we see God choosing what is weak and humble to represent him ( the stammering Moses , the infant Samuel , Saul from an insignificant family , David confronting Goliath , etc. ) .
Paul tells us that God chooses the weak things of the world to confound the mighty .
Here , however , we have a striking contradiction .
In Constantine God is supposedly choosing an Augustus , a triumphant military leader .
This vision and this miracle are totally impossible .
But they are not impossible in the context of Christianity that is already off the rails , that thinks of God as the one who directs history and is the motive power in politics .
Jacques Ellul , The Subversion of Christianity ( 1982 ) , G. Bromiley , trans . ( 1986 ) , p. 123

The matron whom we find so often arguing with Rabbi José observed one day to that sage , ' My god is surely greater than yours .
When your God appeared to Moses in the bush , Moses merely covered his face , whilst when my god ( the serpent ) made its appearance he could not stand his ground at all , but had to run away out of fear . '
' Not so , 'returned the Rabbi , 'for in order to be out of the power of your god it sufficed for Moses to step a few paces back , but whither could he have fled from the presence of Him who filleth the earth ? '

When God first called Moses , not being then an expert prophet , he was addressed in a voice similar to that of his own father , and he thought that his father had come to him from Egypt .
God then told him that it was not his earthly father who called him , but the God of his father .
Then , we find , Moses hid his face , which he did not do when first called by his name ; not in fact until he heard the words , ' I am the God of thy fathers . '

Ludwig Feuerbach , in The Essence of Christianity ( 1843 ) , p. xvi
By positing God as unknowable , man excuses himself to what is still left of his religious conscience for his oblivion of God , his surrender to the world .
He negates God in practice – his mind and his senses have been absorbed by the world – but he does not negate him in theory .
He does not attack his existence ; he leaves it intact .
But this existence neither affects nor incommodes him , for it is only a negative existence , an existence without existence ; it is an existence that contradicts itself – a being that , in view of its effects , is indistinguishable from non-being .
Ludwig Feuerbach , The Essence of Christianity ( 1843 ) , Z. Hanfi , trans. , in The Fiery Brook ( 1972 ) , p. 112
When the claims of God are revealed to the mind , it must necessarily yield to them , or strengthen itself in sin .
It must , as it were , gird itself up , and struggle to resist the claims of duty .
This strengthening self in sin under light is the particular form of sin which we call impenitence .

It is beyond my power to induce in you a belief in God .
There are certain things which are self proved and certain which are not proved at all .
The existence of God is like a geometrical axiom .
It may be beyond our heart grasp .
I shall not talk of an intellectual grasp .
Intellectual attempts are more or less failures , as a rational explanation cannot give you the faith in a living God .
For it is a thing beyond the grasp of reason .
It transcends reason .
There are numerous phenomena from which you can reason out the existence of God , but I shall not insult your intelligence by offering you a rational explanation of that type .
I would have you brush aside all rational explanations and begin with a simple childlike faith in God .
If I exist , God exists .
With me it is a necessity of my being as it is with millions .
They may not be able to talk about it , but from their life you can see that it is a part of their life .
I am only asking you to restore the belief that has been undermined .
In order to do so , you have to unlearn a lot of literature that dazzles your intelligence and throws you off your feet .
Start with the faith which is also a token of humility and an admission that we know nothing , that we are less than atoms in this universe .
We are less than atoms , I say , because the atom obeys the law of its being , whereas we in the insolence of our ignorance deny the law of nature .
But I have no argument to address to those who have no faith .
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in Young India ( 24 September 1931 ) ; also in Teachings Of Mahatma Gandhi ( 1945 ) , edited by Jag Parvesh Chander , p. 458
The existence of God is like a geometrical axiom .
It may be beyond our heart grasp .
I shall not talk of an intellectual grasp .
Intellectual attempts are more or less failures , as a rational explanation cannot give you the faith in a living God .
For it is a thing beyond the grasp of reason .
It transcends reason .
There are numerous phenomena from which you can reason out the existence of God , but I shall not insult your intelligence by offering you a rational explanation of that type .
In order to do so , you have to unlearn a lot of literature that dazzles your intelligence and throws you off your feet .
Start with the faith which is also a token of humility and an admission that we know nothing , that we are less than atoms in this universe .
People are even more reluctant to admit that man explains nothing , than they were to admit that God explains nothing .
Ernest Gellner , Legitimation of Belief ( 1974 ) , p. 99
I cannot think we are useless or Usen would not have created us .

If we desire to hold on to solidarity with everyone else in the communicative fellowship , even the dead ... then we must claim a reality that can reach beyond the here and now , or that can connect our selves beyond our own death with those who innocently went to their destruction before us .
And it is this reality that the Christian tradition calls God.

The love of gain , which is a large , incalculably large , element in every soul , when once applied to the desire for God , will bless the man who has it .
Gregory of Nyssa , On Virginity , Chapter 18
In vain do they think themselves innocent who appropriate to their own use alone those goods which God gave in common ; by not giving to others that which they themselves receive , they become homicides and murderers , inasmuch as in keeping for themselves those things which would alleviate the sufferings of the poor , we may say that every day they cause the death of as many persons as they might have fed and did not .
When , therefore , we offer the means of living to the indigent , we do not give them anything of ours , but that which of right belongs to them .
It is less a work of mercy which we perform than the payment of a debt .
Gregory I , quoted in George D. Herron , Between Caesar and Jesus ( 1899 ) , pp. 111-112
As one reads the scriptures of Christianity and Islam with a morally alert mind , one starts getting sick of the very sound of word ‘ god ’ which word is littered all over this literature like dead leaves in autumn .
The deeds which are ascribed to or approved of by this God are quite often so cruel and obnoxious as to leave one wondering that if these are the doings of the Divine , what else is there which is left for the Devil to do .

The most preposterous notion that H. sapiens has ever dreamed up is that the Lord God of Creation , Shaper and Ruler of all the Universes , wants the saccharine adoration of His creatures , can be swayed by their prayers , and becomes petulant if He does not receive this flattery .

The significance of God , cause , number , substance or soul consists , as James asserts , in nothing but the tendency of the given concept to make us act or think .
If the world should reach a point at which it ceases to care not only about such metaphysical entities but also about murders perpetrated behind closed frontiers or simply in the dark , one would have to conclude that the concepts of such murders have no meaning , that they represent no ‘ distinct ideas ’ or truths , since they do not make any ‘ sensible difference to anybody . ’

Why did it occur to anyone to believe in only one God ?
And conversely why did it ever occur to anyone to believe in many gods ?
To both these questions we must return the same answer :
Because that is how the human mind happens to work .
For the human mind is both diverse and simple , simultaneously many and one .
We have an immediate perception of our own diversity and of that of the outside world .
And at the same time we have immediate perceptions of our own oneness .

* I have said , Ye are gods ; and all of you are children of the most High .
Jesus quoted in Psalms 82:6
Some foolish men declare that creator made the world .
The doctrine that the world was created is ill advised and should be rejected .
If God created the world , where was he before the creation ?
If you say he was transcendent then and needed no support , where is he now ?
How could God have made this world without any raw material ?
If you say that he made this first , and then the world , you are faced with an endless regression .
If you declare that this raw material arose naturally you fall into another fallacy , For the whole universe might thus have been its own creator , and have arisen quite naturally .
If God created the world by an act of his own will , without any raw material , then it is just his will and nothing else — and who will believe this silly nonsense ?
If he is ever perfect and complete , how could the will to create have arisen in him ?
If , on the other hand , he is not perfect , he could no more create the universe than a potter could .
If he is form - less , action - less and all - embracing , how could he have created the world ?
Such a soul , devoid of all morality , would have no desire to create anything .
If he is perfect , he does not strive for the three aims of man , so what advantage would he gain by creating the universe ?
If you say that he created to no purpose because it was his nature to do so , then God is pointless .
If he created in some kind of sport , it was the sport of a foolish child , leading to trouble .
If he created because of the karma of embodied beings [ acquired in a previous creation ]
He is not the Almighty Lord , but subordinate to something else .
If out of love for living beings and need of them he made the world , why did he not take creation wholly blissful free from misfortune ?
If he were transcendent he would not create , for he would be free :
Nor if involved in transmigration , for then he would not be almighty .
Thus the doctrine that the world was created by God makes no sense at all , And God commits great sin in slaying the children whom he himself created .
If you say that he slays only to destroy evil beings , why did he create such beings in the first place ?
Good men should combat the believer in divine creation , maddened by an evil doctrine .
Know that the world is uncreated , as time itself is , without beginning or end , and is based on the principles , life and rest .
Uncreated and indestructible , it endures under the compulsion of its own nature .
Jinasena ( 9th Century ) in the Mahāpurāna , as translated in Primal Myths ( 1979 ) by Barbara Sproul

And I saw no difference between God and our Substance : but as it were all God ; and yet mine understanding took that our Substance is in God : that is to say , that God is God , and our Substance is a creature in God. Julian of Norwich , Revelations of Divine Love ( c .1393 ) , Ch. 54

A god is usually characteristic of a certain system of thought or morality .
For instance , take the Christian God , the summum bonum :
God is love , love being the highest moral principle ; and God is spirit , the spirit being the supreme idea of meaning .
All our Christian moral concepts derive from such assumptions , and the supreme essence of all of them is what we call God. C. G. Jung , Nietzsche 's Zarathustra ( 1988 ) , p. 40

The Christian God is spirit and Christianity is spirit , and there is discord between the flesh and the spirit but the flesh is not the sensuous - it is the selfish .
In this sense , even the spiritual can become sensuous - for example , if a person took his spiritual gifts in vain , he would then be carnal .
And of course I know that it is not necessary for the Christian that Christ must have been physically beautiful ; and it would be grievous - for a reason different from the one you give - because if beauty were some essential , how the believer would long to see him ; but from all this it by no means follows that the sensuous is annihilated in Christianity .

If everything is assumed to be in order with regard to the Holy Scriptures - what then ?
Has the person who did not believe come a single step closer to faith ?
No , not a single step .
Faith does not result from straightforward scholarly deliberation , nor does it come directly ; on the contrary , in this objectivity one loses that infinite , personal , impassioned interestedness , which is the condition of faith , the everywhere and nowhere in which faith can come into existence .
Has the person who did believe gained anything with regard to the power and strength of faith ?
No , not in the least ; in this prolix knowledge , in this certainty that lurks at faith ’s door and craves for it , he is rather in such a precarious position that much effort , much fear and trembling will be needed lest he fall into temptation and confuse knowledge with faith .
Whereas up to now faith has been a beneficial taskmaster in uncertainty , but it would be its worst enemy in this certainty .
If passion is taken away , faith no longer exists , and certainty and passion do not hitch up as a team .

To live only in the unconditional , to breathe only the unconditional – the human being cannot do this ; he perishes like a fish that must live in the air .
But on the other hand a human being cannot in the deeper sense live without relating himself to the unconditional ; he expires , that is , perhaps goes on living , but spiritlessly .
Thus the single individual must personally relate himself to the unconditional .

California study finds no link between vaccine ingredient , autism
Rates of autism have increased in California despite the removal of the preservative thimerosal from childhood vaccines seven years ago , a finding that researchers say disproves the theory that the mercury in thimerosal causes the mysterious neurological disorder .
The study , which analyzed autism rates in young children over a 12 - year period , is the first to offer hard evidence that thimerosal plays no role in autism .
Results of the study were released Monday in the Archives of General Psychiatry , a publication of the Journal of the American Medical Association .
" Whatever the explanation for this increase in children with autism , exposure to mercury in vaccines is not it , " said Robert Schechter , a medical officer with the California Department of Health Services and lead author of the study .
" Vaccines with thimerosal and without have been safe and appropriate to give to our children . "
But even as researchers held up the study as absolute evidence that childhood vaccinations do not cause autism , some parents were quick to point out what they saw as flaws in the report .
They stand by their claim that exposure to mercury - be it in a vaccine or from environmental sources - is a major cause of autism .
Cases of autism , a neurological disorder marked by profound communication problems and impaired social skills , have exploded in the past two decades , pushing the condition to the forefront of medical research .
Autism was considered rare before the 1990s , afflicting as few as 5 children per 10,000 births , but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated last year that as many as 1 in 150 children is diagnosed with autism now .
At least 300,000 children ages 4 to 17 had autism in 2004 , according to the CDC , and as many as 1.5 million people in the United States currently have autism .
Symptoms usually appear in the first three years after birth .
There is no cure , although therapy can help alleviate symptoms .
Boys are nearly four times more likely to be diagnosed with autism than girls .
Many researchers believe there is a genetic component to autism , but several large and vocal parent groups are convinced that exposure to heavy metals - especially mercury - is a major culprit .
Until 2001 , most childhood vaccinations included thimerosal , exposing children to a small but significant amount of mercury .
Based on recommendations from pediatricians , thimerosal was removed from all childhood vaccinations in 2001 .
But rates of autism continued to increase , according to the new study .
The study found that rates of autism for 3 - year - old children climbed from 0.3 per 1,000 births in 1993 to 1.3 per 1,000 births in 2003 .
Similar increases were shown for children of all ages .
Many neurological experts and child psychiatrists say the rise in autism rates is most probably due to increased awareness among parents and doctors , possibly resulting in over - reporting of symptoms .
There also are cases of doctors giving autism diagnoses to children who have mild developmental disorders just to give them access to disability services , said Bryna Siegel , director of the Autism Clinic at UCSF .
" It 's being over - reported , and we 're just starting to do studies to figure out why that is , " Siegel said .
" A lot of clinicians will tell you off the record that they 're well aware that kids with a diagnosis of autism will get a variety of services .
They 're willing to err on the side of autism to get those services . "
Siegel said she understands why parents have been eager to prove a relationship between thimerosal and autism , but she thinks it 's time to move past that theory .
" It 's very hard for parents to find out that they 've somehow passed this horrible disorder to their child , " Siegel said .
" But people like me are exasperated that so much money and attention has gone into disproving the mercury hypothesis , when it could have been going toward treatment and research . "
Lyn Redwood , a board member of the National Autism Association who has a child with autism , said it 's too soon to rule out environmental factors or even the role of thimerosal .
Many of the children in the California study probably got childhood vaccinations outside the United States , she pointed out .
And it's now common for pregnant women to get flu shots , which still contain thimerosal and can therefore expose a fetus to mercury , she said .
" We need to look at these children and the metals in their body and not close the door on any theory , " Redwood said .
" When we get to the point where there is no more mercury in the vaccines , if they could go back to the database and figure out exposures for each child , then that 's something .
Otherwise , we 're just guessing about whether or not there 's an association . "

She won big in the Florida primary , but whether Hillary Rodham Clinton won anything that counts in the fierce competition for the Democratic presidential nomination is much less certain .
No delegates were at stake here Tuesday , meaning Clinton ’s double - digit victory over Barack Obama gets her no closer to the magic number of 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the nomination .
Still , she did all she could to play up the outcome .
Clinton jetted down to Florida from Washington for a celebration , savoring the win and casting it as genuine .
Delegates or not , it was a better day than Saturday , when she lost the South Carolina primary to Obama by 28 percentage points .
Her campaign argued that Tuesday ’s result blunted any momentum Obama had gotten in the last week from the South Carolina win and the endorsement Monday of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) and other members of the Kennedy family .

Speaking to a boisterous crowd , many of whom held up union signs , Clinton said : “ I am so grateful to the countless Floridians who , on their own , organized , worked hard , talked to your friends and your neighbors .
You made a very big difference . ”
As elections go , the Democratic primary proved a muddle .
The national party stripped Florida of its delegates as punishment for leapfrogging other states in the election calendar , in defiance of party wishes .
Neither Obama nor Clinton overtly campaigned in the state , abiding by a pledge signed to preserve the status of states that traditionally hold early contests .
So the import of Clinton ’s victory comes down to interpretation .

Her camp made the case that the results could be a foreshadowing of Super Tuesday , when more than 20 states will hold election contests .
In the view of the Obama campaign , the Florida outcome was essentially meaningless -- a “ beauty contest ” that carries no more weight than a statewide poll .
In a succinct statement Tuesday night , the Illinois senator ’s camp said : “ Obama and Clinton tie for delegates in Florida : 0 for Obama ; 0 for Clinton . ”
Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said in an interview that Clinton was “ basically trying to take a victory lap when there was no race . ”
And Clinton did not linger in Florida .
She gave a seven - minute speech , shook supporters ’ hands , then flew to Arkansas -- her former home state , which votes in the Feb. 5 contests .
She was to campaign today in Little Rock , Ark. , and Atlanta .

“ Stay with us , ” the New York senator told the crowd gathered in a ballroom here , “ because starting tomorrow we ’re going to sweep through the states across our country to Feb .
5 -- and we will , together , not only take back the White House but take back our country ! ”
As the day unfolded , the Clinton and Obama campaigns implored the media to accept their answer to the day ’s question :
What do the Florida results mean ?
Clinton strategists offered an intricate argument .
No candidate can afford to invest substantial time and money in all the states that vote on Super Tuesday .
In that sense , Florida -- where there was little real campaigning or advertising -- was akin to those states , spokesman Howard Wolfson said .
So a solid Clinton victory in Florida bodes well for her .
In a conference call , Obama supporters accused Clinton of trying to have it both ways .
She curried favor with Iowa and other states holding early contests by boycotting Florida , they said , only to claim later that Florida ’s result counted after all .
Advertisement
Sen. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass. ) , who has endorsed Obama , said : “ I know what this race is about , and what it is ultimately about is delegates .
Delegates are what Sen. Clinton and her campaign have described it as being about .
. . .
The bottom line is that Florida does n’t offer any delegates . ”

If a kid picks up a candy bar and runs , you give him a warning before you cuff him .
Same with those mindless teenyboppers who go to the Hickory Farms store , and then take double samples of fruitcake and cheeselog , you warn them that they will be charged with a felony ( grand theft ) , and that if they attempt to fight and run , they will be , unfortunately , first tazered , and if they continue to resist violently with intent to maim , then wounded .
Fortunately , wounding fire to suppress teenage kleptomaniacs is relatively easy , they all run in straight lines , and a hit in the knee will be relatively simple from the second floor .
But they all get a warning first , we do not simply shoot shoplifters unless they resist violently .
I 'm currently talking to Harpers about ways we can make the American Gods online reading experience a more pleasant one .
And about ways to give American Gods away that would make Harper Collins happy while also making , say , Cory Doctorow happy too .
I was surprised by a few emails coming in from people accusing me of doing bad things for other authors by giving anything away -- the idea being , I think , that by handing out a bestselling book for nothing I 'm devaluing what a book is and so forth , which I think is silly .
I like giving stuff away .
I think it 's sensible .
I like that you can read Sandman # 1 on the DC Comics site , for example .
( It 's at http://www.dccomics.com/media/excerpts/1696_1.pdf .
( Although for reasons known only to DC , they have put the last two pages of the story in the wrong order . )
We 've got five short stories up at http://www.neilgaiman.com/p/Cool%20Stuff/Short%20Stories , and I just realised on poking around that I 've put more essays and things up over the years on this blog than have ever made it into the essays section , and a lot more audio than ever made it to the rather threadbare audio section ( although there 's lots of free audio now up at http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Gaiman
During one of the interviews recently , a reporter said something like , " Of course , a real publisher would n't give away paper books , " and I pointed out that 3,000 copies of The Hitchhiker 's Guide to The Galaxy were given away by Douglas Adams ' publisher , with a ' write in and get your free book ' ad in Rolling Stone .
They wanted copies of HHGTTG on campuses in the US , and they wanted people to read it and tell other people .
Word of mouth is still the best tool for selling books .
This is how people found new authors for more than a century .
Someone says , " I 've read this .
It 's good .
I think you 'd like it .
Here , you can borrow it . "
Someone takes the book away , reads it , and goes , Ah , I have a new author .
Libraries are good things : you should n't have to pay for every book you read .
I'm one of those authors who is fortunate enough to make my living from the things I 've written .
If I thought that giving books away would make it so that I could no longer make my living from writing and be forced to go out and get a real job -- or that other authors would be less likely to be able to make a living -- I would n't do it .
As I tried to explain in the Guardian interview , the problem is n't that books are given away or that people read books they have n't paid for .
The problem is that the majority of people do n't read for pleasure .... Ah , the joys of the Mall - Ninjas .

In a cliché world everyone in Switzerland and Austria walks around in Lederhosen , quaffing down Wurst , Schnitzel and large vats of foamy lager , whilst trekking up large mountains with large dogs , socks pulled up yodelling about Ricola .
In reality Lederhosen is a German fashion item and the only yodelling that still exists is in American adverts .
The beer and the food is very true .
Unless you have been locked away for the last year , I am sure you are aware of the forthcoming European Championships hosted in said countries from the 7th to 29th June .
Here is a guide on how to get around , generally survive and make the most of your money .
Football
First off lets get the Football out of the way .
If you are going I am sure you know who you want to see but in case you do n’t or are just going for a laugh and are n’t actually going to any of the stadiums ( getting a ticket was nigh on impossible for me ) you should probably have a think of where you want to be and when .
A useful website is the UEFA website for schedules and locations for each game .
However one thing you should consider is the Fan Arenas that are being put together , especially if you do n’t have tickets .
Now as far as I know these are only being put together in Switzerland but they are definitely worth a look .
Basically , in 16 towns and cities , small stadiums are being constructed with large screens , padded seating and also standing places .
It seems the only way to get seats is to buy them from supermarkets , banks and other ticket vendors in Switzerland but the standing places are free of charge and appear to be on a first come first served basis .
This would be ideal for anyone interested in checking out the real Switzerland whilst enjoying the football – I would recommend places like Chur , Locarno , Lausanne for some impressive scenery and being close to the mountains .
As for the hosts chances , both nations look highly unlikely to get any further than the knock out stages .
Switzerland have a collection of well known players .
The likes of Senderos , Djourou , Yakin , Streller and even the up coming Degen brothers are worth checking out but unfortunately the side lacks the strength and skill to go far in my opinion .
The press recently expressed their disappointment with their performance against an ‘ average England side ’ so things are n’t looking too hot .
However , one must not forget they did n’t concede a single goal in open play during the World Cup - anyone remember that dire game against Russia ?
Switzerland ’s group is an interesting one and I predict there might be some violence between the fans ( or the players ) considering the large Turkish immigrant community in Switzerland and last time Switzerland met Turkey this happened :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxm8wo6ahlU
Austria on the other hand have pretty much lost every game before the tournament has even begun .
With a recent 3 - 1 defeat to their co hosts and losing 3 - 0 to Germany , even the Austrian public are n’t too hopeful .
Some have even made a petition to get them out of the tournament to avoid embarrassment .
With both Pogatez and Scharner both banned from the team for publicly criticising the national team ’s professionalism it does not look hopeful for Austria .
Personally I am putting money on Germany to win it , but that is another discussion completely … .
Travel
Getting there : I recommend checking out easyjet.com , bmibaby.com , swiss.com and aua.com for cheap flights .
If you book now you will definitely get a flight for between 70 - 150 pounds return .
As for travelling between cities and between Switzerland and Austria it ’s worth checking out :
For Austria : http://www.oebb.at/euro2008/en/
For Switzerland : http://mct.sbb.ch/mct/en/euro08/euro08-fahrausweise.htm
Or if you fancy the bus : http://www.eurolines.com/index.php?id=113&L=0
Switzerland and Austria are n’t cheap countries but if you take advantage of the offers they provide then it ’s easy to get around on a relatively tight budget .
For around 30 Euros you can get a Vorteilscard ( in Austria ) or a Halbtax card ( in Switzerland ) which are valid for both countries for the duration of the tournament and give you half price on all train tickets .
If you buy it in advance you can save around 10 Euros or buy it when you get there for about 39 .
Trains in both these countries are notoriously prompt , clean , fast and easy .
I ca n’t recommend a better way to get around as once you get to your destination , trams will get you anywhere else you need .
Get drunk , get the train I say .
Accommodation
Obviously youth hostels and hotels are an option but there are other ways to live on the cheap during the tournament .
I highly recommend Euroom08.ch , – a site dedicated to people renting out their houses and apartments during the tournament .
The site is n’t the easiest thing to navigate but if you just do a search for the cities you want to be in you will find some really good deals ranging from about 32 Euros to about 150 per person per night .
Well worth a look , especially as you wo n’t have to eat out all the time .
But if you want to do it on the real cheap and want to meet people on the way then I suggest you join www.couchsurfing.com, an online travelling community where you can offer up your couch to crash on or find someone ’s couch to invade .
There ’s enough people signed up from Austria and Switzerland who will consider putting you up .
Booze and Food
In general food is relatively expensive , fags and booze are cheap .
Feldschloesschen Bier ( who are also sponsors of the Fan Arenas ) really is the don of cheap Swiss beers .
You can get a ten pack for about 5 pounds , approximately 10 Swiss francs and people are relatively relaxed about you drinking outside in public as long as you are respectful and do n’t leave a mess .
While in Austria the people ’s drink ( as in the cheap one from the shops ) is Stiegl .
As for food you are sure to come across a lot of schnitzel , rosti , and wurst with bread and mustard .
All perfect dishes to go with a day of drinking and football .
During the games I can guarantee you will find a lot of wurst stalls in and around the stadiums and they cost about 2 - 3 pounds .
Language
If you think you are going to get to the Euros and practice a bit of your German , think again .
Firstly the majority of people can speak English and will notice within your first syllable that you are n’t a local .
Trains and airports usually have announcements in German , French and English and even some of the trams are incorporating this at useful stops such as the train station .
The German they speak in Switzerland and Austria is not your every day eins , zwei , drei .
Austrian German and Swiss German ( Schweizer Deutsch ) is a dialect that even the Germans struggle to understand .
My advice is , go with the flow , give it a try , they will reply in English ( obviously this depends on where you are from , if you ’re from Czech Republic I do n’t know what to recommend ! ) ; unless you go to southern Switzerland where they speak French ( round Geneva mainly ) and Italian and is something I have little knowledge of .

In Ms. Lange , the institute found an experienced legislative tactician and a disarming public face .
Ms. Lange grew up in Peoria , Ill. , as a regular churchgoer and youth - group member in a United Methodist congregation .
While she recalls having decided by her early teens that she did not believe in God  and being particularly disturbed by what she considered the misogyny of the Bible  she still accompanies her parents to church during family visits to the Midwest .
She put her idealism first into the Peace Corps , spending two years in Guatemala , and then into the presidency of the National Organization for Women ’s chapter in Buffalo .
( In somewhat unfeminist fashion , she had followed a boyfriend to western New York . )
She then became a legislative aide to Sam Hoyt III , a Democratic assemblyman from Buffalo , serving two years in his district office and then three in Albany .
Her time in the state capital gave her the practical savvy and personal connections that the humanist institute sought when it hired her last April .
As Ms. Lange zigzagged through the office building on that Monday morning this month , she collected busses on the cheek and doting questions about her toddlers , Hannah and John .
Her fond relations with the secretaries and administrative assistants ensured that she would get access , timely access , either to legislators or a staff member of consequence .
“ Being an insider , I know who you need to know , ” she said .
“ I know the process .
The bills , the legislation , the budget , scheduling meetings . ”
At each stop , Ms. Lange made her pitch against the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .
While the measure sought to remove any “ unreasonable burdens ” from religious practice , the State Constitution more than amply protected religious freedom , she told legislators .
A new law risked eroding the separation of church and state .
In her search for allies , she made sure to discuss issues like same - sex marriage and comprehensive sex education , on which she and many legislators already agreed .
She also lined up sponsors and votes for a coming resolution to declare Feb. 12 as Darwin Day .
( It passed unanimously . )
Still , none of the five Assembly members she met with promised to side against the religion measure .
Mr. Brodsky , a Democrat from Westchester County , chided Ms. Lange that opposing the bill put her on the same side as lobbyists for fundamentalist Christians and ultra-Orthodox Jews , who deemed the measure too weak .
A very strange monkey
The rarest present I got this year would have to be " Consul , the Educated Monkey " .
It 's a small tin plate with a monkey on it , over a chart of numbers .
You move the feet of the monkey to point at two numbers , and , through scissor action , his hands point at those numbers ' product in the chart .
Here 's another picture , and another .
So aside from a very odd gift , this would make a nifty programming puzzle .
So , here one is : generate the chart printed behind the monkey .
Make a program that generates it for any upper limit of numbers .
For reference , here 's the chart ( printed from my program to do this ) :
1
12 4
11 24 9
10 22 36 16
9 20 33 48 25
8 18 30 44 60 36
7 16 27 40 55 72 49
6 14 24 36 50 66 84 64
5 12 21 32 45 60 77 96 81
4 10 18 28 40 54 70 88 108 100
3 8 15 24 35 48 63 80 99 120 121
2 6 12 20 30 42 56 72 90 110 132 144
The numbers on the bottom go from 1 to 12 , and the little square on the far right means , obviously , " square the number " .
For bonus points , make the program print the chart for any arbitrary operation on two numbers , like print an addition chart like this , or a modulus chart .
In this case , the square should just act as if it is whatever the other foot is pointing at .
Do n't worry about spacing , I had to resort to HTML to get it to line up .
Just generating the right numbers is enough .
I 'll make another post in a few days with code and explanation .
Richard F. Humenn , PE was the Senior Project Design Engineer for electrical systems for the entire World Trade Center , and he had 60 people working under him .
In other words , he was the guy in charge of all electrical at the WTC .
A retired licensed professional engineer , he was certified by the States of New York , New Jersey , Connecticut and Washington , D.C .
Humenn stated to Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth :
On September 11 , I watched the live TV broadcast of the progressive collapse of the World Trade Towers with disbelief , as the mass and strength of the structure should have survived the localized damage caused by the planes and burning jet fuel .
I viewed the presentation of Richard Gage and other related material , which compels me to believe that the fuel and planes alone did not bring the Towers down .
I , therefore , support the proposal to form an international group of professionals to investigate all plausible causes for the virtual freefall and the almost total destruction of the WTC structures .
Humenn also recently gave a two - hour recorded interview to an attorney and former law school professor ( a transcript of the interview will soon be posted to AE911 Truth.org ) .
In that interview , Humenn expressed his opinion that the Twin Towers were intentionally demolished .
( He stated that he could not believe the U.S. government could have done such a thing ; however , he was not asked about rogue elements within the government ) .
Few engineers have as much first - hand knowledge of the Twin Towers as Humenn , so his opinion carries some weight .
As he explains , " Though an electrical engineer by trade , I was also very familiar with the structures and their conceptual design parameters . "
Is Microsoft Office adware ?
Wikipedia defines adware as " any software package which automatically plays , displays , or downloads advertising material to a computer after the software is installed on it or while the application is being used . "
In Microsoft Office Professional 2003 's help , a search for " APA " ( a popular documentation style ) brings up two links labeled Microsoft Office Marketplace .
A click on the link opens a web page where the item is available for a fee .
Also , there 's a banner advertisement from Dell .
A search in Office 's help for " print " leads to the brief article " Print more than one copy " with two up - selling links for Office 2007 .
By the way , clicking either promotion launches Internet Explorer even when Firefox is the default browser .
The reason is the Office help runs an embedded Internet Explorer showing a page from office.microsoft.com .
Despite the technical explanation , it can be confusing and inconvenient for the user to use a non -default browser .
On Microsoft.com , Sandi Hardmeier , MVP , concludes her adware definition , " Ads are not bad by themselves but they become a problem when they are unauthorized .
Unfortunately , many adware programs do not give users enough notice or control . "
In Office , where is the " notice or control " ?
A workaround is to search the Offline Help instead of the default Microsoft Office Online .
Could Office be spyware ?
Microsoft defines spyware as " software that performs certain behaviors such as advertising . "
Microsoft continues :
That does not mean all software that provides ads or tracks your online activities is bad .
For example , you might sign up for a free music service , but you " pay " for the service by agreeing to receive targeted ads .
If you understand the terms and agree to them , you may have decided that it is a fair tradeoff .
You might also agree to let the company track your online activities to determine which ads to show you .
Basically , spyware includes adware , but not all ads are bad .
Are ads bad about after paying for an Office license ?
Another part of spyware is tracking .
The Office 2003 EULA ( . PDF and .XPS wrapped in . EXE ) states :
CONSENT TO USE OF DATA .
You agree that Microsoft and its affiliates may collect and use technical information gathered as part of the product support services provided to you , if any , related to the Software .
Microsoft may use this information solely to improve our products or to provide customized services or technologies to you and will not disclose this information in a form that personally identifies you .
While in Office the collected information is not personal , the EULA does not mention disabling collection .
The Office Privacy Statement admits the use of tracking cookies .
While cookies are normal and generally harmless , it is unusual to require cookies or to use them in a desktop application .
If cookies are disabled in Internet Explorer , the Office help fails .
In conclusion , Office 2003 does display ads , and certain parts require cookies .
While these are a normal and healthy part of the web , it is , at least , unusual for a commercial desktop application .
Do you believe in coincidences ?
Of course , they happen all the time , and with this government , coincidence and incompetence are the bread and butter of the Bush administration .
When I quoted “ Le Canard Enchaîné ” which I found in The New York Sun that predicted an attack on Iran would occur on October the 15th , I was then unaware that NORTHCOM was Planning a 5 Day anti-terrorism exercise called Vigilant Shield 08 .
I noted that members from the site George W. Bush - Terrorist in the White House were following a link to my article on the subject , Attack On Iran Slated For October 15th , Prepare For Disaster .
Being my usual curious self , I went to their site , and I found this link staring me in the face - and when I read it , a chill ran up my spine as I attempted to grasp the magnitude of the “ coincidence . ” :
NORTHCOM Plans 5 Day Martial Law Exercise The United States Northern Command ( USNORTHCOM ) has just announced plans for an anti-terrorism exercise called Vigilant Shield 08 .
The exercise which is slated to run from October 15th to October 20th is described as a way to prepare , prevent and respond to any number of national crises .
The exercise is simply a test case scenario for the implementation of martial law .
Although the description of the exercise is disturbing , USNORTHCOM also announced that they are more prepared for a natural disaster and a
terrorist attack after they used their response to Hurricane Katrina as a test laboratory .
During Hurricane Katrina , authorities violated the constitutional rights of citizens by stealing people ’s firearms and even relocating people against their will .
These announcements are incredibly disturbing on a number of levels as the nature of Vigilant Shield 08 and the admission that Hurricane Katrina was used as a test laboratory shows that the government is actively preparing the military and government institutions
for martial law .
Below is the full press release from USNORTHCOM describing Vigilant Shield 08 .
“ North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command along with U.S. Pacific Command , the Department of Homeland Security as well as local , state and other federal responders will exercise their response abilities against a variety of potential threats during Exercise Vigilant Shield ‘ 08 , a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff - designated , North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) and U.S. Northern Command ( USNORTHCOM ) - sponsored , and U.S. Joint Forces Command - supported Department of Defense exercise for homeland defense and defense support of civil authorities missions .
VS - 08 will be conducted concurrent with Top Officials 4 ( TOPOFF 4 ) , the nation ’s premier exercise of terrorism preparedness sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security , and several other linked exercises as part of the National Level Exercise 1-08 .
These linked exercises will take place Ocober 15 - 20 and are being conducted throughout the United States and in conjunction with several partner nations including Australia , Canada , and the United Kingdom , as well as the Territory of Guam .
VS - 08 and National Level Exercise 1-08 will provide local , state , tribal , interagency , Department of Defense , and non-governmental organizations and agencies involved in homeland security and homeland defense the opportunity to participate in a full range of
exercise scenarios that will better prepare participants to prevent and respond to national crises .
The participating organizations will conduct a multi-layered , civilian - led response to a national crisis .
USNORTHCOM ’s primary exercise venues for VS - 08 include locations in Oregon , Arizona and a cooperative venue with USPACOM in the Territory of Guam .
NORAD ’s aerospace detection and defense events will take place across all the exercise venues , to exercise
the ability to mobilize resources for aerospace defense , aerospace control , maritime
warning , and coordination of air operations in a disaster area . ”
This exercise is clearly a way to prepare government to respond to a national crisis with martial law .
This announcement also follows a number of other news stories that indicate the government is becoming more actively prepared for the implementation of martial law .

On September the 11th , 2001 , another “ coincidence ” occurred ;
Two passenger jets hit the World Trade Center , another “ passenger jet ” allegedly hit the Pentagon , and a fourth crashed in a field in Pennsylvania .
Thousands of innocent Americans lost their lives that day , and on that exact day :
On September 11 , 2001 , the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) was involved in an ongoing operation which involved deploying fighter aircraft to northwestern North America .
The US Military and NORAD had also planned to conduct several military exercises and a drill was being held by the National Reconnaissance Office , a Department of Defense agency .
The operations , exercises and drills were all canceled following the September 11 , 2001 attacks .

I ’ve heard that Condoleeza Rice warned the Mayor of San Francisco , Willie Brown , not to fly on 9/11 …
I ’m sure that was a coincidence too , but knowing that , I have yet to understand why the mayor would n’t admit that it was Condi Rice who warned him rather than stating it was his “ airport security . ”
But , like most lies , the truth was uncovered :
David Irving comments : ACCORDING to a report today Friday , May 17 , 2002 , on Pacifica Radio , the warning to San Francisco ’s mayor came from squeaky - clean Condoleezza Rice .
I recall that attorney general John Ashcroft received a similar warning in July .
LINK
There have been too many “ coincidences ” since George Bush and Dick Cheney were placed in the White House .
They stated they were bringing back morals and credibility to the White House , but instead , quite coincidentally , those who helped get Bush elected were placed in prominent positions throughout our government - and many are under investigation , indictment , or have already been sentenced for abusing their positions .
Even as I write these words , the investigations continue , and we as a nation are plagued with the most incompetent , criminally negligent Presidency in the history of this nation !

のようなテンプレートを考えましょう。また、このテンプレートとは別に、（一桁の数に限定して）1から9の数が書いてあるカードがそれぞれ1枚ずつ準備されているとします。
テンプレート □+□ がある。 カー ド [ 1]を持ってきて、最初の四角にはめ込んで 1+□。 カード[ 2]を持ってきて、次の四角にはめ込んで
1+2。
この手順 はOK。しかし、
□+□ がある。 カー ド [ 1]を持ってきて、最初の四角にはめ込んで
1+□。 カード[ 1]を持ってきて、ってもう使っちゃってるから、できない。
カード [ 1]はすでに消費しちゃっているから、2回は使えないってわけです。
タプルの片一方を取り出 す
今度はタプル（特にペアの場合ですけど）のテンプレート ( □ , □) を考えます。四角には、やはりカードをはめ込むとして、(1 , 2 ) 、( 2 , 1 ) などを作れます。各数値ごとのカードが1枚ずつだと
( 1 , 1 ) は作れません。（同じ数のカードがイッパイあることにすれば、( 1 , 1 ) も作れます。）
さて、タプル（ペア ） ( 1 , 2 ) の一番目を取り外すと ( □ , 2 ) です。手元には数値のカード[ 1]があります。この操作は、タプルの第1成分を取り出す射影（projection）と呼ばれるものです。ここで問題は、残っている(□ , 2 ) のほうです。これにはカード[ 2]
が1枚はめ込まれたままになっていますが、どうしたものでしょう？
普通は気にしない、つまり、残ったカードとテンプレートを捨ててしまいます。最終結果は手元のカード[ 1]だけです。
もし、 「空っぽのテンプレートは捨ててもいいが、カードが1枚でも入っているテンプレートは捨ててはいけない」という規則があると、(1 , 2 ) を[ 1 ] と( □ , 2 ) に分けることはできても、[ 1]だけを単独で取り出すことはできません。
リソースに敏感にな る
いま問題にしているのは、
数値のカードを素材にして、 式1+2とかタプル(1 , 2 ) を作ること 逆に、組み立てた式やタプルから素材を取り出すこと
です。通常は意識してないのですが、式やタプルを自由に組み立てるには素材のカードを複製（コピー、クローン）する必要があります。そうでないと、1+1も(1 , 1)も作れません。それと、式やタプルの一部にだけ注目して取り出すには、取り出した部分以外を捨てる操作（破棄）も潜在的に行われています。
複製や破棄を明確に意識することは、数値や記号を物体のように扱うことです。物体の複製や破棄にはかならずコストが伴います。場合によっては、完全な複製を作ることや、迷惑をかけずに捨てる／破壊することは不可能かもしれません。
冒頭 の 「1+1ができない子」は、数値や記号を物体扱いするセンスを持っていたわけです。このようなセンスを、リソースに敏感（resource sensitive/aware）と呼びます。ここでリソースとは、数値や記号のような抽象的なモノを物体扱いした概念と思ってください。
コンピュータによる記憶や計算では、メモリ、ディスク、CPUなどの“リソース”が使用され、複製も破棄（ゴミ管理）もコストがかかるので、リソースに敏感な態度はコンピューティング・サイエンスでは自然ともいえます。
奇妙な論理と現象の世界
前節のタプル（ペア）の計算／処理では、次の図式で示される
A → ( A , A ) 、( A , B ) → A という操作が（暗黙的である明示的であれ）使われていました。
A 素材 ----------------[重複タプルを作る]
( A , A ) タプル ( A , B ) タプ ル
----------------[第1成分を抜き出す]
A 素材
論理の世界で似た操作は、次のものでしょう。ただし、AやBは数値や記号ではなくて、命題（論理式）です。
A 仮定 ---------- A∧A （Aか つA） A∧B 仮定 （AかつB） ----------- A
これは、 「正しいことを（しつこくも）二度言っても正しい」、「2つとも正しいなら、そのうちの一方は正しい」ことなので、あきれるくらいに当たり前です。
にもかかわらず、リソースに敏感な態度をとると、命題（論理的な主張）もリソースと考えることになります。正しいことを言って、その影響が他に及んでしまうと二度目は言えないかもしれません。また、A∧B が正しいのは、あくまでも組み合わせとして正しくて、A , B単独で正しいことは保証されないかもしれません。
と、こう述べてみると、論理にリソースに敏感な態度を持ち込むのは異常なことに思えます。リソースに敏感な論理は線形論理（linear logic）と呼ぶので、この言葉を使えば、「線形論理は異常だ、奇妙だ、変態だ」というわけです。実際僕はそう思っていました。
しかし、先日の 「ボブ・クックの『物理系実務者のための圏論入門』」で紹介した圏論的量子力学／量子情報学の基礎的前提を眺めていると、量子情報（量子的真偽値、量子的命題と言ってもいい）は完全に複製することも、破棄することも許されていません。これは、人為的な仮定ではなくて、物理的な法則がそうなっているようです。
となると、人間の論理（古典論理*1や直観論理）から見ていくら奇妙でも、自然現象の論理は線形論理になっていると認めざるをえないようです。
そして、計算現象の論理もどうも線形論理みたいなのです。その理由のひとつは、コンピュータによる計算が実際にリソースに敏感だとういうこと。また別な理由として、計算も結局は自然現象（物理現象）に支えられているという事実があるでしょう。手作業で行う計算でも、紙がなくなったり鉛筆が折れたら中断しちゃうし、やってる人間が疲労して間違ったりと、確かにリソースに敏感ですものね :-)
とまー、そんな事情で、線形論理を毛嫌いしているわけにもいかないのかなー、と思っているこの頃…
Psychopathia Sexualis , by Richard Freiherr von Krafft - Ebing M.D. is a fascinating historical document .
First published in Germany in 1886 the book attempts to catalogue and illuminate every manner of “ sexual perversion ” bubbling just under the surface of the 19th century .
On the one hand reading through its pages is a melancholy sort of affair .
This was a time when masturbation was a dirt path straight to the lake of fire , a time when if your own tastes stretched beyond monogamous “ missionary work ” you would likely be viewed as a tainted psycopath begotten by maniacs ; if you also happen to be a woman … well , head directly to the assylum , do not pass go , do not even think about sexual fullfilment .
On the other hand because of this rather narrow view of human sexuality much of what is characterized as sexual deviancy in the book seems downright cuddly and sweet in our filthy 21st century world , where a shampoo commercial might present more outwardly explicit sexuality than a 19th century woman ’s entire adult existence .
Below the fold you will find 8 case studies which I ’ve culled from the hundreds , presented for your education , possible discomfiting recognition , and , of course , your smug amusement ( yeah , like you do n’t have some , uh , “ problematic ” shit going on in the sex centers of your noggin . )
Enjoy .
Case 123
Here we have a fetish which is wholly benign , strangely poetic , and really , to be envied .
“ B. , thirty years of age , apparently untainted , refined and sensitive ; great lover of flowers ; liked to kiss them , but without any sensual motive or sensual excitement ; of a rather frigid nature ; before twenty - one did not practice masturbation , and subsequently only for periods of time .
At twenty - one he was introduced to a young lady who wore some large roses on her bosom .
Since then large roses had dominated his sexual feelings .
He incessantly bought roses ; kissing them would produce erection .
He took roses to bed with him , although he never touched his genitals with them .
His pollutions , henceforth , were accompanied by dreams of roses .
He dreamt of roses that had fairy - like beauty ; when he inhaled their fragrance , he ejaculated . ”
Ah yes .
Imagine if it were all so simple …
You could work at a flower shop , with the ultimate goal of one day gaining employment at some fine botanical gardens somewhere , and at night you could return home to do a little “ tending ” to your own prized rose bushes .
Case 88
Here we have a story full of pathos , sweaty gymnasiums , fetishistic desire , odd naiveté , brash artistic license , chance encounters , arrests , and ultimately , as with so many human dramas , failure .
And all this encapsulated in one very dry , very short , clinical paragraph .
“ X. , aged thirty four , teacher in the gymnasium .
In childhood he suffered from convulsions .
At age ten he began to masturbate , with lustful feelings , which were connected with very strange ideas .
He was particularly partial to women ’s eyes ; but because he wished to imagine some form of coitus , and was absolutely innocent in sexual matters , he evolved the idea of making the nostrils the seat of the female sexual organs in order to avoid too great a separation from the eyes .
His vivid sexual desires then revolved around this idea .
He sketched drawings representing correct greek profiles of female heads , but the nostrils were so large that insertion of the penis would have been possible .
One day , in an omnibus , he saw a girl in whom he thought he recognized his ideal .
He followed her to her home and immediately proposed to her .
Shown the door , he returned again and again , until arrested .
X never had sexual intercourse . ”
So tragic .
Nose - craving , eye - adoring , virgin man , we feel your pain …
As an afterward to this case the Richard Von Krafft - Ebing M.D. offers us this little nugget :
“ Nose fetishism is seldom encountered .
The following rare bit of poetry comes to me from England -
O sweet and pretty little nose , so charming unto me ;
O were I but the sweetest rose , I ’d give my scent to thee .
O make it full with honey sweet , that I may suck it all ;
T’would be for me the greatest treat , a real festival .
How sweet and how nutritious your darling nose does seem .
It would be more delicious , than strawberries and cream . ”
Uh… Yeah .
Case 98
Here we have a case which , by today ’s standards , hardly seems deviant at all , more like a pilot script for a sitcom .
It ’s marital bliss … with a tiny catch !
“ A lady told Dr. Gemy that on her wedding night and the night that followed , her husband contented himself with kissing her , and running his fingers through her wealth of tresses .
He then fell asleep .
On the third night , Mr. X. produced an immense wig , with abundant long hair , and begged his wife to put it on .
As soon as she had done so , he richly compensated her for his neglected marital duties .
In the morning he again showed extreme tenderness while he caressed the wig .
When Mrs X. removed the wig , she at once lost all charm to her husband .
Mrs X. recognized this as a hobby , and readily yielded to the wishes of her husband , whom she loved dearly , and whose libido depended upon the wearing of the wig .
It was remarkable , however , that a particular wig had the desired effect for only a fortnight or three weeks time .
It had to be made of thick , long hair , but its color was unimportant .
The result of this marriage , after five years , was two children and a collection of seventy two wigs . ”
Comming this fall to FOX .
Wiggin ’ Out !
“ Married life can be a hairy sittuation ! ” Filmed in front of a live studio audience .
Case 99
Here we have a variation on the theme of the previous case .
“ X. , aged twenty , inverted sexually .
Only loved men with large bushy mustaches .
One day he met a man who was his ideal .
He invited him to his home , but was unspeakably disappointed when the man removed an artificial mustache .
Only when the visitor returned the ornament to his upper lip did he exercise his charm over X. once more and restored X. to complete virility . ”
Ah yes , those dreaded artificial mustaches !
X. must have been quite disappointed .
I mean what are the odds of a man with a mustache - fetish just happening to pick up a man with a fake mustache ?!
Of course , if an artificial stache was good enough to fool X’s “ sexually inverted ” senses , why did n’t he just carry a nice bushy one around in his pocket ( b.y.o.m . ) ?
Hell , why not buy an artificial mustache factory and get to work Tom Sellecking the world ?
Crazy bastards , we humans .
Case 225
Here we have a case which falls under the “ theft dependent on fetishism ” heading .
By way of lead in Krafft - Ebing offers the following - Pathological fetishism may become the cause of crimes .
As such hair despoiling , robbery or theft of women ’s linen , handkerchiefs , aprons , shoes , and silks are now recognized ( as crimes ) .
It can not be doubted that such individuals are the subject of deep mental taint …
“ P. , laborer , aged twenty nine .
Family heavily tainted .
Emotional , irritable ; had masturbated since childhood .
At ten years old saw a boy masturbate into a woman ’s handkerchief .
This gave direction to P ’s sex life .
He stole handkerchiefs from pretty girls and masturbated into them .
His mother tried every means to break him of this habit .
She admonished him , took the stolen handkerchiefs away and bought him new ones , all in vain .
He was caught by the police and punished for theft .
He then went to Africa and served in the army with an excellent record .
On his return to France he resumed his old practices .
He was only potent if a prostitute held a white handkerchief in her hand during the act .
He married in 1894 and sustained his virility by grasping a handkerchief during coitus .
The fetishistic crisis always came suddenly , like a paroxysm , especially at moments of laziness .
He would feel out of sorts , psychically moody , sexually excited , and impelled to masturbate .
Soon the fantasy image of a handkerchief would appear and take full possession of his thoughts and feelings .
If he then caught sight of a woman ’s handkerchief he would choke with fear , palpitation of the heart would set in , he would tremble , and profuse perspiration would break out all over his body .
Although conscious of the risk involved , he was irresistibly forced to steal the handkerchief .
He was arrested on one such occasion , but the examining physician declared him irresponsible .
During the time of detention he was free of his obsession .
He hoped to master his weakness in the future .
He estimated that he had stolen one hundred handkerchiefs .
He used each handkerchief only once , then threw it away . ”
He used each handkerchief only once , then threw it away ?
Stingy uncaring bastard !
Did n’t he realize there were men even worse off than he who could only attain potency when wrapping their members in stolen women ’s handkerchiefs which had already been ejaculated into by loony ex-cons who ’d served with the army in Africa and whose names began with the letter P ?!
Case 116
Here we have a case filed under the “ pathological erotic fetishism ” heading -
“ L , aged thirty seven , clerk , from a tainted family .
At five years old , he had his first erection when he saw his bedfellow - an aged relative - put on his nightcap .
The same thing occurred later when he saw an old servant put on her nightcap .
Later , simply the idea of an old ugly woman ’s head covered with a nightcap , was sufficient to cause an erection .
The sight of a cap , or a naked woman or man alone made no impression , but the mere touch of a nightcap induced erection , and sometimes even ejaculation .
L. was not a masturbator , and had never been sexually active until his thirty second year , when he married a young girl with whom he had fallen in love .
On his wedding night he remained cold until , from necessity , he brought to his aid the memory - picture of an ugly woman ’s head with a nightcap .
Coitus was immediately successful .
Thereafter it was always necessary for him to use this method .
From childhood he had been subject to attacks of depression , with suicidal tendencies , and occasional frightful hallucinations at night .
When looking out a window he became dizzy and anxious .
He was a perverse , peculiar , and easily embarrassed man of bad mental constitution .
In this very peculiar case , the simultaneous coincidence of the first sexual reference and an absolutely heterogeneous impression seems to have determined association .
A related case of accidental associative fetishism which is quite peculiar , is that of a married man , aged thirty , who in other respects , was physically and mentally healthy , who is said to have suddenly lost his sexual power after moving into another house , and to have regained it as soon as the furniture of the bedroom had been arranged as before . ”
I must say that the thought our sexual proclivities are so radically influenced by the random occurrences of early childhood is horrific .
Perhaps it ’s a good thing that the internet serves up every manner of sexual fodder to the youngsters .
Better to see straight away that there is a whole universe of degradation and kink and perversity to explore , and grow bored of , than getting obsessively fixated on your grandma ’s bunions or a playmate ’s soiled diaper or whatever .
Sheesh .
Case 95
Here we have a case in which a gentleman named Z struggles mightily with a very “ particular ” fetish .
“ Z. , gentleman , family tainted .
Even in early childhood he always felt great sympathy with the lame and crippled .
He used to limp about the room on two brooms in lieu of crutches or , when observed , go limping about the streets : at the same time , however , no sexual significance was coupled with the idea .
Gradually , the thought supervened that he would like “ as a pretty lame child ” to meet a pretty girl who would express sympathy for his affliction .
Sympathy from men he disdained .
Z. was brought up in a rich man ’s house by a private tutor , and claimed that up to his twentieth year he was unaware of the differences between sexes .
His feelings were confined to the idea of being pitied by a pretty girl for being lame , or extending the same sympathy to a lame girl himself .
Gradually , erotic emotions associated themselves with this fantasy and at the age of twenty he succumbed to temptation and masturbated for the first time .
From then on he practiced this act often .
Sexual neurasthenia supervened and an irritable weakness took hold of him , to such an extent that the very sight of a girl with a halting gait induced ejaculation .
When masturbating , or in his erotic dreams , the idea of the limping girls was always the controlling element .
The personality of the limping girl was a matter of indifference to Z. , his interest being solely centered on the limping foot .
He never had coitus with a girl thus afflicted .
He never had the inclination for it and did not think he could be potent under the circumstances .
His perverse fantasies revolved only around masturbating against the foot of a lame female .
At times he anchored his hope on the thought that he might succeed in winning and marrying a chaste lame girl ; that , because of his love for her , she would take pity on him and free him of his crime by ‘ transferring his love from the sole of her foot to the root of her soul . ’
He sought deliverance in this thought .
His present existence was one of untold misery . ”
Happy story that .
Though if you change a few of the words here and there sounds like it could be any average 21st century guy -
The personality of the girl was a matter of indifference to Z. , his interest being solely centered on her [ fill in blank ] .
See what I mean ?
I must say also , in regards to this case , that the sentence “ transferring his love from the sole of her foot to the root of her soul , ” words which had surely never been laid down in exactly that order , in any language , before this book ’s publication , is worth the price of admission all by itself .
( The thumbnail was adapted from an image on Susan Hagen ’s wood carvings page . )
Case 96
Here we have a variation on the theme of the previous case .
“ Mr. V. , aged thirty , civil servant ; parents neuropathic .
From the age of seven he had , for many years , a lame girl of the same age as a playmate .
At the age of twelve , nervously disposed and heterosexually inclined , the boy began to masturbate spontaneously .
At that time puberty set in , and undoubtedly the first sexual emotions toward the other sex coincided with the sight of a lame girl .
Subsequently only limping women excited him sexually .
His fetish was a pretty lady who , like the companion of his childhood , limped with the left foot .
Always heterosexual , but abnormally sensual , he promptly sought relations with the opposite sex , but was absolutely impotent with women who were not lame .
Virility and gratification were most strongly elicited if the prostitute limped with the left foot , but he was also successful if the lameness was on the right foot .
Due to his fetishism , the opportunities for coitus seldom occurred , so he resorted to masturbation , but found it a disgusting and miserable substitute .
His sexual anomaly rendered him very unhappy , and he was often close to committing suicide , but regard for his parents prevented him .
This moral affliction culminated in the desire for marriage with a sympathetic lame lady .
Unfortunately , because he could not love the soul of such a wife , but only her defect of lameness , he considered such a union a profanation of matrimony and an unbearable , ignoble existence .
On this account he had often thought of resignation and castration . ”
I ca n’t help but be in awe of this sentence in particular - “ Virility and gratification were most strongly elicited if the prostitute limped with the left foot , but he was also successful if the lameness was on the right foot . ”
The analytical and scientific thoroughness of our tortured and miserable Mr. V. for being thoughtful enough to test this particular hypothesis is brilliant .
“ Please try limping on your right foot now Ms. Prostitute … in the interest of science of course . ”
As to the case in particular - Poor Mr. V. , the silly bastard .
Not too bright was he ?
Any self respecting man of the 19th Century would have married a nice perfectly “ intact ” girl and then paid a carriage driver to run over her foot just before they made it to the honeymoon suite .
Castration ?
Uh , I think not .
-
So there you have it .
A tiny porthole into the steamy underpants of the 19th century .
Hope you enjoyed .
Evidently in 2006
Kino released a film which dramatizes many of the cases in Psychopathia Sexualis , though judging by the trailers they focussed on much of the darker material .
Note :
This post was one in a series of reworkings of old posts which date from before the redesign of The Nonist .
The text has been combined from 6 prior posts and reworked .
The images are also updated .
I will be periodically adding these reworkings into the flow of new content in an effort to eventually remove all the old pages from circulation .
At the age of 40 , King Gillette was a frustrated inventor , a bitter anticapitalist , and a salesman of cork - lined bottle caps .
It was 1895 , and despite ideas , energy , and wealthy parents , he had little to show for his work .
He blamed the evils of market competition .
Indeed , the previous year he had published a book , The Human Drift , which argued that all industry should be taken over by a single corporation owned by the public and that millions of Americans should live in a giant city called Metropolis powered by Niagara Falls .
His boss at the bottle cap company , meanwhile , had just one piece of advice : Invent something people use and throw away .
One day , while he was shaving with a straight razor that was so worn it could no longer be sharpened , the idea came to him .
What if the blade could be made of a thin metal strip ?
Rather than spending time maintaining the blades , men could simply discard them when they became dull .
A few years of metallurgy experimentation later , the disposable - blade safety razor was born .
But it did n't take off immediately .
In its first year , 1903 , Gillette sold a total of 51 razors and 168 blades .
Over the next two decades , he tried every marketing gimmick he could think of .
He put his own face on the package , making him both legendary and , some people believed , fictional .
He sold millions of razors to the Army at a steep discount , hoping the habits soldiers developed at war would carry over to peacetime .
He sold razors in bulk to banks so they could give them away with new deposits ( " shave and save " campaigns ) .
Razors were bundled with everything from Wrigley 's gum to packets of coffee , tea , spices , and marshmallows .
The freebies helped to sell those products , but the tactic helped Gillette even more .
By giving away the razors , which were useless by themselves , he was creating demand for disposable blades .
A few billion blades later , this business model is now the foundation of entire industries :
Give away the cell phone , sell the monthly plan ; make the videogame console cheap and sell expensive games ; install fancy coffeemakers in offices at no charge so you can sell managers expensive coffee sachets .
Video produced by Annaliza Savage and edited by Michael Lennon .
Thanks to Gillette , the idea that you can make money by giving something away is no longer radical .
But until recently , practically everything " free " was really just the result of what economists would call a cross-subsidy :
You'd get one thing free if you bought another , or you 'd get a product free only if you paid for a service .
Over the past decade , however , a different sort of free has emerged .
The new model is based not on cross-subsidies – the shifting of costs from one product to another – but on the fact that the cost of products themselves is falling fast .
It 's as if the price of steel had dropped so close to zero that King Gillette could give away both razor and blade , and make his money on something else entirely .
( Shaving cream ? )
You know this freaky land of free as the Web .
A decade and a half into the great online experiment , the last debates over free versus pay online are ending .
In 2007 The New York Times went free ; this year , so will much of The Wall Street Journal .
( The remaining fee - based parts , new owner Rupert Murdoch announced , will be " really special ... and , sorry to tell you , probably more expensive . "
This calls to mind one version of Stewart Brand 's original aphorism from 1984 : " Information wants to be free .
Information also wants to be expensive ... That tension will not go away . " )
Scenario 1 : Low - cost digital distribution will make the summer blockbuster free .
Theaters will make their money from concessions – and by selling the premium moviegoing experience at a high price .
Once a marketing gimmick , free has emerged as a full - fledged economy .
Offering free music proved successful for Radiohead , Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails , and a swarm of other bands on MySpace that grasped the audience - building merits of zero .
The fastest - growing parts of the gaming industry are ad - supported casual games online and free - to - try massively multiplayer online games .
Virtually everything Google does is free to consumers , from Gmail to Picasa to GOOG - 411 .
The rise of " freeconomics " is being driven by the underlying technologies that power the Web .
Just as Moore 's law dictates that a unit of processing power halves in price every 18 months , the price of bandwidth and storage is dropping even faster .
Which is to say , the trend lines that determine the cost of doing business online all point the same way : to zero .
But tell that to the poor CIO who just shelled out six figures to buy another rack of servers .
Technology sure does n't feel free when you 're buying it by the gross .
Yet if you look at it from the other side of the fat pipe , the economics change .
That expensive bank of hard drives ( fixed costs ) can serve tens of thousands of users ( marginal costs ) .
The Web is all about scale , finding ways to attract the most users for centralized resources , spreading those costs over larger and larger audiences as the technology gets more and more capable .
It 's not about the cost of the equipment in the racks at the data center ; it 's about what that equipment can do .
And every year , like some sort of magic clockwork , it does more and more for less and less , bringing the marginal costs of technology in the units that we individuals consume closer to zero .

As much as we complain about how expensive things are getting , we 're surrounded by forces that are making them cheaper .
Forty years ago , the principal nutritional problem in America was hunger ; now it 's obesity , for which we have the Green Revolution to thank .
Forty years ago , charity was dominated by clothing drives for the poor .
Now you can get a T - shirt for less than the price of a cup of coffee , thanks to China and global sourcing .
So too for toys , gadgets , and commodities of every sort .
Even cocaine has pretty much never been cheaper ( globalization works in mysterious ways ) .
Digital technology benefits from these dynamics and from something else even more powerful : the 20th - century shift from Newtonian to quantum machines .
We 're still just beginning to exploit atomic - scale effects in revolutionary new materials – semiconductors ( processing power ) , ferromagnetic compounds ( storage ) , and fiber optics ( bandwidth ) .
In the arc of history , all three substances are still new , and we have a lot to learn about them .
We are just a few decades into the discovery of a new world .
What does this mean for the notion of free ?
Well , just take one example .
Last year , Yahoo announced that Yahoo Mail , its free webmail service , would provide unlimited storage .
Just in case that was n't totally clear , that 's " unlimited " as in " infinite . "
So the market price of online storage , at least for email , has now fallen to zero ( see " Webmail Windfall " ) .
And the stunning thing is that nobody was surprised ; many had assumed infinite free storage was already the case .
For good reason :
It 's now clear that practically everything Web technology touches starts down the path to gratis , at least as far as we consumers are concerned .
Storage now joins bandwidth ( You Tube : free ) and processing power ( Google : free ) in the race to the bottom .
Basic economics tells us that in a competitive market , price falls to the marginal cost .
There 's never been a more competitive market than the Internet , and every day the marginal cost of digital information comes closer to nothing .
One of the old jokes from the late - '90s bubble was that there are only two numbers on the Internet : infinity and zero .
The first , at least as it applied to stock market valuations , proved false .
But the second is alive and well .
The Web has become the land of the free .
The result is that we now have not one but two trends driving the spread of free business models across the economy .
The first is the extension of King Gillette 's cross-subsidy to more and more industries .
Technology is giving companies greater flexibility in how broadly they can define their markets , allowing them more freedom to give away products or services to one set of customers while selling to another set .
Ryanair , for instance , has disrupted its industry by defining itself more as a full - service travel agency than a seller of airline seats ( see " How Can Air Travel Be Free ? " ) .
The second trend is simply that anything that touches digital networks quickly feels the effect of falling costs .
There 's nothing new about technology 's deflationary force , but what is new is the speed at which industries of all sorts are becoming digital businesses and thus able to exploit those economics .
When Google turned advertising into a software application , a classic services business formerly based on human economics ( things get more expensive each year ) switched to software economics ( things get cheaper ) .
So , too , for everything from banking to gambling .
The moment a company 's primary expenses become things based in silicon , free becomes not just an option but the inevitable destination .
Waste and Waste Again
Forty years ago , Caltech professor Carver Mead identified the corollary to Moore 's law of ever - increasing computing power .
Every 18 months , Mead observed , the price of a transistor would halve .
And so it did , going from tens of dollars in the 1960s to approximately 0.000001 cent today for each of the transistors in Intel 's latest quad - core .
This , Mead realized , meant that we should start to " waste " transistors .
Scenario 2 : Ads on the subway ?
That 's so 20th century .
By sponsoring the whole line and making trips free , the local merchants association brings grateful commuters to neighborhood shops .
Waste is a dirty word , and that was especially true in the IT world of the 1970s .
An entire generation of computer professionals had been taught that their job was to dole out expensive computer resources sparingly .
In the glass - walled facilities of the mainframe era , these systems operators exercised their power by choosing whose programs should be allowed to run on the costly computing machines .
Their role was to conserve transistors , and they not only decided what was worthy but also encouraged programmers to make the most economical use of their computer time .
As a result , early developers devoted as much code as possible to running their core algorithms efficiently and gave little thought to user interface .
This was the era of the command line , and the only conceivable reason someone might have wanted to use a computer at home was to organize recipe files .
In fact , the world 's first personal computer , a stylish kitchen appliance offered by Honeywell in 1969 , came with integrated counter space .
Photo Illustration : Jeff Mermelstein
And here was Mead , telling programmers to embrace waste .
They scratched their heads – how do you waste computer power ?
It took Alan Kay , an engineer working at Xerox 's Palo Alto Research Center , to show them .
Rather than conserve transistors for core processing functions , he developed a computer concept – the Dynabook – that would frivolously deploy silicon to do silly things : draw icons , windows , pointers , and even animations on the screen .
The purpose of this profligate eye candy ?
Ease of use for regular folks , including children .
Kay 's work on the graphical user interface became the inspiration for the Xerox Alto , and then the Apple Macintosh , which changed the world by opening computing to the rest of us .
( We , in turn , found no shortage of things to do with it ; tellingly , organizing recipes was not high on the list . )
Of course , computers were not free then , and they are not free today .
But what Mead and Kay understood was that the transistors in them – the atomic units of computation – would become so numerous that on an individual basis , they'd be close enough to costless that they might as well be free .
That meant software writers , liberated from worrying about scarce computational resources like memory and CPU cycles , could become more and more ambitious , focusing on higher - order functions such as user interfaces and new markets such as entertainment .
And that meant software of broader appeal , which brought in more users , who in turn found even more uses for computers .
Thanks to that wasteful throwing of transistors against the wall , the world was changed .
What 's interesting is that transistors ( or storage , or bandwidth ) do n't have to be completely free to invoke this effect .
At a certain point , they 're cheap enough to be safely disregarded .
The Greek philosopher Zeno wrestled with this concept in a slightly different context .
In Zeno 's dichotomy paradox , you run toward a wall .
As you run , you halve the distance to the wall , then halve it again , and so on .
But if you continue to subdivide space forever , how can you ever actually reach the wall ?
( The answer is that you can 't : Once you 're within a few nanometers , atomic repulsion forces become too strong for you to get any closer . )
In economics , the parallel is this :
If the unitary cost of technology ( " per megabyte " or " per megabit per second " or " per thousand floating - point operations per second " ) is halving every 18 months , when does it come close enough to zero to say that you 've arrived and can safely round down to nothing ?
The answer : almost always sooner than you think .
What Mead understood is that a psychological switch should flip as things head toward zero .
Even though they may never become entirely free , as the price drops there is great advantage to be had in treating them as if they were free .
Not too cheap to meter , as Atomic Energy Commission chief Lewis Strauss said in a different context , but too cheap to matter .
Indeed , the history of technological innovation has been marked by people spotting such price and performance trends and getting ahead of them .
From the consumer 's perspective , though , there is a huge difference between cheap and free .
Give a product away and it can go viral .
Charge a single cent for it and you 're in an entirely different business , one of clawing and scratching for every customer .
The psychology of " free " is powerful indeed , as any marketer will tell you .
This difference between cheap and free is what venture capitalist Josh Kopelman calls the " penny gap . "
People think demand is elastic and that volume falls in a straight line as price rises , but the truth is that zero is one market and any other price is another .
In many cases , that 's the difference between a great market and none at all .
The huge psychological gap between " almost zero " and " zero " is why micropayments failed .
It 's why Google does n't show up on your credit card .
It 's why modern Web companies do n't charge their users anything .
And it's why Yahoo gives away disk drive space .
The question of infinite storage was not if but when .
The winners made their stuff free first .
Traditionalists wring their hands about the " vaporization of value " and " demonetization " of entire industries .
The success of craigslist 's free listings , for instance , has hurt the newspaper classified ad business .
But that lost newspaper revenue is certainly not ending up in the craigslist coffers .
In 2006 , the site earned an estimated $ 40 million from the few things it charges for .
That 's about 12 percent of the $ 326 million by which classified ad revenue declined that year .
But free is not quite as simple – or as stupid – as it sounds .
Just because products are free does n't mean that someone , somewhere , is n't making huge gobs of money .
Google is the prime example of this .
The monetary benefits of craigslist are enormous as well , but they 're distributed among its tens of thousands of users rather than funneled straight to Craig Newmark Inc .
To follow the money , you have to shift from a basic view of a market as a matching of two parties – buyers and sellers – to a broader sense of an ecosystem with many parties , only some of which exchange cash .
The most common of the economies built around free is the three - party system .
Here a third party pays to participate in a market created by a free exchange between the first two parties .
Sound complicated ?
You 're probably experiencing it right now .
It 's the basis of virtually all media .
In the traditional media model , a publisher provides a product free ( or nearly free ) to consumers , and advertisers pay to ride along .
Radio is " free to air , " and so is much of television .
Likewise , newspaper and magazine publishers do n't charge readers anything close to the actual cost of creating , printing , and distributing their products .
They 're not selling papers and magazines to readers , they 're selling readers to advertisers .
It 's a three - way market .
In a sense , what the Web represents is the extension of the media business model to industries of all sorts .
This is not simply the notion that advertising will pay for everything .
There are dozens of ways that media companies make money around free content , from selling information about consumers to brand licensing , " value - added " subscriptions , and direct ecommerce ( see How - To Wiki for a complete list ) .
Now an entire ecosystem of Web companies is growing up around the same set of models .
A Taxonomy of Free
Between new ways companies have found to subsidize products and the falling cost of doing business in a digital age , the opportunities to adopt a free business model of some sort have never been greater .
But which one ?
And how many are there ?
Probably hundreds , but the priceless economy can be broken down into six broad categories :
" Freemium "
What 's free :
Web software and services , some content .
Free to whom : users of the basic version .
This term , coined by venture capitalist Fred Wilson , is the basis of the subscription model of media and is one of the most common Web business models .
It can take a range of forms : varying tiers of content , from free to expensive , or a premium " pro " version of some site or software with more features than the free version ( think Flickr and the $ 25 - a- year Flickr Pro ) .
Again , this sounds familiar .
Is n't it just the free sample model found everywhere from perfume counters to street corners ?
Yes , but with a pretty significant twist .
The traditional free sample is the promotional candy bar handout or the diapers mailed to a new mother .
Since these samples have real costs , the manufacturer gives away only a tiny quantity – hoping to hook consumers and stimulate demand for many more .

But for digital products , this ratio of free to paid is reversed .
A typical online site follows the 1 Percent Rule – 1 percent of users support all the rest .
In the freemium model , that means for every user who pays for the premium version of the site , 99 others get the basic free version .
The reason this works is that the cost of serving the 99 percent is close enough to zero to call it nothing .
Advertising
What 's free : content , services , software , and more .
Free to whom : everyone .
Broadcast commercials and print display ads have given way to a blizzard of new Web - based ad formats :
Yahoo's pay - per - pageview banners , Google 's pay - per - click text ads , Amazon 's pay - per- transaction " affiliate ads , " and site sponsorships were just the start .
Then came the next wave : paid inclusion in search results , paid listing in information services , and lead generation , where a third party pays for the names of people interested in a certain subject .
Now companies are trying everything from product placement ( PayPerPost ) to pay - per- connection on social networks like Facebook .
All of these approaches are based on the principle that free offerings build audiences with distinct interests and expressed needs that advertisers will pay to reach .
Cross-subsidies
What 's free : any product that entices you to pay for something else .
Free to whom : everyone willing to pay eventually , one way or another .
Scenario 3 : It 's a free second - gen Wiii !
But only if you buy the deluxe version of Rock Band .
When Wal - Mart charges $ 15 for a new hit DVD , it 's a loss leader .
The company is offering the DVD below cost to lure you into the store , where it hopes to sell you a washing machine at a profit .
Expensive wine subsidizes food in a restaurant , and the original " free lunch " was a gratis meal for anyone who ordered at least one beer in San Francisco saloons in the late 1800s .
In any package of products and services , from banking to mobile calling plans , the price of each individual component is often determined by psychology , not cost .
Your cell phone company may not make money on your monthly minutes – it keeps that fee low because it knows that 's the first thing you look at when picking a carrier – but your monthly voicemail fee is pure profit .
On a busy corner in São Paulo , Brazil , street vendors pitch the latest " tecnobrega " CDs , including one by a hot band called Banda Calypso .
Like CDs from most street vendors , these did not come from a record label .
But neither are they illicit .
They came directly from the band .
Calypso distributes masters of its CDs and CD liner art to street vendor networks in towns it plans to tour , with full agreement that the vendors will copy the CDs , sell them , and keep all the money .
That 's OK , because selling discs is n't Calypso 's main source of income .
The band is really in the performance business – and business is good .
Traveling from town to town this way , preceded by a wave of supercheap CDs , Calypso has filled its shows and paid for a private jet .
The vendors generate literal street cred in each town Calypso visits , and its omnipresence in the urban soundscape means that it gets huge crowds to its rave / dj / concert events .
Free music is just publicity for a far more lucrative tour business .
Nobody thinks of this as piracy .
Zero marginal cost
What 's free : things that can be distributed without an appreciable cost to anyone .
Free to whom : everyone .
This describes nothing so well as online music .
Between digital reproduction and peer - to - peer distribution , the real cost of distributing music has truly hit bottom .
This is a case where the product has become free because of sheer economic gravity , with or without a business model .
That force is so powerful that laws , guilt trips , DRM , and every other barrier to piracy the labels can think of have failed .
Some artists give away their music online as a way of marketing concerts , merchandise , licensing , and other paid fare .
But others have simply accepted that , for them , music is not a moneymaking business .
It 's something they do for other reasons , from fun to creative expression .
Which , of course , has always been true for most musicians anyway .
Labor exchange
What 's free :
Web sites and services .
Free to whom : all users , since the act of using these sites and services actually creates something of value .
You can get free porn if you solve a few captchas , those scrambled text boxes used to block bots .
What you 're actually doing is giving answers to a bot used by spammers to gain access to other sites – which is worth more to them than the bandwidth you 'll consume browsing images .
Likewise for rating stories on Digg , voting on Yahoo Answers , or using Google 's 411 service ( see " How Can Directory Assistance Be Free ? " ) .
In each case , the act of using the service creates something of value , either improving the service itself or creating information that can be useful somewhere else .
Gift economy
What 's free : the whole enchilada , be it open source software or user - generated content .
Free to whom : everyone .
From Freecycle ( free secondhand goods for anyone who will take them away ) to Wikipedia , we are discovering that money is n't the only motivator .
Altruism has always existed , but the Web gives it a platform where the actions of individuals can have global impact .
In a sense , zero - cost distribution has turned sharing into an industry .
In the monetary economy it all looks free – indeed , in the monetary economy it looks like unfair competition – but that says more about our shortsighted ways of measuring value than it does about the worth of what 's created .
The Economics of Abundance
Enabled by the miracle of abundance , digital economics has turned traditional economics upside down .
Read your college textbook and it's likely to define economics as " the social science of choice under scarcity . "
The entire field is built on studying trade - offs and how they 're made .
Milton Friedman himself reminded us time and time again that " there 's no such thing as a free lunch .
" But Friedman was wrong in two ways .
First , a free lunch does n't necessarily mean the food is being given away or that you 'll pay for it later – it could just mean someone else is picking up the tab .
Second , in the digital realm , as we 've seen , the main feedstocks of the information economy – storage , processing power , and bandwidth – are getting cheaper by the day .
Two of the main scarcity functions of traditional economics – the marginal costs of manufacturing and distribution – are rushing headlong to zip .
It 's as if the restaurant suddenly did n't have to pay any food or labor costs for that lunch .
Surely economics has something to say about that ?
It does .
The word is externalities , a concept that holds that money is not the only scarcity in the world .
Chief among the others are your time and respect , two factors that we 've always known about but have only recently been able to measure properly .
The " attention economy " and " reputation economy " are too fuzzy to merit an academic department , but there 's something real at the heart of both .
Thanks to Google , we now have a handy way to convert from reputation ( PageRank ) to attention ( traffic ) to money ( ads ) .
Anything you can consistently convert to cash is a form of currency itself , and Google plays the role of central banker for these new economies .
There is , presumably , a limited supply of reputation and attention in the world at any point in time .
These are the new scarcities – and the world of free exists mostly to acquire these valuable assets for the sake of a business model to be identified later .
Free shifts the economy from a focus on only that which can be quantified in dollars and cents to a more realistic accounting of all the things we truly value today .
Free Changes Everything
Between digital economics and the wholesale embrace of King 's Gillette 's experiment in price shifting , we are entering an era when free will be seen as the norm , not an anomaly .
How big a deal is that ?
Well , consider this analogy :
In 1954 , at the dawn of nuclear power , Lewis Strauss , head of the Atomic Energy Commission , promised that we were entering an age when electricity would be " too cheap to meter . "
Needless to say , that did n't happen , mostly because the risks of nuclear energy hugely increased its costs .
But what if he'd been right ?
What if electricity had in fact become virtually free ?
The answer is that everything electricity touched – which is to say just about everything – would have been transformed .
Rather than balance electricity against other energy sources , we 'd use electricity for as many things as we could – we'd waste it , in fact , because it would be too cheap to worry about .
All buildings would be electrically heated , never mind the thermal conversion rate .
We 'd all be driving electric cars ( free electricity would be incentive enough to develop the efficient battery technology to store it ) .
Massive desalination plants would turn seawater into all the freshwater anyone could want , irrigating vast inland swaths and turning deserts into fertile acres , many of them making biofuels as a cheaper store of energy than batteries .
Relative to free electrons , fossil fuels would be seen as ludicrously expensive and dirty , and so carbon emissions would plummet .
The phrase " global warming " would have never entered the language .
Today it 's digital technologies , not electricity , that have become too cheap to meter .
It took decades to shake off the assumption that computing was supposed to be rationed for the few , and we 're only now starting to liberate bandwidth and storage from the same poverty of imagination .
But a generation raised on the free Web is coming of age , and they will find entirely new ways to embrace waste , transforming the world in the process .
Because free is what you want – and free , increasingly , is what you 're going to get .

As thousands of Americans take to the streets this week , they will face a rising right - wing offensive to discredit and derail the antiwar movement .
The cry of “ troops home now ” will echo in 11 cities as an intense year - long battle begins to sharpen .
Not since 2002 will the antiwar movement  and dovish Democrats  face as virulent and lavishly funded a backlash as this one .
Consider the gathering storm :
A powerful and persistent faction of hawks , centered in Vice President Cheney ’s office , is pushing for a military strike against Iran in the coming year .
The orchestrated campaign for continuing the “ surge ” in Iraq , led by Gen.
Petraeus , succeeded in restoring the nerve of the Republican Party and defeating the Democratic strategy of seeking Republican defections .
The well - coordinated attacks on MoveOn.org were designed to destroy the group ’s proven ability to raise millions of dollars for antiwar messages and , in general , Democratic candidates .
Seventy - five senators , including the likes of Barbara Boxer , rushed to denounce MoveOn , thus helping the effort to de-legitimize the organization .
Ari Fleischer , the former Bush spokesman who warned Americans to “ watch what you say , ” now heads an organization that spent $ 15 million to promote the war as patriotic .
Pro-Israel and Christian Right groups are attempting to raise $ 200 million for a campaign calling for war with Iran .
Rudy Giuliani , currently the Republican front - runner , has selected neocon godfather Norman Podhoretz as his national security adviser .
David Horowitz is spending millions of dollars to demonize pro-peace professors and organize on campuses against what the neocons call “ Islamofascism . ”
The neocons and hawks of all stripes are fighting back .
They already have succeeded in gaining political traction for the escalation in Baghdad , counter - punching the Democratic critics into a corner , planting major stories of “ success ” in the media , and gaining top positions in Giuliani ’s presidential campaign .
Their campaign for war in Iran ( Podhoretz says he “ prays ” for it everyday , an apparent message to the Christian Right ) is on track .
Their top priority is to isolate the antiwar movement and its Democratic allies as “ too extreme . ”
In 2002 , when most of the American people were frozen by the 9/11 experience , it was a matter of trying to prevent the development of antiwar sentiment .
In 2007 , however , the neocons face a more daunting challenge : how to undermine the American majority favoring rapid withdrawal from Iraq ?
As Podhoretz , Horowitz , and writers like Dinesh D’Souza constantly emphasize , the real war is at home , with the leftists and liberals who they believe to be the modern equivalents of “ fellow travelers ” during the Cold War era .
Their major target is MoveOn , with its vast resources and credibility .
But ever in search of potential demons , they lately have been smearing and attacking Code Pink .
The Canadian neocon ally Premier Stephen Harper ordered Medea Benjamin and Ann Wright stopped at the border last week .
The tactical purpose is clear , to make certain antiwar groups radioactive , or too hot to handle , thus damaging their efforts to push the mainstream along , forcing them from offense to defense .
If they succeed in their plans for Iran , they believe Republican presidential chances may be enhanced in 2008 .
All this suggests that antiwar activists face the challenge of being equally strategic .
Impressive turnouts will be needed Oct. 27 .
Coalition - building will be a priority ( already , many busloads of black congregations will be joining the Chicago event , Katrina victims will be turning out by the thousands in New Orleans , and protesters in Tennessee will be converging on the nation ’s major depleted uranium facility  welcomed by the mayor ) .
Unsettled , however , are to key questions needing broad consensus among the diverse multitudes of marchers :
What is the most effective public message for the antiwar movement in the run-up to the bombing of Iran , and what should the movement be doing in the hours , days , and weeks after such an attack ?
What is the most effective approach to the 2008 election if the choice is between a Republican extremist and a moderate Democratic hawk ?
The marchers on Oct. 27 , in twos and threes and larger workshops , will be considering the future of a movement at a crossroads .

The idea for last week 's Listening Post column , which examined the strange demand for vinyl records in the digital age , was inspired to a small extent by Optimal Media Production 's vinyl / CD hybrid , which is just like a normal CD except that on the top , it has vinyl grooves etched in .
Place a VinylDisc on your turntable , drop the needle at the start of the track , and you 'll hear up to 3.5 minutes of music at 33 RPM .
Since CDs have a hole at their center that 's too large to fit on a vinyl spindle , you 'll need to use the little rubber adapter that comes with each disc to center the disc on your record player ; otherwise , it 'll go off - center and you 'll hear the music speed up and slow down with each revolution .
As for the overall sound quality , I just finished giving the vinyl side of a Sonic Kollectiv VinylDisc compilation a spin , and it sounded decent – not as good as 180 gram , but certainly good enough to warrant consideration from bands and labels looking to offer something new to their customers : a CD thateveryone can play , with a secret bonus track in the grooves ontop for those who have record players .
Other weird offerings from Optimal Media Production include etchedvinyl , perfumed CDs , and a partially metallized disc that makes " specially chosen images float through the room , seeminglythree - dimensional and extraordinarily vivid . "

Newly - released records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request contradict the 9/11 Commission ’s report on the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks and raise fresh questions about the role of Saudi government officials in connection to the hijackers .
The nearly 300 pages of a Federal Bureau of Investigation timeline used by the 9/11 Commission as the basis for many of its findings were acquired through a FOIA request filed by Kevin Fenton , a 26 year old translator from the Czech Republic .
The FBI released the 298 - page “ hijacker timeline ” Feb .
4 .
The FBI timeline reveals that alleged hijacker Hamza Al - Ghamdi , who was aboard the United Airlines flight which crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center , had booked a future flight to San Francisco .
He also had a ticket for a trip from Casablanca to Riyadh , the capital of Saudi Arabia .
Though referenced repeatedly in the footnotes of the final 9/11 Commission report , the timeline has not previously been made available to the public .
When Guy Hoelzer runs computer simulations of organisms living in the modeling equivalent of a featureless plain , he sees them break into different species – * even though there 's no reason for natural selection to take place . *
That preliminary but tantalizing finding hints at some larger phenomenon driving the mechanisms of neo-Darwinian evolution .
Hoelzer thinks the phenomenon is self - organization : combine energy with complex networked interaction and order will emerge .
In the abstract of " On the logical relationship between natural selection and self - organization , " published in 2006 in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology , he described natural selection as " a mechanism that coordinates the coevolution of species in an ecosystem to effectively capture , process and dissipate solar energy into the earth 's shadow ... an emergent process founded on the same thermodynamic imperatives that are thought to underlie all self - organization . "
I came across that paper while researching an upcoming article on the application of complexity theory to evolutionary biology , and was fortunate enough to interview Hoelzer .
( Another interview , with microbiology titan Carl Woese , came out in Wired Science yesterday . )
Here 's what he said :
The idea of self - organization as a natural engine of activity seems like a relevant thing for evolutionary biology .
But at least in this country , I detected a large resistance to this idea from evolutionary biologists devoted to exploring Darwinian theories of evolutionary biology and adaptation .
I never saw them as being in conflict – but that was the feedback I was getting .
In the paper we explored the relationship and came to conclusion that Darwinian natural selection is a mechanism of self - organization in the biosphere .
We saw these concepts as tightly linked : the idea of natural selection embedded within self - organization .
The way I think about it in the biological sense is from thermodynamic point of view , which is the same way chemists think of self - assembly in molecules .
It 's a somewhat outcome - driven process : the precise mechanisms that get you to that outcome are less fundamental than the outcome achieved .
You 're maximizing the rate of entropy production and so on .
In a biological system , if the function is to break down gradients and increase the rate of entropy production , natural selection is an effective evolutionary way to get there .
It coordinates the ecological roles of species such that the ecosystem persists and processes a great deal of energy .
This particular perspctive works at all scales .
That in fact is part of the idea here : to extend thermodynamic thinking up to the scale of ecosystems and the biosphere .
It 's not inconsistent with the Gaia idea .
I 'm doing some very early research at the single - species level , where
I 'm doing computational modeling of population genetics .
It involves a different approach from traditional mathematical modeling : it allows us to spread a population across a large [ and uniform ] space in the computer model .
One thing I find is that as mutation occurs in the system , it drives genetic divergences in a spatially localized way .
I get spacial self - organization .
One sub -species dominates in one place ;
a different sub -species in another place .
If I allow genetic incompatibilities to evolve through mutation , we get speciation .
Speciation is a process of self - organizaiton of the gene pool ; in this case , it 's not driven by adaptation to environmental conditions .
It 's as if – to put in teleological language – its as if these populations are inherently , internally , a machine of diversification that creates types that are spatially localized .
If you add environmental variables , does it chage ?
It 's early in the project – but I want to address that .
There 's no doubt that environmental variation will impact the process , but I doubt that it will overwhelm it .
I think this internal dynamic , which is a matter of self - organization , is omnipresent and universal .
I see it as physics – my own point of view is that chemistry is a subset of physics , and biology a subset of chemistry , so these scales of organization of matter are all aspects of self - organization and driven by physics .
What are the drivers ?
From a thermodynamic perspective , if you have a dynamical system composed of lots parts , it seems to rather generically have this tendency to self - organization .
That builds higher levels of organizations , from ( perhaps ) strings to subatomic particles up to macromolecules , to biomolcules , cells , multicellular organisms , species , ecosystems and so on .
I think there 's quite a wave of work being done in this area that may not be appreciated by some evolutionary biologists until it 's washed over the field .
I think we 'll wake up one day and turn around and say ,
" Wow !
We lived through a revolution in our thinking of evolution .
We wo n't realize until it 's done .
But I do n't see ideas about self - organizing complex systems as competing with our traditional Darwininan evolution , but extending them and putting them into a thermodynamic context .
I 'd hope that my colleagues would see this as a point of view for deepening understanding .
If this interests you , be sure to check out the Carl Woese interview .
Another Woese tidbit : he called evolution a variation on the second law of thermodynamics , of the progress from high to low universal energy , to a point where even atoms fall apart .
Maybe that 's not what 's going to happen , he said : maybe " the universe is going to decay into all these wonderful sculptures . "
When would it stop , I asked ?
" When does an algorithm stop ? " replied Woese .
" Certain algorithms continue to change in their state .
They go on and on .
You would n't ask when an algorithm has run its course .
Evolution is like that . "

In fact , you do n’t need to have a panel at all .
Here ’s how to remove the bottom panel in KDE 4.0 :
Browse to ~/.kde4 / share / config/ and make a backup copy of of the plasma - appletsrc file .
This is the file you will need to edit .
You can use the backup to restore the panel and your widgets to their previous configuration .
Remove all your widgets from the panel .
( I ’m not sure this is necessary . )
Log in to another desktop environment .
You ca n’t edit the plasma - appletsrc file while logged in to KDE 4.0 because your changes will be overwritten .
I used GNOME to do the editing , if you do n’t have another desktop environment to use you can log out and switch to a virtual terminal .
( Use Ctrl - Alt - F1 to open the terminal and Ctrl - Alt - F7 to switch back . )
Open ~/.kde4/share/config/plasma-appletsrc .
Find the section defining the panel and remove it .
This is what it should look like : [ Containments ] [ 2 ] formfactor=2 geometry =0,994,1680,56 location=4 locked =false plugin=panel screen=0 transform=1,0,0,0,1,0,0 , -1056,1
Save the file , switch back to KDE , and the panel should be gone .
I added the Application Launcher Menu , Digital Clock , Notes , Pager , System Tray , and Task Manager widgets to the desktop to replace the panel .
The only problem is the Task Manager window list , which is always a square .
When windows are on top of your widgets , press Ctrl - F12 to bring them to the top .

* Photo : Rennio Maifredi * A constable in a sweat - stained undershirt and checkered blue sarong lays a ragged cloth over a patch of mud .
He jerks open the back door of a decrepit Indian - made Tata Sumo SUV — what passes for an evidence locker at this rustic police outpost in the Indian state of West Bengal .
A hundred human skulls tumble out onto the cloth , making a hollow clatter as they fall to the ground .
They 've lost most of their teeth bouncing around the back of the truck .
Bits of bone and enamel scatter like snowflakes around the growing pile .
Standing next to the truck , the ranking officer smiles and lets out a satisfied grunt .
" Now you can see how big the bone business is here , " he says .
I crouch down and pick up a skull .
It 's lighter than I expected .
I hold it up to my nose .
It smells like fried chicken .
Before the authorities intercepted it , this cache was moving along a well - established pipeline for human skeletal remains .
For 150 years , India 's bone trade has followed a route from remote Indian villages to the world 's most distinguished medical schools .
Skeletons are n't easy to get .
In the US , for instance , most corpses receive a prompt burial , and bodies donated to science usually end up on the dissection table , their bones sawed to pieces and destined for cremation .
So most skeletons used for medical study come from overseas .
Often they arrive without the informed consent of their former owners and in violation of the laws of their country of origin .
India has long been the world 's primary source of bones used in medical study , renowned for producing specimens scrubbed to a pristine white patina and fitted with high - quality connecting hardware .
In 1985 , however , the Indian government outlawed the export of human remains , and the global supply of skeletons collapsed .
Western countries turned to China and Eastern Europe , but those regions produce relatively few skeletons .
They have little experience producing display - quality specimens , and their products are regarded as inferior .
Now , 22 years after India 's export ban , there are signs that the trade never ended .
Black - market vendors in West Bengal continue to supply human skeletons and skulls using the time - honored method : Rob graves , separate soft flesh from unyielding calcium , and deliver the bones to distributors — who assemble them and ship them to dealers around the globe .
Exports to North America are still small compared with pre-ban levels , but shipments are finding their way to American medical programs .
Suppliers have ample incentive — it 's a lucrative business .
The skulls on the ground before me , for instance , would fetch an estimated $ 70,000 overseas .
The constable grabs the cloth by its corners and gathers the evidence into a bundle .
" You know , I 've never seen anything like this , " he says .
" I hope I do n't again . "
A massive low - pressure system over the Bay of Bengal is threatening to flood the state of West Bengal .
Newspapers have already dubbed the storm a " watery apocalypse " after eight people drowned in floods before it even touched land .
I 'm driving to the tiny village of Purbasthali — about 80 miles outside of Kolkata , the state capital — the site of the processing plant where the police discovered their load of skulls .
My rented Toyota Qualis gets stuck in the mud half a mile from the facility , so I jump out to make my way on foot .
The sky is pitch - black , the rain suffocating .
Toads the size of boxing gloves hop across the muddy track .
When police arrived to investigate last spring , they could smell the stench of rotting flesh from nearly a mile away .
Sections of spine strung together with twine dangled from the rafters , an officer told me .
Hundreds of bones were scattered on the floor in some sort of ordering system .
This bone factory had been operating for more than 100 years when two of its workers , drinking at a bar , bragged that they were hired to dig bodies out of graves .
Shocked villagers dragged them to a police station , where they confessed .
The workers said a man named Mukti Biswas ran the factory .
The authorities knew him well .
In 2006 , police had arrested Biswas as the kingpin of a grave - robbing ring ; he was released a day later , news reports said , " because of his political links . "
The police took him into custody once again , but he was let out on bail and has since taken flight .
After 10 minutes of slogging through the mud , I make out the flicker of a gas lamp .
I peek into the doorway of a wood - frame house .
A family of four sitting on the dirt floor stares back at me .
" Do you know Mukti Biswas ? " I ask .
" The bastard still owes me money , " replies Manoj Pal , a twentysomething man with a thin mustache .
His family has been working at the bone factory for generations , he says .
He offers to show me around , and we head out along the bank of the Bhagirathi River .
The processing plant is little more than a bamboo hut with a tarpaulin roof — one of a dozen bone factories Pal says he knows about .
In April , the authorities confiscated piles of bones , buckets of hydrochloric acid , and two barrels full of a caustic chemical they have yet to identify .
All that 's left is a dirt floor with a large concrete vat sunk into the ground .
A third - generation bone trader , Biswas had no problem finding dead bodies .
As caretaker of the village 's cremation ground , he claimed to have a license to dispose of the dead .
But police told reporters he was robbing graves .
Biswas pilfered corpses from cemeteries , morgues , and funeral pyres ; he would drag the deceased from the flames as soon as the families left .
He employed almost a dozen people to shepherd the bones through the various stages of de-fleshing and curing .
For this work , Pal says he earned $ 1.25 a day .
He also received a bonus for keeping the bones from a given body together so they represented a biological individual rather than a mishmash of parts — a feature prized by doctors .
Pal explains the factory 's production process .
First the corpses were wrapped in netting and anchored in the river , where bacteria and fish reduced a body to a loose pile of bones and mush in a week or so .
The crew then scrubbed the bones and boiled them in a cauldron of water and caustic soda to dissolve any remaining flesh .
That left the calcium surfaces with a yellow tint .
To bring them up to medical white , bones were then left in sunlight for a week before being soaked in hydrochloric acid .
Biswas sold complete skeletons wholesale for $ 45 to a medical supply company called Young Brothers , which wired the pieces together , painted on medical diagrams , and sawed away sections of the skulls to reveal internal structures .
Then Young Brothers sold the bones to dealers around the world .
Shining my flashlight on the floor , I pick up a wet rag .
The translator lets out a low hiss .
" I hope you know that 's a death shroud , " he says .
I drop the cloth and wipe my hand on my shirt .

The empirical study of human anatomy took off with Leonardo da Vinci 's sketches in the 15th century ; the earliest extant articulated skeleton dates from 1543 .
As medicine advanced , physicians were expected to have a systematic understanding of the human body 's inner workings .
By the beginning of the 19th century , Europe 's demand for human remains far outstripped supply .
In England , home of many of the world 's preeminent medical institutions , grave robbing became so commonplace that certain cemeteries were famous for battles between grieving families and marauding medical students .
To contain the problem , the government passed the Anatomy Act of 1832 , allowing doctors to take any corpse that was left unclaimed in a city morgue or hospital .
The law put an end to grave robbery , but the supply of legal skeletons still could n't keep up with demand .
So British doctors looked to the colonies .
In India , members of the dom caste , who traditionally performed cremations , were pressed into service processing bones .
In the 1850s , Calcutta Medical College processed 900 skeletons a year , mostly for shipment abroad .
A century later , a newly independent India dominated the world market for human bones .
In 1985 , the Chicago Tribune reported that India had exported about 60,000 skulls and skeletons the year before .
The supply was sufficient for every medical student in the developed world to buy a bone box along with their textbooks .
Price : $ 300 .
If most of the merchandise was stolen , at least exporting it was legal .
" For years , we ran everything aboveboard , " Bimalendu Bhattacharjee , a former president of the Indian Association of Exporters of Anatomical Specimens , told the Los Angeles Times in 1991 .
" No one advertised , but everyone knew it was going on . "
At their height , Kolkata 's bone factories took in an estimated $ 1 million a year .
But it could n't last .
The graveyards of West Bengal were being picked clean , and the lure of ready money soon attracted criminal elements .
The industry shuddered to a halt in March 1985 , when a bone trader was arrested after exporting 1,500 child skeletons .
Because they 're relatively rare and illustrate transitional stages in osteological development , child skeletons command higher prices .
Indian newspapers claimed that children were being kidnapped and killed for their bones .
Panic spread with news of the arrest .
In the months after the indictment , vigilantes combed the cities searching for members of the alleged kidnappers ' network .
In September , an Australian tourist was killed and a Japanese tourist was beaten by a mob after rumors spread that they were involved in the conspiracy .
The attacks might have been enough to stall India 's bone industry , but the government had already taken action :
A few weeks earlier , India 's Supreme Court interpreted the national Import / Export Control Act to prohibit the export of human tissue .
In the absence of competing suppliers in other countries , the court 's decision effectively shut down international trade in human skeletons .
Medical schools in the US and Europe begged the Indian government to reverse the export ban , to no avail .
Since then , natural human bone has been difficult to come by .
The voracious demand for fresh cadavers in medical education consumes nearly all donated corpses in the US , and in any case , processing skeletons is a slow , messy business that few people care to take on .
When high - quality specimens do become available , they tend to be costly .
A complete skeleton in good condition now retails for several thousand dollars , and orders can take months , even years , to fulfill .
Students no longer buy their own bone boxes ; instead , schools usually keep an inventory that 's replaced only when specimens are damaged or stolen .
Stanford Medical School allocates half a skeleton , cleaved down the middle , for every two students .
Such policies mean that many established institutions already have all the bones they need .
The biggest buyers of skeletons are new and growing schools throughout the world that need to outfit their labs .
Some institutions have turned to plastic replicas .
But artificial substitutes are n't ideal .
" Plastic models are reproductions of a single specimen and do n't include the range of variations found in real osteology , " says Samuel Kennedy , who stocks the anatomy program at Harvard Medical School .
Students trained on facsimiles never see these differences among individuals .
Moreover , the models are n't entirely accurate .
" The molding process does n't capture the detail of a real specimen , " Kennedy adds .
" This is especially critical in the skull . "
In the US , major dealers like Kilgore International are making do selling replicas .
" My father would have done almost anything to get back into the bone business , " says Craig Kilgore , who runs the company his father founded .
" He was legally blind but would still come to the office and write letters to anyone , anywhere in the world , that he felt could be of help to reopen the supply . "
His father , who died in 1995 , did n't live to see the turnaround .
Tucked away on a side street between one of Kolkata 's largest graveyards and one of its busiest hospitals , Young Brothers ' headquarters looks more like an abandoned warehouse than a leading distributor of human skeletons .
The rusted front gate appears to have been padlocked and forgotten a decade ago .
Above the entrance , the company sign is a tableau of peeling paint .
It was n't always this way .
The building was bustling with activity in 2001 , according to former Kolkata Health Department chief Javed Ahmed Khan .
At the time , neighbors complained that the Young Brothers offices stank of death .
Huge piles of bones lay drying on the roof .
When the police refused to file a case , Khan raided the building with a posse of bamboo - wielding heavies .
" There were two rooms full of human skeletons , " Khan recalls .
It took five trucks to haul them away .
He also seized thousands of documents , including invoices to companies all around the world .
" They were sending shipments to Thailand , Brazil , Europe , and the United States , " he says .
Sixteen years after the export ban , it was as if the law had never taken effect .
" We used to fill orders all over the world , " says a clerk employed by Young Brothers between 1999 and 2001 , who requested anonymity .
" We used to buy bones from Mukti Biswas .
I saw more than 5,000 dead bodies . "
There were other suppliers , too , and factories up and down the length of West Bengal .
The company took in roughly $ 15,000 a month .
Khan 's raid prompted the police to arrest Young Brothers ' owner , Vinesh Aron .
He spent two nights in jail before being released .
Today , there are no bones on the roof .
I 've been poking around the area for an hour or so , interviewing neighbors , when a white van pulls up to the building .
A man dressed in a pink - checkered shirt steps out .
He walks briskly to a side door and knocks : Vinesh Aron .
Aron sees me snapping photos and knocks more forcefully , but the assistant inside is having trouble with the lock .
As I try to formulate a question , my translator shoves a microphone in his face and asks whether he 's still shipping skeletons to the West .
Looking flustered , Aron blurts , " We won that case ! "
The entrance cracks open and he slips in before the door slams in my face .
In a subsequent phone conversation , Aron says he now sells medical models and charts , but no bones .
However , a vendor of surgical instrument supplies who claims to be his brother - in - law says Young Brothers is the only bone distributor in the country .
" My brother - in - law is the only man who still does this in India .
He is the only one with guts , " he says .
Then he offers to dig up a skeleton for me for 1,000 rupees ( $ 25 ) .
The most recent Young Brothers catalog ( 2006 - 2007 ) takes care to inform customers that it abides by the law .
It lists a wide assortment of bones at wholesale prices , noting that they 're " for sale in India only . "
Indian skeletons are somehow making it out of the country anyway .
In Canada , Osta International sells human bones throughout the US and Europe .
The 40 - year - old company offers to fill orders immediately .
" About half of our business is in the States , " says Christian Ruediger , who runs the business with his father , Hans .
Ruediger admits that Osta stocks bones from India , presumably smuggled out of the country in violation of the export law .
Until a few years ago , he got them from a distributor in Paris , but that source dried up in 2001 — around the time Javed Khan raided Young Brothers .
Since then , he has bought his stock from a middleman in Singapore .
He declines to provide the name .
" We want to keep a low profile , " he says .
Of some 30 institutions I contacted in the course of researching this article , the handful that admitted to buying bones in the past few years declined to reveal their sources or speak on record .
Osta 's name came up twice .
" I bought a complete skeleton and a dissected human demonstration skull from Osta , " a professor at a prestigious Virginia college says .
" Both were excellent . "
Another Osta customer is a firm called Dentsply Rinn , which offers a plastic model head containing a real skull , used in training dentists .
" It 's very difficult to procure human bones , " marketing manager Kimberly Brown says .
" Our requirements stipulate that the skulls must be of a certain size and grade and without certain anatomical defects .
But we have no requirement for their origin . "
Indian authorities express a similar lack of concern .
Although the international bone trade violates the national export law and local statutes against grave desecration , officials look the other way .
" This is not a new thing , " says Rajeev Kumar , West Bengal 's deputy inspector general of police .
" There 's no evidence that they were killing people . "
The police took an interest in Biswas only because the bodies of a few important people went missing .
" We are trying to implement the law based on the stress society places on it , " he adds .
" Society does not see this as a very serious thing . "
The need to study human bones in medicine is well established .
The need to obtain the informed consent of people whose bones are studied is not .
The reemergence of India 's bone trade reflects the tension between these requirements .
Someday doctors may develop a supply chain based on voluntary donation .
Meanwhile , the bone factories of Kolkata are open for business .

Fuse :: DBI - mount your database as filesystem and use it
SYNOPSIS
Top
use Fuse :: DBI ; Fuse :: DBI -> mount ( ... ) ;
See run below for examples how to set parameters .
DESCRIPTION
Top
This module will use Fuse module , part of FUSE ( Filesystem in USErspace ) available at http://fuse.sourceforge.net/ to mount your database as file system .
That will give you possibility to use normal file - system tools ( cat , grep , vi ) to manipulate data in database .
It 's actually opposite of Oracle 's intention to put everything into database .
METHODS
Top
mount
Mount your database as filesystem .
Let 's suppose that your database have table files with following structure : id : int filename : text size : int content : text writable : boolean Following is example how to mount table like that to / mnt : my $ mnt = Fuse : : DBI -> mount ( { ' filenames ' => ' select id , filename , size , writable from files ' , ' read ' => ' select content from files where id = ? ' , ' update ' => ' update files set content = ?
where id = ? ' , ' dsn ' => ' DBI : Pg:dbname=test_db ' , ' user ' => ' database_user ' , ' password ' => ' database_password ' , ' invalidate ' => sub { ... } , } ) ; Options : filenames SQL query which returns id ( unique id for that row ) , filename , size and writable boolean flag .
read SQL query which returns only one column with content of file and has placeholder ?
for id .
update SQL query with two pace - holders , one for new content and one for id .
dsn DBI dsn to connect to ( contains database driver and name of database ) .
user
User with which to connect to database password Password for connecting to database invalidate Optional anonymous code reference which will be executed when data is updated in database .
It can be used as hook to delete cache ( for example on - disk - cache ) which is created from data edited through Fuse : : DBI . fork Optional flag which forks after mount so that executing script will continue running .
Implementation is experimental .
There is also alternative way which can generate read and update queries on the fly : my $ mnt = Fuse : : DBI -> mount ( { ' filenames ' => ' select id , filename , size , writable from files ' , ' read ' => sub { my ( $ path , $ file ) = @_ ; return ( ' select content from files where id = ? ' , $ file -> {row} - > {id} ) ; } , ' update ' => sub { my ( $ path , $ file ) = @_ ; return ( ' update files set content = ?
where id = ?' , $ file -> {row} -> {id} ) ; } , ' dsn ' => ' DBI : Pg:dbname=test_db ' , ' user ' => ' database_user ' , ' password ' => ' database_password ' , ' invalidate ' => sub { ... } , } ) ;
is_mounted
Check if fuse filesystem is mounted if ( $ mnt-> is_mounted ) { ... }
umount
Unmount your database as filesystem .
$ mnt ->umount ;
This will also kill background process which is translating database to filesystem .
fuse_module_loaded
Checks if fuse module is loaded in kernel .
die " no fuse module loaded in kernel " unless ( Fuse : : DBI::fuse_module_loaded ) ;
This function in called by mount , but might be useful alone also .
EXPORT
Top
Nothing .
BUGS
Top
Size information ( ls -s ) is wrong .
It 's a problem in upstream Fuse module ( for which I 'm to blame lately ) , so when it gets fixes , Fuse : : DBI will automagically pick it up .

In the aftermath of the dispiriting comments following last week ’s post on the Parapsychological Association , it seems worth spelling out in detail the claim that parapsychological phenomena are inconsistent with the known laws of physics .
The main point here is that , while there are certainly many things that modern science does not understand , there are also many things that it does understand , and those things simply do not allow for telekinesis , telepathy , etc .
Which is not to say that we can prove those things are n’t real .
We can’t , but that is a completely worthless statement , as science never proves anything ; that ’s simply not how science works .
Rather , it accumulates empirical evidence for or against various hypotheses .
If we can show that psychic phenomena are incompatible with the laws of physics we currently understand , then our task is to balance the relative plausibility of “ some folks have fallen prey to sloppy research , unreliable testimony , confirmation bias , and wishful thinking ” against “ the laws of physics that have been tested by an enormous number of rigorous and high - precision experiments over the course of many years are plain wrong in some tangible macroscopic way , and nobody ever noticed . ”
The crucial concept here is that , in the modern framework of fundamental physics , not only do we know certain things , but we have a very precise understanding of the limits of our reliable knowledge .
We understand , in other words , that while surprises will undoubtedly arise ( as scientists , that ’s what we all hope for ) , there are certain classes of experiments that are guaranteed not to give exciting results — essentially because the same or equivalent experiments have already been performed .
A simple example is provided by Newton ’s law of gravity , the famous inverse - square law .
It ’s a pretty successful law of physics , good enough to get astronauts to the Moon and back .
But it ’s certainly not absolutely true ; in fact , we already know that it breaks down , due to corrections from general relativity .
Nevertheless , there is a regime in which Newtonian gravity is an effective approximation , good at least to a well - defined accuracy .
We can say with confidence that if you are interested in the force due to gravity between two objects separated by a certain distance , with certain masses , Newton ’s theory gives the right answer to a certain precision .
At large distances and high precisions , the domain of validity is formalized by the Parameterized Post - Newtonian formalism .
There is a denumerable set of ways in which the motion of test particles can deviate from Newtonian gravity ( as well as from general relativity ) , and we can tell you what the limits are on each of them .
At small distances , the inverse - square behavior of the gravitational force law can certainly break down ; but we can tell you exactly the scale above which it will not break down ( about a tenth of a millimeter ) .
We can also quantify how well this knowledge extends to different kinds of materials ; we know very well that Newton ’s law works for ordinary matter , but the precision for dark matter is understandably not nearly as good .
This knowledge has consequences .
If we discover a new asteroid headed toward Earth , we can reliably use Newtonian gravity to predict its future orbit .
From a rigorous point of view , someone could say “ But how do you know that Newtonian gravity works in this particular case ?
It has n’t been tested for that specific asteroid ! ”
And that is true , because science never proves anything .
But it ’s not worth worrying about , and anyone making that suggestion would not be taken seriously .
As with asteroids , so with human beings .
We are creatures of the universe , subject to the same laws of physics as everything else .
As everyone knows , there are many things we do n’t understand about biology and neuroscience , not to mention the ultimate laws of physics .
But there are many things that we do understand , and only the most basic features of quantum field theory suffice to definitively rule out the idea that we can influence objects from a distance through the workings of pure thought .
The simplest example is telekinesis , the ability to remotely move an object using only psychic powers .
For definitiveness , let ’s consider the power of spoon - bending , claimed not only by Uri Geller but by author and climate skeptic Michael Crichton .
What do the laws of physics have to say about spoon - bending ?
Below the fold , we go through the logic .
Spoons are made of ordinary matter .
This sounds uncontroversial , but is worth explaining .
Spoons are made of atoms , and we know what atoms are made of — electrons bound by photons to an atomic nucleus , which in turn consists of protons and neutrons , which in turn are made of quarks held together by gluons .
Five species of particles total : up and down quarks , gluons , photons , electrons .
That ’s it .
There is no room for extra kinds of mysterious particles clinging , aura - like , to the matter in a spoon .
That ’s because we know how particles behave .
If there were some other kind of particle in the spoon , it would have to interact with the ordinary matter we know is there — otherwise it would n’t stick , it would just zip right through , as neutrinos zip right through the Earth nearly undisturbed .
And if there were a kind of particle that interacted with the ordinary particles in the spoon strongly enough to stick to the spoon , we could easily make it in experiments .
The rules of quantum field theory directly relate the interaction rates of particles to the ease with which we can create them in the lab , given enough energy .
And we know exactly how much energy is available in a spoon ; we know the masses of the atoms , and the kinetic energy of thermal motions within the metal .
Taken together , we can say without any fear of making a mistake that any new particles that might exist within a spoon would have been detected in experiments long ago .
Again : imagine you have invented a new kind of particle relevant to the dynamics of spoons .
Tell me its mass , and its interactions with ordinary matter .
If it ’s too heavy or interacts too weakly , it ca n’t be created or captured .
If it is sufficiently light and strongly interacting , it will have been created and captured many times over in experiments we have already done .
There is no middle ground .
We completely understand the regime of spoons , notwithstanding what you heard in The Matrix .
Matter interacts through forces .
We ’ve known for a long time that the way to move matter is to exert a force on it — Newton ’s Law , F=ma , is at least the second most famous equation in physics .
In the context of quantum field theory , we know precisely how forces arise : through the exchange of quantum fields .
We know that only two kinds of fields exist : bosons and fermions .
We know that macroscopic forces only arise from the exchange of bosons , not of fermions ; the exclusion principle prohibits fermions from piling up in the same state to create a coherent long - range force field .
And , perhaps most importantly , we know what forces can couple to : the properties of the matter fields that constitute an object .
These properties include location , mass , spin , and various “ charges ” such as electric charge or baryon number .
This is where the previous point comes in .
Spoons are just a certain arrangement of five kinds of elementary particles — up and down quarks , gluons , electrons , and photons .
So if there is going to be a force that moves around a spoon , it ’s going to have to couple to those particles .
Once you tell me how many electrons etc .
there are in the spoon , and the arrangement of their positions and spins , we can say with confidence how any particular kind of force will influence the spoon ; no further information is required .
There are only two long - range forces strong enough to influence macroscopic objects — electromagnetism and gravity .
Of course , we have worked hard to discover different forces in nature , and so far we have identified four : gravitation , electromagnetism , and the strong and weak nuclear forces .
But the nuclear forces are very short - range , smaller than the diameter of an atom .
Gravitation and electromagnetism are the only detectable forces that propagate over longer distances .
Could either gravitation or electromagnetism be responsible for bending spoons ?
No .
In the case of electromagnetism , it would be laughably easy to detect the kind of fields necessary to exert enough force to influence a spoon .
Not to mention that the human brain is not constructed to generate or focus such fields .
But the real point is that , if it were electromagnetic fields doing the spoon - bending , it would be very very noticeable .
( And the focus would be on influencing magnets and circuits , not on bending spoons . )
In the case of gravitation , the fields are just too weak .
Gravity accumulates in proportion to the mass of the source , so the arrangement of particles inside your brain will have a much smaller gravitational effect than just the location of your head — and that ’s far too feeble to move spoons around .
A bowling ball would be more efficient , and most people would agree that moving a bowling ball past a spoon has a negligible effect .
Could there be a new force , as yet undetected by modern science ?
Of course !
I ’ve proposed them myself .
Physicists are by no means closed - minded about such possibilities ; they are very excited by them .
But they also take seriously the experimental limits .
And those limits show unambiguously that any such new force must either be very short - range ( less than a millimeter ) , or much weaker than gravity , which is an awfully weak force .
The point is that such forces are characterized by three things : their range , their strength , and their source ( what they couple to ) .
As discussed above , we know what the possible sources are that are relevant to spoons : quarks , gluons , photons , electrons .
So all we have to do is a set of experiments that look for forces between different combinations of those particles .
And these experiments have been done !
The answer is : any new forces that might be lurking out there are either ( far ) too short - range to effect everyday objects , or ( far ) too weak to have readily observable effects .
Here is a plot of the current limits on such forces , from the Eot - Wash group at Julianne ’s home institution .
This particular plot is for forces that couple to the total number of protons plus neutrons ; similar plots exist for other possible sources .
The horizontal axis is the range of the force ; it ranges from about a millimeter to ten billion kilometers .
The vertical axis is the strength of the force , and the region above the colored lines has been excluded by one or more experiments .
On meter - sized scales , relevant to bending a spoon with your mind , the strongest possible allowed new force would be about one billionth the strength of gravity .
And remember , gravity is far too weak to bend a spoon .
That ’s it .
We are done .
The deep lesson is that , although science does n’t know everything , it ’s not “ anything goes , ” either .
There are well - defined regimes of physical phenomena where we do know how things work , full stop .
The place to look for new and surprising phenomena is outside those regimes .
You do n’t need to set up elaborate double - blind protocols to pass judgment on the abilities of purported psychics .
Our knowledge of the laws of physics rules them out .
Speculations to the contrary are not the provenance of bold visionaries , they are the dreams of crackpots .
A similar line of reasoning would apply to telepathy or other parapsychological phenomena .
It ’s a little bit less cut and dried , because in the case of telepathy the influence is supposedly traveling between two human brains , rather than between a brain and a spoon .
The argument is exactly the same , but there are those who like to pretend that we do n’t understand how the laws of physics work inside a human brain .
It ’s certainly true that there is much we do n’t know about thought and consciousness and neuroscience , but the fact remains that we understand the laws of physics in the brain regime perfectly well .
To believe otherwise , you would have to imagine that individual electrons obey different laws of physics because they are located in a human brain , rather than in a block of granite .
But if you do n’t care about violating the laws of physics in regimes where they have been extensively tested , then anything does in fact go .
Some will argue that parapsychology can be just as legitimately “ scientific ” as paleontology or cosmology , so long as it follows the methodology of scientific inquiry .
But that ’s a slightly too know - nothing attitude to quite hold up .
If parapsychologists followed the methodology of scientific inquiry , they would look what we know about the laws of physics , realize that their purported subject of study had already been ruled out , and within thirty seconds would declare themselves finished .
Anything else is pseudoscience , just as surely as contemporary investigation into astrology , phrenology , or Ptolemaic cosmology .
Science is defined by its methods , but it also gets results ; and to ignore those results is to violate those methods .
Admittedly , however , it is true that anything is possible , since science never proves anything .
It ’s certainly possible that the next asteroid that comes along will obey an inverse - cube law of gravity rather than an inverse - square one ; we never know for sure , we can only speak in probabilities and likelihoods .
Given the above , I would put the probability that some sort of parapsychological phenomenon will turn out to be real at something ( substantially ) less than a billion to one .
We can compare this to the well - established success of particle physics and quantum field theory .
The total budget for high - energy physics worldwide is probably a few billion dollars per year .
So I would be very happy to support research into parapsychology at the level of a few dollars per year .
Heck , I ’d even be willing to go as high as twenty dollars per year , just to be safe .
Never let it be said that I am anything other than open - minded .

The booby - trapped sites have been removed from Google 's index
The booby - trapped websites came up in search results for search terms such as " Christmas gifts " and " hospice " .
Windows users falling for the trick risked having their machine hijacked and personal information plundered .
The criminals poisoned search results using thousands of domains set up to convince search index software they were serious sources of information .
Innocent victim
While computer security researchers have seen small - scale attempts to subvert search results before now , the sheer scale of this attack dwarfed all others .
" This was fairly epic , " said Alex Eckelberry , head of Sunbelt Software - one of the firms that uncovered the attack .
Mr Eckelberry said tens of thousands of domains were used in the vanguard of the attack .
Most domains were Chinese registered , hosted in the US and were only a couple of days old .
Websites loaded on these domains were booby - trapped with malicious software that looked for vulnerabilities in copies of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer used to browse them .
This is not going to go away
Alex Eckelberry
The criminals who bought the domains convinced the indexing software used by Google , MSN and Yahoo they were good and popular sources of information , said Mr Eckelberry .
Although the results were indexed by Yahoo and MSN the webpages were coded to only show up if someone used Google .
They accomplished this using comment spam on blogs to push the pages up the search index rankings .
Sunbelt had discovered malicious sites connected with search terms such as " hospice " , " cotton gin and its effect on slavery " , " infinity " and many more .
" You could be searching for really innocuous things and get nailed , " said Mr Eckelberry .
" There was really nasty stuff in there . "
" If there 's any message from this I can scream from the rooftops its make sure you patch your machine , " he said .
Security firm Trend Micro also discovered a series of booby - trapped sites aimed at Christmas gift shoppers and those looking for information about many other innocent subjects .
" Some of the top rated hits are leading to the malicious sites , " said Raimund Genes , chief technology officer at Trend Micro .
The criminals tried to catch out Windows users
He speculated that the campaign was being waged by the Russian Business Network - a hi-tech criminal gang known to favour web - based attacks .
The booby - trapped websites were thought to be in operation for about 24 hours before Google began stripping them out of its search index .
Some of the trapped websites are believed to be still turning up in searches carried out on Yahoo and MSN Live .
But , said Mr Eckelberry , this attack was likely to be a harbinger of many more .
" This is not going to go away , " he said .
Bush administration officially called liars over Iraq
January 23 , 2008
Two respected nonprofit journalism groups have released a study showing that President Bush and his top aides publicly , and intentionally , made 935 false statements about the security risk posed by Iraq in the two years following Sept. 11 , 2001 .
" In short , the Bush administration led the nation to war on the basis of erroneous information that it methodically propagated and that culminated in military action against Iraq on March 19 , 2003 , " reads an overview of the study , conducted by the Center for Public Integrity and the Fund for Independence in Journalism .
According to the study , Bush and seven top officials - including Vice President Dick Cheney , former Secretary of State Colin Powell and then - National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice - made 935 false statements about Iraq during those two years .
The study is based on a searchable database compiled of primary sources , like official government transcripts and speeches , and secondary sources mainly quotes from major media organizations .

The US government has announced plans to open more than 3 m acres ( about 5,000 square miles ) of Alaskan wilderness to logging , mining and road building , angering environmental campaigners who say it will devastate the region .
Supporters say the plan for the Tongass National Forest , a refuge for grizzly and black bears , wolves , eagles and wild salmon , will revive the state 's timber industry .
The Bush administration plan for the forest , the largest in the US at nearly 17 m acres , would open 3.4 m acres to logging , road building and other development , including about 2.4 m acres that are currently remote and without roads .
About 663,000 acres are in areas considered most valuable for timber production .
The move , the latest in a long - running saga over the Tongass forest , effectively reverses the " Roadless Rule " protection given to the area by President Clinton .
Denny Bschor , Alaska regional forester who approved the Tongass plan , said it would sustain the diversity and health of the forest , provide livelihoods and subsistence for Alaska residents and ensure a source of recreation and solitude for forest visitors .
" What is significant in the amended plan is our commitment to the state of Alaska to provide an economic timber sale programme which will allow the current industry to stabilise , and for an integrated timber industry to become established , " he said .
Environmentalists said the plan continues a Bush policy of catering to the timber industry .
Robert Vandermark , manager of the Pew environment group 's heritage forests campaign , said : " In its final months , the Bush administration is attempting to give logging and mining industries the keys to the Tongass National Forest , the world 's largest intact temperate rainforest .
Wild areas like the Tongass contain watersheds that provide clean drinking water , wildlife habitat and outstanding outdoor recreation opportunities that should be kept safe for generations to come . "
The Alaska Wilderness League said logging made up only 1 % of the region 's economy , much less than commercial fishing and tourism , which could be damaged by increased development .
But the Alaska Forest Association , an industry group , said the plan , which will not increase the timber take allowed from the forest , fell short of its needs .
Owen Graham , the group 's executive director , said : " It is critical that the final plan allows our industry to survive .
Survival means returning to a realistic timber supply level in south - east Alaska , not a continuation of the starvation level we have been struggling with for the last few years . "
Both sides could challenge the decision , announced last Friday , in court .
The new plan stems from lawsuits filed by environmental groups in 2003 that have since shifted the Forest Service 's timber sale programme away from roadless areas to land that can be reached by roads that meander for 3,700 miles through the forest .
The plan does offer some protection : it puts aside 90,000 acres of old - growth reserve as off - limits to the loggers , and protects 47,000 acres of vulnerable limestone formations called karst lands .
The Forest Service said it would consult with Indian tribes to protect and maintain sacred sites in the forest .
In fact , blogging has become common among former officials , especially reformist politicians who do not have a platform to express their ideas .

The first official who became a blogger was Mohammad Ali Abtahi , a vice president to former President Mohammad Khatami .
Mr. Abtahi has remained an active blogger , updating his Web site every day for the past four years .
“ I thought it was exciting when the president first launched his blog , ” Mr. Abtahi said .
“ But it looks like it is just a formality .
The computer is one of the many items on his desk which he does not use very often . ”
However , the president ’s Web log highlights the unusual techniques he uses , like the trucks that follow him on provincial trips for collecting people ’s letters to him appealing for help , to promote his populist agenda .
Mr. Ahmadinejad has tried to touch on most issues that concern him .
He has written about freedom in Iran , referring to the protest of students against him a year ago at Amir Kabir University in Tehran as an example of its existence in Iran .
“ It was a joyous feeling to see a small group insult the elected president of people fearlessly amid a majority , ” he wrote , without referring to the fate of the students , many of whom are in prison now .
In a letter to an American mother whose son was killed in Iraq , he calls the United States a “ warmonger ” but he says he respects all people of the world , including American people .
In another article , he condemns the fingerprinting of passengers , like Iranians , by American customs officials and says it has caused hatred toward the American government .

" Ah - hah ! " you say , " But what about the pain of rejection ? "
Pish - posh !
Rejection still costs you nothing .
A bruised ego , perhaps even some personal dignity , depending on your level of drunkenness .
Such wounds are slight and the concern of only lesser mortals .
You , my friends , are confident !
You are brave !
No fear !
You must simply unlearn that which plagued you in middle school .
While you were being acutely embarrassed on the playground for your awakening sexuality ( " Stop poking me with that stick in your pants ! " ) , we gay boys were simply relating to girls as equals -- sharing stories , plotting fan clubs , and making scrapbooks .
Our shame and embarrassment were relegated to the locker room before gym class , but that 's for another post .
The point is that your early relationships with girls rested on expectations that you had no right to form in the first place .
You expected girls to want you right off the bat , simply because you approached them .
And if they did n't want you immediately , you felt that you had lost something .
But in reality , you lost nothing .
In fact , the only time you do lose something is when you fail to pursue an opportunity that attracts you .
You expected the pretty girls to already have boyfriends .
However , keep in mind that -- unlike high school -- women in real life are not constantly surrounded by dozens , hundreds , or thousands of men constantly clamoring for attention .
In high school , all the pretty girls were taken because ... well , they had platoons of boys to choose from and could pick the pretty boys who were well - mannered .
My point is this -- fear breeds inhibition in relationships , even the simplest conversation among people meeting for the first time .
Overcome your fear and you will free your inhibitions .
You might try thinking like we do -- when we approach gorgeous women , we do n't expect sex , a kiss , or even conversation .
We simply see a vibrant person who might be fun to talk to .
Try anticipating nothing , expecting nothing , and then being surprised if something does happen .
Trust me -- it will work .
It 's worked for all of my straight friends so far , in fact .
So ... if this little diatribe helps you in any way , just thank a gay guy the next time you see one of us .
The game could inspire the next generation of Nasa employees
The virtual world would be aimed at students and would " simulate real Nasa engineering and science missions " .
The agency has published a " request for information " ( RFI ) from organisations interested in developing the platform .
Nasa believe the game would help find the next generation of scientists and engineers needed to fulfil its " vision for space exploration " .
" A high quality synthetic gaming environment is a vital element of Nasa 's educational cyberstructure , " the RFI reads .
" The MMO will foster career exploration opportunities in a much deeper way than reading alone would permit and at a fraction of the time and cost of an internship program . "
Space mission
Nasa already has a presence in the 3D virtual universe .
The agency owns an island in Second Life where individuals and groups with an interest in the space programme can meet , share ideas and conduct experiments .
Nasa would like to build a realistic training environment
CoLab , as it is called , is the brainchild of scientists at the Nasa Ames Research Center in San Francisco .
The agency hopes that the environment could one day be used to allow the public to take part in virtual missions .
" We at Nasa are working hard to create opportunities for what I might call participatory exploration , " the director of the project , Simon Worden , has said .
" We are looking at how this island can be a portal for all to fly along on space missions , " he told delegates at the National Space Society 's ( NSS ) conference last year .
" When the next people step onto the surface of the Moon in a little over a decade , your avatar could be with them , " he said .
The latest proposal was published by Nasa 's Learning Technologies Project Office which supports and develops education projects to promote science and technology .
Job seeker
The document says that games are becoming increasingly important in education and could be useful for teaching a range of skills .
" Virtual worlds with scientifically accurate simulations could permit learners to tinker with chemical reactions in living cells , practice operating and repairing expensive equipment , and experience microgravity , " it says .
The document calls for a game engine that includes " powerful physics capabilities " that can " support accurate in - game experimentation and research " .
" A Nasa - based MMO could provide opportunities for students to investigate science , technology , engineering , and mathematics career paths while participating in engaging game - play . "
Other organisations such as the US armed forces already use online gaming as a recruitment tool .
America 's Army for example introduces players to the " seven Army Core Values " and now claims to be one of " the most popular computer games in the world " .
Nasa has asked for interested organisations to respond to the request by the 15 February .
( CNN ) -- Newspapers across Europe Wednesday reprinted the controversial cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed that sparked worldwide protests two years ago .
The move came one day after Danish authorities arrested three people allegedly plotting a " terror - related assassination " of Kurt Westergaard , the cartoonist behind the drawing .
Berlingske Tidende , was one of the newspapers involved in the republication by newspapers in Denmark .
It said : " We are doing this to document what is at stake in this case , and to unambiguously back and support the freedom of speech that we as a newspaper always will defend , " in comments reported by The Associated Press .
Newspapers in Spain , Sweden and the Netherlands also republished the drawing Wednesday as part of their coverage of Tuesday 's arrests .
The image , by Morgenavisen Jullands - Posten cartoonist Westergaard , was one of 12 cartoons about the Prophet Mohammed originally published in September 2005 .
Westergaard 's cartoon depicted the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse .
Violent demonstrations erupted across the world in early 2006 after other newspapers reprinted the images as a matter of free speech .
The uproar came as some Muslims believe it is forbidden by the Quran to show an image of the prophet .
Many protesters directed their ire at Denmark , prompting the closure of several Danish embassies in predominantly Muslim countries , including Indonesia and Pakistan .
There were also attacks on other diplomatic missions in Iran and Syria among others .
The Danish Foreign Ministry has said it is keeping a watch on the situation at its embassies and has yet to report any incidents .

Appeals for calm over cartoon row Gallery : Muslim protests
Muslim leaders in Denmark Wednesday attacked the republication of the cartoon , as well as the alleged murder plot , while calling for calm .
Imam Mostafa Chendid , chief of the Islamic Faith Community , told AP his group was discussing whether to hold a demonstration before parliament , adding : " We are so unhappy about the cartoon being reprinted . "
" No blood was ever shed in Denmark because of this , and no blood will be shed .
We are trying to calm down people , but let 's see what happens .
Let 's open a dialogue . "
The Danish Security and Intelligence Service Tuesday said police arrested a 40 - year - old Dane of Moroccan origin and two Tunisians in the Aarhus area of western Denmark following lengthy surveillance .
The Danish citizen is charged with a terrorism offense , the intelligence service said , and the Tunisians will be deported .
Police have not yet released the names of the three .
The target of the plot , the intelligence service said , was the cartoonist for the Danish newspaper Morgenavisen Jullands - Posten , which first published the controversial drawings in September 2005 .
The paper identified the cartoonist as Kurt Westergaard .
Watch how threats have targeted cartoonists »
" Not wanting to take any undue risks [ the intelligence service ] has decided to intervene at a very early stage in order to interrupt the planning and the actual assassination , " the statement by Jakob Scharf , the agency 's director general , said .
" Thus , this morning 's operation must first and foremost be seen as a preventive measure where the aim has been to stop a crime from being committed . "
Westergaard has previously said that he wanted his cartoon to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terror .
However , many in the Muslim world interpreted the drawing as depicting their prophet as a terrorist .
" Of course I fear for my life after the Danish Security and Intelligence Service informed me of the concrete plans of certain people to kill me , " Westergaard said in a statement posted on the newspaper 's Web site .
" However , I have turned fear into anger and indignation .
It has made me angry that a perfectly normal everyday activity which I used to do by the thousand was abused to set off such madness . "
CNN 's Paula Newton said the arrests reinforced growing fears in Europe that radical Islam was trying to suppress free speech .
" More and more Europeans feel that Islam is a threat to their way of life , " Newton said .
A recent Gallup poll for the World Economic Forum showed a majority of Europeans believed relations between the West and the Muslim world were worsening .
According to the poll this sentiment was strongest held among Danish .
Westergaard remains under police protection and does not know whether it will continue .
" I could not possibly know for how long I have to live under police protection ; I think , however , that the impact of the insane response to my cartoon will last for the rest of my life , " he said .
" It is sad indeed , but it has become a fact of my life . "
Carsten Juste , the paper 's editor - in - chief , said staffers have been " deeply worried " for several months .
" The arrests have hopefully thwarted the murder plans , " he said on the newspaper 's Web site .

Yep , there are more than enough ignorant ( that is , not well educated and informed about the spectrum and expanding continuum of the known Universe - although a few of those are well meaning and intentioned ) to those who are downright knowingly and intentionally lying as they 're sweating , spitting and slobbering , whooping and hollering and flaying about thumping on " The Bible " and podiums , or gently turning the pages and waving " The Bible " - using the calm somber façade of righteous piousness , dressing up in Western world suits and neck ties , or simple plain robes , and on to those in varieties of elaborate fancy ceremonial garb , ' carrying - on ' with mesmerizing Rituals and Services , aided by beautiful and emotionally calming , or shouting high energy music performed by their bands and / or choirs ( like in the " Blues Brothers " Hollywood in yo ' face movie , and many others ) .
Most are primarily emphasizing , in one way or another , putting " The FEAR of God " ( What about LOVE , COMPASSION , UNDERSTANDING ...? ) in their spiritually needy , vulnerable and susceptible " followers " – " sheep " – " congregations " or whatever term they use to refer to those they are " leading " to do what they tell them is required to get into Heaven , which , as " Born hopeless sinners , " means that they , as " followers " – " sheep " – " congregations " or whatever term , have no other alternative than to regularly and continuously ' tithe ' / give the ' leaders ' a fixed percentage of whatever money they have NOW and will EVER have for as long as they live – and bequest , or leave what 's left in the Legal Will .
No , they are not just asking YOU for a voluntary donation , they are demanding that YOU give it up to them , or get put out / lose your membership in their church / religious organization , and " Go to Hell . "
And now , besides the Pope with the State of the Vatican City , we got the maximum high - tech media savvy , extremely BIG money Megachurches , globally , at the top of the heap of the Televangelist with the best of everything that money can buy , inclusive of televisions channels and networks , everything available on the World Wide Web Internet , private corporate luxury air planes , high quality production studios for movies , book publishing , hugh estate living , real estate investments , universities , and on and on – YOU name it , they got it .
Far too many to list , but check out Benny Hinn - Crystal Cathedral - Pat Robertson – and then make sense out of - with all of their mega billions of dollars , years of their world - wide ministries , " saving " people , ( healing people through their TVs , and all of the rest that they claim to be doing ) , White House access and influence , and so on ( tracable to nearly 2000 years ) - why is it that the human species and desirable life habitation on this planet is on the brink of extinction , huh ?

Spookily enough , I think and imagine that ifin ' I ( that is my Soul , Spirit and Consciousness , in only my etheric body shroud , after I leave my humans remains , along with the rest of the material stuff I have here on Earth ) were to get to " The Pearly Gate " for entrance to " Heaven " - and " Saint Peter " asked me why He should open ' The Gate ' and let me in , and I responded with - Well , uhm , I was a true Believer that Jesus , The Christ died for my sins , as the hopeless sinner that I was told that I was by my particular Religious Leader , which included regularly confessing my on - going sins , and to whose church organization I tithed to / gave money to , went regularly to Services at the church building , prayed the way I was told I was supposed to , and tried to do everything I was told that I needed to do to get in to Heaven .
For some reasons , I can't help but THINK , and imagine , that " Saint Peter " would stand there silently , with " The Gate " remaining locked .
Or , maybe say something like ; Your ' Religious Leader ' is not here now to open ' The Gate ' for YOU .
[ Having to do with this : Concerning the New Covenant mediated by Jesus Christ , God promised , " This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , says the LORD : I will put My laws into their hearts , and in their minds I will write them . "
( Hebrews 10:16 ; quoting from Jeremiah 31:33 ) .
The ultimate intent of God 's master plan is to change the hearts of all peoples so He can give them His gift of eternal life . ]
How would the law of God be written in the hearts and minds of mankind ?
It certainly would not be by man 's penmanship , or from the mouth of another human .
To which my understanding is that I , as an Individual Soul , temporarily incarnated in human form , who was granted the innate and inherent FREE WILL - to Think , ask questions , seek and find answers , change my thinking and behavior - from The Creator and Source of EVERYTHING in existence , AM ultimately fully responsible .
With my fundamentally essential FAITH being in that which is most clear to me from the INNER silence of my heart and mind .
My reasons are many , and I have written and published a 325 pages book COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS : Do - It - Yourself Manual , and a CD LET'S HEAL IT of lyrics with music addressing , in depth , these matters , and more .
" Scandalous acts of random ignorance . "

" Lies will die , and TRUTH will rise to the surface . "
As Dinah Shore said to Burt Reynolds
It is clear to all coherently clear thinking individuals that the truth , about whatever , can no longer be hidden , repressed or suppressed .
The fact of the matter is that the old paradigm is dead .
It 's just that it always takes the " Leaders " and the mainstream elite ( Who are really the ' followers ' ) a certain amount of time to accept and acclimate to the changes that the ' grassroots ' and ' underground ' are , and have been for some time , already actively about in our ' real - I- zations ' , thinking , living activities and behavior , which has the most powerful influence on the general population .
Of course , once the " Leaders " and the mainstream elite are convinced that the changes are ' real ' and irreversible , ' they ' will claim to have produced , discovered , or invented , and be ' leading ' the way – after having done everything ' they ' possibly could ( inclusive of the most blatantly abominable actions that produce destruction , deprivation , torture , murder / assassinations and genocidal crimes against humanity and all of plants , animals and essential elements of our environment - with ' their ' serious looks , or just smiling and smirking at us , with the silent question : " How stupid and weak - willed are YOU people ? " ) to maintain the status quo of everything staying as it was , simply to protect ' their ' undeserved elite positions and obscene material wealth – if the majority of our population allows this pathetic idiocy to continue to the absolute ' bitter end ' for all of us .
Oops and ouch !!!
We have been warned , and all of the excuses are used up .

All of this is , and has been , well known and predictable by the genuine Seekers , prophets , shamans , heroes , heroines and Wise Ones - throughout the history of humankind .

'' There is a river flowing now very fast .
It is so great and swift , that there are those who will be afraid .
They will try to hold on to the shore .
They will feel they are being torn apart and will suffer greatly .
Know the river has its destination .
The elders say we must let go of the shore , push off into the middle of the river , keep our eyes open , and our heads above the water .
And I say , see who is in there with you and celebrate .
At this time in history , we are to take nothing personally , least of all , ourselves .
For the moment that we do , our spiritual growth and journey comes to a halt .
The time of the lone wolf is over .
Gather yourselves !
Banish the word struggle from your attitude and your vocabulary .
All that we do now must be done in a sacred manner and in celebration .

The ( lost , but found ) Gospel of Judas gives a different view of the relationship between Jesus and Judas , offering new insights into the disciple who betrayed Jesus .

This is a list of artists who have influenced fellow artists profoundly in one shape or form and who have pioneered in their own way a part of music .
Think of them as musician ’s musicians .
So , here are the top 10 :
10 . Richie Havens Jan 1941
Havens is a folk singer / guitartist best known for his performance at the original Woodstock .
He is also known for his unusual method of using open D tuning and fretting all strings which creates an intense rhythmic style .
Also heard on some song recordings is a unique drumming sound which is actually his foot tapping .
He had moderate fame when he reached the Billboard charts in the 70’s but until then had maintained a fairly local success within his Greenwich Village scene .
He rarely wrote his own songs , but is known for the distinctive interpretations of songs that is uniquely his .
9. Ian Curtis July 1956 May 1980
Vocalist and genius lyricist of Joy Division , Curtis committed suicide in 1980 .
The suicide was thought to be related to combination of anxiety over an upcoming North American tour the band was embarking on as well as his severe epilepsy .
His on stage seizures were often mistaken for an erratic style of dance which resulted in Curtis having to be carried off stage at some performances .
His legacy has grown and continues to grow World wide since his death .
8. Vini Reilly
( Gerard Vincent Reilly ) Aug 1953
Reilly was a guitarist , singer and “ Durutti Column ” post - punk pioneer .
He worked with Morrissey on his groundbreaking first album “ Viva Hate ” ( 1988 ) .
He also worked with John Cooper Clarke , Pauline Murray , Anne Clark , The Wake , Richard Jobson , Quando Quango , and more .
He has been very influential in the musical movement now known as “ chill - out electronica ” .

Jan. 30 , 1933 The Story behind Hitler 's Rise to Power
Wednesday marks the 75th anniversary of Adolf Hitler 's attainment of power .
It took the Führer just 12 years to plunge Europe into the darkest chapter of its history and unleash the Holocaust .
But how did a failed painter manage to bring all of Germany under his dictatorial thumb ?
Many farmers have stopped growing traditional crops , such as millet
Over the last century about 75 % of the world 's crop varieties have been lost , data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) suggests .
UN researchers say that we now rely on just three crops : wheat , rice and maize .
The fact that poorer nations are almost twice as dependent on these cereals as richer nations has led to the question : are we now too reliant on too few crops ?
The Kolli Hills in Tamil Nadu , southern India , is home to about 40,000 people .
Scientists have visited the area to see if ancient traditions offer any clues to finding a way out of a future global food crisis .
Changing landscape
" First of all , I think the environment is going to be more unpredictable , " Sayed Azam - Ali , professor of tropical agronomy at the University of Nottingham , UK , tells the Television Trust for the Environment 's Earth Report programme .
" So we need crops that are going to be safe , " he said .
For centuries , farmers of the Kolli Hills harvested millet
" We can't rely on importing and moving crops around the world indefinitely .
" I think we have to be more reliant on locally sourced food . "
Until the first road was built in the 1960s , the Kolli Hills were cut off from the outside world .
Farming families had been harvesting millet for centuries , and it was their main source of nutrition .
" This was the only food crop they could depend on , " explained Dr S Bala Ravi , a researcher from the Swaminathan Research Foundation .
" There was no communication system ; there was no public distribution system , so this was the only dependable crop for them which could be grown in the hills . "
However , the construction of the road presented an opportunity for some farmers to switch to more profitable crops .
One such crop is cassava , also known as tapioca .
One farmer explained that until 20 years ago he used to grow millet , but tapioca offered a better return and a better standard of living .
Growing demand
The demand for relatively few crops has left experts worried that traditional knowledge of how to harvest millet will die out ; something they have called " cultural erosion " .
A project to reintroduce the crop has begun to have some success .
Researchers believe the high nutritional value and its resilience means millet offers a more secure future for farmers , rather than growing cash crops and buying cheap rice to eat .
Thirty - two of the 250 villages in the hills are growing millet again , but Professor Bala Ravi knows more is needed ; farmers need to be able to sell it for cash too .
The farmers ' millet products are finding their way into more stores
" We want the farmers , instead of selling the raw harvest at a low rate , to enhance its value by various processing methods .
" We are supplying the various machineries and increasing the capacity for processing , " he added .
" We have created a market line so that they can bring out their own entrepreneurship and enhance it . "
Kolli Hills millet products are now on sale in 34 stores in the region , and sales have increased by 300 % over the past year .
Mixing minor crops , such as millet , into the major farming system could be the future for food , locally and globally .
But researchers warn that the success of this type of venture still hangs in the balance .
The Television Trust for the Environment 's ( TVE ) Earth Report - Forgotten Fruit - will be broadcast on BBC World on 15 - 20 February 2008 .

Operatives had only a 10 - second window to hit the satellite
Robert Gates said the operation " speaks for itself " , adding the US was prepared to share some information with China .
The comments came after China said the missile strike could harm security in outer space .
US officials are confident that the satellite 's potentially toxic fuel tank was destroyed by the missile .
Marine Gen James Cartwright said there was a 80 - 90 % chance the tank had been hit .
A fire ball , vapour cloud and spectral analysis indicating the presence of hydrazine all indicated this , he told reporters .
It would take 24 - 48 hours for officials to confirm whether the operations had been completely successful , he said .
' Complete transparency '
The satellite , USA 193 , was struck 153 nautical miles ( 283 km ) above earth by an SM - 3 missile fired from a warship in waters west of Hawaii .
BROKEN SATELLITE
Owner : National Reconnaissance Office Mission : Classified Launched : 14 Dec 2006 Weight : 2,300 kg ( 5,000lbs ) 1,134kg ( 2,500lbs ) could survive re-entry Carrying hydrazine thruster fuel
New space race fears
Send us your comments
Mr Gates said the issue of whether the technology would work was already decided .
" I think the question over whether this capability works has been settled , " he said , quoted by AFP news agency .
" The question is what kind of threat , how large a threat , how sophisticated a threat [ the US faces ] . "
The US approach was one of " complete transparency " , he said .
" We provided a lot of information ... before it took place , " he said , adding : " We are prepared to share whatever appropriately we can . "
China called on the US on Thursday to provide more information about the mission .
Russia suspects the operation was a cover to test anti-satellite technology under the US missile defence programme .
Frozen solid
Operatives had only a 10 - second window to hit the satellite , which went out of control shortly after it was launched in December 2006 .
The missile needed to pierce the bus-sized satellite 's fuel tank , containing more than 450kg ( 1,000lbs ) of toxic hydrazine , which was otherwise expected to survive re-entry .
The US denies the operation was a response to an anti-satellite test carried out by China last year , which prompted fears of a space arms race .
US officials had said that without an attempt to destroy the fuel tank , and with the satellite 's thermal control system gone , the fuel would have been frozen solid , allowing the tank to resist the heat of re-entry .
If the tank were to have landed intact , it could have leaked toxic gas over a wide area - harming or killing humans if inhaled , officials had warned .
The US has denied that it shot down the satellite to prevent parts of it from falling into the hands of foreign powers .
Gen Cartwright said most of the satellite 's intelligence value was likely to have been destroyed .

606 : DEBATE
2200 : " One word : delirium .
I have now lost the ability to hear .
Complete and utter chaos .
People are hugging , dancing and singing . "
BBC Sport 's Mark Orlovac in Paris
2156 : " Talk about ' The Great Escape ' .
New Zealand were cruising and felt that they could score enough points at will .
Instead of killing France dead in the first half they let them back in .
" Amazing .
One of my French colleagues has already e-mailed me .
Methinks that we will all watch the game at his house next week .
" Who would have bet on England and France knocking out Australia and New Zealand given the way that the teams started the tournament ? "
CS on 606
2153 : " Anyone know the odds on an England - France semi- final at the start of the day ?
Would 've been worth a few quid ! "

DM on 606
80 mins : New Zealand lose the ball and little scrum - half Jean - Baptiste Elissalde joyously runs backwards and sideways towards the French fans and kicks the ball into touch to bring a sensational match to a close .
Simply amazing , what can you say ?
New Zealand have failed to win the tournament they were red - hot favourites to win once again .

Luke McAlister has a go at a drop - goal from halfway but it is well wide of the target .
78 mins : Amazing stuff again as France somehow get their hands on the ball again .
This time Jean - Baptiste Elissalde takes the responsibility and belts the ball into he stands .
New Zealand have a line - out about 35 m out from the try - line .
77 mins : France somehow turn the ball over but Frederic Michalak fires a shocking kick to the longer touchline which fails to find touch .
What was he thinking of ?
Chris Jack does n't take it cleanly , but he can launch another All Blacks attack .
74 mins : New Zealand are going through phase after phase .
They are desperate for the score , but France 's defence is rock solid so far .
The All Blacks are within 6 m of the France try - line and the tension is unbearable .
70 mins : Everything is going France 's way at the moment .
Winger Vincent Clerc looks to be going nowhere and takes an almighty swing at the ball .
It sails 60 m , over Sitiveni Sivivatu 's head and bounces into touch .
Incredible scenes in Cardiff .
68 mins : TRY & CONVERSION New Zealand 18 - 20 France
Goodness gracious me , an absolutely breathtaking try from France has put them into a sensational lead .
Damien Traille takes the ball into contact at speed on halfway and passes out of contact to Frederic Michalak .
The pass looks forward but goes unnoticed by the officials .
Michalak sprints 25 m and shows great awareness to pirouette as the tacklers close in and give the ball to the supporting Yannick Jauzion to score and send the Millennium Stadium into raptures .
And scrum - half Jean - Baptiste Elissalde kicks the conversion to put France ahead .
67 mins : A final gamble from France coach Bernard Laporte as he brings Frederic Michalak on for Lionel Beauxis .
66 mins : A sharp break from Nick Evans opens France right up , but Jean - Baptiste Elissalde just keeps hold of his shorts to bring him down .
Evans passes as he falls to Mils Muliaina and the ball is too low for the centre to collect .
A lucky break for France .
64 mins : A horrible flashback to the opening night for France winger Cedric Heymans as he fumbles a Nick Evans up - and - under to give possession back to New Zealand .
62 mins : TRY New Zealand 18 - 13 France
Sitiveni Sivivatu makes a powerful dart of the wing with a couple of French defenders hanging onto his shirt , and New Zealand seize the initiative with their forwards embarking on a series of drives towards the France try - line .
Replacement hooker Andrew Hore goes to within 2 m , and number eight Rodney So'oialo gives a textbook example of keeping your body low as he drives over the line to put the All Blacks back in front .
But Luke McAlister 's conversion attempt is wide .
60 mins : France win a penalty at the scrum on their own 10 m line as new Zealand are pinged for not binding correctly .
They are back to their full complement of players now , with Luke McAlister back on the field .
57 mins : Dan Carter limps off , seemingly with the calf injury which had affected his preparations for the match .
Now we 're going to find out what New Zealand are made of .
53 mins : TRY & CONVERSION New Zealand 13 - 13 France
This match is right back on as France score an excellent try through open - side flanker Thierry Dusatoir after a prolonged attack .
France work an overlap on the right but Imanol Harionordoquy seems strangely reluctant to commit to his one - on - one chance .
France recycle the ball and fling it to the left before coming back the other way .
This time , Vincent Clerc commits his man and sends Dusatoir in for a brilliant score which Lionel Beauxis coverts - off the post .
Things are going France 's way at the moment as they level the scores .
51 mins :
The noise in the stands reaches a new high as Sebastien Chabal , who has come to symbolise France 's efforts in this tournament , bounds onto the field in place of Fabien Pelous .
The departing lock implores the crowd to get even more vocal in their support , and they respond .
Dan Carter misses with a drop - goal attempt , and is clearly disappointed with himself .
49 mins : Very intelligent play from New Zealand as they start to keep the ball in the forwards and just go through the phases , frustrating France 's efforts to attack with their one - man advantage .

The referee decides to hand McAlister a yellow card , and Beauxis kicks the resulting penalty to cut the gap and give France real hope .
42 mins : France have started the second half with a bang , with some full - blooded attacks down both flanks .
The players seem to have been given permission to run with the ball rather than try to kick the leather off it at every opportunity .
2105 : Massive apologies everyone for the delay .
It was all down to a total failure of our computer systems here at the BBC - I 've run up to another office in a different part of the building which is , so far , unaffected .
We 'll do our best to catch up and keep you right up - to - date with the rest of the match .
40 mins : PEN New Zealand 13 - 3 France
Lionel Beauxis lands a penalty with the final kick of the half to give France some hope going into the half - time break .
38 mins : All Blacks prop Tony Woodcock muscles his way straight through to turn the ball over as France try to attack in the 22 .
35 mins : France win a penalty as New Zealand creep offside in midfield , and the kicking duties are handed over to scrum - half Jean - Baptiste Elissalde .
But Elissalde , under the watchful gaze of French president Nicolas Sarkozy in the crowd , has no more luck and pushes a fairly straightforward kick wide of the posts .
32 mins : Damien Traille persists with the policy of kicking long and pays the price as the ball rolls over the deadball line , giving New Zealand a scrum 5 m inside the French half .
30 mins : PEN New Zealand 13- 0 France
Dan Carter kicks a long - range penalty after France are pinged for an offence at the breakdown .
This is not going to plan for Les Bleus so far .
Surely they will have to start trusting their instincts and keep the ball in hand ?
26 mins : A lovely box - kick from Byron Kelleher gives Sitiveni Sivivatu the chance to absolutely cut Vincent Clerc in half , but France do recycle the ball .
As they have done on every occasion so far , they ignore the possibility of an attack from deep and instead decide to kick long for territory .
22 mins : France win another contested penalty decision after a New Zealand player gets on the wrong side of the ruck .
The All Blacks are falling foul of the referee 's interpretation at the moment .
But the kick at goal , from a fairly tight angle , by Lionel Beauxis fades right of the post .
Apologies but our updates have been delayed by technical problems .
We have been continuing our live coverage and the details will be here in the next couple of minutes - thanks for your patience .
20 mins : " The All Blacks just so confident , that chip ahead in their own 22 , they have so much trust in each other .
This could get very one - sided . "
Hawick on 606
18 mins : TRY & CONVERSION New Zealand 10 - 0 France
It was only a temporary let - off for France as New Zealand score a fine opening try through centre Luke McAlister .
McAlister cuts a sweet line off Dan Carter and scythes through the French midfield .
He checks his stride , stands up the full - back and passes to the supporting Jerry Collins who takes the ball to within 2 m of the line before passing back to McAlister who scores .
Carter kicks the conversion for a handsome early lead .
16 mins : Hats off to the diminutive France winger Vincent Clerc as he comes in with a last - ditch tackle on the massive frame of Ali Williams , knocking him into touch by the corner flag as the lock tried to score .
A brilliant break up the middle from Luke McAlister makes the initial line bust , and France are holding on a little at the moment .
14 mins : A horrible slice off the side of Dan Carter 's boot gifts France possession deep in the All Blacks ' half .

12 mins : PEN New Zealand 3 - 0 France
New Zealand open the scoring through Dan Carter 's penalty after France are penalised for an infringement at the breakdown in front of their posts .

8 mins : Referee Wayne Barnes penalises New Zealand for the second time at the breakdown , with skipper Richie McCaw pinged for going off his feet .
Could this be a potential Achilles heel for New Zealand ?
6 mins : Great driving play from the French pack off a Julien Bonnaire line - out take .
They make 15 m before the ball comes out to the backs on the All Blacks 22 .
Yannick Jauzion cuts inside and recycles the ball which is fed back to Damien Traille .
Unfortunately for France , his drop - goal is wide of the mark .
5 mins : Serge Betsen is in serious trouble on the floor .
The veteran France flanker seems to have been knocked absolutely cold and there are several medical staff on the pitch attending to him after he tackled Joe Rokocoko on the charge .
The damage seems to have been done though by a stray knee to his head as he tried to regain his feet .
Mercifully , he regains consciousness and is helped off the pitch , not entirely sure of his surroundings .
Imanol Harinordoquy , sporting the French - est moustache I have ever seen , is the replacement .
A real shame for Betsen , who has been an absolute warrior for France over the years .
4 mins :
The first decent All Blacks attack of the match sees the ball worked out wide through the hands to Dan Carter .
He is tackled and France manage to turn the ball over - very encouraging start at the breakdown for Les Bleus .
2 mins : Leon MacDonald puts up a massive up - and - under which Lionel Beauxis cannot quite take cleanly .
The two sides are just feeling each other out at the moment .
1 min : France fly - half Lionel Beauxis gets the match under way with a kick that must have almost touched the stadium 's roof .
After the ball goes loose , New Zealand eventually claim it and Dan Carter finds a good touch inside the French half .
1959 : Talk about confrontation .
France , arm in arm , line up on the halfway line and are literally inches away from New Zealand 's haka .
There is a fair bit of eyeball - to - eyeball contact there .
We 've got a match on our hands here .
1954 : The two teams come out of the tunnel to a massive reception from the crowd .
" God defend New Zealand " is the first anthem to be sung , with some gusto , and " La Marseillaise " is also given a fair old rendition .
You all know what 's next .
1950 : " The noise as the Kiwis greet each player 's name read out over the PA is ear - splitting .
I take back what I said earlier about the roof , although none of us will be able to hear for a week . "
BBC Sport 's Rob Hodgetts at the Millennium Stadium
1949 : A very specific prediction here from fleprechaun on 606 .
" Damien Traille and Lionel Beauxis to kick and kick and kick again , pinning the All Greys in their own 22 and winning 16 - 15 . "
That 's a good point actually .
New Zealand are going to be playing in their change strip which they wore in their lacklustre 40 - 0 win over Scotland .
Will that have any bearing or are we clutching at the thinnest of straws ?
1944 : With reference to my 1920 chat on whether New Zealand are , perhaps , " undercooked " for this match .
" Mr. Harlow , you may be right .
It could well have been the undoing of Australia in the first quarter - final .
But New Zealand 's average score in the first round was a little matter of 78 - 9 .
" Weak sides were dispatched with brutality .
It does n't make you think that New Zealand are taking things easy . "
CS on 606 .
I can't remember the last time I was referred to as Mr. Harlow , thanks for that Mr. CS .
1940 : " Come on the All Blacks , it 's now or never .
From the All Blacks ' number one fan .
Being born in England , I fell in love with the black shirt as an eight - year - old some 29 years ago .
" I have been waiting in anticipation for the last four years .
What a game !
God defend New Zealand ! "

Andrew
Hore comes onto the New Zealand bench in place of Keven Mealamu who has failed to shake off a hamstring injury .
The teams in full then are :

1934 : " I 'd love to see France win because an England v France semi would be a real classic .
However , I just can't see it .
" France need to play out of their skins and New Zealand to have an off day . "
CS on 606
1927 : My esteemed colleague Mark Orlovac is really slogging his guts out for us all in Paris .
With barely a thought for his own welfare , ' Orlo ' has moved from The Frog & Rosbif pub , where he watched the England - Australia game , to the Eiffel Tower to take in the atmosphere in the French capital .
" I'm in a giant marquee in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower and it is absolutely rammed , " he says .
" The big screens are showing endless replays of the 1999 World Cup semi-final ( where France launched arguably the most astonishing comeback in rugby union history to beat the All Blacks ) .
" Every time France score , the place goes potty .
Heaven knows what it will be like when the game actually starts . "
Bless him .
1920 : What about some of the other big talking points coming into this match ?
Are New Zealand undercooked after cruising through their group games with one hand behind their back ?
After thrashing Portugal , Romania , Italy and Scotland B , the All Blacks may well be a little steak tartare , but can France take advantage ?
1915 : " The turnstiles have been open for an hour and there 's probably a couple of thousand in the ground so far .
It sounds like the horn sellers have done a roaring trade today although I reckon some might wear out before the game starts ( horns , that is , not the sellers ) .
" The roof is closed but I have to say I prefer it open .
For one , rugby is an outdoor sport , and two , it makes it all seem ever so slightly artificial .
I 'm sure I wo n't notice once the game starts .
" Earlier today I went for a little stroll pitchside .
There 's no doubt it 's an awe - inspiring venue .
But for the purposes of this match , it 's just in the wrong country .
" Up close , the pitch looks so small and the stands loom so close and large above it , it 's a wonder the players do n't lose their marbles - and the waste products from their pre-match meal - under the pressure .
I suppose that 's why they 're pro sportsmen and the rest of us are n't . "
BBC Sport 's Rob Hodgetts at the Millennium Stadium
1910 : Shall we get the " why on earth is it being played in Cardiff ? " chat out the way , then we can hopefully all settle down for a top - draw match and ignore the rugby politics .
My opinion , for what it 's worth , is not vastly different from the general consensus which is that France have got no - one to blame but themselves .
If you trade votes for matches like they did to guarantee the support of the Celtic nations , you have to take the rough with the smooth .
Even so , you 'd have thought that somebody somewhere among the organisers did not think it might be a good idea to make sure that whoever finished second in France 's " group of death " pool would also play their quarter - final in the host country .
Obviously not .
1900 : " The Rolling Stones might as well have written ' Paint it Black ' for Cardiff today , there are that many Kiwis tumbling out of the woodwork .
" I saw my first New Zealand fan at eight in the morning at Clapham Junction and it's been a black haze ever since , like an army of orcs multiplying by the minute .
" Eight hours before the game and Cardiff already resembled a multi-national rugby shirt - wearing jamboree .
" Dotted among the Kiwis were pockets of Frenchmen , isolated and outnumbered , bands of Irishmen , who came anyway despite their side not being here as planned , plenty of English and kilted Scots , some Australians , South Africans , Italians ... but funnily enough , hardly any Welsh shirts .
" England 's victory over Australia , fuelled by drinking that began well before lunch , has certainly ratcheted up the excitement levels .
" The Kiwis are crowing that they are already in the final ( the winners of tonight 's match meet England next ) and the French , more visible now , have seen the ' impossible ' happen and are starting to dream .
" Around every corner there are sporadic bursts of the Marseillaise , watched with affection and respect by the Kiwis and answered now and again by guttural roars that resemble the start of a Haka .
No -one seems to want to be the first to let rip properly , though .
" The streets around the Millennium Stadium are buzzing and rammed with people and there 's plenty that wo n't remember the game .
If it 's anything like the one this afternoon , they 'll have missed a cracker . "
BBC Sport 's Rob Hodgetts at the Millennium Stadium
1850 : Evening all , I hope we 've all had a nice cup of tea and maybe even a couple of custard creams to calm down after the England - Australia game earlier this afternoon .
Not a bad day though , if you 're a rugby union fan , as we are just over an hour away from another potentially classic encounter as tournament favourites New Zealand take on hosts France in Cardiff .
Cardiff is n't technically in France , but that 's what you get when you muck about with fixtures in exchange for votes .
AMSTERDAM 
Some of the most visited brothels in Amsterdam ’s red - light district have gained unexpected new neighbors .
For years , the brothels ’ large street - side windows have showcased women of all races , wearing minute bits of clothing as they preened and beckoned customers .
But in some windows , women have recently been replaced by plastic mannequins in designer clothes .
What may appear to be a new form of street theater is , instead , the most visible sign of an ambitious new gentrification plan that may take years to complete .
The city council has voted to clean up the historic but notorious district , which has become bloated with expanding sleaze .
The city is buying up brothels , and it has lent the first 18 windows and boudoirs for one year to young designers and photographers .
The elders of the Dutch capital , long known for its broad - mindedness , insist they have not been seized by a wave of prudishness .
They say there is new evidence that criminal gangs , including East Europeans and Russians , have encroached on the area , making it meaner , more violent and more in the grip of the underworld of international sex traffickers .
By Simon Jenkins
The foreign secretary speaks as part of a political generation with no experience of war and little sense of history
David Miliband loves democracy .
We all love democracy .
We also love capitalism , social welfare , child health , book learning and leatherback turtles .
We would like the whole world to love them too , and we stand ready to persuade it so .
But do we shoot anyone who refuses ?
It is hardly credible that two centuries since Immanuel Kant wrestled with this oldest of ethical conundrums , a British government still cannot tell the difference between espousing a moral imperative and enforcing one .
Yesterday in Oxford the foreign secretary decided to update the 1998 Chicago speech of his then mentor , Tony Blair , in which Blair tore up the UN 's sovereignty provisions in favour of the new " liberal interventionism " .
He proposed a doctrine of international community , which he claimed , like St Teresa , to have " witnessed " .
This required Britain to attack sovereign states unprovoked if this would end a violation of human rights .
Blair qualified his zeal with reference to military feasibility , a " readiness for long - term commitment " and " our national interest truly engaged " .
Like any interference in the lives of others , the motives were soon mixed and the language confused .
How feasible is feasible ?
How long is long term ?
What is an " engaged " national interest : a moral crusade or an arms deal ?
Nonetheless , as Kosovo and Sierra Leone were to show , Blair was right to acknowledge a humanitarian instinct beyond relieving the starving , as in Biafra or Ethiopia .
In 1993 the liberal Washington Post was goading the US to invade Somalia , since states that " treat their peoples badly " should lose the protection of the UN charter 's protection .
Such unilateral rewriting ended in tears , but this did nothing to halt the exhilarating " virtues imperialism " of many on the left and right .
Miliband brushes aside the blundering into Iraq and Afghanistan as errors of implementation rather than principle and takes the Blair doctrine into new territory .
He wants his pan-democratic world to be achieved by peaceful means , by trade , multilateral action and - his new soundbite - a " civilian surge " .
Should soft power fail , Miliband wants to use sanctions and send in troops , for instance through offering security guarantees to regimes that " abide by democratic rules " .
Such measures would need to embrace internal and external security , and be of universal application if , as Kant warned , they are to go beyond opportunism and carry moral force .
They would have guaranteed Dubcek 's Czechoslovakia against the Soviet Union , and Allende 's Chile against America .
The regimes in Baghdad and Kabul would need guarantees indefinitely , as would an elected regime in Pakistan - guaranteeing it against insurgent Taliban and lurking generals .
Miliband calls any scepticism " a retreat into a world of realpolitik " .
Such point scoring may do for an Oxford debate but not for bereaved army mothers taking him to the high court , or the thousands of victims of his doctrine who see hard power interventionism as a menace to life and order .
The professor of political science at Baghdad University said yesterday that the imprisonments under Saddam were more tolerable than the weekly murders , kidnappings , militia censorship and female repression his department is suffering .
Is Miliband saying , from the comfort of his office , that this man is deluded ?
Few would quarrel with the platitude that democracy is the least worst way of governing a freedom - loving state .
But history shows that democracy takes centuries to bed down in any culture ( including Europe's ) .
This generation of western politicians has no experience of war and little sense of history .
The new interventionism may differ from the old imperialism in not seeking to settle or rule countries .
But it is the same in believing that western values can ( and should ) be imposed on often reluctant states through military occupation .
I regard the way I am governed as superior to most .
But I am not so arrogant or naive as to believe I can change other states by persuasion or war .
The latter is an infringement of self - determination and has proved starkly counterproductive .
The greatest boost to the overrated Islamist threat is from just the power projection Miliband supports .
In the non-interventionist 1990s , the thinktank Freedom House charted a steady growth in democracy worldwide .
With the advent of the democracy crusaders Blair and George Bush this trend has probably gone into reverse .
The cynical appeasement of China and aggressive treatment of Russia and the Muslim world has done no service to democracy .
Indeed the cause has fared better in south - east Asia and Latin America , where outside pressure has been least in evidence .
There is no text in international law that justifies ramming a system of government down the throats of others .
Self - determination , warts and all , has been the defining essence of the nation - state throughout history , which is why the UN charter qualified it only in cases of cross - border aggression and humanitarian relief .
The robustness of this doctrine is shown in half a century of relative peace worldwide .
Collapsing it has been disastrous .
Democracy everywhere has emerged when individuals give or withhold consent and rulers are confident enough to accept their verdict .
Besides western Europe in 1945 ( when democracy was not created but restored ) , there is almost no example of democracy imposed by external force .
Russia , with no experience of it , appears to be rejecting it .
The concept of consent in countries such as Egypt , Pakistan and Iran is hesitant , but western pressure , soft or hard , aids the reactionaries .
There is one simple way of honouring Britain 's pride in its chosen system : prove it works at home better than any other .
That means working tirelessly to refresh it .
This is not easy , as Miliband should know in his failed bid to regenerate civic democracy .
It may seem small beer , but how can he preach reform to others when he cannot achieve the tiniest reform himself ?
The west can invite the world to witness the virtues of democracy .
It can deploy the soft power of education , exchange , publicity and aid .
But a true democrat cannot abandon Voltaire 's respect for the autonomy of disagreement , let alone seek to crush it .
Britain can shine its beacon abroad but it cannot impose its values on the world .
It has tried too often , and has failed .
This is not isolationism .
It is fact .
The government claims that national identity cards will help to counter terrorism , illegal immigration and ID fraud .
That 's rubbish , says Henry Porter , and in fact there is something much more sinister about them - they will fundamentally alter the relationship between citizen and state , and make slaves of us all
The other day I went to see my publishers in central London and prepared for the usual performance at the entrance , which involves me writing my name , the name of my editor and the time in a book .
On this occasion the man asked me to type the details into a keyboard then angled a camera on a stalk into my face .
I typed away but held one hand in front of the lens before moving swiftly out of the camera 's field to make for the lift .
" Hold on , sir , " shouted the security guard after me .
" You ca n't go in unless you 've had your picture taken . "
" I can , " I said , " because you have no right to take my photograph without my consent .
And you most certainly do n't have it . "
A week later I was confronted with the same piece of equipment at my gym in west London .
Again I placed my hand over the camera lens and to the baffled receptionists quoted the Image Retention Act 2002 .
There was , of course , no Image Retention Act in 2002 , or any other year .
That time , they let me in .
By my next visit they were waiting for me .
The receptionist stood back out of range of my hand and snapped my picture before I had time to react .
To many , my behaviour would seem unreasonable .
After all , my picture is taken hundreds - maybe thousands - of times every day in London .
But that is not my objection .
What bothers me is when someone puts my image , my name , the place and time together .
That is information of a personal nature , and is an invasion of my privacy .
I have exactly the same response to the ID card and the much more sinister National Identity Register ( NIR ) , which one day will track each one of us through almost every important transaction of our lives .
Emails leaked to the Sunday Times at the weekend suggest that senior civil servants in charge of key aspects of the scheme , Peter Smith and David Foord , have grave doubts about the practicalities of introducing the card .
This may be reassuring to some but the argument against this folly must take place on every level .
I am instinctively against them , politically against the card and the NIR - and , if it does n't sound pretentious , philosophically against them too .
At a stretch , I would carry a voluntary little plastic ID card , because I have no objection to identifying myself when it is my choice .
I do n't mind taking my passport along to the bank or showing my driving licence to collect a parcel from the post office - but I am preternaturally against the state forcing me to supply biometric measurements and 49 separate pieces of information about myself to a database which will be accessed by God knows who without my permission or knowledge .
I am genetically incapable of submitting to such a process .
I can not do it .
I will not do it , and I pray that when the public understands how this scheme will profoundly alter the relationship between the individual and the state thousands more will recoil and say the same .
The government 's arguments in favour of ID cards keep shifting , and the hugely expensive project has been sold to the British public on a false prospectus .
The government began by saying it would prevent terrorism .
When that was n't tenable , it said it would prevent ID theft .
When that did n't work , it said it would prevent benefit fraud and when that did n't work it resorted to claiming that it would help control illegal immigration .
So , first of all , terrorism .
The Spanish ID card did not stop the Madrid train bombers and a British ID card would n't have stopped the London July bombings of 2005 .
ID cards , it is plain , will not deter home - grown terrorists or suicide bombers who are quite happy for their names to be known once they have carried out their attacks for the obvious reason that martyrdom is pointless when it is anonymous .
So when that did n't work , ministers stirred up fears about ID theft as the great scourge of modern society .
Yes , it is a problem , but it is nowhere near as large as the government has been making out .
In January , the Home Office published a report which said that ID theft cost the British public £ 1.7bn annually .
It turned out that that figure included £ 395 m for money laundering and £ 504 m for the total loss of plastic cards .
Thus the figure was exaggerated by a little under 50 % .
Rather than stopping ID theft , ID cards are , in fact , likely to increase the problem , because this single unified and trusted identifier will be something that is really worth forging .
Already , we hear , criminal gangs have compromised the chip - and - pin technology that will be used .
And the new RFID technology - that 's radio frequency identifiers - in place in some passports has been read by illegal scanners at 30 paces .
Imagine that gadget in the hands of terrorists or criminal gangs .
In February 2004 the government published a report saying that a campaign against benefit fraud had cut losses by £ 400 m .
The report said that the government was on target to slash fraud and error by half by this year , quite an achievement .
Then the boasting suddenly stopped .
Why ?
Because the government 's success at meeting its own targets militated against the argument for ID cards .
Like crime , benefit fraud has decreased .
But you hear little of this from No 10 or the rightwing tabloid press , because it suits them to keep us in a state of near frenzy about both .
And there is something else to remember : in the majority of cases , benefit fraud is not the result of well - organised individuals using multiple identities , but rather people exaggerating their sickness and the extent of their disability .
The ID card will do nothing to stop someone faking depression or lower back pain .
And , finally , the ID card wo n't stop illegal immigration .
True , it will make the lives of illegal immigrants more difficult , but there is little evidence to suggest that it will actually deter people - smugglers and desperate migrants .
Not one of these arguments is accepted by the prime minister .
Just six months ago , David Cameron asked at Prime Minister 's Questions how the government could afford the scheme .
Tony Blair replied : " Because if we introduce an ID cards scheme and reduce identity fraud that makes a major difference to the costs of government , to the costs of doing business .
In today 's world if we want to tackle illegal migration , crime and identity fraud , then using the new biometric technology to have ID cards is an important part of doing so . "
One thing we do know is that the cost will be enormous .
The London School of Economics puts it at £ 19bn over 10 years , while the government has said it will cost just £ 5.8bn , which seems ludicrously optimistic given that £ 12bn is being spent on the National Health Service database , a much less ambitious project .
The government estimates that the cost of running the scheme will be £ 584 m per year , which happens to be exactly the operating deficit of the NHS announced in June .
Think of the schools , hospitals or university research centres , or jails , if you like , that could be built for this figure .
I would guess that the LSE has got it about right : after 10 years there wo n't be much change from £ 20bn , which , incidentally , is about four fifths of the cost of renewing Trident , a figure that surely interests Gordon Brown .
The thing to remember is that this is our money and our children 's money and we are about to spend it on a project that will divide people and government with mutual suspicion , that will invade everyone 's privacy to a degree never seen in human history and that will make criminals of the people who feel that they cannot submit to the system .
And you know what really kills me ?
It is the vast amount that the government will spend on an advertising campaign which will by turns dragoon the British public , threaten us and seek to reassure us .
Let none of us be under any illusion that ID cards will remain voluntary .
The system only works if everyone is forced to carry a card and submit their details to the NIR .
Already , £ 55 m has been granted in contracts to set up 69 enrolment centres across the country and the bill , which became law this year , includes provision for a system of heavy fines for non-compliance .
These speak eloquently of the government 's intention to enforce its will .
It will involve considerable inconvenience , as the NO2ID website makes clear .
You will be required to attend an enrolment centre with some form of identifying material - bank statements , credit cards , driving licence or birth certificate , who knows what .
Then you will be fingerprinted , photographed and the iris in your eye will be measured .
You will give the authorities 49 pieces of information about yourself .
If you do n't , you may be fined up to £ 2,500 .
Additional fines of up to £ 2,500 may be levied every time you fail to comply .
If you fail to inform the police or Home Office when you lose your card , or if it becomes defective , you face a fine of up to £ 1,000 .
If you find someone else 's card and do not immediately hand it in , you may have committed a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for up to two years , or a fine , or both .
And you will be fined £ 1,000 if you fail to inform the NIR of any change of address .
You will also be expected to tell the authorities your previous addresses .
Truly the government will be able to say with all the menace of the underworld enforcer : " We know where you live . "
If you do n't inform the register of significant changes to your personal life , or any errors they have made , you will face a fine of up to £ 1,000 .
Astonishingly , you may also face a fine if you fail to submit to being reinterviewed , rephotographed , refingerprinted and rescanned .
And for all this you will pay between £ 30 and £ 93 ( or more ) to be registered , with further charges to change your details and to replace a lost or stolen card .
It 's a devilishly clever scam because , in essence , the government is charging you so that it can charge companies that wish to confirm your identity .
The card that you have paid for and have taken so much trouble over then remains the property of the secretary of state and he or she may withdraw it without explanation .
Once that happens you will find it very hard to function in our brave new society .
Some , like the editor of Prospect , David Goodhart , have attempted to portray the cards as " badges of citizenship embodying the idea of the contract between citizen and state " .
The argument is superficially comforting .
" They help us to know who is in the country and what their status is and to protect the precious entitlements of all existing citizens . "
There is no mention in his recent essay of the database or the terrible potential for intrusion and control .
And of course the idea of this being a contract is ridiculous when one party is being forced to sign or face penalties .
The notion of a badge of citizenship is codswallop being put about by people who are too impressed by authority and too weak to oppose it .
When reading the ID card bill I am constantly struck by its minatory tone - the threats of fines and the general contempt for the average citizen .
There 's a reason for this .
Rather than being something that is designed to help us , the card and the register are , in fact , tools of government control and surveillance .
Over and above the information you have supplied at enrolment ( please note the voluntary connotations of the word enrolment ) your file on the NIR will build an entire picture of your life - your hospital visits , your children 's schools , your driving record , your criminal record , your finances , insurance policies , your credit - card applications , your mortgage , your phone accounts ( and , one presumes your phone records ) , and your internet service providers .
Every time you get a library card , make a hire - purchase agreement , apply for a fishing or gun licence , buy a piece of property , withdraw a fairly small amount of your money from your bank , take a prescription to your chemist , apply for a resident 's parking permit , buy a plane ticket , or pay for your car to be unclamped you will be required to swipe your card and the database will silently record the transaction .
There will be almost no part of your life that the state will not be able to inspect .
And it will be able to use the database to draw very precise conclusions about the sort of person you are - your spending habits , your ethnicity , your religion , your political leanings , your health and even perhaps your sexual preferences .
Little wonder that MI5 desired - and was granted - free access to the database .
Little wonder that the police , customs and tax authorities welcome the database as a magnificent aid to investigation .
But know this : from the moment the database goes live , we will become subjects not citizens and each one of us will be diminished in relation to the state 's power .
Something enormous and revolutionary is about to happen to us .
We are giving the most precious part of ourselves to the government , allowing it complete freedom to roam through our privacy .
And it 's not just to this government , but to the governments of the future , the nature of which we cannot possibly know .
And it 's not just our privacy - it is the rights and privacy of future generations .
While we are comfortable about handing this information over to the state , the citizens of the future may feel strongly about our complacency and our faith in the British government .
We have a duty to those people , just as all the people who fought for the rights we enjoy today felt a sense of obligation to us .
The prime minister asks us to trust him and implies that abuse of a database would be unthinkable in Britain .
But after the lies before the invasion of Iraq , the revelations of the Hutton inquiry and the evidence about rendition flights using British airspace I would suggest that we treat these sorts of assurances and appeals with the utmost suspicion .
Remember this government 's attack on liberty .
Remember what we have already lost - the campaign that has diminished defendants rights , introduced punishment without a court deciding that the law has been broken , restricted protest and speech and even assembly .
Blair is unabashed about his record and has taken to describing civil liberties as a privilege that may be removed from someone the moment they become a suspect or a defendant .
I am afraid I do not trust the government 's motives - nor do I trust its competence .
The past decade is littered with failed government IT projects - the Child Support Agency , the immigration records , the working tax credit database , the farmers ' single payment scheme are a few that come to mind .
This is to say nothing of its record on security .
The NIR will literally have thousands of entry points where the information on your file can be accessed .
One of the worst failures of a government database came to light a few weeks ago when the Home Office admitted that the Criminal Records Office had wrongly identified 2,700 people as having criminal records .
I cannot think of a clearer case of defamation and it is surprising there is not some kind of class action against the Home Office .
Not only were these people 's reputations seriously damaged , many were turned down for jobs as a result of the CRO 's mistake and can therefore argue for a serious loss of earnings .
But the Home Office did not even apologise .
It is exactly the arrogance that I fear will come to characterise all government dealings with the person in the street once this database is operational .
As I said , I am instinctively - genetically , as I put it - opposed to ID cards and the Identity Register .
I am also politically opposed because as the government database grows , I believe there will be a commensurate lessening in the state 's respect for each one of us .
We will be reduced to the great mass of classified specimens , pinned down and itemised like dead butterflies in a showcase .
Because of the power it possesses over us , I believe the government will gradually become less accountable and less responsive to the needs and wishes of the people .
Whereas once politicians were our servants , they will become our masters and we their slaves .
I have philosophical objections , too .
In a free country I believe that every human being has the right to define him or herself independently and without reference to the government of the time .
This , I believe , is particularly important in a multicultural society such as ours .
The ID card and NIR require and will bring about a kind of psychological conformity , which is utterly at odds with a culture that has thrived on individualism , defiance and the freedom to go your own way .
And it will remove the right of those who for whatever reason wish to withdraw from the cares of the world and the influence of society , to resort to the consolations of solitude and privacy without inspection from a centralised authority .
Privacy , anonymity and solitude are rights , and we are about to lose them for ever .
People say that everything about you is known already .
Someone has calculated that each of us appears on up to 700 databases .
But the real point is that everything that is known about you will become linked up on the NIR .
The register will take on a life of its own , for once you set up a system like this it becomes ineluctably compelled to find out more and more about you .
That will be its hardwired purpose .
Imagine handing over the keys to your home when you are out at work to allow some faceless bureaucrat to rifle through your desk and drawers , your photograph albums and children 's school reports , your bills and love letters .
That is the kind of access they are going to have , and it is going to grow as time goes by and we become accustomed to this unseen presence in our lives .
Well , it 's not for me .
I can not do it .
I will not do it , and I hope you wo n't either .

BEIJING  Faced with persistent air pollution despite promises to stage a green Olympics , Beijing is planning to reduce its motor traffic by half during the Games to improve air quality and ease traffic flow , according to a newspaper report on Wednesday .
The article , in The Beijing News , said the number of vehicles in the city was expected to reach 3.3 million by August , meaning that roughly 1.65 million cars and trucks would be pulled off roads each day .
The city will dedicate lanes to Olympic traffic and increase public transportation with new shuttle buses to accommodate visitors and local residents , the article said .
Beijing officials have not announced Olympic contingency measures , but the newspaper said the traffic plan had been completed .
The city ’s air pollution  ranked by some studies as among the worst in the world  is one of the most pressing challenges facing Olympic organizers , with fewer than 200 days until the opening ceremony on Aug .
8 . Many Olympic teams plan to train outside the city to protect athletes .
Besides whatever measures
Beijing officials take to reduce pollution , factories throughout north China may face shutdowns during the Games .
Below is a commentary from Glenn Beck , who anchors " Glenn Beck " on Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated .
" .. Nothing ... will drive more listeners to conservative talk radio than a liberal back in the White House , " says Beck .
Well , actually , it 's not just the rumors of my demise ; it 's me , Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity and every other conservative talk radio host .
Here 's how the theory goes :
1. Rush Limbaugh is the most powerful and influential conservative talk radio host around .
2. Rush Limbaugh spoke out on the air against John McCain .
3. John McCain still did well in the primaries .
4. Rush Limbaugh must have no power or influence .
5. Conservative talk radio is dead .
But that cute little theory leaves out a few important facts .
First , no one -- from Rush , to Schwarzenegger , to Ted Kennedy , to Oprah -- has enough power to dictate an election .
Nor should they .
The founding fathers thought that might be a bad idea -- remember , they had already gotten their fill of the whole monarchy thing .
Secondly , I do n't wake up every morning hoping to influence anyone to do anything .
Unlike Air America ( the liberal radio network that has consistently failed ) I do n't consider it my job to win elections for any one candidate , let alone an entire political party .
My job is to entertain .
Period .
If people relate to what I say , and maybe find a little piece of themselves in the process , then great , I get to keep my job for another day .
Do n't Miss Glenn Beck on Headline News
Glenn Beck on Headline News Glenn 's new book : " An Inconvenient Book "
But let 's put that aside for a second and assume hypothetically that talk radio's mission is to directly influence behavior .
Let 's even assume that all the hosts get a morning talking - points email directly from the White House and / or Halliburton with our " original thoughts " of the day outlined .
What influence would any of that really even have on an election ?
Sure , conservative talk radio has an enormous audience -- tens of millions of listeners -- but over 215 million Americans were eligible to vote in 2004 .
So even if talk radio hosts could completely manipulate every single voter in their audiences , it would still be just a fraction of the voting public .
In a close general election , with two vastly different candidates , that fraction could very well make a difference .
But in a wide - open primary with a half - dozen candidates all claiming to be conservative ?
Not a chance .
Even when people point to instances where talk radio has had influence , they 're missing the point : it 's not the hosts who had the power , it 's our listeners .
For example , when the McCain - Kennedy immigration bill was being rubber stamped through Congress last year , it was conservative talk radio that ignited the fire that eventually stopped the bill in its tracks .
But that fire did n't start because we brainwashed people ; it started because we focused them .
We did n't change anyone 's opinion , we just helped open their eyes to the one they already had .
And that is the real power of talk radio -- we can take an issue or a problem and shine a national spotlight on it .
Sometimes enough people look and decide that it warrants action .
Sometimes they do n't .
But that 's not our decision to make ; and it 's certainly not our job to make it .
Part of the reason why this is even a story is that the media does n't understand talk radio at all .
They like to pretend that our listeners are one big , dumb voting block that 's ordered around by us hosts .
But while that would make our advertisers extraordinarily happy ( and wealthy ) people , the reality is that our listeners are exceptionally smart , independent people .
Years of open , honest conversations on the air have resulted in an implicit trust between talk radio listeners and some hosts .
But just because you trust someone does n't mean you always agree with them let alone blindly follow them .
For example , you might trust your real estate agent , but you 're not going to buy a house just because they describe it to you .
Talk radio is the same way : we bring our listeners to the issues we think they might like , but they ultimately do their own homework and make their own decisions .
Our listeners are the people who actually know what McCain - Feingold is .
They are the people who have done a full cost - benefit study of McCain - Lieberman .
They are the people who have listened to hours of analysis on the Z - Visa buried in McCain - Kennedy .
They are the people who care enough to know what they 're actually voting for .
As a result , some of them have considered all of the information and decided that John McCain is worth their vote because he is brilliantly ahead of the curve .
Others have decided that he 's simply the best bet to keep Clinton or Obama out of the White House .
But the vast majority of them have spread their votes out among candidates named Huckabee , Romney , and Paul ( and , in some cases , Giuliani , Thompson , Hunter and Tancredo as well ) .
No matter the reason , the point is that our listeners have their own brains .
They make up their own minds .
Talk radio may be one source of information , but it 's certainly not their only one .
The biggest irony in all of this is that most of the people who are claiming ( or is it hoping ? ) that talk radio has no influence are the same people who are hoping for a Hillary / McCain match - up this November .
Why is that ironic ?
Because nothing -- absolutely nothing -- will drive more listeners to conservative talk radio than a liberal back in the White House .

One Man ’s Odyssey into ‘ Eat , Pray , Love ’
One Man ’s Odyssey into ‘ Eat , Pray , Love ’
Travel Books : Elizabeth Gilbert 's best - selling trans - global travel book is a fun read -- but do n't expect Rolf Potts to embrace the fantasy
Let ’s pretend , for purely rhetorical purposes , that I — an American male journalist — wrote a travel book about a quest for sensuality and spiritual growth .
Let ’s say that the plot of my book could be briefly summarized as follows :
As I enter my 30s , I find myself emotionally unsatisfied .
I have achieved professional success as a writer , I own a new house , and my wife is ready to have kids , but somehow it all just feels wrong in a way I ca n’t quite identify .
Thus befuddled — and given to random jags of weeping and self - pity — I elect to assuage my unhappiness by shacking up with a cuter , younger writer - actress woman from New York .
Soon , I come to love the cute , young writer - actress in a way I could never love my wife .
But then , due to social and personal uncertainty , I start picking fights with the writer - actress , who is n’t reciprocating my emotional intensity or sexual appetite .
Meanwhile , my wife is making the divorce contentious because ( for reasons I ca n’t seem to fully grasp ) she is angry , and wants my assets and royalties .
Since sparring with the increasingly disinterested writer - actress is n’t yielding the love and satisfaction I want from the relationship , I decide — amid further jags of weeping and self - pity — to settle my divorce , quit my job , take a year off and wander the world in search of sensual pleasure and spiritual epiphany .
I start by going to Italy , where I eat a lot of pasta , drive around and take some naps .
I also study the language with a cute , younger Italian woman , and I frequently fantasize about having sex with her and her equally cute twin sister .
I extol the virtues of these Italian women , who know how to treat their men — selflessly lavishing them with love and making them the center of attention .
I pointedly ponder how nice it would be if the American women in my life had had the awareness to treat me that way .
At the end of my Italian sojourn , I shell out for a new wardrobe and go to India to explore spirituality .
Once in India , I go directly from the airport to an ashram to study meditation under the guidance of a Guru .
I occasionally ponder the terrible poverty of India outside the ashram walls , but I ca n’t bring myself to actually leave the retreat for any substantial period of time because I ’m enjoying my meditation studies — and travel in India can be darned uncomfortable !
Fortunately , neglecting to experience the cultural context of my spiritual discipline does not keep me from having many fabulous spiritual epiphanies .
Slowly , I see that I am learning tons about how to better live through a life that has been lacerated with the painful emotional legacy of success , wealth and leisure .
I end my journey by looking for “ balance ” in Bali , where I make many charming friends who constantly assure me how handsome and wonderful I am ( one of them is poor — so I raise money to buy him a house , but I ’m forced to get tough with him when he tries to finagle more money out of me ) .
I have a wise old Guru in Bali , too , but I eventually stop seeing this Guru because I meet a lovely Brazilian divorcee businesswoman who wants nothing more than to have sex all day , drone on about how handsome I am and make declarations of unconditional love .
Finally happy , I congratulate myself for having the inner fortitude to travel into the world and solve my problems .
Do you think American women would embrace this book and turn it into a bestseller ?
Or do you think American women would react with hostility at such a self - absorbed , culturally oblivious and vaguely sexist narrative ?
No doubt it would be the latter reaction — and I would be reduced to dodging rotten fruit at book readings .
Reverse the genders on this synopsis , however — turn the protagonist female — and you get the essential ( if somewhat snarkily summarized ) plot of Elizabeth Gilbert ’s Eat , Pray , Love , the best - selling American travel narrative of the last couple years .
Since an enthusiastic female readership has driven the success of “ Eat , Pray , Love , ” it ’s tempting to conclude that women have serious double standards when it comes to defining acceptable behavior .
Of course , part of the reason Gilbert ’s book is so popular is that she writes with charm and insight , even as she presents herself as an imbalanced and not entirely sympathetic narrator .
What might be derided as a cliched and blatantly male “ mid- life crisis narrative ” seems honest and soulful when distilled through the sensibilities a woman .
Through such a raw and fallible self - portrayal , Gilbert allows female readers to vicariously examine their own lack of satisfaction in their lives — and ponder how travel might bring them spiritual balance .
( For men , who are less likely to empathize , reading “ Eat , Pray , Love ” is like traveling the world with a lovely and intelligent girlfriend who ca n’t stop talking about herself :
You ’ve come to admire this woman — and you wish the best for her — but you wish she ’d stop yapping about emotional minutiae so you could both look out and enjoy the scenery from time to time . )
At this point , I could probably dust off some evolutionary psychology and examine all manner of male / female behavioral expectations , but I think this is less about behavior than the difference in how men and women read .
In “ Why We Read Fiction , ” cognitive literary critic Lisa Zunshine argues that the pleasure of reading fiction is that it “ lets us try on different mental states . ”
According to Zunshine , women read more novels than men do because novels explain people ’s behavior through their feelings , beliefs , thoughts and desires .
“ They want to experience other ‘ minds in action ’ — which is another way of defining ‘ empathy ’ — much more than men do , ” she writes .
Even though Zunshine was referring to fiction , the same idea could be applied to travel literature :
In broad demographic terms , men like their travel protagonists to pursue outward journeys and physical challenges ; women prefer the traveler ’s inner journey , her emotional challenges .
Thus , for those seeking a vicarious emotional experience , “ Eat , Pray , Love ” reads like a survival tale , every bit as harrowing and inspirational as a north - face ascent of K2 .
So while Gilbert ’s tale is nonfiction , the appeal of “ Eat , Pray , Love ” lies in its sense of fantasy .
Around the middle of the 20th century , pulpy American men ’s magazines published what has come to be known as “ adventure porn ” — breathlessly told tales that involved hairy - chested men fighting crocodiles , exploring rivers and surviving diseases in far - off lands .
Women characters did n’t figure much in these stories , unless they were helpless victims , hot - blooded savage - vixens or hookers .
Though this era of men ’s travel writing has been ridiculed , these stories no doubt lent a sense of escape to the working stiffs who read them — men who were n’t likely to ever leave the country , but enjoyed the vicarious problem - solving that came with the pulpy adventure .
The legacy of “ adventure porn , ” I think , is not the kind of adventure writing you see in Outside magazine , but books like “ Eat , Pray , Love . ”
Instead of wrestling crocodiles in distant lands , our protagonist wrestles despair ; instead of exploring rivers , she explores emotions ; instead of surviving disease , she survives heartbreak .
Men occasionally appear in this survivor ’s tale , but they are as one - dimensional as adventure - porn wenches , and mainly serve as a sounding board for the protagonist ’s feelings .
When these men are giving our heroine love and help , she gushes with admiration ; when they ca n’t intuit her emotional needs , she reacts with despair ( and vague contempt ) .
Rarely does she ponder what — besides emotional availability to her — might motivate these men in day - to - day life .
Fortunately , I do n’t think women read “ Eat , Pray , Love ” as a prescription for practical behavior .
As with adventure porn , the pleasure of reading lies in its vicarious problem solving — the passive joy of projecting yourself into the protagonist ’s shoes , pondering how you might hold up from situation to situation , and hanging on for the happy ending .
Call it “ travel porn for women . ”
Just do n’t expect me to relate .
( LifeWire ) --
They ate lunch together almost every day .
They commiserated over professional and personal woes , and when projects ran long at the San Francisco architecture firm where they were both summer interns , they checked building plans together until they were sprung from the office at 10 p.m .
Take care that a flirtation with a co-worker does n't cross the line .
" She was fun to hang out with , and sometimes she would do things that some might consider flirty , like run a hand through my hair to mess it up , " says Hayes Shair , now 25 .
" Sometimes I 'd sort of flirt back . "
But Shair was dating his college sweetheart at the time .
This woman was more like his " work girlfriend " -- a coworker with whom one flirts platonically during office hours but without any romantic intentions .
It 's hardly a unique situation .
The career information Web site Vault.com reports that in a 2007 office - romance survey of 575 employees , 23 percent said they had a " work husband " or a " work wife . "
As with real spouses , work spouses turn to each other for mental and emotional support , perhaps share inside jokes or even bicker like married couples .
But that 's where the line is drawn .
Having a work spouse can give you an emotional connection without a professional nosedive .
Heidi Reeder , associate professor of communication at Boise State University in Idaho , says it can be a good thing .
Good for work ?
" There are some cases where the motivation of flirting is to get the person into bed .
But I think what a lot of people do n't realize is that there are other reasons why people might be motivated to flirt , like developing a positive relationship with the person with compliments and touch , " says Reeder , whose teaching specialties include gender and workplace communication .
Do n't Miss
Worst things to say at work
" It 's an esteem booster for both men and women to have a little flirtation in their day -- it makes them feel a little better , gives them a little more energy . "
Liking your co-workers might make you more excited about coming to work , too .
" You 're happy to see them , " Reeder says , " instead of , ' Ugh , I hate these people . ' "
In fact , flirting might even have some indirect benefits on the job , says Reeder , citing research conducted at the University of South Alabama in 2003 showing that people who do n't flirt very much have lower energy levels and rate themselves as less attractive than people who flirt a lot .
" It seems like having higher energy levels and thinking that you 're attractive might help you make the sale , and it can help you be more responsive to your partner in the bedroom , " she says .
Flirting with trouble
Of course , there is always the risk that platonic work flirting may be asking for trouble .
Last summer , Cheryl , 26 -- happily married for two years and six months pregnant with her second child -- found an easy self - esteem boost in her work boyfriend 's adulation .
" He fawned over me , complimented me on my cutting wit , my sassy outfits and sizzling personality , " she says , which left her " flustered and giggly schoolgirl - ish . "
Though her husband complimented her constantly , his words paled in comparison : " It 's like how your mom always tells you you 're beautiful .
It 's expected , " she explains .
" Getting the compliments from an outsider was refreshing . "
Cheryl , who asked that her last name not be used given the sensitive nature of the topic , had no intention of starting an actual affair .
In fact , even though she was suffering from a waning sex drive because of her pregnancy , her work flirtations sparked a flame at home with her husband .
But eventually the office flirting crossed a line , and she had to stop it .
" Over the months , our banter had more of a sexual overtone , at times downright raunchy , " Cheryl recalls .
Moreover , she became obsessed with his affection , and jealous when he flirted with other female coworkers .
Cheryl , now tending to her two young children in Wisconsin , acknowledges it was n't her finest hour .
Was it emotional cheating ?
" Probably , " she says .
" When our conversations became so explicit I could n't repeat them to my husband , I knew I had to cut it out , " she says .
" And I did ... though it was n't until I quit working to become a stay - at - home mom and he started dating someone at work that the book finally closed on that chapter . "
Where to draw the line
Is your work marriage crossing the line ?
Reeder outlines some questions to ask yourself :
• Would you behave the same way if your romantic partner were standing next to you ?
• Are your flirtations consistent with the way you normally behave ?
• Are you thinking about your " work spouse " while not at work ?
• Do you compare your " work spouse " to your real romantic partner ?
As flirting can include physical contact , even though the intent is innocent , it is wise to keep in mind how such behavior might be misinterpreted by some people .
Shair , now a graduate student at Columbia University in New York City , does n't make too big a deal of his work relationship .
" What were we supposed to do to prove that we were just friends ?
High - five each other ? "

It 's not all just cellphones at Mobile World Congress -- HP and Qualcomm have just announced plans to ship laptops with Qualcomm 's Gobi dual - 3G chipset that supports both EV - DO and HSPA .
That means you wo n't be locked into a carrier when you buy a laptop with an integrated WWAN modem -- and hardcore road warriors with multiple subscriptions will even be able to switch on the fly to the network with better coverage .
HP says Gobi ( officially the MDM1000 chip , but that 's no fun ) will be available on a range of laptops from ultraportables to high - performance models later this year , but there 's no word on pricing just yet -- let 's hope it falls into the " might as well " range , eh ?
A hundred years ago , a new network - the electric grid - allowed people to abandon their private waterwheels and steam engines .
In short order , electrical power turned into a utility .
Now , thanks to the broadband internet , it 's computing that 's becoming a utility .
Over the past 10 years , the nature of computing has changed .
While most of us continue to depend on personal computers , we 're using them in a very different way than we used to .
Instead of relying on software installed on our hard drives , we increasingly tap into software that streams through the internet , supplied by large data centres run by companies like Google , Facebook and Intuit .
Our PCs are no longer self - contained devices .
They 're terminals that draw most of their usefulness not from what 's inside them but from the network they 're hooked up to .
Vital role
By making power cheap and plentiful , the electric grid changed society , spurring the expansion of the middle class and the spread of mass culture .
Given the vital role that software plays in our lives today , we can expect the computing grid to bring equally large changes .
We already see the early signs in the shift of control over media from institutions to individuals in people 's growing sense of affiliation with virtual communities rather than physical ones , and in debates over privacy .
Nowhere , though , are the stakes as high as in employment and the distribution of wealth .
Over the past few decades , we 've seen a growing concentration of riches in a small slice of the population .
In coming years , the skewing of income promises to accelerate as the new computing grid allows companies to achieve far higher levels of automation .
For a preview , you need only look at YouTube .
When Google acquired the company for $ 1.65 bn ( £ 830 m ) in 2006 , YouTube had just 60 employees .
Yet the minuscule staff was able to run one of the most popular and fastest - growing websites .
Every day , people watched more than 100 m YouTube clips and uploaded some 65,000 new videos to the site .
What made it possible for YouTube to build a very large business very quickly with so few people ?
The internet 's abundance of cheap processing power , storage capacity and communication bandwidth .
And YouTube 's experience is far from unique .
Many companies are using the utility computing grid to create expansive enterprises with hardly any employees .
A year before Google bought YouTube , another internet giant , eBay , purchased the internet telephone company Skype for $ 2.1 bn .
Founded just two years earlier by a pair of Scandinavian entrepreneurs , Skype had signed up 53 million customers - more than twice the number of phone customers served by venerable British Telecom - and was attracting 150,000 new subscribers every day .
Yet Skype employed just 200 people .
Even more remarkable is PlentyOfFish , an online dating service .
Launched in Canada in 2003 , the site experienced explosive growth .
By late 2006 , some 300,000 people were logging on to the service every day , and they were looking at about 600 m pages a month .
How many people did this booming business employ ?
Precisely one : its founder , Markus Frind .
Companies like YouTube , Skype and PlentyOfFish are constructed almost entirely of software .
Their products are virtual , flying across the internet as strings of digits .
The cost of distributing their goods or services to a new customer anywhere in the world is essentially zero , so they can expand vastly without hiring additional employees .
By relying on the internet as their distribution channel , they can also avoid making capital investments .
YouTube does n't have to build production studios .
Skype does n't have to string miles of cable between telephone poles .
PlentyOfFish does n't have to open offices .
The economics of doing business online can be a boon to consumers .
What used to be expensive - everything from international phone calls to video transmissions - can now be had for free .
But there 's another side to the robotic efficiency enjoyed by the new internet companies .
They compete , after all , with old - line businesses that have long employed many people .
Given the economic advantages of online businesses - advantages that will grow as utility computing drives the costs of data processing and communication even lower - traditional companies may have no choice but to refashion their own businesses along similar lines , firing workers in the process .
Shrinking workforce
We already see signs of the thinning of the workforce in some information industries .
Early last year , the US Department of Labor released a revealing set of statistics on the publishing and broadcasting business .
Employment in the industry had fallen by 13 % in the six years since 2001 , with nearly 150,000 jobs lost .
These were years when many media companies had been shifting from physical media to online .
Yet the report revealed that there had been no growth in internet publishing and broadcasting jobs .
In fact , online employment had actually dropped 29 % .
The displacement of workers by machines is nothing new .
But whereas industrialisation created far more jobs than it destroyed , computerisation is taking a very different course .
It is extending the replacement of workers by machines from the blue - collar to the white - collar world , but it shows no sign of creating broad new categories of employment .
The electric utility was instrumental in spreading wealth among a large and prosperous middle class .
The computer utility may funnel society 's riches to a small digital elite .

I recall reading about an obscure native culture in which the concept of death is fluid rather than fixed .
You might be “ dead ” ( somewhat sick ) , “ very dead ” ( extremely ill ) or “ completely dead ” ( actually deceased ) according to their terminology .
The following 20 funny photos have been organized by these darkly funny and fatalistic categories !
Believe it or not , the image above is completely real – the photograph was taken in Lysefjorden , Norway .
Dead ( aka Somewhat Sick ) :
The above victims may survive their ordeals but will certainly have some scars an bruises to show for them .
A shark bite here , broken nose there and a few gore marks later these traumatized sports players , spectators and commuters all have priceless photos to document their near - death experiences .
Very Dead ( Extremely Ill ) :
The top set of photos , while completely unretouched via Photoshop , was of course staged .
A French photographer hired hip - hop dancers to jump and appear to be falling on the sidestreets of France .
The latter group of images , though , depict dizzying near - death automotive accidents .
How do you suppose that last guy got out in time ?!
Completely Dead ( Actually Deceased ) :
While nothing is sure in life , everything is certain in death and few of the above - featured individuals seem likely to make it out alive .
To be fair , a few from this last category have ‘ gone under the knife ’ so to speak and become victims of Photoshop ( good news for the ‘ victims ’ they feature ) , though they are nonetheless entertaining after their digital ’ surgery ’ !
However , some analysts predict a decrease of up to 2 million barrels .
Analysts also predict the EIA report will show refinery utilization rose 0.3 percentage point ; gasoline supplies , still near record lows , rose 1.1 million barrels ; and distillate stockpiles , which include heating oil and diesel , rose 200,000 barrels .
Analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires on average predict crude inventories rose 300,000 barrels during the week ended Oct. 19 , and Vienna 's PVM Oil Associates also noted that " expectations for this week 's U.S. oil inventory data are for a rise in crude oil stocks . "
Here ’s what they got :
U.S. commercial crude oil inventories fell by 5.3 million barrels compared to the previous week .
At 316.6 million barrels , U.S. crude oil inventories are near the upper end of the average range for this time of year .
Total motor gasoline inventories decreased by 2.0 million barrels last week , and are at the lower end of the average range .
Both finished gasoline inventories and gasoline blending components fell last week .
Distillate fuel inventories decreased by 1.8 million barrels , and are at the upper limit of the average range for this time of year .
Propane / propylene inventories increased 0.6 million barrels last week .
Total commercial petroleum inventories decreased by 7.9 million barrels last week , but are in the upper half of the average range for this time of year .
I suspect crude will be off to the races again .
I had called a ( short - term ) top on front - month WTI a week ago at $ 89 , and in fact oil was down almost every day since then .
But this inventory report will provide a lot of fuel for the bulls for another week .
Here is the rest of the report :
U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 14.9 million barrels per day during the week ending October 19 , down 183,000 barrels per day from the previous week 's average .
Refineries operated at 87.1 percent of their operable capacity last week .
Gasoline production rose compared to the previous week , averaging nearly 9.0 million barrels per day .
Distillate fuel production fell last week , averaging 3.9 million barrels per day .
U.S. crude oil imports averaged 9.1 million barrels per day last week , down 1,305,000 barrels per day from the previous week .
Over the last four weeks , crude oil imports have averaged 9.9 million barrels per day , or 414,000 barrels per day less than averaged over the same four - week period last year .
Total motor gasoline imports ( including both finished gasoline and gasoline blending components ) last week averaged 838,000 barrels per day .
Distillate fuel imports averaged 235,000 barrels per day last week .
Total products supplied over the last four - week period has averaged nearly 20.8 million barrels per day , up by 0.4 percent compared to the similar period last year .
Over the last four weeks , motor gasoline demand has averaged 9.2 million barrels per day , or 0.2 percent below the same period last year .
Distillate fuel demand has averaged nearly 4.3 million barrels per day over the last four weeks , up 1.0 percent compared to the same period last year .
Jet fuel demand is down 3.3 percent over the last four weeks compared to the same four - week period last year .
It is going to be a close call on the $ 1,000 bet .
( The real irony is that the primary risk factor I saw with respect to the bet - the potential for falling Saudi production - has not been an issue .
Saudi production has been steady all year , and is now set to rise ) .
I do believe the fundamentals for higher oil prices are generally worse now than they were 3 months ago .
Peak driving season has passed , OPEC is already pumping more crude , and prices have had a dramatic run-up .
On the other hand crude inventories , while still high , have been pulled down ( although they are at about the same level they started the year at ) , and gasoline inventories continue to hover near record - low levels .
But , the sentiment has certainly turned in favor of higher oil prices .
And the sentiment of the market can move it quite a bit in a short period of time .
You can see some of the analysts on CNBC - after having missed out on most of the run-up - have now moved their clients into oil and so are talking up the price .
But the recent fast run-up in prices , followed by OPEC ’s decision to pump more crude , would make me very cautious about buying oil at this level .
You might make some money , but it is a much bigger risk than it was earlier in the year when the fundamentals for higher oil prices looked better ( at least to me ) .
Of course over the long haul , I am bullish on oil prices and have been for 5 years .
I thought $ 100 oil in 2008 was likely , but a move from $ 60.77 ( the crude price the first week of January ) to $ 100 in a single year would be unprecedented .
I would also add just a bit on refinery utilization .
Analysts had predicted utilization to come up this week .
Generally , refineries are coming out of their turnarounds now , and you would expect to see utilization at a higher level at the end of October .
But you have to take the current crack spreads into account .
When crack spreads are at $ 30 / bbl , as they were earlier in the year , you do everything you can to maximize your utilization rate .
If that means paying overtime , or paying extra to have equipment fabricated and delivered quickly , you do it .
Money is not an object ; you get your refinery up and running as quickly as possible .
But when crack spreads are $ 5 / bbl , as they are now , you do n't do those things .
You still want to have your refinery up and running , but it does n't make economic sense to go all out to boost your utilization .
That $ 5 / bbl margin will disappear pretty quickly if you throw money around .
So , utilization rates will be less robust in times of low margins .
It has absolutely nothing to do with inability to secure crude - as some have suggested .
It has everything to do with economics .
But given where gasoline inventories are currently setting , I do n't expect margins to stay soft for long .
The policeman in charge of the Sally Anne Bowman murder inquiry today called for the national DNA register to be made compulsory .
Detective Superintendent Stuart Cundy urged the adoption of the register after Mark Dixie was found guilty of killing the 18 - year - old model .
Dixie was the second high - profile suspect in as many days to have been caught and convicted because his DNA had been collected over a minor offence .
Yesterday , Steve Wright was found guilty of murdering five women who worked as prostitutes in Ipswich .
He was arrested after his DNA – which was on the police database following a conviction for petty theft five years ago - was found on three of the victims .
Cundy said having the DNA of everyone in Britain on file would speed up arrests and cut down on further offending .
Bowman 's mother , Linda , has also called for a national register .
" If there was a DNA register , we would have known who killed Sally Anne [ on the day her body was found ] , " he said .
In a statement today , the Home Office said the database was " an invaluable police tool " , contributing 3,500 police leads a month , but that there were no plans to make it compulsory .
" To do so would raise significant practical and ethical issues , " the statement added .
Dixie was arrested in June 2006 - nine months after Bowman 's murder - within hours of his DNA being put on national police computers following his arrest for a minor offence .
Detectives believe it could have taken up to two years for him to be tracked down had he not been arrested following a minor scuffle at the Surrey pub where he was working .
Since 2004 , police have been given powers to take DNA swabs from anyone arrested and taken to a police station .
The national police register contains 4.2 m records , which are kept for the duration of their subject 's life .
Records are rarely deleted , even if a person is never charged with an offence .
Up to 500,000 people who have profiles on the database have not been convicted or cautioned for a crime .
That number includes profiles of 100,000 children , the Liberty pressure group said .
Hugh Whittall , the director of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics , said there was no data to suggest a significant increase in the number of solved crimes because of the inclusion of people who had not been convicted of serious offences on the database .
Whittall said a universal database raised serious issues of cost , privacy and " the relationship between the state and the individual " .
" The proportionality of that is simply out of kilter , " he added .
Dixie had 16 previous convictions in Britain , but in each case had been arrested before DNA was routinely taken from suspects .
He burst into tears when his DNA was taken in 2006 , but did not attempt to flee when he was released on police bail .
" He probably thought he had got away with it when he did not hear anything immediately , " Cundy said .
Around 1,700 men in the Croydon area gave their DNA voluntarily to be eliminated from the Bowman investigation .
Police were also working through a list of 22,500 local suspects before widening their search to other parts of London when Dixie was identified .
After Dixie 's arrest for murder , his DNA profile was also sent to Australia , where officers in Perth found a match for an unsolved 1998 attack on a Thai student .

A study from the University of Glamorgan suggests that valuable information is easy to find on computers that have not had their files erased properly .
The survey of 111 hard drives , bought from internet auction sites , uncovered financial accounts , school records and personal information .
Andrew Jones , research group leader of BT's Security Research Centre , who analysed the hard drives , said the problem was businesses not understanding the complex procedures needed to properly delete computer files .
Moreover , they could be entering a legal quagmire .
" Companies believe they have the infrastructure in place to deal with these problems , but they have n't checked policies to make sure they work , " he said .
" Companies are not fulfilling statutory obligations under such acts as the Data Protection Act or Sarbanes - Oxley and Gramm - Leach - Bliley . "
Beyond the possible legal implications of this some industry experts argue that companies not properly deleting files could leave themselves open to some form of attack .
" Failing to completely erase information before reselling computers can easily come back and create even more headaches for businesses , " said Arthur Barnes , principal consultant , at secure technology company Diagonal Security .
" It could provide would - be hackers with company passwords which can compromise the organisation , or sensitive personal information which can create opportunities for identity theft . "
Jones disputed any suggestion that criminals are targeting discarded computers but believes if they did , it would be easy to get potentially harmful information .
" It is ridiculously easy to find information on these disk with nothing more complicated that the Windows operating system and a hex editor , " he said .
Jones added that hard disks should be crushed or melted down rather than using software tools .
" Most of those on the market do not effectively destroy data . "
Some of the more interesting findings the university made include school reports , psychological information and details of a married woman 's affair .

Participating in sports such as football , weightlifting and boxing has long been part of the culture within the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department .
But deputies have recently been playing some new games -- on -duty enforcement competitions that have police watchers across the country crying foul .
One recent competition , described in an internal Sheriff ’s Department e-mail obtained by The Times , was called “ Operation Any Booking . ”
The object was to arrest as many people as possible within a specific 24 - hour period .
Other one - day competitions have included “ Operation Vehicle Impound , ” a contest aimed at seizing as many cars as possible .
And another challenged deputies to see how many gang members and other suspected criminals could be stopped and questioned .
The prize for winning was nothing more than “ bragging rights , ” said Lt. James Tatreau , who helped organize the events that involved teams of deputies patrolling the southeast Los Angeles cities of Lakewood , Bellflower , Paramount , Artesia and Hawaiian Gardens .
The station is one of 23 that make up the nation ’s largest sheriff ’s department .

“ It ’s just a friendly competition to have a little fun out here , ” Tatreau said .
It was Tatreau who sent the e-mail about the booking contest Aug. 15 .
Tatreau said he viewed the games , which began in July , as a morale booster for overworked deputies who , because of staffing shortages , are required to work four overtime shifts a month .
But police accountability experts , civil libertarians and defense attorneys condemned the practice , saying that it trivialized traumatic encounters such as arrests and having a car impounded , and raised questions about deputies ’ motives in taking such actions .
Hubert Williams , president of the Washington , D.C. - based Police Foundation , which promotes innovative policing strategies , called the competitions “ highly problematic and inappropriate . ”
“ The arrest is one of the most potent tools in the possession of law enforcement and should be used with great thought , ” Williams said .
“ It ’s not a competition or a game . ”

Others , including Los Angeles County Public Defender Michael P. Judge , worried that the games might also prompt deputies to make illegitimate arrests to boost their statistics .
“ Certainly , it calls into question whether there was a legitimate reason to book any of the people who were booked during the time of the competition , ” Judge said .
“ It ’s crazy , ” said Jane White , the associate director of the National Center for Community Policing .
“ I ’m at a loss for words .
I ’ve never heard of anything like this before . ”
After being called for comment by The Times on Wednesday , Sheriff Lee Baca said he spoke with the Lakewood station lieutenant .
Baca called the competitions a well - meaning but ill - conceived idea that promoted “ the wrong values . ”

“ We train deputies to be independent thinkers and leaders , ” Baca said .
“ The lesson learned here is that -- whether it ’s for morale purposes or to increase productivity -- law enforcement is not the kind of service where you can dictate the activity .
“ We ’re not into numbers , we ’re into quality , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think it will occur again . ”
Operation Any Booking did not result in an increase in arrests on the day of the contest , according to records provided to The Times in response to a public records request .
The cities reported a combined total of 28 arrests , which was equal to the daily average that month .
The impound competition , however , appears to have dramatically increased the number of vehicles seized , records show .
On average , deputies in the five - city area hauled away 4.7 cars a day in July .
On the day of the contest , July 11 , they impounded 37 vehicles -- which owners could not recover until they paid a towing fee .

Deputies in Lakewood seized 18 vehicles that day , half the total they would impound over the course of the month .
The number of field interviews with gang members and other suspected criminals also soared during the contest to increase that particular enforcement activity .
Tatreau said the spike occurred because some deputies had fallen out of the habit of doing that intelligence gathering .
Before he was contacted by Baca , Tatreau said he stood by the idea to encourage deputies ’ productivity and had been encouraged by deputies who liked the competition .
“ They were pumped and excited , ” Tatreau said .
“ I ’ve never got any negative feedback .
It ’s not a quota or review system .
It ’s a morale booster . ”

Like every station , Tatreau said , there are “ good , hardworking deputies and there are the lazy guys . ”
He said he was trying to encourage the less motivated deputies to get more involved in proactive police work .
Tatreau said he joined the Lakewood station about 18 months ago and noticed that some deputies were n’t pulling their weight .
Some patrol deputies made 15 to 20 arrests a month , while others made seven arrests in an entire year , he said .
“ It frustrates me that people are so against doing work and cry foul , ” he said .
Tatreau said he was “ almost certain ” that he was the one who came up with the original idea to have deputies compete , but that he did so with the approval of his captain .

On the day of the contests , a sheet of paper was posted in the watch commander ’s office where deputies reported their activity .
At the end of the 24 - hour period , the team results were tallied .
“ We ’re not doing anything wrong , ” Tatreau said .
“ No way , no how did anyone encourage officers to falsify a report or an arrest . ”

We 're shocked we can even write this headline without needing to go f**k something
by Jeremy Hooper
Earlier this month , we told you about a new book from anti-gay Texas governor Rick Perry , and we showed you some queer - antagonistic excerpts from the pages within .
Well over the weekend , The NY Times Magazine ran a brief interview with Perry , in which he further elaborated on his unfortunate views regarding gays and the Boy Scouts .
Check it out :
TIMES ( Deborah Solomon ) :
Which has been fighting the A.C.L.U. , to keep gays out of the scouts .
Why do you see that as a worthy cause ?
PERRY : I am pretty clear about this one .
Scouting ought to be about building character , not about sex .
Period .
Precious few parents enroll their boys in the Scouts to get a crash course in sexual orientation .
TIMES : Why do you think a homosexual would be more likely to bring the subject of sex into a conversation than a heterosexual ?
PERRY : Well , the ban in scouting applies to scout leaders .
When you have a clearly open homosexual scout leader , the scouts are going to talk about it .
And they ’re not there to learn about that .
They ’re there to learn about what it means to be loyal and trustworthy and thrifty .
TIMES : But do n’t you think that homosexuals might also be interested in being loyal and thrifty ?
PERRY :
The argument that gets made is that homosexuality is about sex .
Do you agree ?
TIMES : No .
PERRY : Well , then why do n’t they call it something else ?
Okay , first off -- he 's being disingenuous in regards to the scout 's ban .
It 's not just against the leaders .
Openly gay ( as well as openly atheist ) scouts are also banned under the short - sighted policy .
So when Perry positions the barring as only applying to adults and frames it around the idea that kids would be confused if there was a ' mo in charge , he is overlooking the truth about the scouts ' discrimination .
Boys who talk about the " hot " girl in the blockbuster movie and all the smooches they'd like to give her are totally at home within the scouts ' ranks , while boys who proudly objectify George Clooney 's fine ass are kept at bay .
This distinction is not insignificant .
But moving past Perry 's misrepresentative ways and onto his heteorsexist outlooks :
How DARE he suggest that the context clues in the word " homosexuality " imply a stronger connection to sex than do the ones within the word " heterosexuality . "
By what sense of irrational logic can he make such a suggestion ?!
We 're talking about a four - letter difference between the two words , with " sex " not being the part that is altered .
What , does the word " etero " have an etymological root meaning " love , companionship , and morals " while the word " omo " has a historical connection to " groups orgies in a backroom bar " ?!
Gee , we must 've missed that in our study of Greek and Latin word history .
It would be unfortunate if anyone were making stigmatizing comments like the ones above .
However , when you consider that this is a man who has been put in place to govern our nation 's 2nd largest state , the words come across in a mind - numbingly painful manner .
On the obvious level , Perry is encouraging his populace to keep gays in a marginalized box ( in which they will do nothing but schtup each other all day ) .
On an almost more enraging level , however , he is also encouraging irresponsible , unreasoned outlooks in the most aggressively ignorant of fashions .
Even though we live in a world where Playboy and Maxim are heterosexual male staples and straight reality show contestants give BJs on camera ( we 're looking at you , Natalie from " Big Brother " ) , Perry is seriously suggesting that it's the gayswho are automatically , by virtue of both their nature and nomenclature , sex - crazed obsessives who would grant little kiddies their merit badges in proper lube usage .
This sort of mindless bias is not something that should only be protested by the LGBT community .
It is a cretinous view that should be loudly resisted by ANYONE who thinks a society is stronger when it uses its brain .
Troop Leader [ NY Times ]
Your thoughts
I was in the Boy Scouts before I came out as transgender to my parents .
It was something my Dad always wanted me to do .
In those years before I came out , I did n't know at the time that the Boy Scouts were so closed - minded .
I did n't even know they kicked out scouts that were gay , or otherwise ' displeased ' them .
However , looking back ...
This attitude was apparent in the leaders , and in the parents .
I served as the troop leader for 6 months ( my Mom asked me too ) ...
The only reason why I was SPL was simply because no one else wanted to be it ...
And as an outcast as I was ...
No one wanted me to be the troop leader because I was ear marked as the ' different ' one , but did n't know what that meant for me at the time .
The Boy Scouts , as a youth organization , needs to support all youth ...
Instead of ramming ' morality ' , God and heterosexuality down kids throats .
But it 's also the parents fault too .
Posted by : Kira | Feb 25 , 2008 12:09:02 PM
I went through the whole Scout program as a youth , leader , volunteer and employee .
The truly sad thing is that the organization can do so much good for so many boys , ( I certainly did for me , ) but their exclusionary policies are leave many kids behind .
It 's like a fly in an ice cream sunday .
The sad truth is that Scouting Executives view the organization as a business .
Many of them do n't really believe gays will be more likely to abuse scouts or be bad role models .
They just do n't want to alienate their biggest customer : The MORMON Church .
The Mormons have already set up their own parallel program to use in countries where " the values of the Scouting organization " do not match those of the church .
They do n't want to pull out of Scouting in the U.S. , but the organization knows that they can and will if the Scouts get too " liberal " for them .

This homophobic gubernatorial cracker nonsense could be ended if we would simply return ownership of Texas to Mexico , on or after 1 - 21 - 2009 .
Crawford resident and soon - to - be - ex - president G W Bush would be included in the bargain , as well as the state 's judgmentally moronic governor .
Posted by : E | Feb 25 , 2008 1:33:22 PM
" The argument that gets made is that homosexuality is about sex .
Do you agree ? ? "
Apparently being stupid is a requirement for being governor of Texas .
I read this post about three hours ago , and I can't stop thinking about it , and it's not pleasant thoughts that I am having .
The people that make that argument are the one 's on the side of those wingnuts .
I do n't call myself homosexual .
I refer to myself as being gay or queer , but usually I do n't use any of those terms .
I 'm just me .
Yes , I am a man who is attracted to other men , but I cannot ignore the emotional aspect of my life .
My partner snores like a buzz saw , he talks when I try to read , and he would forget his name if I were n't around to remind him .
I think the bedroom floor is a hamper , no one has seen the top of my night stand in a decade ( because of the stack of books ) , and he thinks that I 'm the world 's worse driver .
If it were just sex , we would have killed each other several years ago .
The fact that we love each other has prevented the mayhem .
So yes Governor Perry , it is about sex , but it 's also about so much else .

Mike :
If you 're of a certain mindset , Perry 's comments really are unbelievable .
But what 's extremely annoying is just how many people wo n't understand why they are so offensive .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Feb 25 , 2008 2:53:19 PM
" PERRY : Well , then why do n’t they call it something else ? "
And if he was n't so think in the head , he might have realized that was a big reason for using GAY .

Catching Some Rays
Enormous detector makes first real - time detection of elusive , low - energy neutrinos streaming from the sun 's core
The fully - assembled Borexino detector is visible from multiple cameras embedded in the structure .
August 20 , 2007
This material is available primarily for archival purposes .
Telephone numbers or other contact information may be out of date ; please see current contact information at media contacts .
An international team of researchers has detected low - energy solar neutrinos -- subatomic particles produced in the core of the sun-- and measured in real - time the rate the particles hit our planet .
The researchers also obtained fresh evidence that neutrinos oscillate ( transform from one state to another ) before arriving at Earth , adding weight to present theories about the nature of neutrinos and the inner workings of the sun and other stars .
The team of more than 100 researchers , including National Science Foundation ( NSF ) - supported investigators at Princeton University and Virginia Tech , have operated the so - called Borexino experiment in one of the deepest laboratories in the world , the Gran Sasso Laboratory of the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare ( INFN , the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics ) , near the town of L'Aquila , Italy .
These are the first results from the Borexino experiment that has been under construction since the late 1990s with the support of INFN as the lead agency , NSF in the United States , and institutions in Germany , France and Russia .
" In making these first direct measurements of low - energy neutrinos coming from the sun , Borexino represents a convergence of our present understanding of neutrino properties and the physics of solar energy generation , " said Brad Keister , program director for nuclear physics in NSF 's mathematical and physical sciences directorate .
" The great depth of the laboratory and the incredible purity of the materials used in the detection were critical to the discovery and demonstrated the impact of eliminating background radiation from such experiments , " added Keister .
Produced in the Big Bang , and more recently in stars and nuclear reactors , neutrinos are everywhere .
They constantly bombard the Earth , but because they interact very weakly , chances are slim a neutrino will hit anything .
More than 100,000,000,000,000 pass through each of us every second without our noticing them .
The 18 - meter ( 59 - foot ) diameter Borexino detector lies more than a kilometer ( almost a mile ) underground in one of the planet 's deepest laboratories .
The depth blocks out cosmic rays and other radiation sources that could create additional background signals .
The detector is comprised mainly of concentric layers of radiation shielding .
Within an external tank filled with 2,400 tons of water , an enormous stainless steel sphere lies anchored .
Within the sphere are two nested nylon vessels , each containing successively purer detector fluids .
Neutrinos knock electrons out of atoms in the detector fluid , and in turn , the electrons generate photons as they travel further through the liquid environment .
Attached to the inside of the stainless steel sphere and facing inward is a suite of photomultipliers , 2,200 glass bulbs that look somewhat like floodlamps .
Instead of creating light , each is capable of detecting the individual photons .
Because radioactive decay in stray uranium , thorium or other elements can produce photons , even impurities in the materials of the detector itself could generate false signals .
To counter this , the researchers developed techniques to achieve an unprecedented level of purity for the fluids and all materials in the experiment .
" The Borexino team made a major leap forward in the field of low - radiation background measurements , reaching far lower background radiation than ever before , " said Frank Calaprice , the principle investigator of the Princeton University team .
" The first part of the strategy was to use a simple detection liquid that could be purified by standard methods such as distillation .
The second component was to house the liquid in a clean , low - background containment vessel . "
The Borexino experiment measures the flux of neutrinos passing through the detector , and this rate is critical for confirming theories for how neutrinos oscillate .
Researchers have long known that neutrinos were generated by fusion reactions in the sun 's core , but the model predicted more neutrinos than had been seen .
Physicists later realized that the explanation might lie in a new understanding of neutrinos , rather than a revised understanding of the reactions in the sun 's core .
In recent years , physicists have theorized that neutrinos produced in the sun transform back and forth , or oscillate , into other " flavors " of neutrinos .
Earlier measurements of higher - energy neutrinos have shown that the solar models appear to be correct , but due to oscillations , only a fraction of the neutrinos with the original flavor is detected .
" We 've learned a lot from higher energy neutrinos in recent years , " said Keister .
" But the issue has remained that we have n't looked directly at the energies where most of the neutrinos have been produced . "
Now , the Borexino measurement of low - energy neutrinos confirms this picture , including the expected neutrino deficit .
" This eagerly awaited physics result is an excellent example of an international collaboration undertaking an extremely challenging measurement , " said Bruce Vogelaar , the principal investigator of the Virginia Tech team .
" The Borexino detector will now move into a precision measurement phase and we will be able to uniquely probe some of the most important fundamental properties of neutrinos and our sun . "
The study has so far involved 100 professionals , including physicists , engineers , and technicians , and included INFN sections at the Universities of Milan , Genoa , and Perugia and the laboratories of Gran Sasso ; Princeton University and Virginia Tech in the United States ; the Technische Universität of Munich ; the Max Planck Institute of Heidelberg ; the French Laboratory for Astroparticle Physics and Cosmology ; the Jagellonian University of Krakow ; the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna ; and the Kurchatov Institute of Moscow .
The research preprint is now available online at the arXiv server , a leading pre-publication posting site for physics discoveries .
Additional information on the experiment , the results and the facility is available on the INFN website .

The first way was to send more women into paid work .
Most women streamed into the work force in the 1970s less because new professional opportunities opened up to them than because they had to prop up family incomes .
The percentage of American working mothers with school - age children has almost doubled since 1970  to more than 70 percent .
But there ’s a limit to how many mothers can maintain paying jobs .
Image Credit ... Oliver Munday
So Americans turned to a second way of spending beyond their hourly wages .
They worked more hours .
The typical American now works more each year than he or she did three decades ago .
Americans became veritable workaholics , putting in 350 more hours a year than the average European , more even than the notoriously industrious Japanese .
But there ’s also a limit to how many hours Americans can put into work , so Americans turned to a third way of spending beyond their wages .
They began to borrow .
With housing prices rising briskly through the 1990s and even faster from 2002 to 2006 , they turned their homes into piggy banks by refinancing home mortgages and taking out home - equity loans .
But this third strategy also had a built - in limit .
With the bursting of the housing bubble , the piggy banks are closing .
The binge seems to be over .
We ’re finally reaping the whirlwind of widening inequality and ever more concentrated wealth .
The only way to keep the economy going over the long run is to increase the wages of the bottom two - thirds of Americans .
The answer is not to protect jobs through trade protection .
That would only drive up the prices of everything purchased from abroad .
Most routine jobs are being automated anyway .
A larger earned - income tax credit , financed by a higher marginal income tax on top earners , is required .
The tax credit functions like a reverse income tax .
Enlarging it would mean giving workers at the bottom a bigger wage supplement , as well as phasing it out at a higher wage .
The current supplement for a worker with two children who earns up to $ 16,000 a year is about $ 5,000 .
That amount declines as earnings increase and is eliminated at about $ 38,000 .
It should be increased to , say , $ 8,000 at the low end and phased out at an income of $ 46,000 .
We also need stronger unions , especially in the local service sector that ’s sheltered from global competition .
Employees should be able to form a union without the current protracted certification process that gives employers too much opportunity to intimidate or coerce them .
Workers should be able to decide whether to form a union with a simple majority vote .
12/12 six month old babies reached for the helper .
10/12 ten month olds reached for the helper .
( Standard science disclaimers apply : further experiments showed it was n't the shape or color ; nor the direction of the movement , only the coupling of two in a helping movement that was preferred .
)
So either the babies prefer helpers , or they are averse to hinderers .
To test this , they ran the experiments pairing 1 ) helper scenario vs. neutral , or 2 ) hindering scenario vs. neutral .
In 1 ) 7/8 babies chose the helper , and in 2 ) 7/8 babies chose the neutral .
In other words , babies both prefer helpers and are averse to hinderers .
Awesome .
If I need backup , I 'm calling a baby .
So we have a situation where the overwhelming number of babies prefer " helping " and like to avoid " hindering . "
Is this innate ?
The age suggests it may be ( and the same team has similar data on 3 month olds ) , though at least one psychologist that Yahoo !
asked said they more than likely learned these behaviors from observing adults , etc .
But the question is n't why do babies choose this way .
We have to assume these are randomly selected babies , and they overwhelmingly and homogeneously chose helping .
The real question is why , if presented with a similar choice , do random adults notchoose this way ?
If it 's innate , why do adults lose it ?
If it 's learned , why did they forget ?
If these are indeed random babies , then presumably all / most humans were once like this .
It 's possible that some babies never learned it -- they lived in households were helping was n't rewarded or modeled , etc .
But what about everyone else who chooses the bad guy ?
The most likely explanation is that we learned it , but ignore or overrule it .
Make choices based on other reasons instead .
You can imagine a billion different " reasons : " the guy wants to appear tough / cool .
( Like cheering for the bad guy . )
Deep jealousy or envy over anything symbiotic .
Paranoia about anyone " pretending " to be a helper .
Double bind .
A will to power .
Whatever .
But what becomes clear , if you work it through this way , is that whatever the reason , it was a reason .
There was no compulsion , anymore than one is compelled to choose pizza over pasta -- it is a preference born of a myriad of factors , but a preference nonetheless .
You were someone , and you become someone else .
Inevitably and unfortunately , you get to pick who you are .
Israel ’s lobby in the US is " scrambling , " as Ron Kampeas puts it in the Jewish Exponent , to defend the draconian sanctions imposed on Iran for its alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons .
With a war - weary America unlikely to respond favorably to the news that President Bush has ordered an attack on Iran , the War Party has had to content itself with preparing the ground for a future conflict , including a campaign to isolate Tehran economically , diplomatically , and politically .
Now , however , as Kampeas reports ,
" The NIE is being held up by Congress , the presidential candidates and the media as an argument for tamping down isolation of the Islamic Republic rather than a vindication of earlier warnings that Iran indeed was pursuing a bomb .
The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations organized an emergency conference call of members on Tuesday to address how the news could threaten its recent campaign to isolate Iran . "
Red alert !
Red alert !
It looks like peace is about to break out !
All hands on deck !
The Lobby is frantically calling in all its chips in a desperate effort to repair the damage and get their war - wagon rolling again .
Congress recently passed a " package " of sanctions on Iran proffered by Rep. Tom Lantos ( D - Tel Aviv ) , who phrases his advocacy of isolating us from the Iranian people in terms of " talking " to Tehran in the language of " carrots and sticks . "
Which means : first the stick , and then  maybe  a skinny shriveled up little carrot .
This is the same Tom Lantos , you ’ll recall , who gleefully told Colette Avital , a Labor party member of the Israeli Knesset , " My dear Colette , do n’t worry .
You wo n’t have any problem with Saddam .
We ’ll be rid of the bastard soon enough .
And in his place we ’ll install a pro-Western dictator , who will be good for us and for you . "
( Lantos denied saying that , but Ms. Avital confirmed it : the man ’s a liar as well as a hypocrite . )
Well , I do n’t know who Lantos is referring to when he says " us "  because it sure did n’t turn out that way for the real " us , " that is the American people , although one could make a good argument that Israel ’s interests have been more than served by the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
We have n’t installed a proper dictator , as yet , but that ’s just a matter of time , now is n’t it ?
Perhaps we just ca n’t find a suitable candidate .
In the case of Iran , the logical choice to play that role is one of the Pahlavi clan ’s royal pretenders .
Yet the NIE on Iran has knocked over a major pillar of that dream , the mad - mullahs - with - nukes meme that worked so well in its Iraqi version .
Not that there are n’t plenty of other tripwires capable of triggering a war , as I pointed out the other day , and yet a major setback for the War Party is that the ticking time - bomb aspect of their propaganda has got to be abandoned .
Now we have time for diplomacy , for examining the real facts about Iran , including the historical context , and maybe we even will take the opportunity to ask questions such as " who wants war with Iran , and why ? "
This time , there ’s to be no rush to war : we can face the alleged " crisis " in light of genuinely American interests .
As for the Israelis , they have a clear enough concept of their own interests .
Defense Minister Ehud Barak ’s carefully worded I - beg - to - differ showed just a hint of bared fangs :
" It is our responsibility to ensure that the right steps are taken against the Iranian regime .
As is well known , words do n’t stop missiles .
It is apparently true that in 2003 Iran stopped pursuing its military nuclear program for a certain period of time .
But in our estimation , since then it is apparently continuing with its program . "
" We can not allow ourselves to rest , " avers Senor Barak , " just because of an intelligence report from the other side of the Earth , even if it is from our greatest friend . "
The other side of the earth  but not really so far away .
Not when the Lobby is hard at work , pressuring US legislators , relentlessly churning out propaganda , and going on the offensive to ensure that the sanctions not only stay in place but are actually tightened  until the Iranian people really begin to hurt .
It ’s just one more way to provoke some sort of internal convulsion that will give the Western powers a pretext for intervention .
I have to add that the New York Times report identifying the sources of the NIE as intercepted conversations between hardliners in the military complaining that the Iranian nuclear program had been scotched in 2003  which may or may not be true  was not something the authors and shapers of the report would want leaked , and was no doubt part of the pushback .
The Times report undermines the position of Iranian moderates , and feeds the suspicions of Iranian nationalists  who will naturally sympathize with the officers ’ bitter protests .
Seymour Hersh is telling us that the President gave the Israelis a heads up on the NIE two days before he was supposed to have first learned of it , and yet the " gotcha " aspect of this story 
" Bush lied , or his brain is fried ! "  is its least interesting aspect .
What I want to know is why the chief executive of a foreign country gets the facts before the American people  and what , exactly , was said .
I suspect the following :
" Hey , Ehud , that damned CIA is telling me you guys are wrong about those Iranian nukes  can you give me something to get them off my back ? "
" Yeah , my own guys are no better : they ’re telling me the same thing .
But , hey , that did n’t stop us the last time , now did it ? "
Appreciative laughter all round . "
" Yeah , but , Ehud ol ’ buddy , do me a favor , willya ? "
" Sure , Mr. President .
After all , what are friends for ? "
" Do n’t stick me with anything like those Niger uranium forgeries again  I think they ’re getting wise to us . "
" Oh , do n’t worry , Mr. President .
A word to the wise is sufficient . "
I ’m kidding , of course , so spare me the letters of outrage .
What I ’m not kidding about , unfortunately , is how careless the President of the United States has been when the actual interests of this country are at stake , and how willing he is  in spite of his administration ’s reputation for " unilateralism "  to subordinate those interests in order to preserve our " special relationship " with Israel .
Now , however , it looks like the national security bureaucracy has done an end run around him , and confronted him with a blunt declaration of independence .
What we are witnessing is a serious rebellion within key military , diplomatic , and intelligence circles against our Israel - centric policy in the Middle East .
Critics of the status quo such as Michael Scheuer and professors Mearsheimer and Walt prefigured this realist " surge " by daring to break the taboo against stating the obvious : that our unconditional support for Israel has crippled our efforts to combat Islamist terrorism , threatened our security on account of our required access to oil , and cost us far more in moral and political capital than the " special relationship " was ever worth .
Here we have a real divergence between American and Israeli interests , and those who shaped the NIE report were determined that , for once , the US government was going to go to bat on behalf of the former .
Israel cannot afford to cut the Iranians any slack : we , on the other hand , are able to put the issue in perspective .
In this case , geography is destiny .
Yes , Israel has much to fear from an Iranian nuke  almost as much as the Iranians have to fear an Israeli first strike , which is all too imaginable .
That ’s why a comprehensive approach to nuclear disarmament is the only one that will work : a regional solution , or nothing .
Why , after all , should the Iranians give up for good the idea of developing a nuclear deterrent to Israel ’s atomic arsenal ?
Tel Aviv has n’t even signed the Nonproliferation Treaty , while Iran has : yet we continue to send billions to bolster Israel ’s " defenses . "
The pushback against the NIE ’s " high confidence " verdict is already well underway , and you can bet it will be attacked from every possible angle : it ’s not a sure thing , here ’s the parts they left out , it was written by Bush - hating axe - grinding bureaucrats who are anti-Semites to boot  expect the works .
When that barrage fails to make much of a dent in the growing realization that their entire scare campaign was purest hooey , the Lobby will switch tactics and assert that this just proves we need to impose harsher sanctions .
After all , the sanctions worked , did n’t they ?
The NIE says the Iranians were pressured into abandoning their program because of the high costs imposed from outsiders , including the sanctions : yet what will be the effect of punishing them for compliance ?
If they get the same results from not complying , then it ’s all sticks , and no carrots .
Those who want to isolate Iran  let ’s call them " isolationists , " just for the sheer fun of turning the War Party ’s favorite epithet on its head  have one thing in mind , and that is in ginning up a war .
Isolation is just what the Iranian militarist faction wants : it feeds into their narrative of humiliation and injured pride .
Our own War Party benefits from this isolationist policy , too , because Iran is singled out as a pariah among nations , and thus fair game .
It ’s time to lift the economic and diplomatic sanctions on Iran , and , not only that , but we must begin to establish normal relations .
That means more than negotiations : it means unilaterally dropping the campaign to demonize the Iranian regime , publicly renouncing the goal of " regime change , " and beginning the process that will end with the return of American diplomats to Tehran .
For as long as the cold war lasted , we maintained an embassy in Moscow , and in all the Eastern bloc countries : in this context , twenty - eight years after the Iranian hostage crisis , our absence from Tehran is inexplicable .
That ’s for starters .
An opening of relations , both diplomatic and economic , would pave the way for a comprehensive settlement of the outstanding issues between the US and Iran , including not only the nuclear question but Tehran ’s relations with Iraq , Israel , and Lebanon .
None of this can happen , however , until and unless there is resistance to the power of the Lobby , which has thus far successfully superimposed Israeli interests on US policy initiatives , effectively making us Israel ’s instrument in the region .
The resistance is on the rise , that ’s the real meaning of the NIE , and that is cause for celebration  and yet much more remains to be done .
The national security community has done its part , and now it is time for the politicians to step up to the plate and show their own independence from the most powerful lobby in the foreign policy realm .
As a species , politicians are hardly known for their courage  and yet , now more than ever , we need patriots to come forward and make their views known .
HR 1400 , introduced by Rep. Lantos and passed by the House in late September , bars all Iranian products in the US and greatly narrows the range of allowable exports .
This must be rescinded , at the very least , in response to this new information : or are we saying that the Iranian people must be punished no matter what their government does ?
Where are the presidential candidates on this ?
Only two have said all along that Iran poses no threat to us , and that we must trade goods , not threats , with a nation of some 50 million souls .
Only two have spoken out and said the Iranian people are not our enemies , and denounced the rush to war : Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul .
Will at least some of the other Democrats now step up to the plate and give us their unvarnished assessment in light of this new evidence from our own government ?
I ’m afraid they must be talking in awfully low voices , because I can hardly hear a peep out of any of them .

This is a great innovation — the streets of Europe could soon be lit by " solar trees " .
These self - contained streetlights could save cities energy and money too .
Unlike regular streetlights , they do not require costly underground wiring to install , and they are immune to blackouts .
Designed by Ross Lovegrove , the lights have 10 solar panels arrayed at the top of tree - like branches , which charge built - in batteries .
The batteries then power LEDs for illumination .
Compared to conventional streetlights , they emit much less light pollution , because LEDs generate a very directed light .
The trees also incorporate light detectors !
So the lights automatically turn on sunset and off at sunrise .
The solar trees went on display for four weeks in October on a busy street — the Ringstrasse — in Vienna , Austria .
They were able to provide enough light during the night - time even when the sun did not show for as much as four days in a row .
The director of the program , Christina Werner said .
" Someday soon solar trees could well be the main form of street lighting in Europe . "
Putting solar powered LED light systems on trees would cut down on the carbon emissions and also slash the bills of local authorities , she said .
Street lighting consumed 10 percent of all the electricity used in Europe in 2006 or 2,000 billion KWh , and resulted in carbon emissions of 2,900 million ton .
The use of more energy - efficient lighting in the Austrian city of Graz , with a population of almost 300,000 saved the city 524,000 KWh of electricity and 67,200 euros [ US $ 96,800 ] in 2005 .

Real variables are those where the effects of prices and / or inflation have been taken out .
In contrast , nominal variables are those where the effects of inflation have not been controlled for .
As a result , nominal but not real variables are affected by changes in prices and inflation .
A few examples illustrate the difference :
Nominal Interest Rates vs. Real Interest Rates
Suppose we buy a 1 year bond for face value that pays 6 % at the end of the year .
We pay $ 100 at the beginning of the year and get $ 106 at the end of the year .
Thus the bond pays an interest rate of 6 % .
This 6 % is the nominal interest rate , as we have not accounted for inflation .
Whenever people speak of the interest rate they 're talking about the nominal interest rate , unless they state otherwise .
Now suppose the inflation rate is 3 % for that year .
We can buy a basket of goods today and it will cost $ 100 , or we can buy that basket next year and it will cost $ 103 .
If we buy the bond with a 6 % nominal interest rate for $ 100 , sell it after a year and get $ 106 , buy a basket of goods for $ 103 , we will have $ 3 left over .
So after factoring in inflation , our $ 100 bond will earn us $ 3 in income ; a real interest rate of 3 % .
The relationship between the nominal interest rate , inflation , and the real interest rate is described by the Fisher Equation :
Real Interest Rate = Nominal Interest Rate - Inflation
If inflation is positive , which it generally is , then the real interest rate is lower than the nominal interest rate .
If we have deflation and the inflation rate is negative , then the real interest rate will be larger .
Nominal GDP Growth vs. Real GDP Growth
GDP or Gross Domestic Product is the value of all the goods and services produced in a country .
The Nominal Gross Domestic Product measures the value of all the goods and services produced expressed in current prices .
On the other hand , Real Gross Domestic Product measures the value of all the goods and services produced expressed in the prices of some base year .
An example :
Suppose in the year 2000 , the economy of a country produced $ 100 billion worth of goods and services based on year 2000 prices .
Since we 're using 2000 as a basis year , the nominal and real GDP are the same .
In the year 2001 , the economy produced $ 110B worth of goods and services based on year 2001 prices .
Those same goods and services are instead valued at $ 105B if year 2000 prices are used .
Then :
Year 2000 Nominal GDP = $ 100B , Real GDP = $ 100B
Year 2001 Nominal GDP = $ 110B , Real GDP = $ 105B
Nominal GDP Growth Rate = 10 %
Real GDP Growth Rate = 5 %
Once again , if inflation is positive , then the Nominal GDP and Nominal GDP Growth Rate will be less than their nominal counterparts .
The difference between Nominal GDP and Real GDP is used to measure inflation in a statistic called The GDP Deflator .
Nominal Wages vs. Real Wages
These work in the same way as the nominal interest rate .
So if your nominal wage is $ 50,000 in 2002 and $ 55,000 in 2003 , but the price level has risen by 12 % , then your $ 55,000 in 2003 buys what $ 49,107 would have in 2002 , so your real wage has gone done .
You can calculate a real wage in terms of some base year by the following :
Real Wage = Nominal Wage / 1 + % Increase in Prices Since Base Year
Where a 34 % increase in prices since the base year is expressed as 0.34 .
Other Real Variables
Almost all other real variables can be calculated in the manner as Real Wages .
The Federal Reserve keeps statistics on items such as the Real Change in Private Inventories , Real Disposable Income , Real Government Expenditures , Real Private Residential Fixed Investment , etc .
These are all statistics which account for inflation by using a base year for prices .

So who ever thought the 2004 U.S. presidential election had the remotest chance of being honest and democratic ?
Not , one might guess , the electronic voting security experts like Ken Thompson , Roy Saltman , Rebecca Mercuri , Bruce Schneier , Doug Jones , Victoria Collier , Aviel Rubin , Lynn Landes , and Bev Harris , who have for years been warning that the new voting technology coming into use in the United States offers unprecedented opportunities for electoral fraud . [ 1 ]
Probably not Osama bin Laden , who made his much - anticipated Jack - in - the - Box video appearance three days before polling day : wearing a gold - lamé hospital gown in front of a blank shower curtain , and with a nose that looked to have been quite recently punched flat , he landed some anti-Bush shots that Rush Limbaugh and the other ring - tailed roarers of the American right were happy to interpret as a last - minute endorsement of John Kerry . [ 2 ]
And certainly not Republican Congressional Representative Peter King , who made an equally notable video statement on the afternoon of November 2nd , long before the polls closed , in the course of a White House function that seemed to have put him into a celebratory mood .
" It 's already over , " he told the interviewer .
" The election 's over .
We won . "
Asked how he knew at that early hour , King replied : " It 's all over but the counting .
And we 'll take care of the counting . " [ 3 ]
One of the people who took care of the counting -- and who was responsible as well for some of the most decisive crookedness of the election , and the most flagrant illegalities of the post- election cover - up -- is J. Kenneth Blackwell , Ohio's Republican Secretary of State .
To give the man his due , Blackwell is at once more discreet and more grotesquely Orwellian than the tipsy Congressman King .
Rather than flaunting his election - stealing prowess , he has preferred to boast in a Washington Times op - ed that while the election in Ohio was not in all respects perfect ( " a seven - hour wait " outside polling stations , he acknowledges , " is clearly unacceptable " ) , it was nonetheless " perfectly inspiring -- a testament to the strength and power of our democratic system , the commitment of American voters to have their voices heard and the integrity of the process that encouraged participation and demanded fairness . " [ 4 ]
Prior to the election , this versatile ironist was reported to be " coming out strong " in support of the proposal to ban same - sex marriage : in late October , Blackwell made an appearance with Pastor Rod Parsley , president of " The Center for Moral Clarity , " in the course of which he edified " an energized crowd " in the " Cathedral of Praise " by telling them that the notion of same - sex couples " even defies barnyard logic [...] the barnyard knows better . " [ 5 ]
But Blackwell 's talent -- and his affliction -- goes beyond irony or hypocrisy into a more permanent state of inversion that one might think of as resembling the punishment reported by the poet Dante for religiously inflected fraud .
[ 6 ]
In another speech in the same week of October - - the context this time being his refusal to obey a federal court order requiring him to comply with the Help America Vote Act -- Blackwell compared himself , in his willingness to endure the unlikely punishment of imprisonment , to Mohandas Gandhi , Martin Luther King , and the Apostle Paul .
A spokesman for the Ohio Democratic Party 's Voter Protection Program offered the appropriate rejoinder : " Many civil rights leaders went to jail to defend the right to vote .
If this official wants to go to jail to thwart it , that would be unfortunate . " [ 7 ]
The talented Mr. Blackwell has garnered praise for having launched " The Ohio Center for Civic Character : A Citizen Education Initiative of the Ohio Secretary of State . "
The Center 's goal , " a revolution of character - building in our great state , " is to be achieved by providing " today 's generation of leaders " with " a shared vocabulary of character - building ethics " which Blackwell calls " Uncommon Sense . " [ 8 ]
It may come as no surprise that one of his most recent public appearances prior to the Bush inauguration was a lecture , delivered on January 12th , 2005 to an exclusive audience at the Scioto Country Club in rural southern Ohio , on the subject of " Ethics in Leadership . " [ 9 ]
Like the unsavoury Katherine Harris , who was Florida Secretary of State in 2000 and simultaneously state Chair of the Florida Bush - Cheney campaign , Kenneth Blackwell occupied a strategic double position as Co-Chair of the Ohio Bush - Cheney campaign and Secretary of State in what analysts correctly anticipated would be the key swing state of the 2004 election .
From this position , a growing body of evidence shows , he was able to oversee a partisan and racist pre-election purging of the electoral rolls , [ 10 ] a clearly partisan reduction of the number of voting precincts in counties won by Gore in 2000 ( a move that helped suppress the 2004 Democratic turnout ) , [ 11 ] a partisan and racist misallocation of voting machines ( which effectively disenfranchised tens of thousands of African - American voters ) , [ 12 ] a partisan and racist system of polling - place challenges ( which together with electoral roll purges obliged many scores of thousands of African - Americans to vote with ' second - class - citizen ' provisional ballots ) , [ 13 ] and a fraudulent pre-programming of touch - screen voting machines that produced a systematic ' flipping ' of Democratic votes into Bush 's tally or the trash can . [ 14 ]
In a nation that enforced its own laws , the misallocation of voting machines -- a clear violation of the equal protection provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution -- would alone have sufficed to invalidate the Ohio election .
Having overseen one of the more flagrantly corrupt elections in recent American history , Blackwell and his Republican machine proceeded to " take care of the counting " -- which involved a partisan and racist dismissal of scores of thousands of African - American ballots as " spoiled , " [ 15 ] a flagrantly illegal " lock - down " of the vote - tallying process in Warren County on the transparently false grounds of a supposed terrorist threat , [ 16 ] massive electronic vote - tabulation fraud in this and other south - western Ohio counties , [ 17 ] and marginally less flagrant but evidently systematic forms of ' ghost - voting ' and vote theft elsewhere in the state . [ 18 ]
Blackwell then saw to it ( with the active assistance of partisan Republican judges , and the passive assistance of a strangely supine Democratic Party ) that no even partial recount -- let alone anything resembling a voting - machine or vote - tabulator audit - - could get under way prior to the selection of Ohio's Republican electors to the Electoral College . [ 19 ]
He also did his utmost to block public access to election data , ordering the Boards of Election in all eighty - eight Ohio counties to prevent public inspection of poll books until after certification of the vote , which he delayed until December 6th . [ 20 ]
On December 10th , his Election Administrator , Pat Wolfe , intervened to prevent analysis of poll - book data by ordering , on Blackwell 's authority , a renewed " lock - down " of voting records in Greene County and the entire state .
( According to Ohio Revised Code Title XXXV Elections , Sec. 3503.26 , such records are to be open to the public ; Ohio Revised Code Sec. 3599.42 explicitly declares that any violation of Title XXXV " constitutes a prima facie case of election fraud .... " ) [ 21 ]
Bizarrely enough , on the night following the statement to election observers in Greene County that all voter records in the State of Ohio were " locked down " and " not considered public records , " the Greene County offices were left unlocked : when the same election observers returned at 10:15 on the morning of Saturday , December 11th , they found the building open , a light on in the office ( which had not been on when it was closed on the evening of the 10th ) , and all of the poll books and voting machines unsecured . [ 22 ]
When at last the Green and Libertarian parties ' lawyers were able to obtain a recount , Blackwell presided over one that was fully as corrupt as the election had been .
Sample hand recounts were to be carried out in each county , involving randomly - selected precincts constituting at least three percent of the vote ; any disagreements between the sample recount and the official tally were supposed to prompt a full county - wide hand recount .
According to Green Party observers , however , a substantial proportion of Ohio 's eighty - eight counties broke the law by not selecting their hand - recount precincts randomly . [ 23 ]
There is evidence , most crucially , that Triad Governmental Systems , the private corporation responsible for servicing the vote - tabulation machines in about half of the state , tampered with selected machines in counties across
Ohio immediately before the recount in order to ensure that the sample recount tallies would conform with the official vote tallies . [ 24 ]
( Triad 's technicians knew which machines to tamper with because , it would appear , Board of Election officials , in open violation of the law , told them which precincts had been pre-selected . )
Despite this widespread tampering , there were discrepancies in at least six counties between the sample hand recounts and the official tallies -- and yet the Board of Elections refused to conduct full county - wide hand recounts . [ 25 ]
As David Swanson writes ,
" Only one county conducted a full hand recount , which resulted in 6 percent more votes than in the original vote .
Those extra votes were evenly split between Kerry and Bush , but -- even assuming that one county 's votes have now been properly counted -- how do we know where votes in the other 87 counties would fall ?
Should an extra several percent of them show up , and should they be weighted toward Kerry , the election would not have yet been what the media keeps telling us it is : over . [ 26 ]
Although required by law as Secretary of State to investigate electoral irregularities , Blackwell consistently refused to do so .
He refused to respond to a formal letter from John Conyers and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus itemizing a host of alleged improprieties and asking what he had done to correct or investigate them .
He also refused to testify in lawsuits against him arising from the election and its aftermath -- in the expectation , no doubt , that any cases not declared moot once George W. Bush was safely reconfirmed as president by the votes of the Electoral College and of Congress would be dealt with by higher courts dominated by Republican judges .
Katherine Harris 's reward for her work in throwing the 2000 Florida election to Bush was a safe seat in Congress .
Kenneth Blackwell has named his prize : he wants to be Governor of Ohio .
In a post-election fundraising letter soliciting funds for his governorship campaign , he takes credit for delivering Ohio to George W. Bush -- and thus , since Ohio decided the national outcome , for ensuring his second term as president :
" I have no doubt the strong campaign we helped the President run in Ohio - - coupled with a similar effort I helped deliver for State Issue One ( the Marriage Protection Amendment ) -- can easily be credited with turning out record numbers of conservatives and evangelicals on Election Day . [....]
And , I draw great satisfaction in hearing liberal members of the media credit the Marriage Protection Amendment as [ the ] single most important factor that drove President Bush over the top in Ohio . "
In the same letter , true to the general inversion of his world view , Blackwell takes credit for his success in preventing electoral fraud :
" I have never shied away from the giving the liberals fits .
And I 'm sure that with all the potential voter - fraud we prevented during this last election , they will be looking to get even with me in my next political campaign . [....]
As Secretary of State , I have been sued almost 30 times since this summer because I stood up for the rights of voters like you and against liberal trial lawyers and activist judges who wanted to give this election to Senator Kerry . [....]
When the ACLU and the other members of the radical left worked to stop me from cracking down and prohibiting outrageous ways to commit voter fraud , I fought back and won . " [ 27 ]
But what precisely does it mean to say that lawyers and judges who sought to protect the rights of minority voters from Blackwell 's manifold vote - suppression tactics would have ' given ' the election to Kerry ?
This sounds rather like a coded acknowledgment of a Republican truth that was , notoriously , voiced openly in July 2004 by a Republican state representative in nearby Michigan : " If we do not suppress the Detroit vote " -- for Ohio , substitute the Akron , Cincinnati , Cleveland , Columbus , Dayton , or Toledo vote - -" we 're going to have a tough time in this election cycle . " [ 28 ]
* * *
The Ohio recount of the presidential vote was declared officially terminated on December 28th , a day that in the Roman Catholic calendar of saints commemorates the Slaughter of the Innocents .
With a derisory alteration of the official count ( Kerry received an additional 734 votes , and Bush 449 ) , George W. Bush retained a certified victory margin in Ohio of 118,755 votes -- still large enough to look decisive , though well down from the lead of over 136,000 he was credited with in the first official tallies .
As Bob Fitrakis , Steven Rosenfeld and Harvey Wasserman have remarked , the end came
" amidst bitter dispute over official certification of impossible voter turnout numbers , over the refusal of Ohio's Republican Supreme Court Chief Justice to recuse himself from crucial court challenges involving his own re-election campaign , over the Republican Secretary of State 's refusal to testify under subpoena , over apparent tampering with tabulation machines , over more than 100,000 provisional and machine - rejected ballots left uncounted , over major discrepancies in certified vote counts and turnout ratios , and over a wide range of unresolved disputes that continue to leave the true outcome of Ohio 's presidential vote in serious doubt . " [ 29 ]
The end to the post-election process as a whole came on January 6th , 2005 , when the United States House of Representatives and Senate , the assembled Congress of the American republic , voted to ratify the votes cast by the Electoral College - - an act which formally made George W. Bush President for the next four years .
What is normally a purely ceremonial state occasion was interrupted , this year , by the brief irruption of a more authentic form of human dignity .
Ohio Democratic Representative Stephanie Tubbs - Jones , supported by California Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer , rose to challenge the Ohio results , thereby forcing the Senate and House of Representatives to separate in order to conduct , in Tubbs - Jones ' words , " a formal and legitimate debate about election irregularities , " and to engage , if only for the two hours prescribed for such a debate , with the arguments of those Democratic representatives and senators whose sense of ethics and of duty had led them to join what Boxer called " the fight for electoral justice . " [ 30 ]
As Mark Weisbrot wrote in an article published by the Knight Ridder newspaper chain , Republican lawmakers responded to Senator Boxer , and to Representative Tubbs - Jones and her colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus , " with howls of derision . " [ 31 ]
Some engaged in ad hominem tactics , labeling the objections " base " and " outrageous " ( David Hobson , R - Ohio ) , and calling the objectors " aspiring fantasy authors " of " wild conspiracy theories , " whose behaviour exemplified " their party 's primary strategy to obstruct , to divide , to destroy " ( Deborah Pryce , R - Ohio ) .
Others denounced the debate itself as " a travesty " ( Senator Rick Santorum , R - Pennsylvania ) , a " squandering [ of the Senate 's ] time " by people " who persist in beating a dead horse " ( Senator George Voinovich , R - Ohio ) ; or , more gravely , as an exercise that " in the midst of a global war on terrorism [...] clearly emboldens those who would in fact undermine the prospect of democracy " ( David Dreier ( R - California ) , and " an assault against the institutions of our representative democracy " by the " X - Files wing " of the Democratic Party ( Tom DeLay , R - Texas ) .
Out of this sound and fury there emerged the dim outline of a theory of Democracy - as - Confidence - Trick -- according to which criticism must be silenced because , as House Majority Whip Roy Blunt ( R - Missouri ) put it ,
" Every time we attack the process , we cast that doubt on that fabric of democracy that is so important .
People do have to have confidence that the process works in a proper way .
They do n't need to believe that it is absolutely perfect because after all it's the greatest democracy in the history of the world .
And it 's run by people who step forward and make a system work in ways that nobody would believe until they see it [... ] . "
Take away the pseudo - democratic pieties , and what 's left as sub - text is a simpler message .
In the laconic formulation of Ric Keller ( R - Florida ) : " Get over it . " [ 32 ]
An overwhelming majority in Congress was anxious to do just that .
Ohio's Electoral College votes , together with those from all the other states , were ratified by votes of 267 to 31 in the House of Representatives , and 74 to 1 in the Senate .
What , exactly , were these large majorities agreeing to " get over " ?
Residual stirrings of anger -- or possibly , on the Republican side , of conscience -- over the fact that for the second time in a row a presidential election has been marked by appalling levels of corruption and fraud ?
Ah , but while Al Gore won the popular vote nationwide in the 2000 election by some 540,000 votes -- and would , it seems , have won Florida too , had the Supreme Court not intervened to stop the vote count , by as many as 23,000 votes [ 33 ] -- are n't things different this time ?
Ohio this time may have been a mess -- no one 's " absolutely perfect , " even in " the greatest democracy in the history of the world " -- but did n't George W. Bush win the nationwide popular vote in November 2004 by several million votes ?
Do you really think so ?
How interesting .
How -- let me borrow a term from the lexicon of George W. Bush 's newly confirmed Attorney General , Alberto Gonzales - - how " quaint . "
* * *
Ohio was the swing state of swing states on November 2nd , 2004 , the one whose twenty Electoral College votes decided the outcome of the U.S. presidential election .
It is therefore a matter of some significance that the testimonial evidence of corruption in the Ohio election is corroborated by statistical evidence which shows the election in this state -- and nationwide -- to have been not just corrupt , but stolen .
The evidence in both categories is massively complex .
But thanks to the no less massive analytical labours over the past two months of citizen pro-democracy activists , of social scientists , of mathematicians and statisticians , of computer programmers , and of alternative - media investigative journalists , it can nonetheless be conveniently summarized .
You want smoking guns ?
Here they are , starting with the evidence that John F. Kerry , and not George W. Bush , won the state of Ohio .
1. Uncounted punch - card and provisional ballots .
Well over 13,000 Ohio provisional ballots were never counted , and 92,672 regular punch - card ballots were set aside by vote - counting machines as indicating no choice for president .
Thus , even after Ohio 's supposed recount , a total of over 106,000 ballots remained uncounted -- though there was " no legal reason for not inspecting and counting each of these ballots . " [ 34 ]
But there seems to have been a very good political reason for not doing so : the uncounted ballots came disproportionately from places like the cities of Cincinnati , Cleveland and Akron , all of which voted overwhelmingly for the Democrats .
2 . Fraud through default settings on touch - screen voting machines .
Some 15 percent of Ohio's votes were cast using the new touch - screen voting machines .
In the city of Youngstown , in Mahoning County , there were repeated complaints about what election observers referred to as " vote flipping " by the ES&S Ivotronic touch - screen machines used there .
This " flipping " phenomenon , also widely observed in other states , typically appeared to poll watchers " like a mere computer glitch , no different than a super market checkout machine that records an incorrect price for lettuce . " [ 35 ]
But what was happening , in the vast majority of cases , was no " glitch . "
As Dom Stasi notes , " The laws of probability demand that multiple random errors trend toward even distribution , but only if they are truly errors . " [ 36 ]
Yet in all of the published accounts of vote flipping , the " errors " consistently favoured Bush : voters who were trying to vote for Kerry found their votes being given to Bush , transferred to third - party candidates , or simply erased . [ 37 ]
The Chairman of the Mahoning County Board of Elections is reported to have stated that " 20 to 30 machines [...] needed to be recalibrated during the voting process . " [ 38 ]
He is not quoted as saying that any action was taken , or could be taken , to compensate for the machines ' one - way errors -- and there is evidence that many other machines were left uncorrected .
It is clearly not the case , as one Youngstown poll worker claimed , that the repeated anomalies were due to the machines being " temperamental . "
A supermarket checkout machine does n't charge ten dollars for a tin of sardines because it 's having a bad hair day : it does so because that 's what it has been ( perhaps mistakenly ) programmed to charge .
Similarly , ES&S machines flipped votes from Kerry to Bush because , as Richard Hayes Phillips proposes , they had been given " preselected default settings " that made them do so .
And if they flipped votes in an apparently " temperamental " manner , ' acting up ' only for every fourth or fifth or tenth voter , that would be a sign , not of electronic hissy fits , but of their having been programmed to move at preset intervals to the default setting .
One of the six machines in Youngstown 's precinct 5G appears to have had a default setting for no vote at all .
It may have been single - handedly responsible for the fact that nearly 14 percent of the ballots cast in this precinct ( where the votes were running in Kerry 's favour in a ratio of 12 to 1 ) were " undervotes , " that is , votes cast with no preference for president . [ 39 ]
Elsewhere , the subtler effect of many machines moving at intervals to their default settings would have been a gently tidal lifting of the Republican vote tallies by thousands of stolen votes . [ 40 ]
3. ' Ghost ' absentee voters in Trumbull County .
What appears to be a similar effect of widely diffused fraud came to light in Trumbull County when Dr. Werner Lange undertook the labour of inspecting 106 of the county 's precinct poll books .
Among the absentee votes listed in these books he found a total of 580 apparent ' ghost ' votes -- that is , " absentee votes for which there were no absentee voters identified . "
In other words , there were on average 5.5 faked absentee votes in each of the precinct books he checked .
The number may not seem significant , but this level of faked absentee votes , if it turned out to have been reproduced across the state of Ohio , would have resulted in a total of over 62,000 faked votes . [ 41 ]
Just how widespread this particular form of cheating was we may never know , since it appears that in many counties the electoral data is now being destroyed .
Lange 's evidence has been challenged by Russ Baker , who in a study financed by " the Investigative Fund of the Nation Institute " describes himself as " an old - style investigative reporter . "
The ' investigation ' in this instance did n't go beyond accepting the explanation of a Trumbull County official " that the poll books Lange looked at had been printed before absentee voting ended -- including those who voted in the final days before the election at the Board 's offices .
The books would -- according to practice - - be updated to include everyone . " [ 42 ]
But the investigator , bless his gum shoes , seems not to have understood what is at issue .
Lange writes that his study " would have been completed weeks earlier if Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell [...] had not unlawfully ordered all 88 boards of elections to prevent public inspection of poll books until after the certification of the vote . "
In other words , much if not all of his inspection of poll books was carried out after the official certification of the Ohio vote on December 6th -- and thus more than a month after election day .
When , if not at the time their votes were recorded , does Baker imagine that the identities of absentee voters would be recorded in the poll books ?
4. Implausible voter turnout figures .
In Franklin County , which includes the city of Columbus , voter turnout figures in the 125 precincts won by Bush were on average nearly 10 percent higher than in the 346 precincts won by Kerry : the median turnout in Bush precincts was 60.56 percent ; in Kerry precincts it was 50.78 percent . [ 43 ]
Though the wide turnout differences here and in Ohio's other largely urban counties may be ascribed in large part to Kenneth Blackwell 's vote - suppression tactics , including the partisan misallocation of voting machines , they have also raised suspicions that large numbers of Kerry votes went unrecorded .
These suspicions are strengthened by the certified reports from pro-Kerry Cleveland , in Cuyahoga County , of precincts with turnouts of as few as 22.31 percent ( precinct 6B ) , 21.43 percent ( 13O ) , 20.07 percent ( 13 F ) , 14.59 percent ( 13D ) , and 7.85 percent ( 6C ) of the registered voters . [ 44 ]
Thousands of people in these precincts lined up for many hours in the rain in order , it would appear , not to vote .
Meanwhile , in pro-Bush Perry County , the voting records certified by Secretary of State Blackwell included two precincts with reported turnouts of 124.4 and 124.0 percent of the registered voters , while in pro-Bush Miami County , there were precincts whose certified turnouts , if not physically impossible , were only slightly less improbable . [ 45 ]
These and other instances of implausibly high turnouts in precincts won by Bush , and implausibly low turnouts in precincts won by Kerry , are strongly suggestive of widespread tampering with the vote- tabulation processes .
Similarly anomalous patterns of differences in voter turnout have been detected by Richard Hayes Phillips in Lucas County , which includes the city of Toledo .
In this case , the story has a piquant twist : thieves broke into Lucas County Democratic Headquarters on the night of October 12th , and stole computers containing all of the party 's local organizing and get - out - the - vote plans .
It comes as no surprise that vote - tabulation manipulations in Toledo -- and election - day vote - suppression efforts as well - - appear to have been particularly well - focused . [ 46 ]
5. Vote -tabulation fraud in Miami County .
The fact that Miami County reported two successive sets of returns on election night attracted suspicion from the start .
The county 's initial figures , with 100 percent of the precincts reporting , seemed improbably low , with 31,620 votes cast -- only about three - quarters as many as in the 2000 election .
But the second total , when it came in late on election night , seemed improbably high - - 50,235 votes cast altogether -- as well as being peculiarly tidy in two respects : John Kerry 's share of the vote remained , to one - hundredth of one percent , exactly what it had been in the first set of returns ( 33.92 percent ) ; and George W. Bush was shown to have won the county by exactly 16,000 votes .
The final certified figures ( which include 1,542 provisional ballots added to the total ) provided further surprises .
In a county whose population had increased by only 1.38 percent since 2000 , the number of votes cast rose by a whopping 20.86 percent .
Bush 's margin of victory over Kerry in the county was larger by 7.3 percent than his margin of victory over Gore had been in 2000 , meaning either that the county swung strongly in Bush 's favour , or else that he succeeded in capturing an overwhelming proportion -- well over 90 percent -- of the nearly 9,000 additional voters .
A third possibility also presents itself : namely , that a substantial number of the people who voted for George Bush in Miami County in 2004 do not in fact exist .
Richard Hayes Phillips proposes that the Miami County returns are riddled with fraud -- sometimes rather sloppy fraud , as when the precincts of Concord South and Concord South West reported voter turnouts of 94.27 and 98.55 percent respectively , while in adjoining Concord South East the turnout amounted to only 56.55 percent of registered voters . [ 47 ]
( The Concord South West turnout figure means , by the way , that only ten registered voters failed to vote -- though more than that number of voters in the precinct have signed affidavits testifying that they did not vote . ) [ 48 ]
6. Vote -tabulation fraud in Warren , Butler , Clermont ( and other ) Counties .
There is strong evidence of large - scale vote - tabulation fraud in these three contiguous and traditionally Republican counties in southwestern Ohio .
The comparisons between the 2000 and 2004 figures that Richard Hayes Phillips provides are instructive .
In Warren County ,
the population increased by 14.75 % , the number of registered voters increased by 29.66 % , voter turnout increased by 33.55 % , Bush 's point spread increased from 42.24 % to 44.58 % , and Bush 's victory margin increased from 29,176 votes to 41,124 votes .
In Clermont County [ ... ] , the population increased by 4.39 % , the number of registered voters increased by 10.20 % , voter turnout increased by 24.86 % , Bush 's point spread increased from 37.50 % to 41.69 % , and Bush 's victory margin increased from 26,202 votes to 36,376 votes .
In Butler County [ ... ] , the population increased by 3.12 % , the number of registered voters increased by 10.06 % , voter turnout increased by 18.18 % , Bush 's point spread increased from 29.40 % to 32.52 % , and Bush 's victory margin increased from 40,197 votes to 52,550 votes . [ 49 ]
These figures are vehemently to be suspected , not least because of the election - night " lock - down " of the Warren County administrative building -- an event which may suggest that the team responsible for ensuring that Bush 's
Ohio vote tallies added up to a convincing victory was at work behind those locked doors , and did n't want their earnest meditations to be disturbed by election observers , journalists , or ' terrorists ' of any kind .
At the precinct level , dubious figures throughout these three counties cry out for detailed investigation .
For example , in Butler County 's St. Clair Township , where voter turnout rose by 8.27 percent , Kerry received exactly 10.00 percent fewer votes than Gore had in 2000 ; while in two precincts of Liberty Township ( which accounted for a quarter of the purported increase in Bush 's margin of victory in Butler County , the numbers of registered voters are said to have risen since 2000 from 660 to 1,834 ( an increase of 177.9 percent ) and from 596 to 1,451 ( an increase of 143.5 percent ) .
A more distinct marker of fraud is the fact that in all three counties C. Ellen Connally , a comparatively little - known African - American municipal judge from Cleveland who was running as a Democrat for the position of Chief Justice against a well - funded Republican incumbent , Thomas Moyer , received significantly more votes than did the Kerry - Edwards ticket -- in Butler County , 5,347 more , and in Clermont County , 4,146 more votes .
As Congressman John Conyers and his colleagues emphasized in their letter of December 2nd to Secretary of State Blackwell , this is a bizarre anomaly :
" Have you examined how an underfunded Democratic State Supreme Court candidate could receive so many more votes in Butler County than the Kerry - Edwards ticket ?
If so , could you provide us with the results of your examination ?
Is there any precedent in Ohio for a downballot candidate receiving on a percentage or absolute basis so many more votes than the presidential candidate of the same party in this or any other presidential election ?
Please let us know if any other County in Ohio registered such a disparity on a percentage or absolute basis . " [ 50 ]
Blackwell , needless to say , did not respond to these questions .
But as Conyers and his researchers went on to discover for themselves , the obscure Judge Connally did in fact out - poll the Democratic presidential candidate in seven other Ohio counties : Auglaize , Brown , Darke , Highland , Mercer , Miami , and Putnam Counties . [ 51 ]
If this " disparity " of Connally out - polling Kerry is a sign that Kerry votes were being discarded or switched to Bush through vote - tabulation fraud in Butler , Clermont and Warren Counties , then it is also a marker of electoral fraud in these other counties as well .
7 . Doing the sums : one analyst 's estimate .
After conducting precinct - by - precinct analyses of statistical anomalies in the election results " in fifteen Ohio counties accounting for 62 % of the registered voters in the state , " Richard Hayes Phillips determined that , on a conservative estimate , " the reported margin of victory for George W. Bush in the State of Ohio is inflated by 101,020 votes . "
This estimate , in addition to being conservative , is also incomplete .
Phillips remarks that " These studies were conducted under time constraints and with such evidence as Ohio officials were willing to provide .
Even in the counties that I have analyzed , I have examined only certain aspects of a well - orchestrated and multi-faceted plan to undermine democracy in Ohio . "
Emphasizing , in conclusion , that he has yet to analyze the data from seventy - three of Ohio 's eighty - eight counties , Phillips implies that the manifold forms of electoral fraud and vote suppression identified were sufficient to divert to Bush what would have been , in a clean election , a clear Kerry victory . [ 52 ]
8. Cuyahoga County : other kinds of fraud .
In moving on to evidence beyond that which Richard Hayes Phillips took into account , I need first to explain one very large - scale false alarm .
The election results published by Cuyahoga County ( which includes the city of Cleveland ) led a number of commentators in November 2004 - - myself among them -- to believe that there had been massive ' ghost - voting ' fraud in the suburbs of Cleveland . [ 53 ]
But the official lists showing twenty - nine communities with voter turnout figures of more than 100 percent ( and hence some 93,000 ' ghost votes ' in the county ) turned out to result from a bizarrely structured software program that grouped communities in the same congressional , house and state senate districts , and added the total number of absentee ballots within the combined districts to the voter turnout figures for each community in these districts - though not to the vote totals for candidates or issues . [ 54 ]
This programming oddity worked , the County 's website idiotically declared , in " even- numbered years . "
What its intended function might have been is hard to say .
It could have been a piece of innocent stupidity , or the residue of an abandoned ghost - voting scheme -- or even a Karl Rovian fool - catcher , designed to set the blogosphere alight with easily extinguished flames .
But other , more subtle , forms of electoral corruption now appear to have been detected in the Cuyahoga County returns .
As may have been observed , the statistically - informed analyses of Richard Hayes Phillips are open to the objection that some of his judgments are , in the end , no more than subjective .
Many of the anomalies he swings at are , without question , home - run pitches : the voter turnout figures in Concord , Miami County , for example , amount to a fast ball over the plate that Phillips hits over the back fence .
In other instances , as in Warren County and the adjoining counties of southwestern Ohio , his analyses are corroborated by evidence like the Judge Connally disparity .
There may be further cases , though , in which a skeptical reader might well ask for firmer evidence of fraud than one analyst's " professional judgment . "
Two recently published studies of the Cuyahoga County data appear to offer methods of analysis that could be usefully applied to the election returns from other Ohio counties -- and , quite possibly , from other states as well .
The first establishes the likelihood that what observers thought to be mere incompetence in the conduct of the election in Cleveland was actually a deliberately designed feature intended to throw large numbers of votes from Kerry to Bush ; the second , if its " reverse - engineering " programming analysis can be confirmed , would show that a significant number of the official precinct vote - tallies in this county -- and perhaps in many others -- were fraudulently generated by a hacker .
James Q. Jacobs ' still ongoing work with the Cuyahoga County data reveals a significant connection between two apparently disparate features of the election : the fact that odd and wholly implausible clumps of votes in certain precincts went to third - party candidates in a manner that some observers have thought must point to computer hacking ; and the fact , noted with frustration by many voters and election - day observers , that in many instances the same polling place was used for two or more voting precincts , and that because of inadequate or nonexistent precinct labeling , significant numbers of voters found themselves in the wrong line - ups .
Jacobs demonstrates a connection between the two : the anomalous third - party votes arose from the fact that the punch - card ballots given to voters in adjoining precincts listed the presidential candidates in different sequences .
What he calls " precinct cross- voting " led to many ballots being counted by machines that were coded to attribute punch - marks in a manner differing from the printed sequence of candidates ' names on the ballots .
As Jacobs ' detailed and statistically sophisticated analysis shows , the result was a steady diversion of votes from Kerry , the candidate favoured by an overwhelming majority of Cleveland voters , to Bush and to third - party candidates . [ 55 ]
What at first seems no more than spectacularly incompetent election design appears , on reflection , more likely to have been intended to produce exactly this effect .
But if the clumps of third - party votes seem not to have been the result of hackers moving votes about and leaving some of them parked with third - party candidates , that does n't mean that hacking was not taking place .
Another analysis that may have wide potential applicability has been published at the Democratic Underground website by a computer programmer who claims to have special expertise in the reverse - engineering of calculations , and who goes by the blogger cognomen of ' 59 sunburst . '
( Because this analysis has been anonymously published -- and because , moreover , I have been unable to activate the author 's link to a field of supporting data -- I present it with due reservations , in the hope that those possessing programming expertise may be able to critically assess its validity . )
Finding it curious that in 46 Cuyahoga County precincts George Bush received the same number of votes in 2004 as in 2000 , while only in 12 precincts did John Kerry receive the same number of votes that Al Gore did in 2000 , ' 59sunburst ' speculated that Bush 's 2000 numbers in each precinct might somehow have been used " as a benchmark for altering the results of 2004 " -- with a putative hacker 's goal being to ensure that Bush 's 2000 level of support was either maintained or enhanced .
' 59 sunburst ' was able to develop a quite simple mathematical formula which made it possible " to calculate Kerry 's and Bush 's 2004 totals for over 400 precincts using Bush 's 2000 numbers and a randomizing factor " ; this formula , s/he claims , works both for the preliminary results published on November 8th and the final results published by Cuyahoga County 's Board of Elections on November 30th .
After demonstrating , with figures from Cleveland precinct 1 M , how the formula generates Bush 's and Kerry 's 2004 vote tallies for both the November 8th and the November 30th reports out of the Bush 2000 vote count and the number of votes cast in 2004 , ' 59sunburst ' anticipates the obvious objection :
If you throw the right randomizing factor into such a calculation , " you can make anything come out the way you want it to . "
True -- but it appears that someone was indeed making things come out the way he wanted to on election night .
For , as it happens , Cleveland precinct 1N -- the very next one on the list -- requires the very same " randomizing factor " as precinct 1M ( Factor : 0.0618 ) for the formula to work .
The same phenomenon recurs repeatedly with other pairs ( or triplets ) of consecutively listed precincts : Cleveland 6G and 6H ( Factor : 0.005 ) , Cleveland 10D and 10E ( Factor : 0.024 ) , Cleveland Heights 3C and 3D ( Factor : 0.0267 ) , East Cleveland 2E and 2 F ( Factor : 0.0263 ) , East Cleveland 2H and 3A ( Factor : 0.0241 ) , East Cleveland 3B , 3C , and 3D ( Factor : 0.0158 ) , and so on . [ 56 ]
If the " randomizing factor " numbers were different in each precinct , or only randomly coincided , there would be no reason to suspect a hacker 's presence .
What gives the game away is the reappearance of the same numbers in successive precincts -- an obvious economizing of effort on the part of a hacker whose sticky fingerprints on the Cuyahoga County returns are made visible by that very fact .
The effects of this hacking appear to have been substantial : in the first pair of precincts discussed by ' 59sunburst ' alone , Bush 's tally rose from 2 votes in 2000 to 23 in 2004 ( precinct 1M ) , and from 2 votes in 2000 to 32 in 2004 ( precinct 1N ) .
8. The Ohio exit poll .
The November 2nd exit poll showed with some clarity the scale of the Republican Party 's electoral fraud in Ohio .
When I gathered the Ohio exit poll data from CNN 's website at 7:32 p.m. EST on election day , women voters ( 53 percent of the total ) were reported as favouring Kerry over Bush by 53 percent to 47 percent , while male voters ( 47 percent of the total ) preferred Kerry over Bush by 51 percent to 49 percent .
The exit poll thus showed Kerry winning Ohio by a margin of 4.2 percent , with 52.1 percent of the vote to Bush 's 47.9 percent . [ 57 ]
According to the official vote tally , however , George W. Bush carried Ohio with 51 percent of the vote to John Kerry 's 48.5 percent -- with a winning margin , that is , of 2.5 percent .
( Subsequent adjustments to the tally as absentee and provisional ballots were counted cut the margin of victory from 2.5 to 2 percent . )
But do exit polls mean anything at all ?
According to the collective wisdom of political pundits in the U.S. corporate media , the Ohio exit poll -- like the national exit poll , which showed John Kerry , not George W. Bush , winning the popular vote nationwide by a margin of 2.56 percent [ 58 ] -- must simply have been wrong .
Set aside the fact that professionally conducted exit polls have been repeatedly shown to have a high degree of accuracy ( significantly higher than that of any other kind of polling ) .
Set aside the fact that the 2004 polls were conducted with elaborate professional care by one of the most highly respected pollsters in the business .
Set aside as well the very peculiar fact that all of the divergences between exit polls and vote tallies in the swing states in the 2004 election favoured George W. Bush - - often by amounts far outside the statistical margins of error -- and the further fact that none of the ( frankly implausible ) explanations put forward to deal with this statistical anomaly have been supported by the smallest shred of evidence . [ 59 ]
Perhaps we should also avoid any mention of the high - toned denunciations of electoral fraud delivered by George W. Bush , Colin Powell , and Republican Senators Richard Lugar and John McCain following the second - round presidential election in Ukraine on November 21st , 2004 .
For what was the key evidence adduced in this chorus of denunciations ?
And why were these Republican statesmen threatening Ukraine with diplomatic isolation and economic penalties if the election results were allowed to stand ?
Because there was a wide divergence in Ukraine between the exit polls , which gave Viktor Yushchenko a commanding lead , and the official vote tally , according to which the election was narrowly won by his pro-Russian rival , Viktor Yanukovich .
Those who have not yet wholly averted their eyes from the matter might want to note that the divergence between the second - round vote tally in Ukraine and what seems to be the more trustworthy of the second - round Ukrainian exit polls was 6.2 percent . [ 60 ]
By an odd coincidence , the divergence between the exit poll result and the final vote tally in Ohio was exactly the same : 6.2 percent .
* * *
If George W. Bush did n't win the vote tally in Ohio - - and the evidence that he did n't is cumulatively overwhelming -- then he did n't properly win the Electoral College vote either .
And the popular vote ?
For the sake of completeness , and of decency , let 's briefly lay to rest the idea that some tattered shreds of democratic legitimacy can be reclaimed for Bush 's presidency through the pretense that he must , after all , have won the popular vote on November 2nd .
I am not going to rehearse here any part of the rapidly accumulating body of analyses that shows Republican electoral fraud to have been carried out in many other states from coast to coast with much the same energy and inventiveness as in Ohio . [ 61 ]
For as the mathematician who posts his analyses of exit poll data at the Democratic Underground site under the name ' TruthIsAll ' has intimated , and as Dr. Steven F. Freeman has shown in a major new study which he has kindly shared with me in draft form , there is a simpler way of showing that , in the big picture , the numbers which underlie Bush 's supposed victory in the popular vote simply do n't add up . [ 62 ]
In comparison to the election of 2000 , there were two dramatic changes in 2004 : an increase of some 14 percent in the total number of votes cast ( which rose from 105,405,000 in 2000 to 120,255,000 in 2004 ) , and a significant decline in the proportion of votes cast for third - party candidates ( which sank from 3,949,000 in 2000 to 1,170,000 in 2004 ) .
According to the national exit poll data made available by CNN on the evening of November 2nd , 83 percent of those who voted in 2004 had also voted in 2000 .
This means , in slightly different terms , that nearly 100 million people who voted in 2000 , or close to 95 percent of the 2000 voters , also cast ballots in 2004 . [ 63 ]
In the 2004 exit poll , 13,047 randomly selected respondents stated that they had voted as follows :
Bush Kerry Gore 2000 voters : 8 % 91 % Bush 2000 voters : 90 % 10 % Other 2000 voters : 17 % 64 % New voters : 41 % 57 %
Al Gore , remember , won the popular vote in 2000 by almost 544,000 votes ( 50,999,897 votes to George Bush 's 50,456,002 ) .
Assuming that the 8 percent of Gore voters who migrated to Bush 's camp in 2004 more or less cancel out the 10 percent of Bush - 2000 voters who swung to Kerry , one can take the base number of supporters for Bush and Kerry in 2004 as amounting to 95 percent of the Republican and Democratic presidential vote tallies in 2000 - - or , in round numbers , 48.4 million votes for Kerry and 47.9 million votes for Bush .
If 95 percent of the 3,949,000 who voted for third - party candidates in 2000 also voted in 2004 , then given that 64 percent of these people voted for Kerry and 17 percent for Bush , that , in round numbers , would add 2.3 million votes to Kerry 's expected total and 600,000 to Bush 's , raising them to 50.7 million for Kerry and 48.5 million for Bush .
Add in the 20.2 million new voters , 57 percent of whose ballots , according to the exit poll , went to Kerry , and 41 percent to Bush .
That means 11.5 million additional votes for Kerry , and 8.3 million additional votes for Bush .
The final expected total comes out to 62.2 million votes for Kerry , and 56.8 million expected votes for Bush .
Compare these numbers to the official results : 61,194,773 votes ( or 51 percent of the total votes cast ) for George W. Bush , and 57,890,314 ( or 48 percent ) for John Kerry .
The discrepancies are striking : Bush appears to have received 4.4 million more votes than he should have , and Kerry 4.3 million fewer than he should have .
The magic -- as Congressman Peter King , whom I quoted at the outset , evidently understood -- is in the counting .
As a large and growing body of evidence makes clear , the official tallies of the 2004 presidential election are to an unprecedented degree distorted by fraud , much of it carried out through widespread and systematic tampering with electronic vote - tabulation machines .
There is , of course , another magic as well , whose secrets reside in all the manifold ways of not counting .
In December 2000 , Dr. Rebecca Mercuri , a leading expert in issues of electronic voting - technology security , together with Curtis Gans , director of the nonpartisan Committee for the Study of the American Electorate , estimated that at least two million of the ballots cast in that year 's presidential election never got counted .
In the words of the journalists who reported this estimate : " That would disenfranchise a city the size of Houston . " [ 64 ]
How large a city has been disenfranchised this time round , if in Ohio alone 106,000 ballots went uncounted ?
And finally , there is the shabbiest magic of all -- the magic of the corporate - media hacks and think - tank trolls , whose collective mission it is to conjure away the most glaring evidence , normalize the abnormal , and twist or bludgeon critical thinking into conformity .
* * *
What this adds up to , I have suggested in my title , is the death of American democracy .
A strange death , because so many Americans , for good reasons and for bad , refuse to acknowledge that it has taken place .
The good reasons -- those of the many thousand pro-democracy activists who remain fiercely attached to the rights and freedoms that are theirs by inheritance and struggle , who have uncovered through patient study the details of the theft , and who are seeking through firm public action to reassert the dignity and reclaim the stolen voices of those many hundreds of thousands of their fellow citizens deliberately abjected and silenced by fraud -- these one must honour .
One can honour as well the activists ' wit and their defiant good humour -- evident , for example , in the placards carried in a demonstration in Denver on November 11th ( Remembrance Day , in this country ) :
" Dude , Where Did My Vote Go ? " " Vote Free or Die Bold " " Correct Electile Dysfunction " " Corporations Cannot Run Elections " " The Computer Ate My Vote ! " " The Fox is Guarding the Voting Coop " " I Do Not Concede . " [ 65 ]
But let 's be realistic about what it means when , with the willing complicity of all the major outlets of the corporate media , a single corporatist party controls the executive functions of the central government , including all of the security apparatus of a thoroughly militarized state , both houses of the legislature , and the judiciary -- and what it means when this same party , having acquired executive power in 2000 through electoral fraud and a judicial coup d'état , and having confirmed its control of the legislature through the corrupt midterm elections of 2002 , then provides a convincing demonstration in 2004 of its power to turn what should have been a landslide electoral defeat into a dubious but effectively unassailable victory .
It might be suggested that the leader himself , in his inverted Orwellian manner , gave fair warning of what the public could anticipate in his second presidential election .
One of the most rightly celebrated of all ' Bushisms ' was delivered in September 2002 to an audience in Nashville , Tennessee : " There 's an old saying in Tennessee - - I know it 's in Texas , probably in Tennessee - - that says , fool me once , shame on -- shame on you .
Fool me -- you can't get fooled again . " [ 66 ]
Really ?
Why on earth not ?
* * *
For now at least , the forms of a democratic republic remain in place -- as , in a parallel way , the residual forms of the Roman Republic remained in place well after its devolution into a militarized imperial autocracy .
One of the early emperors , Tiberius , got sadistic pleasure out of writing deferential letters to the Roman Senate , humbly requesting the terrorized senators ' direction and advice .
( It is not recorded , though others of his missives had a similarly noxious effect , that he ever went so far as to have the envelopes dusted -- did the Romans use envelopes ? -- with weaponized anthrax . ) [ 67 ]
Tiberius 's successor , known to history by the fond nickname , Caligula , given him by the Roman legionaries , likewise held the Senate in high esteem : he is said to have planned to have his horse -- or was it his donkey ? -- elected to that august body . [ 68 ]

I would recommend analysis of the following Cleveland precincts , where the astonishingly low numbers of registered voters in the Cuyahoga County electoral returns creates suspicion of purging : 5U ( 30 registered voters ) , 6E ( 21 voters ) , 6X ( 83 voters ) , 13Y ( 56 voters ) , 13Z ( 53 voters ) , 14C ( 13 voters ) , 14D ( 7 voters ) , 16C ( 51 voters ) , 18B ( 58 voters ) , and 19A ( 19 voters ) .

According to a lawsuit filed on December 30th by the Green and Libertarian parties , the selection of sample precincts was non-random in 17 counties ( see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_U.S._presidential_election_controversy_and_irregularities ) .

The December 30th lawsuit filed by the Green and Libertarian parties lists five counties in which tabulating - machine tampering was carried out by Triad , and one in which the tampering was carried out by a Diebold technician .
25 The December 30th lawsuit filed by the Green and Libertarian parties lists six counties in which , despite sample - recount discrepancies , the Board of Elections refused to conduct full recounts .
Two flagrant cases of impropriety in the recount are narrated in Preserving Democracy : What Went Wrong in Ohio , C.5.b : " Irregularities in Applying the Full Hand - Count Requirement " :
" In Monroe County , the 3 % hand - count failed to match the machine count twice .
Subsequent runs on that machine matched neither each other nor the hand count .
The Monroe County Board of Elections summoned a repairman from Triad to bring a new machine and the recount was suspended and reconvened for the following day .
On the following day , a new machine was present at the Board of Elections office and the old machine was gone .
The Board conducted a test run followed by the 3 % hand - counted ballots .
The results matched this time and the Board conducted the remainder of the recount by machine . "
" In Fairfield County , the hand recount of the 3 % test sample did not match the machine count , even after two attempts .
The Board suspended the recount and stated that Secretary Blackwell recommended that the recount should begin again ' from scratch . '
The Green recount observers were then told that it was 4:00 PM , the building was closed , and all had to leave .
The Republican recount observers , however , were allowed to stay in a conference room for an additional ten minutes or so for a private discussion .
When the Board reconvened a few days later , it announced that it would be conducting a machine count of the county 's votes .
When a Green Party observer objected , she was told by the Board that she was not allowed to speak . "

The figures first released after the election , before there had been a partial counting of provisional ballots , were still more shocking : 7.1 percent ( Cleveland 6C ) , 13.05 percent ( 13D ) , 19.6 percent ( 13 F ) , 21.01 percent ( 13O ) , and 21.8 percent ( 6B ) .
Cleveland precinct 10L was initially reported as having a 24.72 percent turnout -- a figure which rose in the certified results to a 56.21 percent turnout .
Perhaps by some accident all of the provisional and absentee ballots cast in this precinct were counted .

57 It is important to distinguish between these exit poll figures and the altered Ohio figures which were posted by CNN at 1:41 a.m. EST on November 3rd ; these showed women voters splitting 50 - 50 in their preferences for Kerry and Bush , and men supporting Bush over Kerry by 52 to 49 percent .
One must also distinguish , in the national exit poll , between the figures available at 9:00 p.m. EST on November 2nd , which show Kerry leading by nearly 3 percent , and the revised figures posted at 1:36 a.m. EST on November 3rd , which showed a 5 percent swing to Bush .
Richard Morin's claim that the later national figures were based on " later interviewing " that found Bush in the lead ( " New Woes Surface in Use of Estimates , " The Washington Post [ 4 November 2004 ] : A29 ) is demonstrably incorrect .
As was immediately apparent from comparison of respondent numbers and percentage preferences , and as has since been acknowledged by the pollsters , these later figures were conflated with the vote tally percentages .

63 On demographic grounds one would expect that over a four - year period more than five percent of the voters active in 2000 would have moved on to cast their ballots in a better world .
A demographically - inflected estimate would increase the number of new voters in 2004 -- but since this would also increase Kerry 's numbers at the expense of Bush 's , I will hold to the exit - poll figure .

67 What may seem a particularly sour joke is perhaps no joke at all .
The identity of the person who carried out terrorist anthrax - letter attacks in the United States in September and October 2001 remains unknown .
However , the attacks were clearly intended to intimidate the Democratic opposition and the media : they targeted two leading Democratic members of the U.S. Senate , Senator Tom Daschle ( D - South Dakota ) and Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - Vermont ) , as well as major media outlets .
Moreover , the anthrax was of the Ames strain , and came from a U.S. defence - biowarfare source ; and there is strong evidence to indicate that FBI investigation of the anthrax attacks has been blocked as a result of high - level political interference .

Most of us know how important exercise is when it comes to staying fit and healthy .
Despite that , however , not all of us are moving as much as we ’re supposed to .
Even when I have been motivated to get a gym membership and start exercising , it only lasts for a few months .
At the first sign of stress and deadlines at work , the gym routine gets kicked off the list .
So , here are a few tricks on how to live a more active lifestyle :
Park far away
Get into the habit of parking a block away or parking at the farthest parking spot .
If you are grocery shopping , park in the store ’s lot but choose the back row .
Clearly , you would n’t want to be caught pushing a shopping cart down the street trying to get to your car .
Take the stairs instead of elevators
If it is one or two floors , always take the stairs .
If you need to go up or down several floors , then take the stairs to two floors above or below and then take the elevator .
As you get used to it , increase the number of floors you use the stairs for .
If you park in a level parking lot , always park in one of the higher levels and walk down .
If possible , walk or bike to work
This is not possible for everyone , but if you live in a place where the pollution is less and your workplace is relatively close by , then choose to walk or bike instead of driving .
Skip the stop
If your city has a subway or bus system , skip your stop and get off at the one after ( or before ) and then walk from there .
You ’ll get to enjoy the air and neighborhood a little while increasing your heart rate .
Maximize the benefits from your grocery trip
When you go to the grocery store , make it a habit to walk the entire store .
Go through every aisle and every nook and corner .
Avoid the aisles that could tempt you to pick up junk food though , since that can completely obliterate any benefits of walking a few extra steps !
Take a short walk - break at work
Again , this one depends on your work location , but ours is located outside the city and is on large private grounds .
Every afternoon a couple of us go for a short walk which takes roughly 15 - 20 minutes .
It is very invigorating and a nice break from the afternoon routine .
Do your own yard work
This is a good one for summer time when the lawn starts to grow and you need to keep it trimmed .
Instead of hiring someone to do it for you , do it yourself .
You will not only get some exercise , but save some money , too !
Play with your kids
Kids these days seem to play more video games than outdoor games like we did when we were younger .
So , take your kids out to the park and throw the ball around or play tag .
Put on your favorite music and dance
This is not only exercise , but also a great way to unwind at the end of a busy day .
And a good trip down the memory lane for those of us who have not done it in a long time !
While watching TV , pace or stretch
Instead of switching channels during the ad break , get up and walk around the house .
Do some lunges or some simple stretching exercises .
If you have stairs in your house , walk up and down the stairs a few times during each ad break for at least one show every day .
Choose to walk down instead of call or email
When you have a question for a colleague , instead of picking up the phone or shooting an email , walk over to their cube .
This will not only provide some exercise but a short break for a quick recharge .
Walk while you talk on the phone
If your job involves talking on the phone a lot , then instead of doing this sitting at your desk , get into the habit of pacing while you talk .
Motion creates emotion so you may even become a better speaker by doing this .
Choose active entertainment over passive entertainment
Instead of going for a movie , choose to go play tennis with some friends ( or at least bowling ) .
Instead of playing regular video games , play with a Wii .
And instead of meeting friends for a cup of coffee , catch up over a sunset walk .
Choose active vacations
When planning vacations , pick something that involves some walking and hiking .
While taking in a new city , do it by walk , instead of driving around .
If golfing , skip the cart .
If staying at a resort , make use of their pool and the exercise facility .
Try skiing and white water rafting .

While none of these will make an immediate difference in your life style , over a period of time , they will get you into the habit of choosing an active alternative to the every day things you do .
In the long run , that can set the stage for an even more active life style .

( CNN ) -- Suspected killer Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean is most likely in Mexico , authorities said , and the prosecutor said he has agreed not to seek the death penalty if Laurean is arrested in that country .
Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean , wanted for murder , may have fled to his native Mexico .
Onslow County , North Carolina , District Attorney Dewey Hudson told CNN that he was shown " strongly compelling evidence " compiled by federal authorities that shows Laurean is in Mexico .
Hudson said he has asked through the State Department that Laurean be arrested if he is found in Mexico .
But , he said , he had " no other option " but to take the death penalty off the table if Laurean is found there .
Mexico has a longstanding record of refusing to extradite suspects to the United States if they face a possible death sentence if convicted .
" I had to agree not to seek the death penalty , " Hudson told CNN .
" My hands were tied if I wanted to bring him here to face murder charges . "
" It was very frustrating and disappointing , " Hudson added .
Laurean has been charged with murder in the death of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach .
Her charred remains were found January 11 in a fire pit in Laurean 's backyard .
Investigators found the body after Laurean 's wife came forward with a note her husband had written saying he had buried Lauterbach , who was eight months pregnant , after she slit her own throat during an argument .
Hudson said Laurean apparently entered his native Mexico only days after leaving behind that note .
Hudson would not elaborate on the evidence suggesting Laurean is in Mexico , which he said he viewed Friday .
The FBI would not comment on what evidence it might have that Laurean is across the border .
" We strongly suspect , but have not confirmed , he is in Mexico , " FBI spokesman Newsom Summerlin .
Summerlin said the FBI plans to circulate in Mexico either matchbooks or business cards with Laurean 's photo .
The Marine 's wanted poster is on the FBI 's Most Wanted List with a $ 25,000 reward .
Police believe Lauterbach was killed December 14 , the same day she bought a bus ticket for travel for the following day .
But in the note provided to police by Laurean 's wife , the corporal claimed Lauterbach killed herself December 15 .
Police said an autopsy revealed the pregnant Marine was killed by a blow to the head .
Police said they are analyzing a possible murder weapon provided by an undisclosed witness .
A spokesman told CNN it could several weeks to determine whether it was used to kill Lauterbach .
Laurean 's wife told police about the note January 11 , a day after she said Laurean told her what allegedly happened and following a meeting with a lawyer .
Police describe her as a cooperating witness .
Lauterbach was scheduled to testify last month at a military hearing after accusing Laurean of raping her last spring .
On Monday , the Onslow County sheriff 's office released new photographs of the fire pit in Lauren 's backyard taken just before Lauterbach 's body was discovered January 11 .
Police said some neighbors reported seeing a group of Marines having a Christmas Day barbecue in Laurean 's backyard .
Police also released photographs that show Laurean 's living room and garage with paint cans .
Investigators said they found blood in more than one room of Laurean 's home , some of which was covered by fresh paint .
The sheriff 's office said it has documented evidence Laurean bought paint , concrete blocks and a wheelbarrow at a home improvement store December 16 .
In a store surveillance video , Laurean is seen walking into the store with another man , who has not been identified .
Investigators are also awaiting the results of DNA paternity tests , which they said could take weeks , to tell whether Laurean was the father of Lauterbach 's unborn child .

Friends lobbied for ' Deep Throat ' to head FBI while he was leaking Watergate secrets Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday November 29 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Just - disclosed Nixon files also contain Cheney DUI disclosure Newly released papers from Richard Nixon 's White House files show the now - disgraced former president was urged to appoint Mark Felt -- the man who years later would be revealed as Deep Throat -- as the head of the FBI .
Also included in Nixon 's papers were Dick Cheney 's private acknowledgements that he was twice arrested for drunken driving in the early 1960s .
The vice president " was cited for driving under the influence in Cheyenne , Wyo. , in November 1962 and in Rock Springs , Wyo. , in July 1963 , " while he was a college student ; the disclosures were made in Cheney 's application for a government job , MSNBC reports .
The National Archives released more than 10,000 pages of Nixon documents this week , including letters , postcards and telegrams that were sent as part of a lobbying campaign to see Felt , then the Bureau 's No. 2 official , become FBI director after J. Edgar Hoover 's death , according to the Associated Press .
" He has the integrity , the ability , the experience and the image to insure that our FBI will continue to deserve and maintain world esteem , " Harold L. Child Jr. , legal attache to the embassy in Japan and a 30 - year FBI veteran , told Nixon in an April 1973 letter .
That very same month , Felt called reporter Bob Woodward in the Washington Post newsroom to pass along a tip about then - FBI Director L. Patrick Gray , a Nixon loyalist who replaced Hoover .
Gray resigned that month after it was revealed that he destroyed documents related to the Watergate investigation .
Woodward recounts the phone call in his book The Secret Man , which documented his relationship with his secret source .
About 9:30 p.m. [ on April 26 , 1973 ] my phone at the Post rang .
" Give me a number to call you on , " Mark Felt said .
I gave him a basic city desk line and picked it up myself when the call came in .
" You 've heard the Gray story ? "
Felt said .
" Well , it 's true . "
Felt was confirming early speculation about Gray 's pending resignation .
Over the previous 10 months , Felt , who was at the time in the No. 2 position at the FBI , had passed along scores of tips to Woodward , helping the young reporter and his colleague Carl Bernstein expose the massive corruption within the Nixon White House that became known as Watergate .
It was not until 2005 that Felt unmasked himself as Deep Throat , although Nixon 's secret tape recordings revealed that White House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman suspected Felt was Woodward 's leaker as early as October 1972 .
Felt expected to replace Hoover upon his death earlier that year -- before the Watergate hotel break - in -- but Nixon , whose administration already was engaged in myriad political treacheries , decided against the career FBI officer in favor of loyal Gray .
" As best I could tell Felt was crushed but he put on a good face , " writes Woodward , who first met Felt years earlier while still in the Navy .
Woodward first used Felt as a source for an article he wrote about the assassination attempt aimed at George Wallace , but it was June 19 , 1972 that the pair first spoke about the story that would launch Woodward 's career .
Two days after the Watergate break - in , Felt warned that the case was going to " heat up " and abruptly ended their telephone conversations , according to Woodward 's account .
Over the following weeks and months ,
Felt continued to pass along tidbits of information and guide the young reporter in his efforts to expose the corruption within Nixon 's White House and presidential campaigns .
The two would often meet in the dead of night in an abandoned parking garage , scenes memorably portrayed by Hal Holbrook and Robert Redford in the film adaptation of All the President 's Men .
Felt 's role in exposing Watergate remained a secret to virtually everyone aside from Woodward , Bernstein and the Post editors .
Within the FBI
Felt was well renowned for his years of service and tenacity -- qualities that apparently did n't interest a president trying to shield himself from investigations led by that very agency .
" Mr. Felt is a man of outstanding loyalty , character , reputation , habits , " wrote Efton A. Stanfield in a telegram to Nixon .
The " fidelity , bravery , and integrity of Mr. Felt are unquestioned . "
Felt himself was the lead agent in a telegram sent to the White House by a group of agents asking that a highly qualified professional be nominated .
The police chief in Kodiak , Alaska , made the case for Felt , and so did ordinary citizens .
Writing from Brooklyn , N.Y. , Viena K. Neaville told Nixon that choosing
Felt would be good for him because , " You would be spared the tremendous aggravation to which you are subjected by so many factions . "
Interestingly , Woodward also was the first reporter to reveal Cheney 's alcohol - fueled run-ins with the law , in his 1991 book , The Commanders .
A Cheney spokesman also acknowledged the convictions during the 2000 presidential campaign , just after news broke that one - time alcoholic George W. Bush was arrested on similar charges , according to the Smoking Gun .
Nothing is off - limits when the media wants to attack Democrats :
Things McCain can do when running against Obama that Clinton has been unable to do well or at all :
…. Allow some supporters to risk being accused of using the race card when criticizing Obama … .
Emphasize Barack Hussein Obama ’s unusual name and exotic background through a Manchurian Candidate prism .
The tremendous response to my call for impeachment hearings for Vice President Cheney confirms that the Bush Administration and Vice President Cheney must be held accountable .
I have been overwhelmed by the netroots support for my call for impeachment hearings and for my website - WexlerWantsHearings.com .
As of Monday afternoon - after only four days - over 80,000 people have signed up to show their support for impeachment hearings .
It is the constitutional duty of Congress to investigate the serious charges that have been leveled against Vice President Cheney , and I am using my position as a member of the House Judiciary Committee to see that hearings are held .
Unfortunately , Congress and the national media ignore this serious issue .
The outpouring of support documented at WexlerWantsHearings.com has been driven and supported entirely through the power of blogs , the Internet , and word of mouth .
Websites like Crooks and Liars have taken on this important cause and have stepped up to fill the void left by the main stream media who still somehow believe that impeachment is a fringe idea and not worth coverage .
In this case , the American people are way ahead of Congress and the media .
I was shocked when no newspaper would publish the op -ed I wrote with Rep. Luis Gutierrez ( D - IL ) and Rep. Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) .
It is not every day that three members of the House Judiciary Committee set out a substantive case for impeachment hearings against the sitting Vice President .
Yet , the national media yawned .
No matter .
The people have responded .
Americans from all fifty states have signed up to support my call for hearings .
Originally , my goal was to gain 50,000 online signatures on behalf of impeachment hearings .
Today , our goal is 250,000 supporters .
The charges against Vice President Cheney are too serious dismiss without hearings .
If we band together , we can make focus the nation 's attention on this critical issue .
Let 's continue to make our voices heard .

Joseph Ellis :
A promise of unpredictability
[ Historian Joseph J. Ellis ' latest book is " American Creation : Triumphs and Tragedies at the Founding of the Republic . " ]
The first time an American president 's policies defied all the promises made during his campaign occurred in 1800 .
Thomas Jefferson 's platform called for a reduction of federal , especially executive , power ; fiscal austerity aimed at reducing the national debt ; and strict interpretation of the Constitution .
The opportunity to purchase the Louisiana Territory in 1803 threw all of these Jeffersonian principles into the proverbial cocked hat .
As it turned out , in order to acquire an empire , one had to become an imperial president , and Jefferson , albeit reluctantly , did just that .
The same paradoxical pattern repeated itself on several notable occasions in the 20th century .
Woodrow Wilson promised to keep the United States out of World War I in 1916 , but took us to war in 1917 .
Lyndon Johnson vowed that American boys would never be sent to Vietnam , but reversed himself in 1965 .
Ronald Reagan described the Soviet Union as an " evil empire " that could not be trusted , then proceeded to negotiate the greatest reduction in nuclear weapons of all time .
Though the 21st century is just getting started , already the paradoxical pattern has continued .
George W. Bush campaigned as a " compassionate conservative " in domestic policy and an opponent of any sustained American role as global policeman .
But his domestic policies have been designed to appeal to the right - wing base of the Republican Party , and his response to 9/11 has made the United States a preemptive , unilateral world power with boundless global ambitions and responsibilities .
If you look at this pattern squarely , it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that , as often as not , what presidential candidates say to get elected has absolutely no predictive power about what they will actually do as president .
If you push the pattern to its outer limits , it suggests that presidential policies often end up contradicting campaign promises .
And if you apply this logic to the current presidential campaigns , voters who regard American withdrawal from Iraq as their highest priority should not vote for any of the three leading Democratic candidates -- Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama or John Edwards -- but instead for Republican John McCain .
There is something perverse about this way of thinking , and the pattern itself , though disarmingly frequent , is not sure - fire through history .
But the reasons for its prevalence are rooted in two political realities that go all the way back to Jefferson 's election .
First , campaigns are inherently exercises in propaganda and posturing , the posing of melodramatic choices usually defined by candidates ' contorted exercises against stereotypical versions of the opposition .
The real - world choices facing a president seldom fit into these operatic campaign categories .
So picking a president is a little like picking a long - distance runner exclusively on the basis of his ( or her ) talent at running wind sprints .
A corollary is that it is almost impossible to know who can make the transition from candidate to president brilliantly , let alone successfully .
Two presidents in the brilliant category , Franklin Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln , surprised all the experts and pundits of the day , who initially regarded them as superficial ciphers .
Roosevelt was dismissed as " a second - rate mind " and Lincoln as " an Illinois hayseed . "
Second , the world has a way of generating unforeseen predicaments that require unrehearsed choices .
Even the broad issues that dominate a campaign are seldom synonymous with those a president must face .
Jefferson had no way of knowing that Napoleon would impetuously decide to sell all the land from the Mississippi to the Rockies for a pittance .
Wilson had no way of knowing that the Germans would decide to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against U.S. shipping .
Roosevelt had no way of knowing that the Japanese would bet their future as an Asian power on a surprise attack against the U.S. at Pearl Harbor .
And as a candidate , Bush had no way of knowing that Islamic terrorists would fly planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon ....

( Check out our complete collection of Unusual , Creative and Transforming Furniture . )
Why is transforming furniture so alluring ?
Does it appeal to our sense that innovation is progress , the fact that fewer materials for more uses is sustainable or simply a return to the childhood love of things that we can actively change and shape as we wish ?
Whatever the reason , these designs range from humorous and impractical to jaw - droppingly cool .
Be sure to scroll all the way down : the best ( pictured briefly above ) has been saved for last and check here for more unusual urban furniture .
This comfy number is not one nor two but three pieces of furniture in one : a sofa , lounger and a chair .
A good deal of transforming furniture looks or feels better in one configuration or another , but this three - in - one by Roel Verhagen - Kaptein is appealing in each of its transformations .
Normally we think of convertible furniture as transforming from one useful thing into something else with a practical function .
These simply elegant folding chairs by Studio Dror collapse into something you might actually want to use simply for wall decoration : a simpler refined furniture solution than sticking cheap folding chairs back into the closet .
Next time you go on a picnic with some friends you may want to grab a second basket , the so - called Mealbox by Igland Design .
Fourteen puzzle pieces slip out of this simple container and assemble into a table and chairs that seat six – a humorous variation on fast food .
Compact , clever and portable , the Fence Chair by Alain Berteau is a simple blend of traditional picket fence vernacular and sustainable modularity .
The repeated use of a single simple form allows for compact shipping and the seats can be split or joined as needed .
A storable box or subtle side table by all appearances , this articulated shelving system by Bertrand Pinceman folds out into a rather nice bookcase .
It is designed to work both on its side and upright .
Marta Antoszkeiwicz ‘s design is not like most transforming furniture that relies on clever bends , twists and hidden tricks to work .
This simple table and chairs set relies only on sliding pieces under and out from under one another .
The result , though , is impressive : chairs that go well with the table in either configuration and do n’t look like extra elements .
Similar in principle to a Murphy bed ( which folds down from the wall when needed ) this cabinet dining room set has everything one needs to sit down to a comfortable meal and then slides back into place .
Neat as this complete furniture solution sounds , though , it is n’t clear how much space is needed behind - the - scenes to make it work .
Yellow might not be the best color , but you have to appreciate this simply brilliant Tetris - based Chairs +
Table design .
Aside from the sofa , bed , and chairs - and - tables configuration these also pack up nicely to be stored .
The material is designed to be soft enough to be comfortable but resilient enough to work as an eating or work surface .
Also , one could imagine that , with sufficient pieces , other creative furniture constructions would be possible .
We ’re all familiar with beds that fold out from sofas , but few do so as easily and elegantly as this one by Flou .
In Modernist tradition , the form of the bed is also partly visible in the form of the couch with each fold - out layer articulated individually .
Now this one is particularly strange : a stove and kitchen workspace that doubles as a comfortable chair ?
An odd combination to be sure , but it is a step in an interesting direction .
This kind of out - of - the - box thinking could result in furniture that not only serves a similar function to its counterpart but that would have different purposes in various rooms around a house .
Would you believe that everything shown in the above image can be fit into a box that is less than 3 feet by 4 feet ?
The creative furniture within can be carried , unpacked and rapidly assembled by just two people .
It probably goes without saying but : the box itself is also reused in the final results .
Check out the video below to see the boxed room in action and go here to see more awesome urban furniture !
The 33 - year - old hairdresser from Woolwich , south - east London , was the first piece in the jigsaw puzzle that led Kent police to the gang who carried out Britain 's largest ever cash robbery and made off with £ 53 m from the Securitas depot in Tonbridge , Kent .
Yesterday , five of the gang at the centre of the conspiracy were jailed at the Old Bailey .
Hogg had helped to disguise four of the robbers , using latex , false hair , grease paint and modelling wax , so that they could impersonate police officers without being recognised later .
The prosthetic masks were well - made and effective and none of the Securitas staff or the manager and his family who were kidnapped at gunpoint by the robbers were able to identify them .
But within 24 hours of the lorry driving away with the looted money , there was a knock at Hogg 's door .
A tip - off to the police had pointed them in the direction of Hogg 's home and her place of employment , a hairdressers in Forest Hill , south - east London , called Hair Hectik .
She had taken two weeks off work to build the masks for the men and had made an expedition to several theatrical goods shops in Covent Garden , central London , to buy the necessary equipment .
She spent hundreds of pounds .
The men needed the disguises because they were planning to impersonate police officers and thus could not wear the traditional robber 's disguise of a ski mask or balaclava .
It was the beginning of a frightening two years for the woman who had once worked on makeup counters at Harvey Nichols and Selfridges .
The detectives who first interviewed Hogg found a flustered young woman clearly out of her depth in the midst of such a huge crime , one to which 100 officers had been assigned , three times as many as to an ordinary murder case .
She denied having any knowledge that any robbery was about to take place .
" I have committed no crime so far as I know , " she said in a statement handed to the police by her lawyer .
" I may have done some work innocently without any knowledge of how my work would be used .
I would like to assist police further ... but I am terrified as to what may happen to me and my family if I say too much . "
As the daughter of a police officer , she was anxious to help .
She told the police that she had assumed that the men needed the masks for a music video , perhaps , or some theatrical performance , and that she met them through a mutual friend .
She said that she would certainly never have embarked on the work if she had known anything illegal was involved .
The police were not convinced and she was charged with conspiracy to commit robbery and conspiracy to kidnap .
When the trial started in court eight of the Old Bailey last July , Hogg was clearly in a very distressed state .
She shook as she went into the dock alongside her seven co-defendants , and was weeping , anxious and breathless .
Some days she was too ill to attend court , and there were rumours of a breakdown .
Eventually , she was given permission to sit outside the dock with her mother , as she claimed she was being intimidated by the other defendants .
Four of them - Lea Rusha , Roger Coutts , Stuart Royle and Jetmir Bucpapa - knew that she would be able to identify them .
Then , halfway through the trial , came a dramatic twist .
Her legal team approached the Crown Prosecution Service and said that she was prepared to give evidence for the prosecution .
It was agreed that all charges should be dropped against her .
This is known as " going QE " ( Queen 's evidence ) or , more familiarly , " talk and walk " .
The decision to call her as a witnesss was made " in the public interest " .
While the CPS 's Roger Coe -Salazar said later that they were confident of securing convictions without Hogg , it was soon apparent that her evidence was dynamite .
She was adamant that she had disguised the men and denied that she was giving evidence to protect herself .
There were angry clashes in the court .
One of the defendants , Royle , who had sacked his lawyers and was defending himself , told her that " I am going to try and be as nice as I can " .
He admitted she had cut his hair at Hair Hectik shortly after he had had it dyed , but claimed that that was their only contact , and that she had never made a mask for him .
" You trimmed my hair and said it looked nice , " he told her as the cat and mouse game in the court developed .
" You said I was a gentleman for helping you with your bags . "
She agreed that the new colour suited him .
But when he claimed that she must have been at a different bungalow from his when she fitted the men with their disguises , she shot back : " Bless you , Stuart , but it was that bungalow .
I did a face cast of you , Stuart , a nose was made for you .
I am sorry but that is the bungalow that I went to .
You offered me a drink and a cake or a biscuit ...
You are absolutely lying and you are lying by saying the makeup was n't done at your mum 's bungalow . "
The trial judge , Mr Justice Penry - Davey , had to intervene when they clashed again .
" I 'm sorry but the lies that come out of his mouth are ridiculous , " she told the court , adding to the judge : " I am sorry , my lord , but he is talking absolute rubbish .
He might as well be talking out of his bottom . "
The judge warned her to watch her language .
She gave a detailed description of how she had made the disguises .
She told how one conspirator , who was black , had complained that she was making him look like a " black Father Christmas " .
She tried to change his appearance further , using her bra straps to pull his eyes sideways and inserting teats from a baby 's bottle into his nostrils .
She made bald caps , fake noses , fake chins .
After Hogg had delivered her detailed and damning evidence , the prosecution 's case was made .
The jury may have taken more than a week to reach their verdicts but there can be little doubt that she played a very crucial part in helping them reach their decisions .
But there are at least three key members of the gang who are still at large ( along with more than half of the £ 53 m stolen ) , and wanted by the police .
The alleged ringleader , a cage fighter , is believed to be in Morocco .
If they could be brought back to the UK , Hogg would again be the prosecution 's star witness .
There are rumours that there is a contract out on her life - a £ 7 m contract , according to some newspapers - but then there are always such rumours when someone has to assume a new identity for their own safety , which is Hogg 's fate .
She currently has 24 - hour armed police protection , will be under the witness protection for the foreseeable future and is believed to be planning to radically alter her appearance .
The Witness Protection Scheme is designed to look after people who have essential evidence about some of the most serious offences , and who therefore face a real threat to their safety .
Most of these protected witnesses are supergrasses - criminals who have turned on their associates in order to save their own skins .
But some are simply innocent bystanders , or people on the fringes of gang culture .
Individuals living under the scheme have to trade in their old life for a new one - moving house ( usually going to another part of the country , and sometimes as far away as Australia , Canada or New Zealand ) , and changing their identity , with medical records and educational qualifications under a new name .
They are also given a lump sum of money to help them start their new life .
Hogg will be very well looked after by the officers assigned to her .
Given her importance to any future trial , the police will be taking absolutely no risks that anyone can get to her - and already the press has been instructed not to publish her photograph without obscuring her eyes .
But her life will not be easy .
Danielle Cable , whose evidence helped convict the man who murdered her fiance , Stephen Cameron , has been living under the scheme since 1998 .
In 2000 , she told the Daily Mail that she was only given a few minutes to pack her bags and leave her old home - a trauma from which she was still recovering .
She had n't seen two of her brothers since she was relocated , she told the reporter , and was unable to see her mother for four months .
Two years after she went into hiding , her phone calls were still strictly limited , she said - she could only make calls from untraceable locations - and it took six weeks for letters to reach her .
" I have lost twice , " she said , " Stephen and my old life . "
In Britain , the police have a very good record of protecting their witnesses , although some have claimed that , once the evidence has been given , they are treated with less care and respect .
A number of people who gave evidence against former criminals have been killed but these were old - fashioned " grasses " who were not under the protection of the police .
People such as Alan " Chalky " White , who ended up at the bottom of Cotswold Water Park in Gloucestershire in 1989 after giving evidence against fellow criminals .
But witness protection does not guarantee safety .
In 1999 , the IRA supergrass Martin McGartland survived an attempt on his life after being shot six times in the stomach while living under an assumed identity in Whitley Bay .
More recently , in 2006 , the issue came up in court in the wake of the case of Giles van Colle , who was killed by a man against whom he was due to give evidence .
A court awarded £ 50,000 damages to his family after the judge ruled that the police had failed in their duty to protect him .
Mrs Justice
Cox ruled that , in failing to prevent Van Colle 's death , the chief constable of Hertfordshire had violated articles two and eight of the European convention of human rights covering the right to life .
The numbers of witnesses who need protection grows every year - probably because of the increase in gang - related and organised crime - with hundreds of families moved every year .
While it is relatively easy for an individual to disappear without trace , the way they can be found is through family members .
Sometimes family members are moved , too - but police have to weigh up the risks : how many members of an extended family can be given a new identity , and how many of them will be able to keep their mouths shut ?
Although giving evidence in these circumstances is terrifying , the truth is that most witnesses and informants are not pursued by the people against whom they have given evidence .
Professional criminals might like the satisfaction of exacting vengeance but they also know that any action they took would place them at a far greater risk than they already were and would ensure that they probably spent most of the rest of their life in jail .
But this can be little comfort to Hogg , as she starts her new life today .
2 of Every 3 Americans Are Better Off Today Than Their Parents , and More Than 80 % of the Bottom Fifth Are Richer Than Their Parents
The charts above are from the study "
" from the
, based on a sample of 2,367 individuals who were between the ages of 0 and 18 in 1968 and have been tracked into adulthood .
Here is what the study shows :
1. Adults who were children in 1968 — those who were in their 30s and 40s at the end of the century — have more income than did their parents ’ generation .
Median family income rose by 29 % between the two generations , from $ 55,600 in inflation - adjusted dollars to $ 71,900 .
Average family incomes , grew even more rapidly , from $ 61,600 to $ 88,000 ( a 43 % increase ) .
Income growth occurred throughout the income distribution for all five quintiles , as shown in the top chart above ( click to enlarge ) , although family income in the top quintile grew by 52 % , compared to 18 % for the bottom fifth .
2 . The average number of individuals per family shrank from 3.1 to 2.3 individuals between 1969 and 1998 .
Taking into account the smaller family size as well as the growth in family income , families are generally better off economically today .
3 . More than 2 out of every 3 Americans who were children in 1968 had higher levels of real family income in 1995 – 2002 than their parents had in 1967 – 1971 ( see bottom chart above , click to enlarge ) .
Children born to parents in the bottom fifth were MORE likely to surpass their parents ’ income than children from any other background .
More than four out of five children ( 82 % ) born to parents in the bottom quintile have greater family income than their parents .
In contrast , less than half ( 43 % ) of those whose parents are in the top fifth of income surpass their parents .
4. Economic mobility is measured in this study by tracking only changes in cash income .
Income mobility would be higher at the top income quintiles with the inclusion of the value of fringe benefits , since employer contributions to retirement and health insurance totaled 7 % of wages in 1967 – 1971 ( parents ' generation ) and 13 % in 1995 – 2002 ( children 's generation ) .
In other words , contrary to the picture portrayed by the media :
1. Real incomes are NOT stagnant - real median family income has increased by 29 % over the last quarter century , and real incomes have increased for ALL income groups over the last generation .
2 . The middle class has not disappeared , it 's gotten richer !
Real income of the middle quintile ( middle class ) has increased by 29 % .
3 . Although it 's true that income inequality has increased , it does n't really matter because the poor have gotten richer AND the rich have gotten richer .
The rich have NOT gotten richer at the expense of the poor , all groups have gotten richer together .
4 . There is significant upward income mobility , especially for the lowest income group .
Children born to parents in the bottom quintile are more likely to surpass their parents ’ income ( 82 % ) than are children from any other background .

Andy Samberg is sitting in a tall director ’s chair on a soundstage in Hollywood , wearing a white T - shirt and jeans , hair askew , smiling that Samberg smile .
He ’s seated next to three of the co-stars from his new comedy movie , Hot Rod — Bill Hader , Danny McBride , and Samberg ’s old high - school friend and collaborator , Jorma Taccone — all of whom have gathered to perform a relatively straightforward bit of movie marketing : record a bunch of interstitial interview clips to run on Comedy Central during an upcoming Sunday movie marathon .
This seems like a good idea .
The channel ’s young - dude - sitting - around - on - Sunday - watching - Fletch demographic is exactly the kind of person who ’s most likely to recognize Samberg from Saturday Night Live , or from the “ Lazy Sunday ” and “ Dick in a Box ” sketches that zipped from in - box to in - box last year like some viral - video superflu .
So this would seem , for Samberg , to be an ideal synergistic marketing opportunity , were he the kind of person who ’s prone to string together words like synergistic , marketing , and opportunity .
Andy Samberg is not that kind of person .
He ’s more likely to string together words like super , lame , and balls , as when he describes to me a comedy video he made in junior high .
“ It was about one - armed boxers , ” he says , then laughs .
“ Man , it was super - lame balls . ”
You know what else is apparently super - lame balls ?
Recording interstitial promos .
Because when the director lobs an easy question from off - camera like , “ Tell me the plot of your movie , ” Samberg replies , “ Hot Rod is about a sex offender . ”
( It ’s not . )
“ He does stunts to raise money to sex - offend . ” ( He does not . )
Then he , Taccone , and Hader crack a few jokes about how lame the movies are during Comedy Central marathons .
( “ Stay tuned for Teen Wolf Too ! ” )
A lot of this is the usual comedian joshing —
Hader keeps doing an entirely counterproductive bit about how , on the day Hot Rod opens , you should go out and see Transformers for the seventh time — but the implied joke in each of Samberg ’s responses is , Hey , America !
Can you believe they ’re making me do this marketing bullshit ?
Which is , in part , playing right to Comedy Central ’s audience , employing the slacker jujitsu of marketing by making fun of how super - lame balls marketing is .
But it also seems , in part , to be a visceral , almost involuntary response by Samberg to the obligations that come with starring in a major studio comedy — namely , convincing as many people as possible that they ’re going to find you funny .
This is a guy , remember , who got his start just six years ago making video shorts on the cheap with two childhood buddies ( Taccone and Akiva Schaffer , who directed Hot Rod ) and posting them on the Web .
Next thing you know , Samberg and friends were hired to work on SNL , a gig they ’d dreamed about for years .
Then their digital short “ Lazy Sunday ” — which starred Samberg and Chris Parnell as two nerdy New Yorkers rapping about cupcakes , Red Vines , and The Chronicles of Narnia — blew up on YouTube , at which point an executive at Paramount decided Samberg might just be the next Adam Sandler , or Will Ferrell , or Insert Hot Comedy Star Here , and enticed him to star in Hot Rod .
Which is to say that , not long ago , Samberg only had to worry about making himself and his buddies laugh .
Then he had to worry about making Lorne Michaels laugh .
Now he has to worry about making you — by which I mean most of America — laugh .
And he ’s not quite sure he knows what America finds funny .
“ I certainly know how to make my friends laugh , ” he tells me .
“ And that ’s what we ’ve always lived by : If you think it ’s funny , go for it .
But then you get into , like , testing .
And marketing .
And posters .
And a trailer .
And you ’re suddenly like , God .
Maybe I do n’t know what people will like . ”
Make no mistake : Andy Samberg wants to make you laugh .
And up to this point , he ’s had a pretty good track record .
Both “ Lazy Sunday ” and “ Dick in a Box ” were huge , unexpected hits .
( If for some reason you are not familiar with “ Dick in a Box , ” put down this magazine , go to a computer , and Google “ Dick in a Box . ” I know it does n’t sound promising , but I beseech you :
It is by far the most hilarious Justin Timberlake–starring , Kwanzaa - referencing , Color Me Badd–parodying , “ put your junk in that box ” –instructing short video you will ever see . )
Taken as a whole , the digital shorts Samberg has made for SNL , nearly all of which were directed by Schaffer and co-written with Taccone , have been the highlights of the past two seasons .
Another short featured Natalie Portman doing an angry rap with lines like , “ All the kids looking up to me can suck my dick / It ’s Portman , motherfucker , and I drink till I ’m sick . ”
( Samberg cameos in the video dressed as a Viking .
Why ?
Because he thinks Vikings are funny .
Also monkeys .
He ’s a big fan of monkeys . )
In “ Roy Rules , ” Samberg sings a homoerotic heavy - metal love song to his brother - in - law .
“ Roy rules ! /
He loves wearing T - shirts ! /
But in my dreams he ’s dressed like a pirate and my dong is his peg-leg ! ”

As a result , Samberg is currently hovering at a curious place in his renown .
If you say , “ Andy Samberg , ” many people will stare back at you blankly .
But if you say , “ The guy in the ‘ Dick in a Box ’ video who was n’t Justin Timberlake , ” almost everyone will nod and say , “ Oh , yeah , that guy , ” then chuckle .
This will change , of course , if Hot Rod is a hit .
Already , Samberg ’s face is all over movie posters and popcorn bags across the country .
At times , though , he still does n’t quite believe he ’s starring in a real movie .
“ The first preview we went to was the craziest thing , ” he says .
“ People were watching … us . ”
In part , his disbelief has to do with the speed of his ascent .
Lots of SNLers wind up getting cast in comedies , but not many have it happen after their first season .
Thanks to “ Lazy Sunday , ” Samberg was being written up in the New York Times just months after he ’d joined the show .
( Though the paper misidentified his photo as “ Adam Samberg . ” )
During a brunch in L.A. , Samberg mentions that Schaffer had spotted a taxi with a Hot Rod poster on the roof and snapped a souvenir shot .
“ I have n’t seen one of those yet , ” Samberg says , pausing over an enormous platter of creamed beef over eggs and toast .
I ask him what would happen if he saw a huge Hot Rod billboard looming over Sunset Boulevard .
“ I ’ll probably shit in my pants , ” he says .
Then he looks at his breakfast .
“ This is not going to help . ”
Samberg , in person , is exactly as he appears on TV .
He ’s got that grin that recalls the gleeful slash across the jaw of a Muppet .
He ’s got that hair , too — a wild tangle of grown - out bedhead that sort of loiters in a cloud around his skull .
He has an affable , Berkeley - bred quality that suggests he would probably be the awesomest camp counselor ever .
( He served as such for several summers at Sky Lake Yosemite . )
His childhood was , it seems , untroubled by exceptional trauma , corrosive unpopularity , or other psychic scars that might have warped him into a jester .
Instead , he simply developed an early taste for absurd nonsense .
“ When I was growing up , I was into movies like Ace Ventura and Billy Madison and Airplane , ” he says .
“ You know , movies where it ’s like , ‘ Welcome to Crazy World ! ’
That to me was so refreshing and freeing — that people actually made a whole movie about bullshit . ”
He likes to call himself , his friends , and his fellow young SNL castmates ( Samberg is 28 ) part of “ the Muppet Generation , ” by which he means they ’re happy - go - lucky and goofy .
He illustrates this on an L.A. sidewalk by breaking into a loose - limbed , arm - waggling Grover dance .
It would be a mistake , though , to assume that he ’s some whatever - dude slacker who ’s drifted into success .
For starters , he exhibits an encyclopedic memory for every network or studio that ever turned him down .
Of Awesometown , a pilot he and Taccone and Schaffer developed , Samberg says , “ Fox passed .
We took it to Comedy Central .
They passed .
MTV ?
Passed .
MTV2 ? Passed , ” as though each “ no ” was a personal slight that ’s only now being avenged .
Samberg , Taccone , and Schaffer started hanging out in high school , “ just taking a camera to parties and filming ourselves doing silly shit , ” Samberg says .
After college — Taccone and Schaffer went to school in California , Samberg at NYU — the trio reunited .
“ We figured we could either work together , ” says Samberg , “ or be competing with each other . ”
Inspired by stories of other comics who ’d made short - film calling cards and landed deals , such as the South Park guys who ’d turned an animated Christmas card into a hit series , they decided to move to L.A .
They shot films and lived in a cheap apartment and worked various low - rung jobs during what Samberg now calls “ the hell year . ”
At the time , pre-YouTube , no one was really posting funny films online , let alone seeking them out there .
They started their Website mostly so friends back in Berkeley could see their sketches .
They called the site Lonely Island after the nickname they ’d given their apartment .

While Samberg was working as an assistant on Spin City , he showed their reel to his boss , who introduced the group to an agent , who later got them a gig writing for the MTV Movie Awards , which happened to be hosted by Jimmy Fallon , who recommended them to Lorne Michaels .
“ I got a call from Jimmy and he said these guys were the real deal , ” says Michaels .
So he gave them an audition : Samberg and Taccone as performers , Schaffer as a writer .
While waiting to hear about the tryouts , the three of them gathered one night to discuss what would happen if not all of them made the show .
They decided that if only Samberg got it , he should go — SNL , after all , had been his dream since age 8 .
But if only one was rejected , they vowed that one of the other two would stay behind .
As Samberg says , “ leaving one guy alone would have been too fucked up . ”
In the end , miraculously , they all got hired .
“ I really responded to Andy , ” says Michaels .
“ And the hope with Akiva and Jorma was that as writers they would help Andy on the show . ”
At first , Samberg seemed to fit into the show ’s well - established lineage of impish cutie- pies , which ran from Adam Sandler , a Samberg idol , through Jimmy Fallon , who sported his own famously untameable hair .
But after Samberg debuted , it became clear that his strengths did n’t exactly jibe with SNL ’s traditional menu of celebrity parodies and political satire .
( Every comic has to impersonate three celebrities at their SNL tryout ; Samberg , who ’s not big on impressions , remembers doing Jimmy Fallon , The Muppet Show ’s Swedish Chef , and one line of Alan Rickman ’s from Die Hard . )
The sketches written by him and Taccone and Schaffer are always easy to spot , such as “ Deserted Moon ” in which Samberg plays an alien who ’s marooned on a planet with a human guy , to whom he casually reveals that he has both male and female genitalia , then spends the next decade trying to convince the guy to have sex with him .
When Samberg ’s stuck in more traditional sketches , he often seems extraneous , even lost — or at least barely able to restrain himself from breaking into some nonsensical tangent .
The digital shorts , though , became his trademark , and they are by far the weirdest things on the show .
A short such as “ Andy Popping Into Frame ” — which consists of a series of static shots of exotic locales with goofy techno music and Samberg , yes , popping into the frame — will either make him your absolute favorite cast member ever or make you want to smack him with a rolled - up newspaper .
But the best shorts hit that sweet spot where reliably crowd - pleasing gags intersect with bizarrely inspired touches .
“ Dick in a Box ” was based on a gag that ’s been around since the dawn of time —
“ There ’s probably an Egyptian hieroglyphic of a guy holding a snake charmer ’s basket in front of his crotch , ” Samberg says — but then Schaffer suggested the sketch ’s funniest bit : the three steps .
( One : Cut a hole in a box .
Two :
Put your junk in that box .
Three : Make her open the box . )
“ As soon as Kiv said that , ” says Samberg , “ I was like , ‘ This just went somewhere really good . ’ ” The week of “ Dick in a Box , ” the trio was n’t even planning to do a short , but Michaels pushed them to do a musical parody because Justin Timberlake was hosting the show .
( “ I gave them a direct order , ” Michaels says . )
So they wrote , shot , and cut together the sketch between Thursday night and Saturday afternoon .
A couple of months and over 10 million downloads later , Samberg found himself singing a surprise duet with Timberlake in front of 18,000 screaming fans at Madison Square Garden .
“ It was surreal .
Everything happened so fast , ” he says .
He remembers looking out at the crowd , many of whom knew every word , and thinking , Oh my God .
This is huge .
On a summer Sunday in New York , I met with Samberg and Taccone at a sound - mixing facility near Union Square .
Schaffer was sequestered in the studio , tinkering with the film in preparation for Hot Rod ’s quasi- official premiere , an outdoor screening at the L.A. Film Festival a couple of weeks away .
When I asked why he and Samberg were n’t in the studio , Taccone said , “ Too many opinions . ”
So they ’d decided instead to chill out and watch The Prince of Egypt on the flat - screen TV .
Earlier , Samberg had watched Dunston Checks In , a comedy that stars Jason Alexander and an orangutan .
His enjoyment of it , he insists , was not ironic in any way .
And , later , when a Dunston Checks
In commercial comes on , Samberg lets out what I can testify to being an unqualified squeal of joy .
Samberg ’s comic sensibility — a cross between goofy innocence ( kick in the groin ! ) and oddball non sequiturs ( kick a Viking in the groin ! ) — turns out to be tailor - made for popularity on the Internet .
And Samberg has been held up as Exhibit A in every argument about the viral power of the Web .
( In the weeks after “ Lazy Sunday ” hit , YouTube ’s traffic increased by 83 percent . )
In that sense , casting him in a major studio comedy right now makes perfect sense .
He ’s hot !
He ’s big on the Web !
The kids love him !
But in another sense , being big on the Internet and being big at the multiplex have absolutely nothing to do with each other .
The beauty of producing comedy on the Web is that you can do pretty much whatever the hell you want .
And you might find a hundred , or a thousand , or a hundred thousand people who share your weird obsession with monkeys or homoerotic pirates .
But your jokes will find their audience , if there ’s an audience out there to be found .

A studio comedy , however , has to make a lot of people laugh , starting with small , randomly selected groups of people sitting in test screenings .
This is why studio executives tend to champion jokes that everyone ’s seen before ( think of every movie trailer where someone gets bonked in the head ) , while comedians tend to be drawn to jokes no one has ever seen before ( one of Samberg ’s favorite sketches is by a group called Stella and features Mrs. Santa Claus hanging out with three dudes , then saying , “ Did you guys know that I have a cock ? ” before revealing a realistic dildo ) .
And between the Internet and the neighborhood cineplex , the calculus of just how many people have to find you funny changes dramatically .
On YouTube , a million viewers is a phenomenon .
On pay cable , a million viewers is a critical darling , like Curb Your Enthusiasm .
On a network , a million viewers is a disaster .
With a movie , it might end your career .
“ Comedy ’s weird , because it ’s the only job where the definition is a matter of opinion , ” says Samberg .
“ If you ’re a plumber , and you show up and fix someone ’s toilet , then that ’s proof that you are a plumber .
But if you make a comedy , and people do n’t think it ’s funny , then in their world , it ’s disproving your existence .
You ’re like , ‘ Yeah , I ’m an entertainer . ’
And they ’re like , ‘ Really ?
Because I ’m not entertained . ’ ”
Hot Rod , it should be said , is not some alienating comedy manifesto .
No one suddenly pulls out a huge fake cock .
( Not that Samberg would n’t have loved to include that joke . )
And , as you might expect from a stuntman parody , Hot Rod does not underestimate the comedic value of watching a human being travel at high speed into an immovable object .
The original script was written by Pam Brady , a former South Park writer , and it follows a formula that ’s familiar to comedy fans : the faux heartwarming sports movie .
Samberg plays Rod Kimble , a wannabe stuntman who plans one big jump to raise the money to save his ailing stepfather .
Substitute “ stuntman ” with “ ice dancer ” and it could be Blades of Glory ; substitute “ NASCAR driver ” and it could be Talladega Nights .
( The list goes on : Dodgeball is essentially the same story except about dodgeball , and the forthcoming Balls of Fury focuses on ping - pong . )
The script had languished at Paramount for years .
It was originally attached to Will Ferrell back when he was on SNL , but it never got off the ground .
( Rumor has it the studio worried that Ferrell could n’t carry a movie .
Oops . )
After “ Lazy Sunday , ” Lorne Michaels convinced Paramount to make it with Samberg , and Schaffer directing .
“ The amazing thing is they said okay , ” says Michaels .
“ Akiva had never directed film , let alone a feature , and Andy had never really been in a movie , let alone starred in one .
But I thought this could be a different generation ’s comedy . ”
Then they brought in Taccone to play Samberg ’s nerdy step - brother , who performs an excellent rendition of a George Michael love song for his stuffed animals .
Hot Rod might not be the movie Samberg and Schaffer would ideally make , but the hope is that if it ’s a hit , it will give them the chance to make their ideal movie .
“ The studio knew that if they put someone in an Evel Knievel costume , whether it ’s Will Ferrell or Dane Cook or Andy Samberg , then they ’ve got a poster , ” says Schaffer .
“ And they wanted a PG - 13 movie , like a Dodgeball .
I think within those confines , we did pretty well . ”
Now that Ferrell , Adam Sandler , and Ben Stiller are all in their forties — and have , to varying degrees , transitioned from their goofy comedy phase to the family - friendly - movie phase , or the take - me - seriously - as - an - actor phase — Hollywood is hungry for a young , dude - friendly comedy star .
Hot Rod , which opens August 3 , will be Samberg ’s first litmus test , proving whether it ’s his moment , or too much too soon .
On the one hand , a Variety critic , in a middling review of Hot Rod , said of Samberg , “ The up - and - coming comic boasts something unusual for an SNL regular : sex appeal . ”
On the other , when the Hot Rod trailer screened recently in New York , some guy in the crowd shouted , “ They gave that dude a movie ? ”
As for Samberg , he seems genuinely confounded about Hot Rod ’s prospects .
He ’s proud of the weird stuff that made it in , yet mourns the even weirder jokes that did n’t , like one in which he “ jokingly ” asks his younger brother to whip out his wiener .
( As you can tell , he ’s quite fond of the surprise appearance of dongs . )
He says he ’d love to make another movie after this one , with a smaller budget , that ’s as weird as they want it to be .
“ My favorite movies , almost across the board , are not the biggest box - office hits , ” he says , citing Wet Hot American Summer , a cult hit from the guys in Stella .
“ But if you ’re not prepared for that kind of comedy , which by its nature is designed to fuck around with what ’s expected from a movie , it ’s off - putting .
People are like , ‘ I do n’t get it , dude .
What was it even about ? ’
And I ’m like , ‘ I know !
It did n’t make any sense at all ! ’ ” When he and Taccone and Schaffer were storming the streets of L.A. with a camera , there was no one to pull them back .
“ But with a movie , ” he says , “ it ’s definitely about figuring out that balance : between stuff that ’s satisfying to your core weirdness and stuff that ’s accessible .
There ’s validity to both sides . ”
Then he laughs .
“ But when it ’s a Paramount movie , it ’s more on one side . ”
The funniest parts of Hot Rod , to my eye at least , are also the weirdest and most unexpected , like when Chris Parnell , as a straitlaced AM - radio announcer , reveals a hilariously profane tattoo on his stomach .
Or when Samberg and Taccone repeat the phrase “ cool beans ” back and forth until it ’s a bizarre pseudo - rap .
Both of these gags barely made it into the film .
Parnell ’s joke was almost cut when the MPAA objected to the word semen .
( It was later changed to residue . )
As for the “ cool beans ” bit , at first it was n’t quite working , so Schaffer decided to dump it .
“ You can only fight for things so many times , ” he says , “ before you have to move on to something else . ”
Then Samberg and Taccone went into the editing suite on their own and put together the scene that now exists .
At the very last test - screening , Schaffer stuck the joke back in , telling a studio executive , “ We ’re trying out a bizarre scene .
Do n’t freak out . ”
On the audience ’s response cards , the scene was the one most commonly cited as people ’s least favorite .
It was also the one most commonly cited as the favorite , and so it stayed in .
The open - air screening for Hot Rod is held on a gorgeous Los Angeles evening at the John Ford Amphitheatre under a darkening , cloudless sky .
As premieres go , it ’s pretty casual — no red carpet , no paparazzi , just 1,200 fans who are fond enough of “ Dick in a Box ” to pay eleven bucks to check out Samberg ’s movie .
There ’s also a lot of industry folk in the crowd .
“ Everyone ’s very curious , ” says Samberg ’s manager , Julie Darmody .
As she watches a mix of twentysomethings stroll in from the parking lot , she says , “ I like the look of this .
It feels like a home crowd . ”
Samberg and Schaffer arrive in a black SUV .
( Taccone has left to prepare for his wedding , which Samberg and Schaffer will attend the next day . )
Schaffer mentions he ’s just come from his hotel , where he was looking over the final version of the film ’s poster , which features a huge picture of Samberg ’s face .
I ask about the fate of an alternate poster I ’d seen online , one that shows Samberg silhouetted on a hilltop , bowing in a martial - arts pose to honor his rinky - dink motorbike .
“ Yeah , that ’s the one we liked , ” says Schaffer .
“ But this is the one the studio wants . ”
There ’s a roped - off VIP section , but Samberg and his friends decide to duck into some empty seats in the last row .
Dusk falls , and the movie begins .
The opening scene is one featured prominently in every trailer : Samberg dons a fake mustache , revs his motorbike , then takes a calamitous face - plant off a ramp .
The crowd laughs .
The first real test , though , comes about twenty minutes in , when the movie announces to the audience : Welcome to Crazy World .
After yet another failed stunt , Samberg wails in mock angst that he ’s got to go to his “ quiet place . ”
Cut to : Samberg in a deeply wooded forest , doing a long sequence of cornball gyrations straight from an eighties dance movie .
Cut to : Samberg doing elaborate pummel - horse gymnastics over a fallen tree trunk .
Cut to : Samberg taking an extended tumble down an apparently endless hill , his floppy body bouncing and careering off every tree and rock .
Dude falls down :
That ’s funny .
Dude falls down for a ludicrously , indulgently , gloriously silly long time :
That ’s Samberg funny .
At the end of the tumble , the audience cheers .
The home crowd , at least , is entertained .
And Samberg finally does something I have n’t seen him do since the movie started .
Samberg laughs .
“ Lazy Sunday ” “ I told you that I ’m crazy for these cupcakes , cousin . ”
“ Deserted Moon ” “ I have both male and female genitalia .
Just something to think about . ”
“ Dick in a Box ” “ A gift real special , so take off the top / Take a look inside .
It ’s my dick in a box . ”
“ Andy Popping Into Frame ” ( Pop ! )
Hot Rod “ All great men have mustaches . ”

This is where you get to experience your favourite Next Nature projects in a completely new light .
What is the origin of mass ?
You would think physicists long ago figured out the answer to so straightforward a question .
After all , they have deduced what the Universe was like in its first split - second of its existence - and that must have be an incomparably harder nut to crack .
Appearances , however , can be deceptive .
The embarrassing truth is that , at the beginning of the 21st century , one of nature 's best kept secrets remains the origin of mass .
Remarkably , nobody knows why it is difficult to budge a loaded fridge or pick up a heavy bag of shopping .
Not only is the question of the origin of mass hard to answer , it is also open to interpretation .
Just as US President Clinton said " I did not have sex with that woman " and qualified it with " it all depends on what you mean by sex " , physicists ask " What is the origin of mass ? " and qualify it with " it depends what you mean by mass " .
Several distinct characteristics are in fact commonly associated with mass - two familiar and everyday , and one a little more esoteric .
The three types of masses
The most obvious characteristic of massive bodies is that it takes an effort to get them moving .
Think how hard it is to get a broken - down car rolling .
Part of the reason is of course the need to overcome the friction between the tyres and the road .
But , even if there were no such force - say , the car was standing on a perfectly shiny ice rink - it would still take an effort to get the car moving .
As Galileo first realised , all bodies have a curious in - built resistance to having their motion changed in any way .
Bodies which are stationary want to stay stationary ; bodies which are moving want to remain moving .
On Earth this is not at all obvious because frictional forces always act to slow a body down .
A car whose engine cuts out , for instance , travels only a short distance before grinding to a halt .
In the empty vacuum of space , however , the tendency of moving bodies to keep on moving is very apparent .
Newton distilled this idea into his first law of motion , which states : " A body remains in a state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force . "
This stubborn opposition of mass to any attempt to change its motion is attributed to a property called " inertia " .
Every time we try to budge a fridge and it stubbornly opposes our efforts , physicists say we are encountering the fridge 's inertia .
This kind of mass - " inertial mass " - is the most familiar of all forms of mass .
In addition to inertia , however , there is another familiar characteristic which people associate with mass : " weight " .
The weight of a bag of shopping , for instance , is actually the " force " of gravity acting on it .
In everyday life we tend to use the terms weight and mass interchangeably ( much to the dismay of physicists ) .
This is possible because the force of gravity is the same everywhere on the Earth 's surface so that , if one body has twice the weight of another - as shown by , say , a set of bathroom scales - we can be sure it also has twice the mass .
The fact that weight is not the same as mass but also depends on the strength of gravity was obvious to the Apollo astronauts as they bobbed about on the Moon .
Although their mass was the same as on Earth , in the weaker lunar gravity their weight plummeted to a sixth of its terrestrial value .
The mass that responds to gravity is referred to by physicists as " gravitational mass " .
And there is something very peculiar about it , first noted by Galileo and others , though it took Einstein to recognise its true significance for penetrating the mystery of gravity .
The peculiar thing is that the force of gravity experienced by a body goes up exactly in step with its inertial mass .
In other words , a body with double the inertial mass of another experiences twice the force of gravity ; a body with ten times the inertial mass tens times the gravity ; and so on .
Recall , however , that a body 's resistance to being moved also goes up exactly in step with its inertial mass .
Because of this , a body that is twice as hard to move as another experiences a force of gravity twice as strong ; one that is ten times as hard to move a force ten times as great .
By some weird cosmic conspiracy , the effect of inertia and the effect of gravity compensate for each other perfectly .
Consequently , all bodies falling under gravity pick up speed at exactly the same rate , no matter what their mass .
Galileo is said to have demonstrated this striking property of falling bodies by dropping different masses from the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and seeing them hit the ground simultaneously .
However , it was shown beyond a doubt in 1972 when Dave Scott , commander of the Apollo 15 spacecraft , dropped a hammer and a feather together in the air - resistance - free environment of the Moon .
Two simultaneous puffs of dust on the fuzzy black - and - white TV pictures were indisputable evidence that the hammer and the feather had struck the lunar surface at the same time .
Nobody knows why " gravitational mass " - which determines the gravitational force a body experiences - is the same as the inertial mass - which determines a body 's resistance to being moved .
Nevertheless , in 1915 , Einstein was able to use this " equivalence " of gravitational mass and inertial mass as the cornerstone of his theory of gravity , the general theory of relativity .
But , in addition to gravitational mass and inertial mass , there is a third , less familiar , type of mass .
This is the one physicists believe they have made the most progress in understanding .
It stems from a more esoteric characteristic of matter .
As well as responding to gravity and resisting attempts to change its motion , mass also behaves as a super - concentrated " knot " of " energy " .
Energy is actually a slippery concept to define but it comes in many forms - for instance , heat energy , sound energy and energy of motion .
If you doubt that is energy associated with motion , step into the path of a speeding bicycle - or , better still , just imagine it !.
As pointed out before , one of the central characteristics of energy - first appreciated by 19th - century scientists and enshrined in the law of conservation of energy - is that energy can never be created or destroyed , merely changed from one form into another .
In 1905 , Einstein surprised pretty much everyone by identifying an entirely new form of energy - the energy associated with mass .
Of all the forms of energy , mass - energy is by far the most concentrated .
A single gram of matter contains as much energy as is liberated by the detonation of about 10 tonnes of dynamite .
( The precise amount of energy , E , locked inside a chunk of matter of mass , m , is given by the most famous equation in the whole of science : E = mc2 , where c is the speed of light )
This fact would be of little consequence if the energy in matter was locked away irretrievably .
However , it is not .
Because one form of energy can be transformed into another , mass - energy can be converted into other forms of energy , ultimately heat energy .
The awful reality of this was demonstrated in August 1945 with the exploding of atomic bombs above the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
One of the key question in physics is :
Why does matter have the mass - energy it does ?
The question can be made more precise by relating it to the fundamental building blocks of all matter .
These appear to be six particles called quarks and six particle called leptons , with only two types of quark and two types of leptons involved in the construction of all normal matter , including you and me .
The crucial question physicists want to answer is therefore :
Why do the fundamental particles have the masses they do ?
For instance , why does a top - quark have about a million times the mass - energy of an electron ?
The origin of mass - energy
The fundamental particles of matter are believed to be " glued " together by just four fundamental forces .
These are the electromagnetic force , which binds together the atoms in our bodies ; the weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force , which hold sway in the ultra-tiny domain of the atomic " nucleus " ; and the gravitational force , which governs the large - scale Universe of planets and stars and galaxies .
All these forces are believed to arise from the exchange of " force - carrier " particles , which shuttle back and forth between the fundamental particles like microscopic tennis balls between tennis players .
In the case of the electromagnetic force , for instance , the force - carrier is the photon , the humble particle of light ; in the case of the strong nuclear force it is the " gluon " , which comes not in one [ type ] but eight different types .
Having four different fundamental forces , transmitted by a legion of force - carrying particles , may appear a bit on the complicated side .
And this is the consensus view of physicists .
They are convinced that things were very much simpler once upon a time .
What encourages them in this belief is nature 's peculiar obsession with symmetry .
All the fundamental laws of nature seem to be mere manifestations of deep underlying symmetries of the world - properties which remain the same when our viewpoint is changed , either in some concrete or in some abstract way .
Admittedly , in today 's world , some of nature 's symmetries are flawed , or broken .
Nevertheless , physicists believe that , in the blistering hot fireball of the big bang , symmetry reigned supreme .
The evidence for this belief rests on the observation that systems become simpler - which is synonymous with more symmetric - at higher temperatures .
Ice , for instance , is not the same throughout - often it contains bubbles and flaws and fissures .
However , if ice is heated until it becomes water , the non-uniformities vanish .
It looks the same at every place , which is the same as saying it is more symmetric .
Similarly , physicists believe that , when the Universe was a lot hotter - as it was in the first moments of the big bang - it was a lot simpler , a lot more symmetric .
Instead of the four fundamental forces , there was a single " superforce " .
The fundamental forces we observe in today 's Universe turn out to be mere facets of this " unified " force .
In fact , this belief is more than a qualitative , hand - waving one .
As pointed out before , in the mid-1980s , at CERN , the European centre for particle research near Geneva , physicists slammed together subatomic particles with such violence that they were able to recreate for a split - second the ultra - high temperatures which existed in the fireball of the big bang .
Sure enough , they observed the electromagnetic and weak forces merge together into a single , electroweak , force .
Theorists have also devised " Grand unified theories " , or GUTs , which predict that , at the far higher temperatures that existed at even earlier times in the big bang , all the non-gravitational forces of nature - not just the electromagnetic and weak forces - were fused together into a single force .
All this is well and good .
However , there is a rather serious snag with GUTs and their prediction of the unification of the forces .
The unification could have happened only if the fundamental particles had no mass !
Clearly , today 's fundamental particles are not massless .
Consequently , a vital jigsaw piece is missing from our picture of reality .
Specifically , there must exist a mechanism by which nature bestows masses on the massless particles .
Such a mechanism was in fact fleshed out in the mid-1960s by the Scots physicist Peter Higgs .
The Higgs mechanism employs the " Higgs field " , a subtle and previously unsuspected feature of the vacuum .
Physicists often visualise it as a kind of invisible cosmic treacle which fills all of space and sticks to particles .
Since the Higgs field contains energy - which has a mass equivalent - the more treacle a particle accrues , the more massive it is .
" The picture of particles accumulating some treacle is crude - but not totally misleading , " says Nobel - prizewinner Frank Wilczek of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
The mass the Higgs field bestows on a particle is called its " rest mass " .
This is the mass it possesses when it is standing still and it is intrinsic to the particle .
It is important to recognise this because a particle may also possess a mass by virtue of being in motion .
This is apparent from Einstein 's E=mc2 formula , which can equally well be read from left to right as right to left .
Not only is mass a form of energy - mass - energy - but energy has an equivalent mass .
Since one form of energy is energy of motion , a particle has a greater mass when it is moving than when it is not .
Fields like the Higgs field , which fill all of space like a vast sea , are actually considered by physicists to be the most fundamental things in nature - even more fundamental than particles .
In the modern view , the particles are nothing more than localised " excitations " - vortices if you like - in that sea .
The vortex of the Higgs field not surprisingly called the Higgs particle .
In fact , there may be several different types of Higgs particle , the [ precise ] number depends on precisely how nature has chosen to implement the Higgs mechanism .
Particle physicists are desperate to find the Higgs particle , which is widely regarded as a missing piece of their " Standard Model " of fundamental particles and forces .
Currently , all their hopes are pinned on CERN's " Large Hadron Collider " which , when completed in 2008 , will be the world 's most energetic particle accelerator .
If the LHC finds the Higgs , the relief among physicists will be palpable .
Almost certainly they will declare to every newspaper and TV station that they have found the elusive origin of mass .
However , according to Wilczek , this will be an exaggeration of the truth .
" You have to be very clear about exactly what the Higgs mechanism does and does not explain , " he says .
The Higgs mechanism does not in any sense " explain " the actual values of the masses of the fundamental particles .
For instance , it does not explain why the top - quark has roughly a million times the mass of the electron .
In the Higgs theory , the value of the mass of a particular particle depends on how well the Higgs " treacle " sticks to it .
The stickiness is encapsulated in a number called a " coupling constant " , which is different for each particle and , worst still , must be inserted into the theory by hand simply to make the masses come out right .
Far from shedding light on the origin of mass , the Higgs mechanism appears merely to substitute one mystery for another .
Instead of having to explain the different masses of the fundamental particles , physicists must explain their different coupling constants .
" I guess whether or not you call the Higgs mechanism an explanation of mass is a matter of taste , " says Wilczek .
" I would be inclined to say no , since it does n't simplify the description of mass , nor suggest testable new properties of mass . "
Even if the Higgs mechanism is accepted as an explanation of mass , it has an another , rather embarrassing , shortcoming .
It can account for hardly any of the mass of ordinary matter - that is , of you and me !
Most of the mass of ordinary matter is tied up in particles called protons and neutrons , which are found in tight clumps at the heart of atoms .
The protons and neutrons are , in turn , composed of up - and down - quarks .
The Higgs mechanism can certainly account for the masses of these quarks .
However , the quark masses are actually very small indeed .
In fact , they contribute only a tiny fraction of the mass of protons and neutrons .
So , even with the Higgs , the lion 's share of their mass is still unaccounted for .
It must arise in some totally different way .
In fact , the missing mass arises from the gluons , which transmit nature 's strong , or " colour " , force , and so glue together the quarks inside protons and neutrons .
The bizarre thing is that gluons actually have no mass whatsoever !
Nevertheless , the colour field possesses mass by virtue of the fact it contains energy , much as the magnetic field of a magnet contains energy - witness its ability to draw in metal filings .
The mass of the magnetic field of even the strongest magnet is far too small to be measurable .
However , the colour force is enormously stronger than any conceivable magnetic force .
Consequently , the mass of the colour field is substantial .
In fact , it can perfectly account for the missing mass of ordinary matter .
Bizarrely , then , most of mass of you and me does come not from the fundamental building blocks of our bodies .
Instead , it comes from the glue that cements those building blocks together .
The inability of the Higgs mechanism to explain much of the mass of ordinary matter - or even predict the precise values of the masses of the fundamental particles - might be expected to dampen the enthusiasm of physicists .
Not a bit of it , however .
" A lot of hype is perpetrated about the Higgs mechanism and what it actually explains , " admits Wilczek .
Without doubt , the Higgs mechanism provides a vivid and intuitive picture of how ordinary matter acquires a small portion of its mass by accumulating the cosmic treacle of the Higgs field .
However , the kind of mass being talked about is , strictly speaking , the most esoteric type of all - a measure of the energy content of matter .
Think of it as microscopic book keeping .
If a particle at rest disintegrates , or " decays " , into other particles , the total energy of these particles must always be equal to the mass - energy of the original particle .
But the energy content of mass is , of course , only one of its characteristics .
Mass also opposes attempts to change its motion and reacts to gravity .
Where do inertial mass and gravitational mass come from ?
Like most physicists , Wilczek thinks these types of mass come along , part and parcel , with mass - energy .
In other words , the Higgs mechanism explains not just the energy content of mass but all aspects of mass .
However , others disagree .
" There is nothing in the Higgs ' theory that explicitly says mass - energy should doggedly oppose all attempts to change its motion or that it should respond in any shape or form to gravity , " says Bernard Haisch of the Calphysics Institute in Scotts Valley , California .
Haisch is perfectly prepared to believe that the rest mass of a particle - its mass - energy - is " explained " by the Higgs mechanism and that the rest mass is intrinsic to the particle .
However , Haisch believes that the inertial mass and gravitational mass of a particle are not explained by the Higgs mechanism and are not intrinsic .
If they are not intrinsic then there is only one other option .
They must be " extrinsic " .
" In other words , they must somehow arise from the interaction between a particle and the environment through which it moves , " says Haisch .
" That environment can only be the ' quantum vacuum ' . "
The quantum vacuum
The quantum vacuum is an unavoidable consequence of two things , the first of which is the existence of fields of force .
As pointed out , physicists view fundamental reality as a vast sea of such fields .
In their picture , known as " quantum field theory " , the fundamental particles are mere localised humps , or knots , in the underlying fields .
The best understood of all the fields , and the one with the greatest bearing on the everyday world because it glues together the atoms in our bodies - not to mention all other normal matter - is the electromagnetic field .
The electromagnetic field can undulate in an infinite number of different ways , each oscillation " mode " corresponding to a wave with a different wavelength .
Think of the waves at sea , which can range all the way from huge , rolling waves down to tiny ripples .
Naively , the vacuum of empty space would be expected to contain no electromagnetic waves whatsoever .
And this would be true but for the small matter of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle .
According to the principle , every conceivable oscillation of the electromagnetic field must contain at least a minimum amount of energy .
This seemingly innocuous rule has dramatic and profound implications for the vacuum because it means that each of the infinite number of possible oscillation modes of the electromagnetic field must be jittering with the minimum energy dictated by the uncertainty principle .
In other words , the existence of each mode is not simply a possibility , it is a certainty .
Far from being empty , the " quantum vacuum " is a fantastically choppy sea of fluctuating fields .
These quivering fields , known as " quantum " , or " zero - point " , fluctuations , can manifest themselves in a truly remarkable way .
Recall that fundamental particles are nothing more than localised hummocks in nature 's underlying fields .
Consequently , the choppy sea of the vacuum is continually conjuring particles into existence like microscopic rabbits out of hats .
Known as " virtual particles " , they have only a fleeting existence , popping into existence for far less than the blink of an eye before popping back out again .
Haisch began thinking about the intriguing possibility that the quantum vacuum might have something to do with inertial mass in February 1991 .
The trigger was a talk he attended by Alfonso Rueda of California State University in Long Beach .
It was about " stochastic electrodynamics " .
According to the idea , first devised in the 1960s , the quantum vacuum is absolutely central to the creation of the world .
Ultimately , all the bizarre " quantum " behaviour of microscopic particles can be traced back to the relentless buffeting they receive from the ceaselessly churning quantum vacuum .
Sitting in the audience of Rueda 's talk , Haisch had been pretty much letting it all waft over him when something Rueda said suddenly made him sit up and pay attention .
Rueda mentioned an esoteric discovery made independently by two physicists in the 1970s .
Paul Davies and Bill Unruh had been exploring Stephen Hawking 's remarkable idea that black holes are not completely black .
According to Hawking , the immense gravity close to a black hole distorts the quantum vacuum in such a way that the fleeting virtual particles can become real , fountaining out of the vacuum as permanent " Hawking radiation " .
Understanding exactly how Hawking radiation arises requires knowing that , when virtual particles pop out of the vacuum , they pop out in pairs - typically an electron - positron pair .
The positron is the " antiparticle " of the electron .
Every subatomic particle has an associated antiparticle with opposite properties such as electrical charge .
A particle and its antiparticle are always born together .
Furthermore , when a particle and its antiparticle meet , they self - destruct , or " annihilate " .
Such creations and annihilations are the stuff of the quantum vacuum .
All over space electron - positron pairs are continually winking into existence , lingering in the world for the merest of instants , then undergoing mutual annihilation and winking out again .
Close to a black hole , however , something else can happen .
During the fleeting life of an electron - positron pair , one of the particles can find itself dragged through the black hole 's " event horizon " - the point of no-return for in - falling matter .
Since the particle outside the hole now has no partner with which to annihilate , it has no means of popping back out of existence .
It has been elevated from the status of a transitory virtual particle to a real particle with a permanent existence .
All around the horizon of a black hole virtual particles from the quantum vacuum are continually being boosted to reality in this way , flying away from the hole as Hawking radiation .
Of course , ultimately something must pay for their mass - energy and that something is the gravitational field of the black hole , which gradually weakens as it loses an equivalent amount of energy .
What Davies and Unruh were interested in was exactly what the Hawking radiation would look like .
They concluded that an observer looking at the black hole would see radiation exactly like that which emerges from a hot furnace .
In the case of a furnace , the radiation is known as " thermal " radiation and has a mix of colours determined solely by the temperature of the furnace .
In the case of the black hole , the mix of colours is determined by the black hole 's gravity .
In some weird sense , then , a black hole 's gravity gives it a " temperature . "
Black holes are hot !
From this unexpected discovery , Davies and Unruh made an intriguing extrapolation .
Einstein had realised that gravity is indistinguishable from constant acceleration , at least in any small enough region of space .
This he called " the happiest thought of my life " and made a cornerstone of his theory of gravity .
The equivalence of gravity and acceleration enabled Davies and Unruh to extend their result about Hawking radiation .
Just as someone near a black hole would see heat radiation coming from the hole 's vicinity with a temperature dependent on its gravity , someone accelerating through space - that is , through the quantum vacuum - would see heat radiation coming from in front of them with a temperature dependent on their acceleration .
The virtual particles popping in and out of existence in the quantum vacuum actually have a remarkable property .
If an observer flies through the vacuum at constant speed - and it does not matter what that speed is , as long as it is constant - the view they see of virtual particles popping in and out of existence is the same behind them as in front of them .
This means that the quantum vacuum is completely compatible with Einstein 's special theory of relativity , which recognises that all observers travelling through space at uniform speed see the world in exactly the same way .
Because the vacuum looks the same to an observer flying through it at constant speed , it effectively behaves as if it is not there .
Just like the air in which we live , it has no discernible effect on us .
However , Davies and Unruh 's discovery that someone who accelerates through the quantum vacuum will find themselves bathed in heat shows that accelerated motion is fundamentally different from motion at constant speed .
From the point of view of an accelerated observer , the vacuum is transformed into a real , detectable thing , capable of affecting them .
To Haisch , listening to Rueda 's talk , this prompted an intriguing thought .
" If an accelerated body sees heat coming at it from in front , that heat might apply a force which slows the body , " says Haisch .
" I 'm an astrophysicist , you see .
I 'm used to the idea that heat radiation - for instance , sunlight - can exert a force on bodies such as the tiny dust particles that make up the tail of a comet . "
After the talk , Haisch told Rueda his idea and Rueda said he would do some calculations .
For a few months nothing happened .
Then , one morning , Haisch arrived at his office at Lockheed Martin 's Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory in Palo Alto to find his answer machine light flashing .
" Alfonso had left a message at 3 am ! " says Haisch .
" He was so tremendously excited by the result of a mammoth calculation he had been doing that could n't wait to tell me .
' I think I can explain Newton 's second law of motion !' he said . "
Newton 's second law , postulated in 1687 , is conventionally written as F = ma , where F is the force experienced by a body of mass , m , and a is the acceleration that results .
The law is in fact no more than a definition of inertial mass , which is defined as the ratio of the force applied to a body to the acceleration produced .
Rueda had examined in detai the electric and magnetic components of the electromagnetic radiation experienced by a body as it accelerates through the vacuum .
A magnetic field has long been known to exert a force on a moving electric charge .
In fact , this is the basis of the electric motor .
When an electric current - a flow of charged electrons - passes through a coil of wire placed in a magnetic field , the coil rotates on its spindle .
Rueda discovered that there would be a similar force between the magnetic field experienced by an accelerating body and the moving electric charges in the atoms of the body .
" And when he calculated the force he found it was exactly as required by Newton 's second law , " says Haisch .
" A retarding force which depended on the body 's acceleration .
After three centuries , someone had at last explained inertia . "
According to Rueda , inertial mass is not intrinsic to a body at all .
It is extrinsic , bestowed on a body from outside .
Specifically , it arises from the interaction between the basic building blocks of matter and the great roiling ferment of virtual particles that make up the quantum vacuum .
Haisch says he is not surprised by the idea that inertial mass is not intrinsic to a material body - that it is not a fundamental thing .
He points to the fact the inertial mass is impossible to measure directly .
Instead , people infer it .
They take two measurable quantities - the force applied to a body and the acceleration it produces - and deduce the mass of the body from the ratio .
The lot of inertial mass , Haisch believes , is to go the same way as space and time .
In the wake of Einstein 's special theory of relativity , both ceded their fundamental status to the speed of light .
" Inertial mass is not a fundamental thing , " says Haisch .
" The really fundamental thing turns out to be the quantum vacuum . "
If mass is not a fundamental thing , it may explain why it appears to come in so many different kinds - inertial mass , gravitational mass and rest mass , the mass associated with energy .
" It simply reveals a different face depending on how it is measured , " says Haisch .
So , what of the Higgs mechanism ?
Haisch sees no incompatibility between this and the electromagnetic interaction between a particle and the vacuum .
" The Higgs mechanism explains the rest mass of subatomic particles while the vacuum interaction explains their inertial mass , " he says .
Rueda agrees .
" The Higgs field deposits energy , and hence rest mass , around structures we call elementary particles , " he says , " The claim that this accumulated energy behaves in some way that gives such elementary particles the property of inertia is a mere hope .
You need something else for that - and we think we 've found it . "
As pointed out , the force carrier of the electromagnetic field is the photon .
At a microscopic level , therefore , the interaction between the constituent particles of matter and the quantum vacuum involves photons being exchanged between the virtual particles of the vacuum and the quarks and electrons in matter .
An electron is considered by physicists to be a truly fundamental and indivisible particle - a point - like concentration of electric charge .
However , in order to obtain his F = ma result , Rueda had to assume that such an electron jitters back and forth within a characteristic volume of space .
This may seem a bit of an arbitrary - not to say peculiar - assumption .
However , it revives an old idea proposed by Louis de Broglie and Erwin Schrodinger , two of the pioneers of quantum theory .
De Broglie and Schrodinger were puzzled that , in experiments in which photons rebound , or " scatter " , off electrons , the electrons behave exactly as if they have a particular size called the " Compton wavelength " .
To make sense of this , the two physicists proposed that an electron is in fact a point - like charge which jitters about randomly within a sphere of diameter the Compton wavelength .
They called this trembling motion " zitterbewegung " .
" Alfonso and I believe De Broglie and Schrodinger were onto something with their zitterbewegung , " says Haisch .
" Their mistake , however , was in thinking that the motion was intrinsic to an electron .
In fact , it is extrinsic - due to the random battering the point - charge receives from the jittery vacuum .
In effect , this smears out the electron , making it appear as big as the Compton wavelength . "
According to Haisch , it is always possible that this jittering motion could explain more than inertial mass .
" A massless particle may pick up energy from the zitterbewegung , hence acquiring what we think of as rest mass , " he says .
" It would be a neat , tidy package .
It might be possible to dispense with the Higgs mechanism altogether .
It strikes me as far more elegant than an undetected Higgs field . "
Piling speculation on speculation , Haisch and Rueda suspect that the interaction that produces inertia occurs preferentially at a special , " resonant " , frequency .
This is a frequency at which energy is most efficiently transferred from one body to another .
Think of someone pushing a swing .
Everyone knows there is a particular frequency - perhaps one once every 10 seconds - at which the energy in the push is most effectively transferred to the child on the swing , making it go higher and higher .
This frequency of once every 10 seconds is an everyday example of a resonant frequency .
Well , when Haisch and Rueda speculate that the interaction that produces inertia occurs preferentially at a resonant frequency , they speculate further that this resonant frequency is the zitterbewegung , or Compton , frequency .
" If we knew what caused this resonance , we would probably be able to explain the ratio of the various quarks rest masses to the electron rest mass , " says Haisch .
If , as Haisch and Rueda believe , inertial mass is a consequence of an electromagnetic interaction with the vacuum , this still cannot explain the small mass claimed for a particle such as the " neutrino " .
This is because it interacts via the weak nuclear force and not the electromagnetic force .
" The origin of neutrino mass must be in its interaction not with the electromagnetic zero - point fields of the vacuum but with the zero - point weak fields , " says Haisch .
Gravitational mass
If inertial mass does indeed have its origin in the interaction between matter and the quantum vacuum , what of gravitational mass ?
Well , inertial and gravitational mass are of exactly the same magnitude , an observation which is a cornerstone of general relativity .
This equivalence can logically have only a limited number of possible explanations .
One is that inertial mass has a gravitational origin .
This was the hope of the 19th - century Austrian philosopher Ernst Mach .
He postulated that inertia of a body was the result of the combined gravity of all the objects in the Universe .
The reason there is resistance when you try to stop a moving body or start a stationary body , Mach maintained , is because the stars and galaxies Universe are pulling against you !
Mach 's idea appealed enormously to Einstein .
He hoped that it would emerge as a natural consequence of his own theory of gravity .
However , he was to be disappointed .
Like everyone else , Einstein was reduced to assuming , without any understanding or proof , that matter has inertia .
Nowadays , Mach 's idea has fallen out of favour , principally because it requires the Universe to react instantaneously to the acceleration of a body on Earth .
However , we are pretty sure that the cosmic speed limit is set by the speed of light and that no influence , not even gravity , can act without any time delay .
A second logical possibility for the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass is that gravitational mass has an inertial origin .
In fact , this is what Einstein showed in general relativity .
There is in fact no " force " of gravity .
Bodies actually move under their own inertia along straight lines .
The straight lines , or " geodesics " , are actually in a higher , 4 - dimensional , space - time and so appear to us as curves .
However , even though general relativity shows that gravitational mass has an inertial origin , the theory still leaves unanswered : what is the origin of inertial mass ?
" Trying to coax inertia out of gravity or gravity out of inertia , you wind up with an inevitable circularity , " says Haisch .
The final logical explanation for the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass is that they share a common origin .
And this is what Haisch and Rueda think .
Both kinds of mass , they claim , arise from interactions of the electric charges of matter with the quantum vacuum .
But , whereas Haisch and Rueda 's idea of the origin of inertial mass is well developed , their idea of the origin of gravitational mass is far more speculative .
Basically , the two physicists believe , charges in a chunk of matter distort , or " polarise " , the quantum vacuum in their immediate vicinity .
In other words , they attract virtual particles with opposite electrical charges and repel virtual particles with similar electrical charges .
This distortion of the vacuum in turn interacts with the charges in another chunk of matter .
By this roundabout means , a force of attraction arises between the two chunks .
" The mechanism is so tortuous it might explain why gravity is so much weaker than the other fundamental forces of nature , " says Haisch .
" One mass does not pull directly on another mass but only through the intermediary of the quantum vacuum . "
Haisch and Rueda 's description may appear puzzling if you know anything about Einstein 's theory of gravity .
After all , general relativity " explains " gravity perfectly in terms of the warpage of higher dimensional space - time by matter .
At first glance , this " geometrical " picture does not appear to be at all compatible with the picture of Haisch and Rueda .
However , Haisch points out that the warpage of space described by Einstein 's theory is actually not directly measurable .
Instead , astronomers infer it from the bending of the paths of light rays passing through space .
If the light from a distant star passes close to the Sun on its way to the Earth , for instance , its path is bent by the warped space close to the Sun .
" If matter distorts , or ' polarises ' , the quantum vacuum , this changes its ability to bend light , or its ' refractive index ' , " says Haisch .
" The vacuum then bends the path of light just like a piece of glass does . "
Haisch conjectures that the change of refractive index of the vacuum caused by the presence of matter has exactly the same effect on the paths of light rays as the warpage of space which in Einstein 's theory is caused by the presence of matter .
In this way , all the mathematics of general relativity remains intact since space - time , though unwarped , looks exactly as if it is warped !
" I strongly suspect that the vacuum - inertia theory can be made consistent with general relativity and the warping of space - time , " says Rueda .
" But it is still too early to be certain . "
In their latest work , Rueda and Haisch even explain why inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same .
And it turns out to be remarkably straightforward .
If you accelerate through the quantum vacuum , the vacuum resists your motion , which is why you have inertia .
However , if you are held fixed in a gravitational field , it is the quantum vacuum that accelerates past you .
" But this immediately shows that the ' mass ' associated with inertia and the ' mass ' associated with weight must be equal because the two situations are the same , " says Haisch .
" Accelerating through the quantum vacuum or having the quantum vacuum accelerate past you are the same process .
Hence Einstein 's principle of equivalence is neatly explained . "
Perhaps the most mind - blowing consequence of gravitational and inertial mass owing their existence to the vacuum is the possibility of modifying both through modifying the vacuum .
If a way could be found to change the vacuum in the right way , it might be possible to nullify mass , making an inertia - less drive that could accelerate a spaceship from a standstill to the speed of light - the cosmic speed limit - in the blink of an eye !
SAN FRANCISCO  Lawrence Lessig , the Web legal scholar , said Wednesday that he was mulling a campaign for the House of Representatives , a move that could pit the Internet icon in a race against a Democratic loyalist .
Mr. Lessig would run for the seat left vacant by the Feb. 11 death of Representative Tom Lantos , who represented the 12th District of California for nearly 14 terms .
The district , south of San Francisco , runs straight through the heart of Silicon Valley , where Mr. Lessig is considered a celebrity , though one who wears glasses and uses phrases like “ net neutrality . ”
On Wednesday , Mr. Lessig ’s quasi - announcement was made , not surprisingly , in a posting on his blog and an accompanying 10 - minute Web video .
“ It is very rare to have the chance to live in times where there ’s the opportunity for fundamental change ; this is one of those times , ” said Mr. Lessig , a Stanford professor who is the founder of the Center for Internet and Society at the university .
“ We need to fix Washington now . ”

On Monday night , I stumbled upon the Dave Ramsey Prime Time on Fox Business Network Show and stopped channel surfing to watch it .
I heard about Dave Ramsey through my friends — many of whom greatly admire him ( e.g. , Ana , Randall , Lynnae , Gibble , and Mrs. Micah ) .
Personally , I like how he helps thousands of people get out of debt and live financially healthier lives .
So , what I am about to tell you was a shocker to me .
Toward the end of the show , a viewer asked about the best way to save for college .
I do n’t recall the exact words used , but Dave ’s advice went something like this :
For college savings , I recommend Education Savings Account ( ESA ) .
This is similar to your retirement IRA .
You can contribute up to $ 2,000 per year , you can invest it anyway you want , and it grows tax free .
If you want to contribute more than $ 2,000 , then I recommend that you look into 529 plans .
However , there are a lot of bad 529 plans out there and they are not very flexible .
With an ESA , you can choose whatever funds you want to invest in .
If you do n’t like it , you can roll it over to another fund as many times as you like .
The above is not an exact quote , but I think it accurately captures the gist of Dave Ramsey ’s college savings advice .
When I listened to this , I thought , “ No way ! that ’s terrible advice . ”
Granted , I understood the limited time , and how difficult it is to provide a well thought out answer when you have to do it spontaneously .
So nothing against Dave , but I ’d like to dig into this college savings advice , and tell you why I thought it was bad .
Note :
When I talk about 529 , I refer to direct plans because that ’s the type I prefer .
Why Did I Think Dave Ramsey ’s Advice Was n’t the Best ?
More Investment Options
Assuming the viewer was an inexperienced investor , advising him to choose ESA over a 529 College Savings Plan to take advantage of a broader range of investment options is actually more harmful .
I believe that inexperience investors are better off choosing a good 529 plan — i.e. , ones managed by TIAA - CREF or Vanguard — and stick to broad index funds that passively track the market .
Yes , Dave is right about the presence of bad 529 plans .
There are some out there , but it ’s still easier to find a good 529 Plan than learning how to properly invest in the stock market via an ESA .
There are plenty of helpful resources like the comparison chart from SavingForCollege.com and Kiplinger Top Plans , that will make choosing a good 529 College Savings Plan easier .
I am afraid that someone who ’s not knowledgeable about investing could run into some of these common pitfalls :
Choosing bad investments — be it , stocks , mutual funds , or ETFs
Paying too much commissions for trades
Selecting mutual funds , or ETFs , with a high expense ratio
Selecting mutual funds that have front - end load and / or redemption fee
Not being able to diversify enough with the small initial fund
By choosing a good 529 plan that offers no -load , low - cost funds — i.e. , New York ’s 529 College Savings Program — a lot of these potential pitfalls could be avoided .
Change Your Investment As Many Times As You Like
You ’re kidding , right ?
That ’s the kind of advice that will make an investor lose his shirt .
High turnover trading is plain old bad money advice .
There are many costs , hidden and not so hidden , associated with changing mutual funds or worse actively trading stocks and ETFs .
Some example of these costs include :
Trade commissions
Front - load fees
Redemption fees
Bid-ask spread
Asset Allocation , Regular Contribution , and Rebalancing
Personally , I believe the best strategy for an inexperienced investor is to invest in low - cost passive mutual funds using asset allocation , regular contribution , and rebalancing to enhance performance .
In general , these three things are easier to do with a 529 plan :
Asset Allocation —
Most 529 plans offer several funds in different asset classes .
You can set it up so new contributions are automatically distributed among different funds .
This would be a completely manual process with an ESA .

Regular Contribution —
As you may know , I like to build wealth little by little and automatically .
In my 529 plan , I have the plan automatically transfers money from my bank account each month .
Depending on your financial institution , automatic contribution to ESA may not be possible .

Rebalancing — Rebalancing capability is a standard feature in many 529 plans .
With a few mouse clicks , I could redistribute money among different funds to restore the original asset allocation percentages .
With an ESA , this would be a manual ( tedious and expensive ) process of buying and selling individual funds and stocks to get the asset allocation mix right .
Five More Reasons
Why 529 is Better Than ESA
Broader investment options were the main reason why Dave liked ESA better than 529 .
But there are so many advantages to using 529 that Dave did n’t mention .
Here are five of them :
Contribution Age Limit —
Age of the beneficiary does n’t matter when it comes to 529 Plans ; however , you cannot contribute to ESA once the account beneficiary reaches age 18 .
This is one of the neat features that allow you to start a 529 plan before your child is even born .
Deadline for Using the Funds —
With ESA , the beneficiary has to use the money by age 30 .
Money in a 529 plan could be used at any time during the beneficiary ’s lifetime .
Maximum Contribution —
There is a $ 2,000 per beneficiary per year limit for ESA .
The maximum contribution limit for 529 savings plans vary by state but they are generally much higher than ESA .
Phase Out Limit — 529 plans have no income limit , ESA does .
According to Money - zine.com , “ … the income limit for making a maximum contribution … for married couples filing joint tax returns … phase out at $ 220,000 in 2007 and 2008 .
For those not filing a joint return , the contribution limit is $ 110,000 . ”
Tax Advantage — Similar to Roth IRA , ESA contributions are not tax - deductible .
However , some states — e.g. , New York — allow 529 contributions to be deducted from state income for tax purposes .
So there you have it .
I think Dave is a great guy and I love his 7 Baby Steps , but even he is not infallible — we all make mistakes right ?
news Massive Fire Guts Queen West Block
Photo by aardvark from the Torontoist Flickr Pool .
Transit vehicles are being diverted and streets have been closed near Queen and Bathurst as firefighters battle a six - alarm blaze this morning .
The fire broke out about 5 a.m. and spread through eight low - rise buildings on the south side of Queen , consisting of fourteen addresses between Bathurst and Portland .
The destroyed block contained commercial properties Suspect Video , Duke ’s Cycle , National Sound , Preloved , the Jupiter head shop , Room + Furniture and Accessories , Pizzaiolo , and Organize By Design .
Second and third floor apartments have also been wiped - out .
All residents were safely evacuated .
About fifty emergency vehicles and 150 firefighters are reported at the area .
One building housing Duke ’s Cycle collapsed at about 7:30 a.m. , and CTV News reported from their helicopter that the brick wall of the adjacent building was leaning and could be on the verge of collapse .
Three people were treated for minor smoke inhalation , but no other injuries have been reported .
Emergency workers told some bystanders that it seems the fire originated in the National Sound building at 615 Queen Street West .
Fire crews are slated to be present on - scene for most of the day .
Early reports say the fire may have started in a rear shed , though a cause has yet to be established and it will take at least a week for authorities to poke through the rubble for a definitive answer .
Officials say that the damage could reach $ 10 million .
A reception centre for displaced residents was established today at the Trinity Bellwoods Community Centre , and the Fairmont Royal York Hotel is offering ten rooms at no cost over the next two nights .
The Salvation Army is helping out with food and replacement clothing , and nearby patisserie Clafouti donated food to the reception centre .
The Star has an updated map showing traffic and transit disruptions .

Climbing photography tips 'n' tricks
Text and pictures © 1990 - 2020 Guillaume Dargaud
Last updated on 2018/10/17
" As far as I knew , he had never taken a photograph before , and the summit of Everest was hardly the place to show him how . " — Edmund Hillary , referring to the Sherpa Tenzing Norgay .
What 's so special about my mountain pictures ?
That 's an email question I often get .
So , here are a few tricks for taking pictures while trying to breathe high up in the mountains , while belaying ( " yup , go ahead do the crux move , I 'm holding you ! " ) or while hanging by your fingertips ( " Heah , great angleeeEEEeee < Splat > ! " ) .
Obviously this information is only meant as a starter , there are plenty of website with great photo advice , or better books , or even better a subscription to Chasseur d'Images .
What is climbing photography ?
Taking pictures of climbers from the ground ?
Taking pictures of a boulderer with his butt on the ground ?
Taking pictures while climbing ?
Doing a climb with the specific intent of photographing it ?
?
Doing scenic photography of mountains and including some famous routes in the shot ?
Doing pictures for a guidebook ?
Documenting an expedition ?
Left : A picture taken by a friend showing me nearing the summit of Toclaraju , Peru .
I 'm visible as little more than a black fleck , even on the highest resolution scan .
There are different ways to do climbing photography , depending on where you are climbing and what you want to show .
For instance , take mountain climbing : basically you take pictures while you are climbing .
If you take only a close up of your partner , it 's not too interesting in itself so you need to include some background to show how high up you are , what kind of climbing your are doing ...
So it 's actually closer to scenic photography , except that you want to convey that you are in the picture ( or the back of it ) , living an adventure and not just taking a picture of some mountain from the road .
It 's enough to get the camera out every once in a while and take a shot and anyway you can't move away to show the general view .
Back home you can sort out the 3 basic kinds of pictures that come out of such a trip : climber close up , pure landscape and climber (s ) included in scenery .
It 's quite important to vary those 3 types of shots if you are doing the slide show of an expedition for instance : no one wants to see 100 pictures of mountains in succession , even if they are all perfect .
On the other hand , take rock climbing photography : you want to show the difficulty , the movement , the strength of the climber , but you are not particularly interested in the rock itself .
For this you need to act more like a real photographer : you have a subject and need to show it in a certain way , you are not part of it , it 's his climb not yours ( even if you did climb it just before ) .
You need to be a better photographer for this than for mountain climbing photography ; it 's sometimes more like a studio : making sure the light is right ( climbers always have their face in the dark against the rock ) , finding the proper angle ( left for this move , right for the next one maybe , from the top with the head up , from the bottom with the legs spread out ) , managing facial expressions , etc ...
So here 's a list of things I have to say about climbing photography , having started both activities at the same time 13 years ago .
Climber 's camera choice
Well , there are entire magazines devoted to helping you choose a camera .
I will only point out a few things : the ideal climbing camera should be light , sturdy , weather - resistant , with very sharp optical quality for landscapes , a flash for those early morning starts , long exposure capability for those easygoing camping pictures on a tripod , over / underexposure capabilities for snow or dark rock , easy to manipulate with gloves , very resistant to the cold , last a long time on its set of batteries , and so much more ...
Right : El Capitan at night , 1 hour exposure , 50 mm / f1.8 at 5.6 .
The headlamps of the climbers leave a trail of light .
It takes some power of will to take such a picture : hike up to the proper spot in the evening with the gear and a sleeping bag , set it up and take a bunch of picture as the night gets darker , increasing the exposure each time : 30s , 1 minute , 3 , 10 , 30 , 1 hour , 3 hours ...
The non-reciprocity of films in dark conditions makes it so that doubling the exposure does not double the amount of light on the film .
Bring an alarm clock .
Manual vs. Automated
It 's a religious war and although I 'd like to avoid taking sides , I have to say that the idea that an old fashion manual camera is more reliable than a new electronic one is actually quite wrong :
The batteries are smaller and run out of power very fast in the cold .
Then you are left with the 1/16 rule or similar to take your pictures .
They have a lot more cranks and wheels that grit and dust will target and clog .
Newer cameras usually have better protection against rain .
Old cameras contain greases that will freeze at low temperatures , particularly if they also contain dust .
Newer model have very little oil that is also more fluid .
Metal is heavier than plastic .
An older camera is just this , older .
Remember that it will fail someday ; and the older it gets , the more likely to fail .
The one true advantage manual cameras have is for long exposures : there 's no time limit on it .
All recent cameras use an electronic shutter that will drain the batteries in a few hours when using the B or T - pause .
Right : A picture taken with the camera programmed to take one shot every 10 minutes while I was soloing my hardest route ever in Peru ! 20 mm lens .
Nikon vs. Canon ( or Whatever brand vs Whichever brand )
Religious war .
Canons are light ( plastic ) which is important if you need to carry them up mountains .
On the other hand most Nikons ( used to ) accept normal AA batteries , which you can replace by Energizer Lithium for very cold weather conditions , which is even more important .
None of the people who had Canons in Antarctica could keep them running outside for more than an hour without an external power supply .
Personally I 've used Nikons for the last 15 years and they have never failed from the cold , and I 've been at - 50 °C ( - 58 °F ) ... strike that as of september 2005 : - 78.6 °C ( - 110 °F , not even counting the wind chill ) .
The point is , buy a camera that accept standard AA batteries , external power supplies are very expensive and a major pain to use .
And you can find AA batteries in the most remote places of Butphukistan .
BTW , I have nothing against Minolta or Pentax , I just do n't know them well and their lens offerings are way more expensive than Nikon / Canon / Sigma for specialty lenses ( think 20 mm or f2.8 zooms )
Point&shoot vs. Single Lens Reflex
For mountain climbing , it is much better to have a small camera always handy in your breast pocket than a top of the line but big camera that you have to keep inside your backpack .
When you want to take a pic and you are tired or in a hurry ( or as usual both together ) , just think about having to stop the party , remove you pack ( at the risk of dropping it ) , open it up ( at the risk of dropping things from it ) , take the camera out , take the pic and finally put everything back inside ...
There are few small cameras that fit the mountain climbers ' main requirements of being rugged with a good wide angle lens .
For film cameras , the Minolta TC - 1 , the Nikon Ti28 and the cheaper ( and also better designed ) Ricoh GR1 all have a 28 mm lens .
Avoid like the plague any P&S with a zoom , they have the worst lenses in existence and sharpness is essential for landscape photography .
If you want to go super light , avoid even more 110 mm format ( so - called ' spy cameras ' ) , but why not a Minox GT - E or GT - S ?
They have excellent optics and are famous for being the lightest 35 mm manual cameras ever made .
The problem is that they are also very fragile ( thin plastic ) , quite sensitive to humidity and impossible to operate with gloves ( or big fingers ! ) .
So the best solution is probably to have a big SLR in the pack and a tiny compact in the pocket .
Hyperfocal distance
The distance to the nearest plane of the depth of field ( the nearest object in focus ) when the lens is focused on infinity .
Also the distance to the plane of sharpest focus when infinity is at the farthest plane of the depth of field .
When focusing on the hyperfocal distance , the depth of field extends from half of the hyperfocal distance to infinity .
To find the HF distance , compute the K number beforehand for your lens , and write it on it : NK= Focal2/30
HF=NK / f ( to find the hyperfocal distance , divide the K number NK by the aperture )
For instance on a 28 mm lens used at f5.6 , NK=282/30=26 m and HF=26/5.6=4.7 m meaning if you focus 4.7 m away , everything will be in focus from 2.35 m to infinity .
Of course for this to be useful you need a camera that lets you select the aperture , that 's what the A mode is for .
My personal definition of a serious camera is that it must have an A mode , the rest is just details .
Manual focus vs. Autofocus
Let 's admit it , when climbing , there 's no way you can focus manually .
Either you have only one hand available while the other belays or holds you against gravity , or your are wearing thick gloves , or you do n't have time , or you have sunglasses on or you are holding the camera at arm 's length to point over the ledge ...
So is it a clear victory for autofocus ?
Not quite .
Most of the time you will focus on infinity anyway , so a manual camera pre-focused on infinity ( or better , on the hyperfocal ) will do just fine .
I wish there was a way to get cameras to focus automatically on their hyperfocal distance ( depending on the aperture ) , but I do n't know of a single model that does so : you either have to look at your lens marking ( not always present ) or compute it yourself .
Many compact cameras have a ' snap ' mode for quick focus on a standard distance , sometimes within the hyperfocal range .
Film vs. Digital , 2009 update
Up until about 2005 digital photography did n't have much to offer for the discerning climbing photographer .
Good digital SLR bodies are still quite expensive as of 2009 , they fear rain , they are heavy , you can't read their tiny screens in the sun , quality is not up to a good lens with a 100 iso film ...
But other factors have been getting better : battery drain is now in check , image storage is now cheaper than film + processing , trigger delay is all but gone , and wide angle lenses are available ( although far from cheaply ) ...
The fact that you can review your pictures immediately is an advantage when the ligh conditions are difficult , which is often the case with the high contrast found in the mountains ...
Personally I waited till 2007 to go digital .
I waited up for a 24x36 mm Nikon digital sensor , and when I was fed up I finally decided on the Fuji S5 pro for its superior ability to deal with high dynamic range without burning the highlights .
And 3 months later Nikon announced its full sensor D3 !
No , I 'm not bitter , I really do like the S5 , I would n't have been able to afford the D3 anyway and Nikon says you have to use their new ' optimized for the D3 ' FX lens range anyway .
Fat chance !
Beforehand I 'd been playing for a year with the Ricoh GRd which is a digital ' version ' of the GR1 , but although it 's a greatly convenient camera , I 'm not too satisfied of those burnt out highlights .
Another solution which I have n't tested could be to get a compact Fujifilm camera with a SuperCCD SR sensor ( but not HR ) , as you 'd get the same ability to withstand high contrasts as the S5 .
If you can find one with a wide angle you may end up with a perfect camera , but apparently they put cheap - ass sensors on their cheap cameras .
The only one I could find which may fit the bill is the cheap Fujifilm F480 , but I have n't tested it , so beware .
Come on Fuji , put an APS - size SuperCCD SR into a GRd body ( even if you need a crowbar to fit it in ) and I 'll sign the check in blood .
One of the main issue of climbing photography is that the landscapes are wide , so it only seems logical to use wide angles , and for the longest time wide angles were unavailable on digital cameras ( both SLRs or compacts ) .
But besides the fact that wide angles are now availables on SLRs and some compacts have lenses equivalent to the old 28 mm , one capability of digital cameras makes this less of a requirement : the ability to take several images and combine them into a panorama , not necessarily horizontal .
In a few shutter release and 5 minutes of software use such as PTgui , you can make a 180° panorama , a 100 megapixels image worthy of a chamber camera or wide perspective normally unatainable without a fisheye lens .
I loved my GR21 , but I finally sold it in late 2007 .
But do n't forget that the main thing that you lose in the move to digital is the excellent $ 200 slide projector showing a better resolution and brighter slide than anything you could ever dream of ( and much less afford ) in digital .
Add some friends and lots of beer and you are set for a full re-enactment of your exploits on El Cap .
Cons of digital photography : Pros of digital photography : Price of a new setup ( bodies , lenses , memory cards ... )
Ca n't keep your old lenses in practice even if they say you can in theory , due to CCDs being smaller than film .
Weight ( extra bateries , extra cards , charger , portable HD , laptop ... )
Lack or price of wide angle lenses
Lower resolution than a 50iso film
Aliasing problems ( ' stripped tie ' ) on most CCD types
Really crappy compression and / or extrapolation on some early or cheap models
No more slide shows with beer and friends on giant 10x10 ft screen
Classic computer problems : bugs , firmware updates , new models every 6 months , frustrating lack of tech support ...
Memory cards + hard drives are now cheaper than film + processing
Lack of noise / grain on smooth areas such as a deep blue sky
Instant quality control ( unless you are in the sun )
Instant ISO change ( very convenient for early morning starts )
Full control of the white balance
No more double archiving of slides / negatives and files ( but also means one less backup , and you still need to work out a proper RAW to TIF to JPG to low - res JPG workflow )
Shooting info available in the EXIF data field
Faster click - to - web time
Lenses optimized for APS - sized sensors are smaller and lighter than their 24x36 equivalent .
For instance compare the Sigma 70- 200 / f2.8 and its equivalent 50-150 / f2.8 : 1380g vs 770g , half the weight .
Remember that if it 's big and heavy , it wo n't ever go climbing with you ( applies to partners as well ) .
So yes , as of 2007 I 've finally sold out and gone digital , but I 'm not entirely satisfied of the change .

Color vs. B&W
Thinking about Ansel Adams , hey ?
Well , you might be disappointed ...
I do n't want to disprove your talent , but Adams was n't using a camera but a chamber with huge negatives .
It helped a lot in displaying a smooth grain with things like rock or showing the most minute details and shade variation .
Even the latest B&W films like the Fuji Acros cannot match that in tiny 24x36 .
Adams also had tricks like putting silver dust on his paper during the enlargement process , something that is still hard to replicate with PhotoShop .
My first tries at B &W climbing photography were not impressive ; but then recently I tried again , and if you focus more on the climber than on the climbing scene itself , it sometimes gives good results .
Here 's a B &W portfolio of a climb in the Black Canyon and more explanations here , including a way to make Ansel Adams pics !

Vivitar AF 28-80 f/3.5-5.6 ***
This is a selection if you want only one lens on your camera .
Why this choice ?
A focal below 28 mm is necessary for landscapes ; zooms with too much range ( like 28-200 ) do not have enough aperture and have lots of flare .
The stars ( 0 to *****) indicate the optical quality only , regardless of the actual usability of the lens in a climbing environment ( for instance the Sigma 28 - 105 f/ 2.8 - 4 has only 2 stars but makes a great climbing zoom because it 's small , light but still opens at 2.8 ) .
Observations : constant f/2.8 are heavy , but lenses that start above 3.5 are too dark and usually cheaply made ( which is better if you are gonna drop them off a cliff ) .
Zoom vs. Fixed lens
A lens choice summary in 10 lines ?
That 's impossible but let 's just say that for scenic photography you want two attributes in your lens : wide angle ( and here I mean something below 24 mm , but not a fish - eye ) and the utmost sharpness .
Zooms are a lot more convenient , particularly when climbing , but fixed lenses have a better absolute resolution , something required for landscape .
Zooms also exhibit more flare ( internal reflections due to the presence of the sun near the corners of the picture ) .
The newer wide angle zooms like 28 - something , 24 - something or even now 20 - something seem damn convenient as a unique lens but there 's a price to pay in terms of weight , flare , loss of sharpness , vignetting , etc ...
When I travel light I usually take only a 20 mm / f2.8 and a 28-70 / f2.8 or a 28-105/f2.8-3.5 .
A tele lens might be useful every once in a while to give a ' fly on the wall ' appearance to climbers high up , but they do n't make ' in the action ' pictures .
Overall telephoto lenses are not very interesting for climbing , except for taking portraits when bored at base camp .
The focal length does determine the relative perspective between foreground and background ; only a wide angle lens can make a foreground element like a climber stand out dramatically in relation to its background .
Recent wide angle zooms like the Nikon 24 - 85 2.8/4 IF AF - DW or the Sigma 24- 70 3.5/5.6 AF
Aspherical would probably make great single lenses for climbing photography , provided they do n't flare too much when the sun is in the frame , something I hate and that will also ruin assembled panoramas .
If interested , you will find more information about what kind of equipment I use ( or have used ) on a separate page .
A lens shade is quite useful to avoid the flare caused by the sun , but is often impossibly inconvenient to carry ( or affix one handed while belaying ) .
Some lens makers like Sigma make lenses with an integrated shade that you only need to reverse on the lens , or even on a few models like the 28-70 mm / f2.8-4 AFD where the shade comes up automatically when you zoom .
I must confess that if the shade is not integrated in the lens , I never carry it around and would rather place my other hand ( if available ) between lens and sun .
The golden rule of photography says to put more money in your lenses than in the camera itself .
So Pro lenses or normal lenses ?
Even if you have the money , the choice may not be so easy .
A pro lens , like a 28 - 70/2.8 weight about 4 times more than its f4.5 counterpart and is also much bulkier .
Remember , there 's no point in buying an expensive lens if you are going to leave it at home or at the base of the cliff ...
And the extra stops of light might not be such a big deal if your pictures are all on bright days climbing in the sun .
Right :
It does n't take the latest model camera to make landscape photography .
Here 's Chris Kidd's homemade camera , perfect for doing large panoramic pictures on 60x170 mm films .
Some wood , a lens , a few simple cranks , 15 hours of work and that 's all it takes ... ( Photo C. Kidd )
Video ?
Bah !
With some rare exceptions , watching people climb on a video is about as interesting as watching paint dry .
Extraordinary cameras
Climbers have the chance that several very specialized pro cameras work great for climbing photography ( if they are rich enough ) .
First if you combine wide angle and Point & Shoot you get the Ricoh GR21 , the only P&S with a 21 mm , thus the ultimate wet dream camera for the light mountain climbing photographer .
I dreamed about it for 10 years and then saved for 2 years when it was first announced in 1999 .
Only 4000 were ever produced .
I 've used it extensively and loved its convenience and sharpness .
Mountains are big , and you are small at the base , so the perspective sometimes end up not being quite up to what you thought .
A similar problem faced by Architecture photographers , which they solve by using shift / tilt lenses .
This way you can keep the plane of the film vertical , parallel to the cliff , while having the lens focus on the middle of it , high up .
Those lenses , like the Arsat 2.8/35 Shift Lens or the various Nikon PC lenses are expensive and old - fashioned ( no AF , tripod required ... ) .
You can do computer post - processing with similar results nowadays .
Panoramic camera ?
Mountain climbing photography goes hand in hand with landscape photography , so a panoramic camera seems like a good idea .
Or does it ?
99 % of the cameras ( both compacts and reflex ) that have a ' panoramic mode ' actually do it by hiding the upper and lower third of the image .
That 's it , and it applies both to film and digital cameras .
You can do the same thing by making an enlargement of your pictures and cutting off the top and bottom with a pair of scissors or a photoshop crop !
The quality goes down since you have less surface area on the film / sensor .
The only advantage is that the lab usually makes the print directly on panoramic paper ; with a normal camera you need to order an enlargement and then cut it off .
Very few cameras , like the old Ricoh R1 have a bi-focal lens that can give a wider field of view when in pano mode ( 24 mm vs. 30 mm ) .
And do n't get me started on the stupid APS format , a format designed by marketers to enable them to suck more money from ignorant customers : cameras more expensive , fewer functions , hardly any of the promised advanced functions ever implemented , smaller film area ( an enormous drawback for landscape photography where you want the highest resolution possible ) , prints that cost twice as much , NO SLIDES , no B & W ... 10 years after its introduction , this format is mostly gone .
There are a few real panoramic cameras , real meaning that they take the picture on the whole height of the film ( 24 mm ) and wider laterally than the usual 36 mm .
This is achieved for instance by placing a 35 mm film inside a 6x6 camera , allowing for 24x60 mm shots .
Or special cameras like the Hasselblad X - pan on 35 mm or the gigantic Fuji GX617 on 60x170 mm film !
And do n't get me started on chambers , the holy grail of landscape photography , which you need a Caterpillar to carry .
And ever dreamt of taking a picture of all the mountains around you in one shot ?
Some rotating cameras like the old Russian Horizon 360 or some new digital cameras can do it by rotating during the shot .
The price is in proportion to the rarity of the camera , and obviously you need to be able to do something with the picture later , as it's not easy to find a lab that can make prints out of a 24x400 mm negative , and it 's not easy to scan either .
To give you an idea , that 's only about 3 pictures per roll of 36 ...
The cheap solution , although there is some additional work involved , is to take a series of normal shots , scan them and use a stitching program like my old PanoWarp freeware or a more powerful and expensive program to put them all together .
It weight 0 , cost close to 0 and with some careful work gives amazing panoramas that you can print easily with a photo printer that accepts roll paper .
As of 2007 it takes no more than 5 minutes of work to produce and excellent image .
Note about 360° pictures : they are usually not very interesting when taken from mountain summits : there 's no foreground , the valley is far below , barely visible because of the contrast , and the summit itself is not visible because ... you are standing on it !
Take such panoramas from mountain passes , valleys , or lower mountains ( Mt Frances below Denali comes to mind ) .

You either need lots of patience or an advanced programmable databack .
Protecting your camera
Protect your camera
Get a good pouch against rain and dust .
Zipper or velcro / clip ?
The velcro + clip system is very fast for when you need to get a quick shot while belaying .
The zipper is essential if it 's dusty or rainy but it needs two hands to operate .
The solution is to get a bag with both and use whichever suits you .
Dust is not only annoying in the viewfinder , it can scrape films , leave spots on digital sensors and damage the internal mechanics of any camera , so get it cleaned professionally every once in a while after climbing those desert towers ...
Do n't ever use an airjet spray on the inside : you can break the curtain and you will only send the dust flying even deeper inside the camera .
If you come back from a climbing trip and all your films show a scrape at the same height , you may try to save them by dipping them in Tetenal Repolisan ; I 've used it and it works great if the scrape is not on the emulsion side .
When I want to go really light and do n't want to bother with a bulky pouch , I wrap my big lenses in a thick sock and my camera in a T - shirt in the pack .
Makes for a smelly lens and a sweaty camera on long hikes ...
Tape all you can of your camera and lenses with gaffer tape ( unlike duct tape it removes without leaving marks ) , and leave it there until you resell the camera .
It protects against banging on rocks , scrapes and more importantly thieves .
You have no idea how attractive a big Nikon label can be to thieves ; on the other hand , a tape - covered camera is not so sexy .
In the same vein , if I could just find a TopCon sticker to put on top ...
Carry a plastic bag in case it rains .
Yeah , a supermarket bag will do fine .
Attach a small sling to the camera ( right ) so you can clip it directly to your harness , belay or clumsy partner ...
When I 'm belaying and want to get ready to take pictures , I get the camera out of the pouch , turn it on and clip it to a shoulder sling .
I just let it hang , being careful not to hit it against the rock , and it takes me only a second to take a picture from this position .
With film cameras , use a filter on your front lens .
A UV filter ( left : without , right : with UV filter ) , SkyLight or polarizing filter will do fine ( see below ) .
Once a chunk of ice hit my 20 mm dead on while I was taking a picture of my partner leading some steep ice .
The UV filter was shattered but the $ 1000 lens did n't have a scratch !
Except for the protection , UV filters are useless on digital cameras when the [ Auto White Balance ] performs the same function and much more .
Left : A picture of the summit of Mt Cook ( New Zealand ) without either UV filter or color cast correction .
Right :
The same picture with either a UV filter , a color balance ( on digital camera ) or a post - scan color cast correction .
Notice that here the effect is a bit too much , sunny snow has become yellow .
Shadows should always stay a bit blueish .
Ever lost a lens cap ?
Annoying , heh !
A little trick is to put a little piece of string between the lens and the cap with two drops of glue .
The problem is that now it will flap in the wind or hang in your view while you aim down .
Nah , I 'd rather loose one every once in a while and replace it with a brand - less nondescript one ( having ' Nikon ' written in big is like having ' Steal me ' written ) .
Get insurance coverage , but only if the camera is very recent , and be sure to read the fine print ( just remember how many life and medical insurances exclude climbing in the fine prints ) .
Just remember that insurance companies are in this business to make money , so sure , they will insure your camera if you ask them , but be aware of things like depreciation : you certainly do n't want to insure that brand new digital body that in 2 years only will be worth about $ 50 on the used market ...
It 's up to you .
Left : Just to show that little ' details ' should be photographed as well .
You think a scary old rusty piton like that is not important ?
Climbing in Gaeta , on the coast between Rome and Napoli .
Breaking it ...
If you invested your life savings in a camera , you might consider not climbing with it at all ...
When I got stuck in a squeeze chimney on Castleton Tower way above my last protection , I briefly had the thought of throwing down the camera bag attached to my harness , with the expensive F100 in it !
Your camera will get rained on , banged up and dusty even if you are careful .
My F801s had 2 trips for cleanup / minor repairs and my five Ricohs each had a trip to the repair shop !
In the most extreme conditions , take a waterproof disposable camera , averages pictures are always better than no pictures and a $ 1000 repair bill ...
And if the climb is a once in a lifetime opportunity ( are n't all climbs like that ? ) , take more than one camera .
On Cho - Oyu I had a big Nikon F100 and a small Ricoh Gr1 .
I used the Ricoh exclusively above Camp 1 .
Only problem is that my sister had fallen down the stairs with it ( while 8 months pregnant , the morning of my wedding [ I 'm not making this up ] ) and broken it .
I got it back from the repair store a few days before leaving but , unbeknown to me , the shutter was n't working .
So I came back with plenty of empty rolls of slide .
It 's frustrating enough to break a camera , but to loose hundreds of unique pictures as well ...
If it had been my only camera , shudder ...
If you break your camera at the beginning of a trip in a far country , or if it gets stolen , there wo n't be any pictures without a backup camera which you most likely wo n't be able to purchase there .
I met a guy who climbed the Nose of El Capitan many years ago .
He had a small all metal Rollei in a leather bag and dropped it almost at the top of the route ; they were particularly bummed since they had all the pics of the ascent still inside .
They searched the base for a while and found it , crushed but still inside the leather bag .
The joke was that they brought it all smashed up to the camera store and asked for a repair ...
But in the darkroom they did manage to get the film out .
I saw his slides , they were a bit scratched up but otherwise pretty good .
If you are afraid of leading long rock climbing routes with a camera attached to your harness , here 's a little trick : leave the camera with your partner at the belay and lead the pitch .
Your second can then climb the route with much less risk for the camera ( no bouncing lead fall possible here ) .
About 2 / 3 rd of the way up , lower a loop of rope to him and get him to attach the pouch to the rope .
Pull it up and start shooting .
Obviously you need a good pouch that can stand a bit of scraping and bouncing against the rock , and it 's easier to do if the face is vertical , the route straight up , there 's no wind , you are not in too much of a hurry and you partner is willing to carry the extra load ( this also applies to windbreakers and sandwiches ) .
When you are getting desperate in that flared overhanging offwidth , you can always use your enormous TopCon with its 20 - 600 mm lens as a chockstone for protection .
Just kidding to see if you are still with me here .
Against third world country street thieves who sometimes use razor blades to cut off your shoulder strap and run off with your camera , here 's a little trick : double up the strap with a metal wire threaded in .
And put tape over too attractive ' Nikon ' or ' Canon ' symbols .
And if you do break your lens or camera , it does n't hurt to have a go at repairing it yourself before sending it for repair .
With only a set of tiny screwdrivers , some glue and some patience I 've managed to repair 3 of my lenses , one of which had a disloged diaphragm , the other a locked zoom barrel , and the 3rd one had been cleanly broken in half in a fall ...
Hmmm , no , that was n't a climbing fall , I tripped on my shoelaces in the parking lot ...
Cold weather
Right : A penguin taking a pause for a photographer .
As for the cold , I always use Energizer 's Hi-Energy Lithium ( LithEon , ref L91 or X92 ) AA batteries .
Even at - 50 °C they work perfectly ( any other kind dies pitifully , especially the kind of small lithium batteries they put in most compacts nowadays ) .
They even make other batteries with that technology , like AAA or the CR2 for the Ricoh .
But in the unlikely event that you have to withstand temperatures below even that , know that no battery in the world can help you , unless you want to lug a car battery around .
Directly linked to this battery issue is the fact that digital cameras die very fast in the cold as they drain more power .
To give you an idea , at - 70 °C my F100 would last about 30 minutes while a more recent D70 would n't last more than 3 or 4 minutes .
So in summary it 's a very good idea to carry a spare set of batteries in a warm pocket .
If you need to warm up a battery fast , put it under you armpit , directly against the skin .
I do n't recommend carrying the camera under your clothes too close to the body since the sweat will fog it when you put it back from outside ( not only the lens , but also the film inside , leaving grey spots on the pics ) , but sometimes it 's the only solution .
In extreme cold conditions the film may freeze and break in the camera , and this has happened once to me after having left the camera in long exposure at - 70 °C .
Solutions involve wrapping the camera in insulating foil and dropping a couple heat packs underneath or bringing the camera back inside to let it warm up before advancing the film .
Note that this is not an option with motorized cameras .
For this reason for my winterover in Dome C I bought an old Nikon EM for 50 $ on eBay .
I would just put it on a tripod outside , trigger it with a cable release and let it for a bunch of hours to do star rotations , shooting stars and satellite overpasses , then bring it back inside and let it warm before the next shoot .
Also having a manual film advance lets you wind the film carefully .
Right :
The green stripes are where the gelatin on the film broke during advancement .
This film later snapped completely while shooting for 7 hours at - 70 °C and I had to retrieve it in the darkroom .
Another strange issue I 've had to deal with in extreme cold ( think well below - 50 °C ) is exploding batteries .
Three times I 've had batteries become so hot in either my GPS or my camera that they scorched the skin against the pocket where they were .
They did n't really explode but when I pulled them out they were all bloated .
So again , a manual camera with the battery removed will work just fine , you just have to guess the appropriate exposure .
About very cold weather you 'll still hear this old story that you need to have the grease removed from the camera as it can harden and lock the mechanisms ...
Well for several decades there have n't been any grease inside cameras , only very liquid synthetic lubricants that do n't harden with the cold , so rest easy .
Also practice operating your camera at home while wearing big gloves .
There will be times when you do n't want to remove them to fiddle with little button settings or tiny wheels .
In other words , if there are functions that you cannot use with gloves , learn to do without .
For instance I personally like to use the camera in Aperture Priority mode and turn the aperture wheel manually ; but it 's impossible to do with gloves , so on cold days I just set the camera to Program mode .
And while we are at it , if you have a tiny P&S , be careful not to put your glove in front of the lens ...
Yeah , I know it sounds like stupidly obvious advice but you wo n't believe how many mountain climbing pictures I 've seen with a fuzzy red blob in the corner .

Figure out what works for you , what turns you on , what gives you the greatest amount of energy and feeling of satisfaction . " — Galen Rowell .
Misc issues
Film choice
Use slide film ; as you can't get as much detail with negatives , except when comparing high sensitivities which you 'll never use for climbing anyway ; and slide shows with friends and a good glass / mug / bucket of wine can be so fun ...
Same goes for digital , use the lowest sensitivity of your camera ( usually 100iso , 50 or 200 ) .
I used to use mostly Fujichrome Velvia 50 asa slide film .
50 asa is not much , but when you are on snow or with a wide aperture lens you get great results .
Colors are awesome and grain is virtually non existent .
Personally I like it better than even Kodachrome 25 !
The bluish hue on some of my pictures is due to the altitude .
The Velvia , when underexposed , will give you green snow .
Yuk !
In 2000 , the new Fujichrome Provia 100 F made me change my mind .
It has the same grain as the Velvia , colors almost as saturated and it gives you more flexibility in the exposure .
I sometimes take B&W , in which case I use Fuji Acros 100 ( after a decade with the Kodak T - Max 100 ) and an orange - red or greenish filter .
If you have a digital camera and you find the hues on the image to be somewhat off , there are two things to do : calibrate your screen and take RAW files which you can later process in software to extract the proper color balance .
Left :
The effect of light coming parallel to the rock , enhancing every tiny edge .
That 's me on a 5.11d at Shelf Road , Colorado .
Right : Example of digital manipulation put to good use : sequence of pictures of Jason on SuperCrack in Utah .
Put the camera on a tripod , take a bunch of shots , scan them all then use the clone brush of your graphic program to copy the different climbers from each separate shot .
The right time
Mostly , when in the mountains , the trade secret for the best landscapes is to take the pictures at the right time : around sunset and sunrise you have a 10 minutes window when the light is great ( less at the equator , a lot more near the poles ) .
Avoid taking pictures in the middle of the day , except if you can have the light of the sun parallel to a cliff , thus casting long shadows off tiny outcrops and highlighting details .
Look at the picture on the right to have an idea of what I mean by that : see how the skin of the climber ( me ) is burned out by too much direct light , while the tiniest holds on the rock are visible .
Watch for cloud movements .
Wait while they are in front of the sun if you expect them to go away .
Polarizing filter
Its function is to stop any light that is not polarized according to a given angle .
This polarization angle is an intrinsic property of every photon of light .
So when used on a normal beam of light it just stops half of the photons ( since they come with random angles ) , requiring more exposure .
Now if the light is polarized in the same direction as the filter , it goes through unchanged ; if it is polarized 90° from it , it is stopped entirely .
Now what does this have to do with climbing ?
Different physical mechanisms can polarize a normally random light , first of all a reflection ( on glass or on a surface of water ) , but also the diffraction of the light of the sun by the atmosphere .
This diffraction is most effective 90° from the sun : look at the sky through a polarizing filter : in the direction of the sun or 180° away from it , there 's no difference ; 90° left or right you can darken it a lot by turning the filter .
Know how to place the camera in respect to your subject while pointing 90° from the sun ; and yes , this works great on digital cameras too .
Filters
As you do n't want to haul tons of accessories with you up a climb , the two main filters used for climbing photography are the UV filter and the polarizing filter .
The first one stops the UV from getting through the lens .
It does n't make a huge difference at sea level , but at altitude where the amount of UV is quite high it does reduce the blueish hue of the pictures ( note that if you have a digital camera you can emulate it by using the white balance function , and if you have a scanner you can use the color balance filters to remove it afterwards ) .
Besides that , its true use is to protect the front lens against shocks , falling ice , bouncing against rocks and scraping in the pack in case you loose your lens cap .
When selecting a UV filter in a store , open all the various models ' packages and place them on a white sheet of paper ; select the least colored one .
Avoid skylight filters which give a pinkish hue to the images .
The polarizing filters come in two varieties , circular required for AF cameras and linear for manual or compact cameras .
The effect is the same .
This filter makes darker skies on pictures when used properly , it increases colour saturation and it brings out clouds and foliage against the sky .
Its drawbacks are : it eats up about 2 stops of light , you need to rotate it each time for best results , it 's a pain to use on lenses with a rotating front lens and it gives weird results on wide angles ( half the sky clear , the other half dark ) .
If the atmosphere is loaded with humidity , there 's not much effect , but at very high altitude it can give you a not very natural looking ink - black sky that makes it look like you are climbing in outer space ...
It 's possible to use polarizing filters on some compact camera , but you have to remove it each time to figure out the angle of rotation by sight , and you must overexpose by two stops ( most compacts do n't let you do that though ) .
Exposure
Plenty of people will say " over - expose on snow " , " use the spot meter " , " meter your hand " , " Use the 1/16 rule " and other tricks , but the truth is , with modern SLRs you can trust the matrix metering in 99 % of the situations , even on snow .
You have a doubt , a violently backlit subject or a potential exceptional shot ?
Take 2 additional shots , bracketing lighter and darker by one stop .
Film is cheap compared to having to hike in again to take the same shot , do n't you think ?
The only time I consistently over - expose are on north - facing ice climbs , otherwise the ice turns out too dark .
And also sometimes on rock climbing in the shade , particularly if the background is lower and in the sun , it will trick the meter .
Left : Notice how the flash brightens up the ice , particularly the falling chunks which would be invisible otherwise .
That 's Jenny ice climbing in the Ouray ice park , Colorado .
When there is a lot of contrast , think about using a flash .
It 's not useful if everything is in the shade ( it will only make the foreground appear too bright and the background too dark ) , but there are 2 places where it 's quite good : rock climbing and ice climbing .
Rock climbers always have their face turned towards the rock , cutting off the light .
Use the flash , associated with the rear - curtain , to light it up a bit .
Only problem is that , because of the distances involved , you need a powerful flash for that , and it's not very convenient to carry an external flash up a mountain .
For ice climbing the context is different since usually the climb happens on a north face and there 's no sun ; even a small flash from a compact camera will put reflections and sparkles in the ice .
Just remember that most compacts ' flashes wo n't work further than 2~3 meters .
Notice the flash enhancing the falling ice on the picture on the right ?
Tripod
Yes , a tripod is always useful , think about night pictures , star rotations , climbing sequences , long stands waiting for that 9a move , self portraits ...
Three choices only for climbers :
A very small super light one that fits in a pocket .
Even if it's all plastic and can barely hold the weight of your camera , it 's good enough to put the camera on a rock and orient it the direction you want .
Most photo stores have those for cheap .
Really take the smallest so you will not be tempted to leave it at home !
The Gitzo Mountaineer G1128 is quite expensive but very lightweight thanks to its carbon structure .
The legs fold in 4 so it will fit in a pack even though it 's a full 1m40 extended ( not counting the optional head ) .

While climbing
Right : Jenny and Lisa merging vertical perspective while climbing in Golden , Colorado . 20 mm .
As you will notice soon enough , it 's quite hard to climb and take pictures at the same time .
No I do n't mean it literally .
If you want to do the hardest routes , you can't afford the burden of a camera .
If you want to take well crafted pictures you can't spend most of your time / energy climbing .
It 's a tradeoff .
One handed operation is very important .
Some cameras like the Ricoh can be pulled out of the pouch , turned on , used and tugged safely back inside only with the right hand .
Same , if a little harder with the F100 .
So it 's a good point for checking out a camera in a Mom& Pop store instead of ordering it on Internet .
For instance the Fujifilm Silvi F2.8 has one trigger button on each side , indeed a rare camera for left handed people .
For rock climbing , get a locking belaying device .
It will allow you to take pictures while belaying ( well , kind of ... ) .
Just do n't let your partner see you !
If you have a small P&S camera , keep it in your breast pocket ( or some other pocket that wo n't get crushed if you fall off ) .
While belaying , attach the camera to a shoulder sling with a biner , let it hang away from rock and belaying device .
Remove the lens cap .
pre-focus it and set it to some Program mode while your partner is not moving ( or not looking ) ; this way you can grab it and take a shot in less than a second when she is in the heat of action .
Also if it was your lead , try to organize the belay so as to facilitate photography : make your tie - in line just the right length so you can look over the ledge safely ( that 's why I prefer to tie in with a clove hitch instead of an often too short daisy chain ) .
Right :
Where 's the bottom , where 's the top ?

Advanced tricks
Some advanced cameras ( like the MF - 21 databack for the Nikon F801s ) allow you to do tricks like very long exposure ( good for night pictures with star rotations , picture 1 above ) , automatic multiple exposures ( picture 3 above ) or long - delay self - portraits if you want to take pictures of yourself while you are quite far ( picture 2 above ) .
I like to keep track of the date and time a picture was taken , but I hate to see it on the pictures .
For film , a solution is the databack for the Nikon F4/F5 which prints it between the frames ( but inconvenient on slides since it disappears under the mount ) .
Better is a cable + software to retrieve them like HarTalk , but you still have to sort things out .
The best solution so far is some Contax which leave the first two slides blank and then , on rewind , write all the film information on them so you can just keep all the slides together .
Obviously this is not an issue on digital cameras as all the info is embedded within the Exif field and sometimes even in the filename .
For long exposure , you need a tripod ( if there 's no wind ) or a plastic bag filled with rice / dirt .
Take a bunch of shots below f3.5 from 1 minute to 20 minutes if the full moon is up or 10 minutes to 3 hours if it 's pitch black .
For star rotation pictures , you need a sky as black as possible ( no moon , no city lights nearby ) ; and do n't walk around the camera with a headlamp while it 's taking the shot unless you know exactly what you are doing .
I recommend purchasing a used manual camera like the Nikon FM on ebay ( ~50 $ ) : remove the battery , add a cable release and you are set for exposures as long as you want ( use low sensitivity film ) .
This beats digital .
It 's very hard to take good rock climbing pictures if it 's just you and your partner on a route because you are either right below or right above him / her .
The best times to take pictures are on traverses .
So a corolary of the previous statement is that you should be more than two climbers .
Either one party of 3 : one to climb , one to belay and one to take pictures ; or two parties .
That 's how pro photographers do it : they climb or rappel the route in advance and wait in a good spot for the party of ' models ' .
And another pro trick is to use two long poles ( up to 5 meters ) to move away from the rock while on rappel ; this way you can be in the back of the climber .
Above : Possibilities of orientation while holding the camera vertical : crack climbing , hard overhang or resting on the ground !
Yes , it 's the same picture of Jenny on Devil 's Tower El Matador .
Perspective
Right : Brad stemming a vertical perspective .
Golden , Colorado . 20 mm .
A note about perspective : one normally holds the camera in a straight manner , either horizontally or vertically , but it 's not illegal to cheat by tilting the camera a bit in order to make things appear steeper .
But make sure that there is no horizon line in the frame and also that hanging things like ropes , quickdraws , hair or even trees wo n't give you away ...
Beware of clouds in particular .
Be careful when you do it and do n't overdo it : if the cheat is visible , the picture will end up in the garbage .
Also if you hold the axis of the camera vertically ( either shooting towards the ground or the sky ) , the usual rules of perspective do n't apply anymore and you can decide to put the sky / cliff / model anywhere , even after the picture has been shot : just rotate the picture to a more dramatic position .
Above : Examples from Devil 's Tower El Matador holding the camera pointing vertically with 3 different rotations .
The overall impression is quite different although they all seem like proper pictures : just crawling on the ground , crack climbing or insane overhang .
Yes , it 's the same picture .
Also on the right are two pictures taken with a wide angle pointing up , you see how the vertical lines merge in the middle .
Be creative !
One of the best training ground for creative climbing photography is bouldering .
Nothing looks more similar to a boulder than another boulder , and it's not easy to render in an impressive way someone who still has his butt barely off the ground ...
So use the whole nine yard : super wide angle , extreme close ups , flash , pics from above or right between the legs , slow motions , second curtain , multiple exposures , expressions ( distorted faces ) , details ( crimping fingers , crying eyes , cringing teeth ... ) , light effects ( shadow canceled by reflectors , sunlight diffused through chalk cloud ... ) , repetitive falls shown in sequence , important surroundings ( worried spotters ) , body movements ( think dance ) , trash ...
The advantage of bouldering photography is that you can take with you as much gear as you want ( reflectors and flashes come to mind ) .
Forget about taking pictures fom the ground : you do n't see the climber 's face and she 's gonna be too far , for instance top - rope climbing hardly ever gives results worth keeping .
Of course there are exceptions .
As I stated before , the best angles are on traverses but also diagonally from above .
Look at magazines .
In their competition against one another climbing magazines are very creative in their choice of photography ( if only they would compete on the editorial content as well ... ) .
Get inspiration by analyzing how they were done or even imitate , it does n't matter if the original was on a 5.14 and yours is on a 5.7 .
People
Left : Climber on top of the Lost Arrow , Yosemite .
I had to tell him before I traversed that I wanted to take some shots of him standing on the summit .
20 mm lens .
It may not be photography of top models , but pay attention to what they look like : if they are mostly undressed , enhance the muscles by playing on the direction of the light , if they are dressed make sure it 's colorful , and if they are climbing bums make sure their sweat - drenched ripped - off shirts show all the food - stains of the last two months .
And if you are thinking about publications , remember that you need to have a written permission from the models ( even for your website ) .
Several times
I 've had people ask me to remove a picture of them I 'd taken from a distance and did n't bother to ask for authorization .
It happens .
Still about ' models ' , pay attention to details , in particular the helmet always hides half of the head and casts a dark shadow over the eyes , hiding them in the dark .
Ask your partner to remove his / her helmet , just the time to take a shot or two ; and do n't drop rocks in the meanwhile !
Actually it 's a general problem of rock - climbing : the climber faces the rock and never has light on his face , so the face is always hard to see .
The only remedy is using a powerful flash to light up the shadows .
It 's quite impractical to carry up routes , but think about it if you do only a top - rope and have it sent to you somehow .
Or ask your model / partner to turn her / his head towards the light .
If you have good looking people around , try to get them to climb something for the picture .
If you have a good looking rock , try to get someone to climb it for the picture .
A classical example is a protruding spire ( pic on left ) taken from another spire , you need to ask another party to climb it while you take pictures , and not only that , you sometimes need to ask them to take poses ( " lay back from the wall " , " stand on top " , " now do a handstand " ) , promise them prints as an incentive !
It 's hard to yell orders from a distance at someone who 's busy doing knots or getting pumped on the crux .
Illustrate .
Some of the best climbing shots are n't from actual climbs ; they are of climbers joking , gearing up , topping out in the sunset , tossing ropes , camping or whatever .
Right : A tiny spec of a hiker gives a sense of scale to the ridge of the Vercors and Mt Aiguille .
Even if all you care about is the mountain , introducing humans somewhere in the image will give a sense of scale to what otherwise may just be a pile of rocks .
That is , unless it 's Tomo Cesen on the 4 km high South Face of Lhotse taken from kms away , in which case it wo n't even fill a pixel on the image ...
" Free soloing can be deadly , even if it looks great in the photos . " — From a Climbing editorial .
Soloing
A few cameras offer gadgets that can be useful for the solo climber taking a pic of his own scared face while hanging by the other hand .
For instance the Fujifilm Silvi F2.8 has couple things that make life easier when taking pictures of yourself :
Two triggers on either side of the camera , so you can hold it with either hand ( left handed people will love it and it's also good for taking pics while belaying ) ;
A tiny indicator that tells you if you are aiming at yourself properly ;
An infrared remote control ;
An optional date stamp ( so that archaeologists of future generations will know when you fell into that crevasse ) .
Stupid details
Hold your camera horizontal !
[ except if you want to fake the steepness , see above ] .
It sounds like totally obvious and stupid advice , but when you are on a slope without too many reference points it 's not so easy to do .
As a reference use the horizon line if you can see any of it , or the underside of clouds , or the vertical lines shown by trees ...
Now that I do panoramas and I need to connect pictures to each others , the horizontality becomes crucial and I 've noticed I always tilt my camera about 1° to the left if I do n't pay attention .
I purchased a gridded focusing screen ( for Nikon , the reference is ' E type ' ) and it helps a lot .
Some digital cameras can display optional grid lines in the viewfinder or on the LCD screen ; use that very good option .
Long hair is a major pain when taking shots on windy days .
It shows up on a lot of pictures .
Shave it or glue it ( that 's what I 'd do if only Jenny would let me ) !
When taking pics with a small P&S and wearing gloves , be careful not to put your gloves in front of the camera ...
Sounds silly , but you have no idea how many pics I 've seen with a big red blob on a side , especially on vertical shots .
When it 's cold and windless , try not to breath too hard while focusing , even if out of breath : ice deposit can fog the lens , or more often the eyepiece , and then you have to wait for it to clear up .
Never attempt to clean a lens with a dirty glove !
Careful when switching lenses on a wall , make sure you have all the movements planned in advance , and also make sure that even if you loose balance ( from a tug on the rope for instance ) you wo n't drop everything .
Just think about your 1000 $ lens bouncing down the cliff and you 'll be able to grip the lens just as much as the crimpers on the lead that got you to the belay anyway .
Take the pictures yourself .
Yes , the stupidest tip of all , but oh so true .
If you want a picture with someone in it , do n't ask Billy - Bob Passerby to take it of you .
He 'll take a shitty shot even if you prepare all the settings beforehand .
Ask him to pose instead .
Even with 7 missing teeth the result is likely to be better this way .
Too bad you wo n't be on it but you can't be both photographer and model ( and neither can Billy - Bob ) ...
Do n't forget to take pictures when you are in trouble .
A typical slide shows go something like this : " ... and then we had to bivy and it was tough and we barely survived and we were rescued after a week and all but I 'm sorry I was too cold / hungry / tired to take pictures " .
The part that will interest both climbers and non climbers the most is never documented .
For instance I do n't have any pictures of the mexicans who offered me shelter after my solo ascent of Huascaran and I regret it , as well as many others situations that are now fading from memory .
Disclaimer : I 'm not saying to take pictures when danger is looming instead of running for shelter ; what I mean is that most people take pictures only when conditions are ideal ; and when they are tired , hungry , thirsty , cold , late , in their sleeping bag or such , they forget all about photography .
Keep in mind that in those cases the quality of the picture is secondary , it becomes reporting instead of art .
When I came back from Dumont d'Urville , the windiest place on Earth , I noticed that I had only _one_ picture taken during a bout of katabatic wind .
One , over an entire year when half the time the winds were above 150 km / h... and I came back with only pics of sunny days that made Antarctica look like an easygoing ski resort .
Get out of your sleeping bag .
Yeah , it 's nice and cozy , and you are tired , but some of the best pictures are taken at night : star rotations if there 's no moon , moonlight over mountaintops otherwise .
You need a tripod ( even tiny ) and a camera that can do B or T pause .
B pause is the most common but it 's useless ' as is ' : the shutter stays open as long as you keep your finger on the trigger .
Since the camera will vibrate if you touch it in any way , you can't take any picture this way ( and I 'm not even taking finger cramps into consideration ) ; it needs a cable release which most cameras cannot even have !
Companies that put a B - pause on a camera without cable release should be fined .

Companies that put a B - pause on a camera without cable release should be fined .
The best and most simple solution is the T - pause : press once and the exposure starts ; come back after a few beers , press a 2nd time and the exposure stops .
Very few cameras have that ( the Ricoh GR1 / GR21 comes to mind ) ...
" Move back !
Move back ! "
Be careful when you say that in the mountains , it 's exactly how Catherine Destivelle broke a leg in Antarctica : she took a step backward to fit in the frame and fell off the summit !
Ensued a heinous self - rescue ...
Be careful up there , do n't take risks just to take a picture : my friend Fabio fell 26 meters when he tried to take a picture over the rim of a cliff .
Do n't worry , he was okay ( after 6 months in the hospital ) , just a little bit uglier than before .
He even managed to take a lead fall on a multipitch climb and loosen a few screws the very day he was finally released from the hospital ...
Setups
Right : Lightning strike picture in front of our condo , Colorado . 20 mm .
Put the camera on a tripod with a cable release in T - pause .
Close to a fair amount ( say f / 16 or more )
Determine the maximum exposure from the meter ( say 1 minutes ) and never go above less than half of that ( you want the sky to be dark ) .
Start the exposure and release it as soon as either a lightning occurs or you reach the maximum time .
A large angle lens and a lot of film are necessary .
If you want to try during daylight storms , you will need a neutral density filter to increase the exposure time .
It 's much cheaper to use a digital camera for that .
So , after all this text , what are the best equipment setups for climbing photography ?
It depends on how light you wanna be ...
Superlight - Film A small compact camera ( like Ricoh GR1 or Silvi F2.8 ) in a pocket or tied to the harness , a tiny tripod in the pack , one spare roll of Provia 100 F .
For multi- pitch rock climbs , long mountain routes where you need to go fast and light ...
Superlight - Digital I have n't found a way yet ( 2007 ) .
The Ricoh GRd is a fine camera but it suffers from overblown highlights even if you lower the contrast of the image .
A compact Fuji with both a SuperCCD SR sensor and a wide angle zoom would be ideal but I 'm not aware of any model .
Day trip
Same as above plus an SLR with something like a 28 - 105 ( film ) or 17 - 50 ( digital ) zoom and a 20 mm fixed focal , polarizing filter , a tiny tripod , some Provia 100 F if you use film , spare batteries , a plastic bag for the rain .
For easy mountain routes , rock climbing where you leave the pack ( and the camera ) at the base ...
Expedition , car camping ...
A film SLR with 28-70 / f2.8 , 70-210/f2.8 - 4 and 20 mm , or a digital SLR with 17-50 / f2.8 , 50-150 / f2.8 - 4 , lens shades , a compact camera backup , polarizing filter , partial grey filter ( to darken skies ) , cable release , stable tripod , large flash , spare films and batteries , a hand - crank or solar battery charger , spare lens cap , insurance .
Conclusion
So , if there can be only one climbing camera , I 'll choose ... the Panasonic LX3 in 2009 .
You get better at climbing by climbing .
You get better at photography by taking pictures as often as possible .
Make your own conclusion for climbing photography .
And I 'm sure you could take plenty of excellent pictures by doing the exact opposite of all the advice I gave here .
I also believe that if the climb is hard , high and scary the pictures will be interesting , particularly if there is a good story wrapped around !
For some great climbing pictures on the Web , look at : Tuan 's photography page and Galen Rowell 's pro pictures .
RIP
Galen , I 'd never met you but I 'll miss your great pictures .

Aurora observatory opens on remote Arctic island .
Eyes on the sky : the Svalbard observatory is ideally placed to watch the aurora .
M. Hopkin / Nature
SVALBARD
For many people , living through the murky twilight of a polar winter would be a depressing experience .
But not for the scientists working at a new observatory on the remote Norwegian island of Svalbard .
For them , the Arctic darkness gives them the perfect view of the aurora borealis , also known as the northern lights .
These mysterious swirls of light , visible in the polar sky , are caused when superfast particles spat out by the Sun 's nuclear inferno hit our atmosphere , causing atoms high in the sky to give off a ghostly glow .
These aurorae are only visible in polar regions because the Sun 's particles are channelled along the Earth 's magnetic field lines , which emerge roughly from Earth 's poles .
Because they occur at altitudes of more than 80 kilometres , studying them requires very sensitive optical instruments , and a decent vantage - point far from any light pollution .
The new Kjell Henriksen Observatory , perched at the top of the Advent Valley outside Svalbard 's largest settlement , Longyearbyen , offers just that .
Svalbard provides " a window into space " , says Fred Sigernes , an atmospheric researcher at the University Centre in Svalbard , which runs the new observatory .
It joins several other facilities that already study the northern lights .
Opened last week by Norway 's higher - education minister , Tora Aasland , the new observatory currently houses instruments from 16 institutions in 7 countries .
" There are facilities for all sorts of people and instruments , " says Dag Lorentzen , also from the University Centren in Svalbard .
The instruments are mainly optical , because the aurora borealis gives off visible light .
The observatory will be one of the few places on Svalbard that will be at its busiest during the winter months , says Lorentzen .
Though some work has already begun , the main optical telescope will be installed this summer ; so the real action will begin next winter , when researchers will be observing the dark skies around the clock .
Northern dark
From late October onwards , Svalbard , at a latitude of about 78 º
North , is plunged into round - the - clock darkness .
Now , in late February , it is only two weeks since the official ' polar dawn ' , and by mid-morning still only the mountaintops are tinged with the Sun 's tentative pinkish rays .
Down in Longyearbyen , the light , reflected off the snowy slopes , has an eerie bluish tinge — the town will not see direct sunlight for a few days yet .
The researchers at the observatory have a fairly unorthodox commute to work .
The journey from Longyearbyen involves driving along the wide glacial Advent Valley to Mine no .
7 — Svalbard 's only still - functioning coal mine .
From there , the observatory is reached in army - surplus vehicles , which bump and rumble up the frozen slopes on caterpillar treads .
So sensitive are the instruments at the observatory that visitors are not even allowed to use headlights when driving up the hillside , and all communal areas within the observatory have heavy shutters on their windows .
Once at the observatory , access to the building is currently through the back door , as the main entrance is under 2 metres of snow .
But they 're prepared for poor weather .
They have 10 tonnes of backup batteries for power emergencies , and several rooms full of bunk beds for sleeping in the event of storms .
Lorentzen and his colleagues have already done an 18 - day stint at the observatory , while waiting for the right conditions to launch a radar rocket into the atmosphere to collect data on the chemicals given off when the aurora lights are produced .
On the day side
Ironically , Svalbard 's long polar night will also allow researchers to study what are often referred to as the ' dayside aurora ' .
The most commonly visible northern lights are the ' nightside aurora ' , which occur when solar - wind particles are ' slingshotted ' around by Earth 's magnetic field and enter the atmosphere on the side of Earth facing away from the Sun .
That 's why northern lights are typically visible at night .
ADVERTISEMENT
But during the noon darkness of Svalbard 's winter , observers should be able to see the dayside aurora , which enter our atmosphere directly .
Without the extra slingshot magnetic kick , these particles are less energetic , so produce a fainter , reddish glow .
The observatory 's researchers hope that their data could soon help to answer more general questions about solar weather , of which the northern lights are just one side - effect .
Large solar storms , which produce spectacular auroral displays , can also knock out communications satellites , force planes to be diverted , and mess up your in - car global positioning system .
The Sun is currently in the weakest phase of its 11 - year activity cycle — within a few years , such solar flare - ups are set to become more common .
It may even be possible , one day , to harvest the immense energy outbursts behind the northern lights , Lorentzen says , although he admits that currently we have no idea how .
" All we know is that it is a lot of energy , " he says .
“ We have facts for those who think , arguments for those who reason ; but he who cannot be reasoned out of his prejudices must be laughed out of them ; he who can not be argued out of his selfishness must be shamed out of it by the mirror of his hateful self held up relentlessly before his eyes . ”
— Wendell Phillips , American abolitionist , 1853
Culture jamming tactics can be put to use to further a political or activist agenda .
I ’ll give the gold medal to the anonymous poet who managed to hide the phrase “ Li Peng Step Down ! ” in the characters of a patriotic poem in the official Chinese Communist Party newspaper .
A silver to the Barbie Liberation Organization for switching the voice - generating units in talking Barbie dolls with the ones in talking G.I .
Joe dolls and returning the dolls post - surgically to the toy store .
The two dolls then made strides against the tyranny of gender roles , Barbie yelling “ Vengeance is mine ” while Joe offered : “ Let ’s go shopping ! ”
And a bronze to the Veterans of Future Wars — founded at Princeton University in 1936 to parody the bottom - line patriotism of organized veterans groups .
Eventually the group would claim 50,000 members in chapters on hundreds of campuses :
“ Their first manifesto in the Princetonian argued that sooner or later there would be another war and that it would only be an act of justice for Congress to grant a $ 1000 cash bonus to all men between the ages of 18 and 36 .
Legally the bonus would be payable in 1965 , but since Congress seemed bent on paying bonuses before they were due , the actual payment date should be June 1936 , with , of course , an additional 3 percent annual interest compounded back from 1965 to 1936 .
In this way the future veterans would receive their benefits while all were still alive to enjoy them .
A national salute was adopted , a modified version of the then famous Fascist greeting : an arm held straight out in the direction of Washington , the palm turned up receptively . ”
The photographs of Iraqi prisoners abused at the U.S. prison at Abu Ghraib ( or its Orwellian pseudonym : “ Camp Redemption ” ) were more than evidence — they were potent icons , pictures that told more than thousands of words .
And war critics did what they could to keep the American public from turning away from those icons — by putting reminders here and there and elsewhere in public view .
When orwellian antihero John Poindexter was assigned to head up the United States government ’s Total Information Awareness project , an unorganized group of pranksters decided to give Admiral Poindexter a taste of what total information awareness feels like from the other side .
They found his home phone number and address , and posted this information — along with a link to a satellite photo of his house — far and wide on the internet .
It all started when Matt Smith , a columnist for the SF Weekly , wrote an article about Poindexter ’s new intelligence bureau , that read , in part :
… I dialed John and Linda Poindexter ’s number — ( 301 ) 424-6613 -- at their home at 10 Barrington Fare in Rockville , Md … Why … is their $ 269,700 Rockville , Md. , house covered with artificial siding , according to Maryland tax records ?
Should n’t a Reagan conspirator be able to afford repainting every seven years ?
Is the Donald Douglas Poindexter listed in Maryland sex - offender records any relation to the good admiral ?
What do Tom Maxwell , at 8 Barrington Fare , and James Galvin , at 12 Barrington Fare , think of their spooky neighbor ?
… For those of you revolutionaries with private investigator friends , ask for even more sensitive information on Reagan ’s former national security adviser .
I ’d be glad to publish anything readers can convincingly claim to have obtained legally .

Another promising project is the Government Information Awareness site .
Its goal is to provide a comprehensive , easy - to - use repository of information on officials , people , organizations and corporations involved in the United States governing machinery .
“ In the United States , there is a widening gap between a citizen ’s ability to monitor his or her government and the government ’s ability to monitor a citizen . ”
The Open Government Information Awareness project aims to restore the balance .
Political elections are ripe for sniggling .
Jam the Vote !
In India , Nanjunda Swamy has extended the work of his countryman Mohandas Gandhi with something he calls “ laughing satyagraha ” :
Earlier this year Mr. Nanjunda Swamy gathered 50,000 farmers to sit outside the state secretariat and tried to “ laugh the Government out . ”
They had tried all the usual forms of nonviolent protest — sit-ins , blockades , refusing to pay taxes , picketing , blockading roads — but the State Government remained unmoved by the farmers ’ plea for land reforms and an increase in produce prices .
The farmers ’ only reward was getting arrested or shot .
The farmers , surrounded by policemen , just sat on the lawn outside the Government building and told jokes against Mr. Bangarappa .
And the jokes ?
“ They were puns , actually , ” Mr. Nanjunda Swamy said .
After warming up the farmers with a little word - play , it was enough simply to say “ Bangarappa ! ” over the megaphone and the farmers would shake with laughter .
The police made no arrests ( “ How could they ?
All we did was laugh ” ) and no public property was damaged .
“ It ’s as easy to make people laugh as to make them angry .
Laughter can be a very powerful weapon against the Government , ” Mr. Nanjunda Swamy said .
Do n’t try that trick in Belarus , though !
A group of “ flash mob ” practitioners there designed a “ smile mob ” — they were all to “ come to central square and wander around smiling . ”
That ’s it .
Or was , until 100 riot cops showed up and arrested them .
An ongoing guerrilla hack in search of volunteers is the project to interrupt pathological , media - simulated social interaction .

Mark Thomas has been described as “ Michael Moore meets Sy Hersh .
But way more pissed off . ”
His projects have included :
leading protests , giving out leading spies ’ cell phone numbers , launching one - man WMD inspections , showing up at a Nestle factory “ dressed as a huge teddy bear , and then produc[ing ] a huge ghetto - blaster playing Zimbabwe ’s health minister making serious allegations about Nestle ’s baby - milk marketing methods . ”
For an encore , he exposed illegal arms merchants by helping “ a bunch of teenaged schoolgirls set up an online arms dealership ” that managed to negotiate for tanks , grenade launchers and torture equipment .
The right wing magazine FrontPage is up in arms over an anarchist urban assault vehicle being underwritten as a “ performance art ” piece by a foundation grant and promoted by a Kansas City art space .
That vehicle , the “ Tactical Ice Cream Unit ” is a project of the Center for Tactical Magic .
Paul Mavrides reports :
in 1969 at Akron University , some friends and I got together and decided to stage a Vietnam War protest .
We announced we were going to burn a puppy to death with homemade napalm to demonstrate just how horrible napalm burns are .
We anticipated attracting a large crowd of outraged people who would show up to stop it , whereupon you announce , “ There is no puppy .
There ’s no napalm .
How can you people justify showing up to save a dog , when there ’s an actual war going on and this napalm is being used on actual people ? ”
So you embarrass them and make them feel guilty — make ’em stop and think . …
The Los Angeles Cacophony Society pulled a similar stunt more recently , posting flyers claiming “ We Will Kill Our Pets To Protest the War . ”
Mavrides continues :
In Berkeley some people … replaced the “ WHAT TO DO IN AN EMERGENCY ” pictograms on BART with their own version telling what to do in case of nuclear attack .
They detailed a whole procedure for living in a BART car after the attack , giving advice like , “ Reserve one car to isolate all the bodies in . ”
Even if most of the daily commuters did n’t notice it , the few who did were probably put off balance for the rest of the day .
Terry
Fox tells of a similarly - intended provocation :
In front of the museum was a large garden of jasmine plants , which bloom once every seven years .
They had been growing for six years and were due to blossom soon .
During the opening of the exhibition
Fox cremated these plants with a flame - thrower of the type used in Vietnam to provide the wealthy people who regularly enjoyed the garden with a concrete example of the type of action they supported with their dollars and their complacency .
I burned the whole thing with a flamethrower , and it just left a slight border of these plants , and they ended up having to dig them all out , it destroyed them .
So , then , the next day when these people came to have their lunch there , it was just a burned - out plot , you know .
I mean , it was the same thing that they were doing in Vietnam .
Nobody would get excited about napalming Vietnam , but you burn some flowers that they like to sit near , and it ’s like …
In 2001 , all 273 members of South Korea ’s parliament received packages in the mail containing “ human excrement . ”
One wit remarked that at least in South Korea , when it comes to politics , people still give a shit .
Which reminds me of Ales Pushkin , a performance artist from Belarus , who was arrested in 1999 for “ malicious hooliganism ” and “ disgracing state symbols ” for pushing a wheelbarrow of manure up to the presidential administration building and shoveling out the contents .
At the outbreak of the 2003 invasion of Iraq , protesters in San Francisco staged a vomit - in at the Federal Building to demonstrate how the war made them feel .
There ’s a hoax doing the rounds that claims that the United States Internal Revenue Service is giving tax refunds to African - Americans in a program of reparations for the institution of slavery in America .
It ’s not true .
But that ’s not really accurate , either , since in 2000 and 2001 , the IRS mistakenly paid out over thirty million dollars to people claiming this hoax tax credit !
The Germans picked a starker response to the tax man .
In 2002 , they started the “ last shirt for Schröder ” campaign — tens of thousands of Germans dramatizing that Chancellor Gerhard Schröder was taxing the shirts off of their backs by mailing their shirts directly to his office .
Slobodan Milosevic found his control of Serbian government challenged by a group of young , creative , theatrical protesters who go by the name Otpor .
Take a look at their accomplishments — they succeeded !
In Peru , The Civil Society Collective used street theater and provocative props in their protest against Fujimori ’s government .
( And they won their battle , too ) .
City plans for refurbishing the waterfront area of South Boston called for half of the area to remain as “ open space . ”
But by the time politicians and developers got through with the paperwork , “ open space ” was redefined to include sidewalks and roads .
So in the Spring of 2001 , Lisa Greenfield and Jennifer Moses organized a group to cover a Boston bridge end - to - end with grass to dramatize their idea of what open space looks like .
In San Francisco , a group called PARK ( ing ) creates open - space over the asphalt by feeding the meters and installing miniature parks in parking spaces .
Another group , P( LOT ) , created tents in the shape of cars so that people could camp in urban parking spaces .
Another group came up with a do - it - yourself traffic calming plan in Oxford — they moved their living room to the middle of the street !
In 1998 , the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals offered to open its spacious and well - stocked “ dog apartments ” as temporary housing for the homeless .
A Modest Proposal perhaps ?
18th Century classics of the subgenre of literary guerrilla hacks include the satirical essays A Modest Proposal by Jonathan Swift and Shortest Way with the Dissenters by Daniel Defoe .
Benjamin Franklin wrote a letter - to - the - editor back in 1790 in which he claimed to have found a well - reasoned defense of slavery remarkably similar to a recent speech by Senator Jackson - only this defense was written in 1687 by one Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim to justify the enslavement of white Christians in Algeria .
A somewhat more recent example is the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion , a politically - motivated guerrilla hack that has been used by governments as diverse as Czarist Russia , Nazi Germany , and Idi Amin ’s Uganda to whip up antisemitism .
Yet more recently , the Report from Iron Mountain was dreamed up by a pack of leftists during the Cold War as a satire of machiavellian governmental manipulation .
It takes the form of a thinktank - analysis of the effect peace would have on the health of the state , and comes down firmly in favor of continual war as good for the country .
The report simulated so accurately the voice of authority that anti-government militia types are fond of pointing to it today as evidence of a government conspiracy .
The Italian situationist Gianfranco Sanguinetti piled an Iron Mountain of his own in 1975 with his “ The Last Chance to Save Capitalism in Italy . ”
A group of hawks calling themselves ProtestWarrior took it on themselves to parody the simplistic slogans and reasoning of some of those who protested the overhyped sequel to Operation Desert Storm .
They attended a peace rally , holding signs with slogans like “ Saddam Only Kills His Own People — It ’s None of Our Business ! ”
A ( wisely ) anonymous broadside advocates using simulated assassination to accomplish all of the aims of political assassination without actually killing anyone .
This tactic was put into practice at least once — in May , 2004 , spectators at the British House of Commons threw bags of purple - dyed flour at Prime Minister Tony Blair .
“ The attack would have been ‘ incredibly serious ’ if the dyed flour had been anthrax or ricin , ” reported the BBC .
In 1981 , the British environmentalist group “ Friends of the Earth ” produced mailing labels addressed to the U.K.
Prime Minister that were designed to be attached to discarded soda cans , as a way of promoting government support for recycling .
In 1961 , another group protested Soviet nuclear testing by piling hundreds of milk bottles in front of the Soviet embassy in London , each bearing the legend “ Danger : Radioactive . ”
Buffo reports : “ In 1960 a series of demonstrations were held in Japan against the renewal of the Japanese - U.S. security treaty .
President Eisenhower was to make a state visit to promote the pact .
However , on the night of the 19th June , 300,000 Sohyo ( trade union ) members and 40,000 militants of the Zengakuren converged on the Diet ( parliament ) building in a ‘ snake - dance . ’
Then they held a mass urination on the main steps of the building .
The Japanese government was obliged to ask Eisenhower to cancel his visit . ”
And the Drudge Report brings us the news of a mass - mooning by a thousand protesters outside U.S. President George W. Bush ’s hotel room at Gothenburg , Sweeden .
The act of mass - mooning politicians goes back at least as far 1844 Tasmania , and may have been the origin of the term “ Flash Mob ” !
In 1967 a group of Chinese soldiers got in the habit of starting their mornings with a mass - mooning of Soviet troops across the border .
Their Soviet comrades responded by holding up portraits of Chairman Mao when the mooning began !
And , of course , in protest publicity as in advertising , nudity sells .
Protesting via disrobing is catching on from Nigeria to Antarctica .
Upset at slum neighborhood conditions in Chicago , a group called The Woodlawn Organization piled dead rats on the steps of City Hall .
John F. Kennedy ran for president of the United States government saying that he would end racial discrimination in federally - assisted housing “ with one stroke of the pen . ”
When , years after he was elected , he still had n’t fulfilled his promise , the Congress for Racial Equality sent thousands of bottles of ink to the White House in protest .
Environmentally - minded pranksters in Kingston , Ontario — upset that the government was clearcutting old - growth forests in Temagami — decided that public opinion might be influenced if the trees were being cut down in town where the voters lived .
So they created a phony memo from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources explaining that in order to avoid “ an exorbitant municipal tax , ” the government would “ capitalize on the current high market values of oak and maple lumber ” by hacking down “ 5,000 trees in city parks and along city streets . ”
Naturally , the long - overdue outrage was provoked .
Another way they have of harassing the natives up in The Maple Leaf State is to test military aircraft in low - altitude bombing runs on their land .
Again , the Kingston pranksters bring it home , posting official notices alleging that the overflights and bombings will be happening where the white people live !
A similar prank from the Kingston crew was a notice calling for immediate military draft registration that was posted at a war - happy college campus back when the U.S. and its allies were fighting to keep Kuwait safe for monarchy .
The Call to Register was designed to sober up some of the rambo - talking ( but draft - eligible ) men on campus .
People opposed to the military draft by the United States government during the Vietnam War invented a form of protest they called the “ comply - in . ”
According to one activist , “ The law … requires registrants to inform the draft boards within ten days of any change in address or status .
This means changes in religion , mental attitude and everything else .
We want everyone to take this law so seriously that they inform their board of every single change … ”
Some billboard improvements have a political message , like this modification of a military recruitment advertisement , or this hybrid of an anti-drug billboard and a wry commentary on the return of the George Bush political dynasty .
Famous in U.S. revolutionary history is The Boston Tea Party of 1773 , in which an American rebel group calling themselves “ The Sons of Liberty ” dressed up in disguise / costume and dumped imported British tea into Boston harbor as a protest against British control of the American economy .
There ’s a first - hand report of the party on - line .
Another bit of colonial performance art worth mention was the elaborate funeral held commemorating the death of Freedom on 1 November 1765 , when the British began enforcing the Stamp Act .
Upon reaching the graveyard , Liberty was seen to suddenly resurrect , and the rest of the day was spent celebrating the miracle .
New Hampshire patriots pulled a similar stunt in 2006 — holding a solemn funeral for the U.S. Constitution .
Palestinians from Bilin also took inspiration from the Spirit of ’ 76 .

Tawana Brawley was the seed that grew into one of the most outrageous racially - based hoaxes we ’ve seen in a while ( although certainly not the first nor the worst ) .
And the campaign to ban dihydrogen monoxide parodies the often scientifically illiterate warnings against frightening - sounding chemicals ( and provides ammunition to terrorists , apparently ) .
Governments live and die by disinformation campaigns , and they ’re getting pretty good at it .
Is The Eremin Letter real , or just capitalist propaganda ?
When you read about the U.S. government ’s campaigns against enemies like Fidel Castro , or you “ Remember The Maine ” – or the barbarous Huns – or the Tonkin Gulf incident – or the cocaine found in Manuel Noriega ’s fridge – or the babies thrown out of incubators by barbaric Iraqi troops – or the prisoners starving in Serbian death camps – or the specific , credible threat to Air Force One on 9/11 – or the dissidents fed through wood chippers by Saddam Hussein – or the uranium Saddam tried to buy from Niger , you come to understand that there ’s a method to this madness .
The ever - successful Arm The Homeless advocacy group provides a chance to make fun of society ’s attitudes towards poor people , as well as the rhetoric of philanthropy and of Second Amendment defenders .
ATH is joined by satirical political action committees like Ladies Against Women and Always Causing Legal Unrest .
Many of the games that made TV Nation so fun at times were politically aimed .
And then there are the Yippies , America ’s political prankster clowns .
Two of the more well - known are Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin .
I tried handing out copies of that old Yippie document The School Stoppers ’
Textbook to some schoolkids in my town , hoping that it would inspire the inmates of the public schools to acts of rebellion appropriate to their circumstance .
I was met by five people with badges who informed me that the First Amendment did not apply to this particular piece of writing .
I was held in prison on U.S. $ 40,000 bail and eventually convicted for ( I kid you not ) nothing more than handing out leaflets on a public sidewalk .
So the people who publish this text on - line at places like here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here are in danger of prosecution if any California student clicks their way to the page .
When California politicians rolled over to industry and refused to enact a consumer privacy law , privacy advocates proved their point by purchasing on - line the Social Security numbers of the members of the California Assembly ’s Banking Committee and posting the first four digits from each number on - line to demonstrate how easy it was .
The Yes Men are experts at the pointed prank , masquerading as the voice of authority to speak what is usually unsaid — as the examples in our Election Jamming and News Trolls sections show .
I ’ll mention a couple more examples here :
A faux Halliburton site set up by the Yes Men announced that “ Halliburton Solves Global Warming . ”
This solution , though , does n’t involve addressing the phenomenon , but in protecting the suit - and - tie class from its effects :
At today ’s conference , Wolf and a colleague demonstrated three SurvivaBall mockups , and described how the units will sustainably protect managers from natural or cultural disturbances of any intensity or duration .
The devices — looking like huge inflatable orbs — will include sophisticated communications systems , nutrient gathering capacities , onboard medical facilities , and a daunting defense infrastructure to ensure that the corporate mission will not go unfulfilled even when most human life is rendered impossible by catastrophes or the consequent epidemics and armed conflicts .
“ It ’s essentially a gated community for one , ” said Wolf .
And …
Last November at a San Francisco nanotechnology conference , a “ Dow representative ” urged the scientists , engineers , and entrepreneurs in the audience to hurry potentially dangerous nanotech products to market before they could be tested .
Citing
Dow ’s record profits despite a history of releasing dangerous and often lethal products , the representative asserted that caution is best deferred until after a product is released , and that testing ought to be performed not by the corporation but by the population at large , to give them the opportunity to participate in corporate progress .
And …
Rene Oswin , deputy assistant secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development , looked bemused , even a little shocked , to be onstage at Monday ’s Gulf Coast Reconstruction and Hurricane Preparedness Summit , where he was announcing a major change in HUD ’s policies .
Namely , he announced that he was reversing the planned destruction of thousands of units of public housing and allowing the one - time residents to move back in .
Of course , Oswin had good reason to be shocked — he was , in fact , not an employee of HUD , but one of the Yes Men .
From the bureau of amateur chemical - warfare comes a report of a woman who responded to the mayor ’s call for a “ zero - tolerance ” drug policy for Elkhart , Indiana city employees by dropping off a tray of pot brownies at the Central Fire Station last Christmas .
I need to do some more research into the whole monkeywrenching and ecotage movement , which is n’t exactly “ culture jamming , ” but still deserves a mention .
The ecological activist group Greenpeace is always on the front lines of creative activist responses to corporate ecoterrorism .
For instance , recently they packed drums full of dangerous residue from the Bhopal disaster of 1984 and delivered it personally to the headquarters of Dow chemicals in Holland .

Given that she describes herself
as a human pet – and is
happy to walk around on a lead
– Tasha Maltby is used to odd
looks and even odder remarks .
But nothing had prepared her for
the reaction of the bus driver who
allegedly told the self - styled Goth
and her boyfriend : " We do n't let
freaks and dogs like you on . "
Miss Maltby and her fiance Dani
Graves were so angered they have
complained to the bus company of
being " victimised " .
Scroll down for more ...
" It is definitely discrimination ,
almost like a hate crime , " 19 - year - old
Miss Maltby said yesterday .
The music technology student had
this defence of her lifestyle .
" I am a pet , I generally act animal like
and I lead a really easy life , " she
said .
" I do n't cook or clean and I do n't
go anywhere without Dani .
It might
seem strange but it makes us both
happy .
It 's my culture and my choice .
It is n't hurting anyone . "
The bus driver , however , has obviously
not been listening .
He has repeatedly refused to allow Mr Graves ,
25 , and his " pet " on to his bus in Dewsbury ,
West Yorkshire .
Last month , with Miss Maltby on a
leash as usual , the couple tried to
board a bus at the bus station .
The driver , who was off duty , was standing
near the door .
Mr Graves alleged : " He shoved me off
the bus .
He called us freaks and he
called Tasha a dog .
" He said , ' We do n't
let freaks and dogs like you on ' .
" He basically grabbed my T - shirt and
slammed me backwards .
" I got a bit
angry and called him a fascist pig . "
In a separate incident , police were
called when the driver , who has not
been named , refused to allow other
passengers on board after the couple
ignored his orders and sat down .
The couple , who live on benefits in a
council house and plan to start a family ,
have been friends for years .
They started going out together in July and
became engaged in November .
Paul Adcock , of bus company Arriva
Yorkshire , said : " We take any allegations
of discrimination seriously .
" Mr Graves has already contacted us
directly and as soon as our investigation
has concluded we will inform him
of the outcome . "
Or go directly to the photo here but i would recommend a look through the finnieston photos there also one of the pedestrian tunnel amongst them .
There is a photo from 1896 of horses and carts entering and leaving a rotunda and one of the pedestrian tunnel .
Enjoy !
( thanks to Stef Robb for this one )
The Virtual Mitchell library has some pictures of the tunnel between the Rotundas .
Click on the Area link ( on the left ) and then look through the Finnieston photos .
Sadly the pedestrian tunnel was closed on 4th April 1980 .
This tunnel is now only used for access to water mains .
Both the vehicular tunnels were filled in in 1986 .
The North Rotunda is currently being used as a casino , while the South Rotunda is unused after having found brief uses as a " dome of discovery " and a Nardinis Ice Cream Parlour ( replicating the original in Largs ) during the Glasgow Garden Festival .
The next day it was 272 , and the secretary of the Otis Company 's London subsidiary reported that ' the horses generally have taken most kindly to the lifts , and are carried up and down without trouble .
Carters said that by avoiding the steep inclines at the nearby ferries they could take five extra bags of flour per journey .
On the following Monday , however , when only half the hoists on each side were working , 218 vehicles used the tunnel during its opening period of 05.00 to 19:00 hrs .
It was on July 15 , 1895 that the Harbour Tunnel opened for business .
This was during the Glasgow Fair holidays , and traffic was light for the first week .
In each tower there were six segments of hydraulic hoist , three for up traffic and three for down .
The hoists were provided by the Otis Elevator Company of New York , and the chairman of the Harbour Tunnel Company replied to criticisms from the Glasgow engineering establishment about the use of foreign machinery by saying that they were the best available .
Parliamentary approval had been given in 1889 for a pedestrian and vehicle tunnel under the Clyde between Finnieston on the north bank and Mavisbank Quay on the south .
Three l6ft diameter tunnels were dug , with shields and compressed air , the centre one being for pedestrians and the others for horse and cart traffic .
The entrances on both sides were circular brick towers , which contained not only stairs for pedestrians but also hydraulic lifts for raising and lowering cart traffic to and from the main tunnel level under the river .
THE FORGOTTEN TUNNEL :
In 1895 Glasgow was in the grip of a kind of tunneling mania .
The Central Station low - level line was being dug , the underground railway circuit was nearing completion , and the Glasgow Harbour Tunnel Company 's pride and joy was about to be opened after five years of excavating under the Clyde .
That later date came in 1926 , by which time the corporation paid out almost £ 30,000 every year to keep the tunnel and the passenger and vehicle ferries near by running .
The tunnel passed into the city 's control for a payment of £ 100,000 .
At the same time the corporation released details of plans for a new cross-river bridge at Finnieston , and it was expected that the tunnel would soon be closed .
The bridge was never built .
In 1932 a columnist in the Evening Citizen could still write about a journey beneath the Clyde :
Like many similar schemes , the Harbour Tunnel never produced the revenues its promoters expected , and from time to time they threatened closure .
In 1915 an arrangement was reached with Glasgow Corporation by which the city authorities came to the financial rescue by making an annual grant , and being given in return an option to buy over the tunnel at a later date .
The Harbour Tunnel remains one of Glasgow 's best - kept secrets : most people in the city , if they are even aware of its existence , thought it closed down long ago .
Despite the derelict appearance of the towers , and the fact that they seem to be no more than a roosting place for half the city 's birds , the Harbour Tunnel is still open .
The remains of the machinery in the great circular shafts can be glimpsed , and dimly lit stairways plunge eerily down alongside the hydraulic pipeline which took pressure from the south side to the north , to the main level below the Clyde .
In September 1943 it was decided to abandon the vehicle tunnels , and all the hydraulic equipment was removed .
The passenger tunnel was to be retained , and £ 500 was earmarked for pumps to keep it dry .
The tunnel was still of some use to the city , although the ferries were far more popular with those whose business did not take them close to the city - centre bridges .
Traffic increased again during the second world war , when dockers and shipyard workers were among the most regular users .
In April 1943 there was a request that the tunnel should be restricted to motor traffic , since horse - drawn vehicles were causing delays .
Glasgow Corporation , however , had far different ideas , since their Master of Works had recently made a thorough examination of the old tunnel and reported that ' grave responsibilities would be incurred ' if it were kept open at all .
' The door of the passenger tunnel has long been disused , and foot - passengers now enter by one of the four elevators for vehicles at the other side of the rotunda .
Choosing the company of a horse and lorry as preferable to that of a motor - car , I soon found myself smoothly and quietly descending among a bewildering medley of wheels and cables , through which I could see the mouth of the old disused foot - passenger tunnel as we passed on the way down .
At the bottom water oozed through the iron sides of the great tube , which has never been totally watertight .
At one place a single stalactite a font long hung from the roof . '

I have been wondering if Murdoch had been compromised to print these stories when the MSM can cover up " legitimately " with intense coverage of the elections .
Then I saw they were reporting stories about Britney not having her bra on straight , and other useless bullshit , and decided hell no , there is no legitimate reason on God 's green earth for Americans not to know their government has deadly and dangerous spies within it who do not have their best interests at heart .
Halliburton moved to the country that supported the Taliban in open public dialogue .
Vice Preznit Cheney is welded to Halliburton like a siamese twin .

Good link , Good find !
I think the analysis in the link is spot on .
Now , since Joe Biden is chair of the Senate committee which preznit blush wrote to , lets find out what Biden is made of .
In the past I have had the highest regard for him on foreign policy understanding .
He even knows were Iraq and Iran are on a map !
( most bushies do n't know shit about Iraq and Iran compared to Biden ) ... but this has been a year of disappointment when it comes to Senate democrats .
( Note however that Sen . Dodd is standing up against the Amurkans on behalf of we Americans on the FISA bill ) .
So I am going to watch it unfold .
I remember when we hunted down the military industrial complex 's plant , Shawn Whitman , the Lone Certifier of all voting things machines diebold .
After that the Butch Custody and the Hoppy Kid thingy do n't surprise me much .
And that the military industrial complex demons want death and destruction to spread their filthy legs about the planet by hurting decent babes like Valerie and Sibel is no biggie .

Phillip Giraldi , a former CIA officer , said : “ It ’s pretty clear Plame was targeting the Turks .
If indeed that [ State Department ] official was working with the Turks to violate US law on nuclear exports , it would have been in his interest to alert them to the fact that this woman ’s company was affiliated to the CIA .
I do n’t know if that ’s treason legally but many people would consider it to be . ”

Turkish stuff is probably drugs .
Plame probably screwed their operations up if she was involved .
She hates DOJDEA because of Ames and her mistakes following up his arrest and getting caught breaking IIPA .
Breswter Jennings was a movie ' Brewster 's Millions . '
Joe was the diplomat and Val the money chasing thing .
That 's really how they operate .
Gross man ?
He was probably working with us .
Sibel was only supposed to translate .
She told everyone what she heard and that was the mistake .
She was n't paid to analyze anything .
She can't figure that Gross man was spy'n for us ?

Edmonds draws a picture of a three - sided alliance consisting of Turkish , Pakistani , and Israeli agents who coordinated efforts to milk U.S. nuclear secrets and technology , funneling the intelligence stream to the black market nuclear network set up by the Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan .
The multi-millionaire Pakistani nuclear scientist then turned around and sold his nuclear assets to North Korea , Libya , and Iran .
Can someone explain to me why the Neocons on the one hand are afraid of Iran getting nukes and on the other hand playing a role in helping them get nukes ?

Their goal is to perpetuate war , not to prevent war .
They are making tons of money off military contracts .
My theory is this : they are passing nuclear secrets , full knowing that it will eventually end up in enemy hands .
In the hands of the enemy ( and after some extent of development ) it becomes their much needed green light to pull off exactly what they did to Iraq .

If Brewster Jennings was compromised in 2001 it explains why the inner sanctum of the Bushites did not think twice about throwing Plame to the dogs a couple years later .
They were n't compromising BJ because it was already compromised .

I wonder if anyone 's celebrating " Fitzmas " anymore .

One thing that frightens me is that Edmonds was transferred and then terminated shortly after she was approached by agents who wanted her to join up in the fun and profits .
With so few others coming out to tell the obvious real stories , I have to assume that the rest of those doing the translating got turned , joined up and said " hell with integrity , we 'll take the cash . "
Does anyone remember a story that came out shortly after the invasion of Iraq about a shipment of chemical weapons that was stopped crossing from Turkey into Iraq ?
I do n't remember where I read it and I can't find it .
The shipment was stopped by efforts of Bewster Jennings and the Carlyle Group was implicated in the sale .
The suggestion was that this shipment was meant to satisfy the doubters about WOMD , but the plot did n't work out because of that meddling Plame .
Any one else read that or remember where it appeared ?

I really believe Dennis Kusinich could not only be the next president , but if he ties the Sibel Edmond 's information about these careless 2 faced treasonous losers with his call for a new Cheney impeachment investigation , he becomes the new political savior of this country and the world .
Do n't forget Bush 's secret passage for legal trading of nuclear secrets with Turkey now to protect these US greedy parasitic US traitors .
Try to stop that corporate government mass media BLACK OUT fkcx !
Officially denied by the state department ?
Traitors at the state department ?
Better check the missing FBI file again .
Ms. Edmond 's just wanted to give the new James Bond some good material to work with .
Nothing to see here so the criminal hold on the US mass media can eventually back your ace .
Lying criminal murderers Bush and cheney will back your ace .
Marc Grossman , and his 24 other inside traitors like Dennis Haster , Richard Perle are gonna burn .
They will be prosecuted and convicted .
The neo -con police state plan if it comes to frutation will be to do some kind of attack and start accusing Americans as terrorists .
The clock is ticking but they will fill all the new secret prisons they built across America and turn them into concentration camps so prisons can start producing manufactured goods cheaper than the current work their multi-national corps outsourced to China .
Dennis could become an American hero perhaps the biggest of the century , however time is running out .

# 33 Yes , and that capitulation to the State of The Union Amurka is costing a great deal :
We are familiar with the visible costs associated with the war in Iraq and the sacrifices that our men and women in uniform and their families are making .
We 've lost nearly 4,000 troops , over 28,700 have been wounded and we have appropriated over $ 535 billion .
But , we are less familiar with the hidden costs , and these will have long - term consequences .
Every penny of the $ 535 billion we 've appropriated thus far has been borrowed , meaning that the same Americans sacrificing in Iraq today will be paying for this borrowed war for the rest of their lives .
It is estimated that the long - term costs of injuries alone will be at least a further $ 300 billion .
Since the war began , the international credibility and respect of the United States has plummeted while instability has grown throughout the region .
We 've seen a dramatic rise in the economic , military and global influence of both Russia and China .
An emboldened Iran seeks to more aggressively assert influence in the region .
Our NATO allies are unwilling or unable to provide an additional 3,000 troops for Afghanistan .
And the price of oil has climbed from $ 27.18 per barrel before the war began to $ 92.82 today .
Here at home , we are borrowing $ 343 million every day to finance the war in Iraq while shortchanging our domestic needs .
The American economy is slipping towards a recession as our housing market and financial sector are experiencing serious crises .

yep , the dollar has lost about 35 % of it 's value in the " W " years , and is set to do the same in the next 4 years , regardless of who gets elected .
Inflation is twice what interest rates are .
The surge to bankrupt the government IS working , what will replace it ?
Gore knows the answer ...
The generation that defeated fascism throughout the world in the 1940s found , in rising to meet their awesome challenge , that they had gained the moral authority and long - term vision to launch the Marshall Plan , the United Nations , and a new level of global cooperation and foresight that unified Europe ... - from his Nobel acceptance speech none the less " new level of global cooperation and foresight that unified Europe "
Sorry , all I see is --> after your money is worthless and we have another terror attack we 'll scrap the US altogether and blissfully march through peak oil together , oh , and we defeated Fascism in the 40's

Here 's a " cut 'n ' paste " comment from cannonfire
that might interest some readers ...
" “ Treason or not ”
Actually with what I personally know , their ultimate plan involves Treason !
Plus Edmonds great hero whistle - blowing only surfaces part of a much larger picture .
“ the significance of Edmonds ' revelations point to an on - going series of covert relations that link Turkey , Israel and Pakistan to wider U.S. geopolitical interests for which the " war on terror " serves as a convenient cover . ”
This group is big on using “ mind control ” and setup ’s for convenient cover !
With them , everything is done “ slow and easy ” in the sneakiest way possible .
Edmonds worked within the FBI and when reviewing what she says , focus your attention on who is involved .
The same people are also linked to companies involved in other parts of this blooming story that includes huge shipments of Drugs brought in to the US .
I ’m talking about TON ’S per week all over the US !
I was in a family for more than 26 years and their business is Property Development .
The family ’s job in the criminal organization is to launder Drug and Gun Running money straight into property using Mortgage Fraud with Big Banks for those involved .
Note the Gun running part has been already in the news with Chiquita and Drummond however both companies are n’t well known for their huge World Wide Distribution Shipments of Drugs .
There are other companies involved .
The weekly $ 100 Million Dollar sized Drug Shipments destined for Chicago where the family launders came in from Mexico through the Texas border .
Corruption guarantees protection from the point of origin all the way to each destination with much of this being done by an organized Political Mafia .
Guess who was Governor of Texas in the 90’s when I was told this ?
Besides trucking drugs , the family is involved in air freighting drugs by the TON ’s in Jet Planes .
One Coke jet carrying
Ton ’s of drugs was busted last year .
The owner / pilot is my ex- sister - in - law ’s brother .
The Money Man behind Clyde O’Connor is my ex-brother - in - law , Bruce Adreani .
I stood next to Clyde and Bruce in the 90’s while they talked about joining the criminal organization to ship huge drug shipments .
Bruce and the family had already been involved since the late 70 ’s but air freighting would require another focus .
Chiquita was mentioned above and the previous Board of Directors ( around the time of the Conrad Black Indictment and Trial ) includes more of those involved , some are n’t known yet ( Henry Kissinger , Gov James Thompson , etc ) as being involved but Richard Perle is .
The Sun -Time ’s Company is loaded with people involved in the drug system and other parts of the criminal organization .
There are mountains more about this that everyone should know !
This also includes a Mega Church in the Chicago area and the Clintons and Bush families have been directly involved in this for decades .
This drug system makes Clintons ’
Mena scandal look like child ’s play !
No one will ever believe what their plans are with the Drug money !
I would be more than pleased to help Obama surface the Clintons ( and others ) .
Plus , I personally know a few other FBI whistleblowers who know about this !
But like Edmonds they are n’t allowed to openly speak about it !
Maybe I should speak for them until they are ready to speak for themselves ?
This story has only just begun to surface !

Note : the first two minutes is in Dutch and the rest in English .
The translation of the Dutch part : " The war in Iraq does not seem to be over al all , but in the meantime the rebuilding has already started .
This has unleashed fierce competition for contracts , which are mainly awarded to American ( ed : U.S. ) companies .
What is remarkable about these companies , is that they have people on their payroll from American politics and the military .
Is this a conflict of interest , or is this the new global way of doing business ?

BRAD !!
HEADS UP !!
Corroboration ??
( and if it 's already been posted , forgive me , I 'm a little bit under the weather and it's affecting my thought processes )
This is an interview with former American CIA agent and nuclear expert David Dastych .
Exerpt : Q : Do you know anything about some US officials selling nuclear secrets to others ?
A : I do , but only through my American contacts in the Intelligence and the FBI .
Some corrupt US officials of the Department of Defence and State Department facilitated the theft of US nuclear secrets ( technology ) from American national laboratories --- Los Alamos and Sandia --- to customers in several countries , including Pakistan .
This procedure involved Israeli and Turkish intelligence and also Pakistan 's ISI .
Dr A Q Khan 's laboratories were brokers for nuclear proliferation to other countries , including Algeria , Iraq , Iran , Libya , Syria , Myanmar and other states looking for nuclear technology .
This information first surfaced five years ago through reports of a Turkish - American FBI translator , Ms Sibel Edmonds .
She was gagged by US court decision and only recently she disclosed more information , which is still being blocked by the Bush Administration .
It was revealed in part by three articles , published by " The Sunday Times " in London on the 6th , 20th and 26th of January 2008 ( with my contribution ) .
Q : Is it correct that US officials sold nuclear secrets not only to Pakistan but also to Israel and some Arab countries ?
A : Of course , they did .
The main recipient of the most of the US nuclear information was always Israel , specifically after the capture , sentencing and jailing of their main spy in the USA .
Jonathan Pollard , whose handler was a former top Israeli intelligence officer Rafi Eitan ( now member of the Israeli government and chairman of the Pensioners Party ) .
An informal group in the Mossad composed of right - wing operatives and working hand - in - hand with the Turkish and Pakistani Intelligence was offering US nuclear technology to some Arab countries and to other countries .
They did this for profit and , in some cases also for political motives , for example , to get direct proof of some foreign states illegally purchasing nuclear materials or technology .
At present , this might be used as a justification to prove that Iran is developing nuclear weapons .

I met lead Enlightenment developer Carsten Haitzler in the exhibition hall at the Southern California Linux Expo ( SCALE ) this past weekend .
Carsten told me about prospects for the future of Enlightenment and shared with me some details about his work at OpenMoko , a division of FIC which is developing Linux - based open - source mobile phone handsets .
He sees a big future for Linux in the mobile and embedded space and notes that Enlightenment , with its small memory footprint , is ideal for deployment on such devices .
Although Enlightenment — which is a lightweight alternative to KDE and GNOME — has n't gained as much traction on the Linux desktop as its competitors , it has a loyal following of enthusiasts and is beginning to see commercial adoption in a variety of intriguing contexts .
It is included as the default window manager in the Ubuntu - based gOS Linux distribution , which is deployed on budget computers from Everex like the upcoming Cloudbook .
My first interaction with Carsten was in 2006 when I interviewed him for an article about Terra Soft 's Yellow Dog Linux distribution for the PlayStation 3 , which used Enlightenment 's pre-alpha E17 as a desktop environment .
The software has evolved considerably since then and has become more robust .
The OpenMoko software platform makes extensive use of the GTK application development toolkit , which is also used on Maemo - based devices like the Nokia N810 .
GTK provides a solid framework for application development , but there are some notable downsides .
As Carsten explained to me , using GTK pervasively throughout the user interface consumes memory that could be put to better use .
Replacing some of the core GTK - based interactive components with comparable software built using Enlightenment technologies , he says , provides a very significant reduction in memory overhead and increases the responsiveness of the device .
He also tells me that using pieces of Enlightenment will bring more elaborate visual effects and a graphically richer user experience to the OpenMoko products .
He showed me an OpenMoko Neo1973 prototype on which he was running a desktop version of E17 .
The whole environment worked and was extremely responsive .
Although he 's running regular E17 on the device for testing purposes , the final version of the OpenMoko software platform will be a mix of custom - built Enlightenment - based components and GTK software — all designed specifically for touch - screen finger usability .
My conversation with Carsten left me with a very positive impression of the direction that OpenMoko is moving with its software platform .
I think that we can expect to see some very exciting things emerge as development continues .
Derivatives and the Real Estate Bubble ( November 8 , 2006 )
Reader Kenny G. posed a fascinating question about the impact of derivatives on the housing bubble : " My question is this :
How will the huge amount of credit derivatives play out in way of the deflating of the bubble ?
I hate to say it but , " this time MAY be different " ?
I have read that there was about $ 1 trillion worth as little as 5 years ago and now there is in excess of $ 27 trillion .
Will the need to put this " money " somewhere give this market a true early floor or will there be some unwinding that will create an even worst result ?
I have a friend who has an association with Goldman Sachs who is trying to find a home for $ 100's of millions in apartment complexes here on the west coast ... the well is still pumping strong ....
I 'd appreciate your thoughts .... "
Though no expert , I 'll do my best .
There are at least three parts to the answer : the impact of mortgage - backed securities derivatives , the growth of derivatives across all financial markets , and the demand for a " home " for excess capital .
The scale of derivatives appears to be fully 10 times greater than $ 27 trillion ; according to The Economist : " Finance has been convulsed by a computer - enhanced frenzy of creativity .
In today 's caffeine - fuelled dealing rooms , a barely regulated private equity group could very well borrow money from syndicates of private lenders , including hedge funds , to spend on taking public companies private .
At each step , risks can be converted into securities [ like mortgage - backed securities ] , sliced up ... re-packaged , sold on and sliced up again .
The endless opportunities to write contracts on underlying debt instruments explains why the outstanding value of credit - derivatives contracts has rocketed to $ 265 trillion – $ 9 trillion more than six months ago , and seven times as much as in 2003 . "
Derivatives have also skyrocketed in value in the past 5 years as the need to take on more risk has increased .
The demand for superior return in a low - interest environment has driven the capital markets into accepting more and more risk in an attempt to " beat the market " or do better than a safe 6 - month Treasury note .
( Recall that " risk and return " are related ; the lower the risk , the lower the return , and vice versa . )
To offset the greater risks , money managers have turned to derivatives for portfolio insurance .
Here 's ( basically ) how a derivative works .
( Skip this if you already know . )
The simplest way to grasp a derivative is to consider put and call options on a stock or index .
Let 's say you invest a whopping chunk of money in XYZ Corporation which trades at $ 50 a share .
To protect yourself against a sudden collapse in the value of XYZ shares , you buy put options , which increase in value as XYZ drops .
If you own 10,000 shares of XZY , that means you 've got $ 500,000 invested .
If you buy contracts for 10,000 shares ( options come in contracts of 100 , so this means you 'd buy 100 contracts ) for , say $ 1 a share , then you 'd spend $ 10,000 to protect your investment against a massive drop .
Say your put was at a strike price of $ 50 ; if XYZ plummeted to $ 40 , your put options would be worth $ 9 , or the difference between the strike price and the current price .
Even though your shares have lost $ 10 in value , your put gained $ 10 in value .
So you 've suffered no loss despite the steep drop in XYZ 's value .
If XYZ stays at $ 50 or goes up , your option expires worthless , which means the party which wrote the option pockets the $ 10,000 and you receive nothing -- very much an insurance policy .
But your worst case scenario was effectively reduced to the cost of the puts : you could n't lose more than $ 10,000 , even if XYZ stayed at $ 50 / share .
Now this may sound confusing , but the reason why no one worries too much about puts and calls unraveling is to write such an option , you need to own or at least control the underlying security .
In other words , there is collateral for the " insurance " being sold .
Not so with all derivatives .
In more exotic derivatives , the potential loss to the firm issuing the derivative is covered by another derivative .
Thus , derivatives are swapped , layered , chained and intertwined so that every potential loss is covered by another derivative .
If everything stays stable , then the firm writing the derivative pockets the fee and pays out nothing .
Issuing derivatives is highly profitable , and seemingly safe .
Major investment houses may juggle several hundred derivatives contracts at any one time , thereby balancing all the ( visible ) risks of their portfolios .
So what can go wrong ?
Somewhere down the chain , if someone did n't adequately cover their risk , some shock in the financial system may cause a loss they can't cover .
They go belly up , and as a result the firms expecting these guys will pay off their derivative bets find their " insurance " just became worthless .
They in turn may find themselves short of cash to cover derivatives they wrote , and then they have to sell hard assets such as stocks and bonds to cover the losses .
Such selling may well trigger additional selling , which will trigger more derivatives claims , which launches yet more selling ... and that 's how the entire " safe " structure could collapse in giant waves of selling .
Here 's how derivatives impact the housing bubble .
Small - town bankers still write mortgages and keep the " paper , " meaning they actually own the mortgage and collect the principal and interest payments from the homeowner .
But most of the hundreds of billions of sub - prime and option - ARM mortgages written in the past few years have been aggregated into vast pools of mortgages which are then sold much like bonds .
These mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) are often tranched ( sliced and diced ) into various levels of risk .
The buyers then offset the risk by purchasing derivatives which will increase if the underlying mortgages go south ( i.e. become non-performing loans as the homeowner defaults and stops paying the mortgage ) .
Here 's a chart showing the recent rapid rise in MBS :
To connect the dots , scroll back up and look at the chart which shows that 10 % of U.S. households are in danger of defaulting on their debt : ( the chart is from the FDIC ; in other words , this is a Federal agency 's assessment of the risks . )
Let 's say " only " 5 % of homeowners default -- that 's some 4 million mortgages .
Those mortgages are spread out in MBS all over the planet , and as millions of people stop paying their principal and interest ( each one goes to a different tranch , by the way ) , then the owners of those MBS start collecting less income .
The value of their mortgage security plummets , as who wants to buy a mortgage - backed security which is receiving fewer dollars every month ?
Derivatives written against all these MBS will then increase in value , and somebody will have to make huge payouts of cash to cover the decline in the value of the MBS .
To raise the cash , they either need to collect from another derivative bet they themselves made or they need to sell the underlying MBS .
But the mortgage - backed security has lost a big chunk of its value , and buyers may well be scarce .
Maybe the writer of the derivative will have to sell some other asset to make good -- like a stock or bond .
Any way you cut it , losses will be gigantic if 4 million U.S. households default on their sub - prime or option ARM mortgages .
And it is at least conceivable that the unraveling of the MBS and CDO derivative markets could trigger an ever - widening circle of unraveling .
This is more or less what threatened the entire global banking system in 1998 when the highly leveraged bets ( read : derivatives and options ) placed by the firm LTCM ( Long - Term Capital Management ) started unraveling .
If you recall our option example above : $ 100 million ( not much money in today 's world ) could very easily control or expose to meltdown $ 1 trillion in underlying securities , bonds and stocks .
The industry claims risk has been banished ; mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot disagrees .
I never tire of recommending his book The Misbehavior of Markets which explains why risk is never completely absent from any market .
To believe otherwise is an illusion -- and a dangerous one .
I have no doubt that money is still seeking a " home " in real estate -- just as inflows rose to record highs as the dot - com stock market reached its final highs .
The willingness of money managers to throw in " new money " on " bets " that paid off handsomely in the recent past ( i.e. real estate ) is well - known -- as is the resulting crash and destruction of the wealth they controlled ( Nasdaq 2000 - 2002 , down 80 % ) .
The key take - away here is this :
With the explosion of mortgage - backed securities and the steep rise in appetites for risk ( such as sub - prime mortgages ) , the housing market has become inextricably intertwined with global financial and derivatives markets .
Thus the unraveling of the housing bubble may well trigger the unraveling of the entire global derivatives markets .

U.S. President George W. Bush refused to be deterred by an intelligence report that suggests Iran has halted its bid to build nuclear weapons , insisting that the new information only proves how much of a threat Iran is .
U.S. President George W. Bush discusses an intelligence report on Iran at the White House on Tuesday .
( ( Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images ) )
" I view this report as a warning signal , " Bush told reporters at the White House on Tuesday .
" Iran was dangerous , Iran is dangerous , and Iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon . "
" [ The report ] says Iran had a covert nuclear weapons program .
What 's to say they could n't start another covert weapons program ? "
Bush said he was briefed on the U.S. National Intelligence Estimatereport just last week .
Released to the public on Monday , the report states with " high confidence " that Iran put its bid to build a nuclear bomb on hold in the fall of 2003 .
The report , based on the findings of 16 U.S. intelligence agencies , is a stark contrast toU.S. intelligence released two years ago that suggested Iran was determined to develop nuclear weapons capabilities and was continuing its weapons development program .
That earlier report prompted Bush to demand the United Nations Security Council secure a third round of sanctions against Iran .
At Bush 'slast news conference on Oct. 17 , he insisted that nations " interested in avoiding World War Three " should be working together to prevent Iran from obtaininga nuclear weapon .
But on Tuesday , Bush said his opinion has n't changed .
Hesaid the new report clearly states that Iran does have uranium enrichment programs and could be technically capable of producing a nuclear weapon by 2010 or 2015 .
" Plenty of people understand that if Iran learns how to enrich , that knowledge can be transferred to a weapons program , " Bush said .
" Most of the world understands that Iran with a nuclear weapon would be a serious danger to peace . "
He urged other nations to pressure Iran into stopping all nuclear activities .
Bush said Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , needs to know that ifhis countrydoes n't change its tone , it will be isolated internationally .
" Defiance is not the way forward .
My hope is that the Iranian regime takes a look at their policies and changes their policies back to the way they were before the election of Ahmadinejad , " in 2005 .
Iran welcomes the report
While Bush used the report as proof of Iran 's danger , Iran 's foreign minister on Tuesday welcomed the intelligence .
Manouchehr Mottaki said he believes the report indicates that Iran 's enrichment program is being usedfor peaceful purposes .

" It 's natural that we welcome … countries that correct their views realistically , which in the past had questions and ambiguities about " Iran 's nuclear activities , Mottaki said Tuesday .
Conservative Iranianlawmaker Elham Aminzadeh told the Associated Press that " it proved that Iran is not a danger to the world , as some members of the Bush administration claim . "
Iran has always insisted it never has sought nuclear weapons .
Report a result post - Iraq intelligence reform : Bush
On Tuesday , Bush was asked by reporterswhether the latest report on Iran is similar to the situation that occurred with Iraq .
Prior to the Iraq invasion in March 2003 , the White House released and frequently cited portions of a National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq that claimed Saddam Hussein 'sgovernment possessed weapons of mass destruction .
That information later proved to be false .
Bush said there have been many reforms to U.S. intelligence collecting since the intelligence failure in Iraq .
He said the new Iran report is " a very important product " that resulted from those reforms .
Democrats call for overhaul
Meanwhile , Bush 's Democratic opposition in the U.S.Congress is calling for a major overhaul of the United States ' Iran policy in the wake of the report .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the White House must begin " a diplomatic surge " to engage with Iran similar to what previous administrations did with the former Soviet Union during the Cold War .
The International Atomic Energy Agency , whose director - general , Mohamed El - Baradei , has often clashed with U.S. administration over Iran , responded positively to the report , saying it was " consistent " with its own findings .
In a statement Tuesday , El - Baradei said it should help diffuse the escalating crisis between Iran and Western nations opposed to its nuclear enrichment program , while also prompting Tehran to work with his agency .
In Israel , Defence Minister Ehud Barak said " it 's apparently true " that Iran stopped pursuing its military nuclear program in 2003 .
" But in our opinion , since then it has apparently continued that program , " Barak told Army Radio .
" There are differences in the assessments of different organizations in the world about this , and only time will tell who is right . "

Microsoft is one of the firms the NCC wants to see investigated
The National Consumer Council ( NCC ) has accused 17 firms , including Microsoft , Adobe and Symantec , of using unfair " end user licence agreements " ( EULAs ) .
The NCC has asked the Office of Fair Trading to launch an investigation .
The NCC said the firms ' EULAs were misleading customers into " signing away legal rights " .
" Software rights - holders are shifting the legal burden on to consumers who buy computer programmes , leaving them with less protection than when they buy a cheap Biro , " said Carl Belgrove of the NCC .
" Consumers can't have a clue what they 're signing up to when some terms and conditions run to 10 or more pages .
" There 's a significant imbalance between the rights of the consumer and the rights of the holder , " he added .
' Legal responsibility '
As one of the firms named by the NCC , Microsoft said it had not seen the details of the report and was unable to comment .
But it added that it was committed to dealing " fairly " with consumers and addressing any concerns they might have .
Meanwhile Symantec said it would welcome the opportunity to engage with the NCC and any other organisations in order to best serve the interests of its customers .
The NCC looked at 25 software packages and said that in 17 instances , the packaging did not tell potential buyers they would have to sign an EULA in order to use it .
While some contained the EULA inside an instruction manual , or let it be read online , this was only after the software had been bought .
" This means that consumers are unable to make informed decisions before they buy a product , yet are being forced to take on an unknown level of legal responsibility , " said the NCC .
After examining the contents of the EULAs , the NCC also said that some contained potentially unfair clauses .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Four Greenpeace activists breached security at Heathrow Airport on Monday to climb on top of a British Airways plane and protest plans to build a third runway , the environmental group and airport authorities said .
The four activists were atop the Airbus A320 for about an hour and a half before airport security plucked them off in a cherry - picker crane and police arrested them , authorities said .
Greenpeace said it wanted to highlight the environmental damage a third runway will cause , but a Heathrow spokesman called the group 's actions " irresponsible . "
" Climate change can be beaten , but not by almost doubling the size of the world 's biggest airport , " said protester Anna Jones , 27 .
She and the other three activists -- a woman and two men -- unfurled a yellow banner on the plane 's tailfin which read , " Climate Emergency -- No 3rd Runway . "
Greenpeace said it had planned the protest for many months .
Greenpeace said the activists bought airline tickets to get airside at Heathrow 's Terminal 1 , then waited for all the passengers on the Manchester , England to London flight to disembark .
The activists then walked through the terminal , crossed the Tarmac , and climbed stairs onto the plane 's fuselage .
" We may have exposed a hole in security at Heathrow , but it 's not as big as the hole in ( Prime Minister ) Gordon Brown 's climate change policy , " said Sarah Shoraka , 30 , another of the protesters .
Shoraka said the group chose the Manchester - to - London flight because the train is a viable and more environmentally - friendly alternative on the same route .
" The push for a third runway is being fueled by totally unnecessary flights like this one , " Shoraka said .
A Heathrow spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said authorities were investigating the " unlawful protest . "
Wednesday is the deadline for the government 's public consultation on whether a third runway should be built .
" The government is currently consulting on the future of Heathrow Airport and all parties have the opportunity , through the proper democratic process , to make their views known , " the spokesman said .
Heathrow is the main airport in Britain and one of the biggest in the world .
But despite its size Heathrow has only two runways , and the government and airlines have for years called for the construction of a third .
Opponents complain of the environmental impact , noise , pollution , and destruction to local property a third runway would create .
Shoraka said the protest was the only way to get the group 's message across .
" The consultation that the government has set up has been widely derided as a fix , " she said .
" We 're reasonable people but we just felt we had to take this action today because there 's nothing else we can do within our power to stop climate change . "

Are Bush , Cheney and Rumsfeld Themselves Incompetent ?
If you doubt that , take a look at
to see how Cheney has coordinated illegal activities through his own office .
" Generally , US foreign policy is remarkably consistent and cohesive , a deadly success , given the interests it represents .
Those who see it as repeatedly befuddled are themselves revealing their own befuddlement .
Sometimes the policymakers themselves seize upon incompetence as a cover .
[ For example , when the Iran - Contra affair was discovered , President Reagan plead incompetence . ]
His admission of incompetence was eagerly embraced by various analysts and pundits who prefer to see their leaders as suffering from innocent ignorance rather than deliberate deception .
Subsequent testimony by his subordinates , however , revealed that Reagan was not as dumb as he was pretending to be , and that he had played an active and deciding role in the entire Iran - contra affair .
***
No less a political personage than Henry Kissinger repeatedly pretended to innocent ignorance and incompetence when confronted with the dirty role he and his cohorts played . . . . "

NEW YORK --
The sign man of Shea Stadium died Thursday .
Karl Ehrhardt was a fixture at Mets games from 1964 through 1981 , famous for holding up tailored signs after key plays that displayed his
pleasure or frustration with the team .
Karl Ehrhardt , the Mets fan known as the Sign Man for his witty and biting signs at Shea Stadium , holds up a " Met Power " sign after a home run in Game 3 of the 1969 World Series .
Ehrhardt died Thursday at 83 .

He was 83 and died at his home in the Glen Oaks section of
Queens , according to his daughter Bonnie Troester .
Ehrhardt had
been recovering from vascular surgery .
Ehrhardt 's block - lettered signs served as color commentary for
both fans in the stands and TV viewers at home .
He carried dozens
to each game , some witty , some biting .
" Jose , Can You See ? " was a regular when Mets outfielder after
Jose ' Cardenal struck out .
" It 's Alive ! " was for hitters who
broke out of a slump .
" Just Great ! " was for more spectacular moments .
Only the Mets 1969 World Series victory left him speechless .
The
sign he raised high after the last out read , " There Are No
Words . "
At one point he had about 1,200 signs to choose from .
" I just called them the way I saw them , " Ehrhardt told The New
York Times in 2006 .
" Before I went to the ballpark , I would try to crystal - ball
what might happen that particular day , " he said .
" I would read
all the newspapers to learn who was hot and who was in a slump ,
stuff like that , and create my signs accordingly . "
Ehrhardt was n't always a Mets fan .
He grew up rooting for the
Dodgers in Brooklyn before switching to the Mets in the early
1960s .
" He was part of the happening that Shea became , " said Bob
Mandt , former Mets vice president for baseball operations .
Ehrhardt was born in Unterweissbach , Germany .
He moved to the
United States when he was six years old and later served as a
translator for U.S. forces during World War II .
He graduated from the Pratt Institute with a design art degree
after the war and worked for American Home Foods .
His wife , Lucille Schneyer , died in 1997 .
He is survived by a
daughter , a son and two grandchildren .
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi , who introduced transcendental meditation to the West and gained fame in the 1960s as the spiritual guru to the Beatles , died Tuesday at his home and headquarters in Vlodrop , the Netherlands .
He is believed to have been in his 90s .
Steven Yellin , a spokesman for the organization , confirmed the Maharishi ’s death but did not give a cause .
On Jan. 11 , the Maharishi announced that his public work was finished and that he would use his remaining time to complete a long - running series of published commentaries on the Veda , the oldest sacred Hindu text .
The Maharishi was both an entrepreneur and a monk , a spiritual man who sought a world stage from which to espouse the joys of inner happiness .
His critics called his organization a cult business enterprise .
And in the press , in the 1960s and ’ 70s , he was often dismissed as a hippie mystic , the “ Giggling Guru , ” recognizable in the familiar image of him laughing , sitting cross-legged in a lotus position on a deerskin , wearing a white silk dhoti with a garland of flowers around his neck beneath an oily , scraggly beard .
In Hindi , “ maha ” means great , and “ rishi ” means seer .
“ Maharishi ” is a title traditionally bestowed on Brahmins .
Critics of the yogi say he presented himself with the name , which is Hindi for “ great seer . ”
The Maharishi originated the transcendental meditation movement in 1957 and brought it to the United States in 1959 .
Known as TM , a trademark , the technique consists of closing one ’s eyes twice a day for 20 minutes while silently repeating a mantra to gain deep relaxation , eliminate stress , promote good health and attain clear thinking and inner fulfillment .
Classes now cost $ 2,500 for a five - day session .
The TM movement was a founding influence on what has grown into a multibillion - dollar self - help industry , and many people practice similar forms of meditation that have no connection to the Maharishi ’s movement .
Over the years since TM became popular , many scientists have found physical and mental benefits from mediation in general and transcendental meditation in particular , especially in reducing stress - related ailments .
Since the technique ’s inception in 1955 , the organization says , it has been used to train more than 40,000 teachers , taught more than five million people , opened thousands of teaching centers and founded hundreds of schools , colleges and universities .
In the United States , the organization values its assets at about $ 300 million , with its base in Fairfield , Iowa , where it operates a university , the Maharishi University of Management .
In 2001 , disciples of the movement incorporated their own town , Maharishi Vedic City , a few miles north of Fairfield .
Last March , a branch of the organization , Global Financial Capital of New York , moved into new headquarters it bought in Lower Manhattan .
The visibility and popularity of the organization can largely be attributed to the Beatles .
In 1968 , the band , with great publicity , began studying with the Maharishi at his Himalayan retreat , or ashram , in Rishikesh , in northern India .
They went with their wives , the folk singer Donovan , the singer Mike Love , of the Beach Boys , the actress Mia Farrow and Ms. Farrow ’s sister Prudence .

They left in the wake of rumors of sexual improprieties by the Maharishi , an avowed celibate , though no sexual - misconduct suits were filed and some of the participants later denied that anything untoward had occurred .
Nevertheless , public interest in the movement had been aroused in the West , and it continued to grow in the 1970s as the Maharishi took his movement around the world and as its techniques gained respectability in the medical world .
Later in life , the Maharishi refused to discuss the Beatles .
Another one of his disciples was the Indian spiritualist Deepak Chopra , who was a friend of the former Beatle George Harrison and who promotes his own teachings based on traditional Indian Ayurvedic medicine and meditation .
The Maharishi ’s movement began losing followers the late 1970s , as people were put off by the organization ’s promotion of a more advanced form of TM called Yogic Flying , in which practitioners try to summon a surge of energy to physically lift themselves off the ground .
They have never gone beyond the initial stage of flying , described as “ frog hops . ”
Mahesh Prasad Varma was born near the central Indian town of Jabalpur , into a scribe caste family .
Called Mahesh , he studied physics at Allahabad University and for the next 13 years became a student and secretary to a holy man , Swami Brahmananda Saraswati , who the young disciple Mahesh called Guru Dev .
“ Right from the beginning the whole purpose was to breathe in his breath , ” the Maharishi wrote in his “ Thirty Years Around the World : Dawn of the Age of Enlightenment , ” published in 1986 .
“ This was my ideal .
The whole purpose was just to assume myself with Guru Dev . ”
After the death of his master in 1953 , Mahesh went into seclusion in the Himalayan foothills .
He emerged two years later and began teaching a system of belief , which grew into the worldwide TM movement .
“ It would appear that Maharishi cobbled together his teaching after his master died , when he found himself unemployed and out - of - grace with the ashram , ” said Paul Mason , a critic of the Maharishi and the author of a biography , “ The Maharishi : The Biography of the Man Who Gave Transcendental Meditation to the World . ”
“ He reinvented himself and became a ‘ maharishi ’ and wanted to be seen as a messiah . ”
Since 1990 , the Maharishi had lived in Vlodrop with about 50 of his adherents , including his “ minister of science and technology , ” John Hagelin , a Harvard - educated physicist , who is expected to oversee the organization in the United States .
Late in life , the Maharishi tried to breathe new life into TM , establishing in 2000 his “ Global Country of World Peace , ” with the goals of preventing war , eradicating poverty and promoting environmental sustainability .
One effort tried to reach young people across the United States with the support of celebrities like Donovan and the filmmaker David Lynch , who went on a speaking tour of colleges to promote the cause .
The Maharishi also sought to rebuild the world according to Vedic principals .
He called for the demolition of all toxic buildings and unhealthy urban environments , even the demolition of historic landmarks if they were not built according to “ Vedic architecture in harmony with Natural Law . ”
The Maharishi contended that the White House was wrongly situated .
He said that a more suitable location for the capital of the United States was the small town of Smith Center , Kan .
In the last years of his life he rarely met with anyone , even his ministers , face - to - face , preferring to speak with followers almost exclusively by closed - circuit television .
A scathing op - ed in today ’s Hartford Courant gives background on George Bush ’s nominee to be the third ranking official at the Department of Justice , Kevin O’Connor .
Most interesting , the denunciation of O’Connor was written by a Connecticut Republican .
O’Connor demonstrated the excesses of the Bush administration in a case he brought — and lost — against Connecticut librarians under the Patriot Act .
Yes , librarians :
The test of whether an official is worthy of power is how he exercises it when the law shuts out public scrutiny .
Connecticut U.S. Attorney Kevin O’Connor failed that test in 2005 when he thought no one was looking at his abuse of the USA Patriot Act .
His own incompetence , however , allowed light to shine on his battle in the shadows against four upright Connecticut librarians .
The U.S. Senate can take a stand for individual liberty by rejecting President Bush ’s nomination of O’Connor to a high - ranking position in the Justice Department that includes overseeing the enforcement of civil rights .
O’Connor not only lost the case , he made a mockery of the proceeding .
Read the op-ed .
O’Connor fits the mold of a loyal Bushie who has no regard for civil liberties .
We ’ve had enough of those types .
There ’s more after the break .
The Senate should also ask him about his letter to Ron Kaufman ( You know his name .
He ’s the lobbyist who is with Mitt Romney all the time even though Mitt does n’t have lobbyists in his campaign . ) :
O’Connor had foreshadowed his taste for mixing law enforcement and political ambition in a letter he had sent to Washington Republican operative Ron Kaufman at the beginning of the George W. Bush administration , seeking help in snagging the U.S. attorney job in Connecticut .
He saw the job as a gate to higher office : “ Simply put , there is no better position for me to occupy before a statewide run for office than United States Attorney , ” he wrote .
Senators may want a copy of that letter .
It reveals more about O’Connor than the 50 - page questionnaire he provided the committee .
If members of the Senate really do worry about shrouded abuses that occur under the Patriot Act , this is the time to prove it .
The Judiciary Committee holds a hearing on O’Connor ’s nomination Tuesday .
It can punish , not promote , an official who engaged in an abuse of his office while claiming the nation ’s security was at risk .
O’Connor is so hungry for higher office , he was willing to trample the civil rights of librarians .
He should be working for Cheney .
BRUSSELS , Feb 27 ( Reuters ) - The European Commission fined Microsoft MSFT .
O a record 899 million euros ( $ 1.35 billion ) on Wednesday for defying sanctions imposed on the software giant for antitrust violations , far exceeding the original penalty .
The Commission , executive arm of the European Union , has now fined Microsoft 1.68 billion euros for its original violation and for failing to comply with sanctions , more than any other firm .
It said no other company had ever ignored sanctions .
“ Microsoft was the first company in 50 years of EU competition policy that the Commission has had to fine for failure to comply with an antitrust decision , ” Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement .
The Commission said in a landmark 2004 ruling -- upheld by an EU court last year -- that Microsoft had failed to provide needed interoperability information to rival makers of “ work group server ” software .
That software operates printers and sign - ons in small office groups , but to work must connect with desktop Windows machines .
Microsoft was ordered to provide interoperability information .
Microsoft said it would , but only for large royalties .
The Commission said that was unreasonable .
“ I hope that today ’s decision closes a dark chapter in Microsoft ’s record of non-compliance with the Commission ’s March 2004 decision , ” Kroes said .
After fining Microsoft 407 million euros in 2004 , the Commission fined it another 280.5 million euros in July 2006 for failing to comply with the sanctions through June 21 , 2006 .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
Former detainees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the country during their deportation .
Raymond Soeoth , pictured here with his wife , says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will .
One of the drugs in question is the potent anti-psychotic drug Haldol , which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses .
Doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered .
Two immigrants , Raymond Soeoth of Indonesia and Amadou Diouf of Senegal in West Africa , told CNN they were injected with the drugs against their will .
Both are plaintiffs in a class - action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the government .
They are seeking an end to the alleged practice and unspecified damages .
Watch why the former detainees claim abuse »
Dr. Paul Appelbaum , a professor of psychiatry , law and ethics at Columbia University , reviewed both men's medical records for this report and was stunned by what he discovered .
" I 'm really shocked to find out that the government has been using physicians and using potent medications in this way , " said Appelbaum , who also serves as a member of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law .
" That is the sort of thing that would be subject to a malpractice claim in the civilian world . "
The allegations of ICE forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by Sen. Joe Lieberman , I - Connecticut , during the re-nomination hearing of ICE chief Julie Myers .
" The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling , particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards , " Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips told CNN in an e-mail .
" Senator Lieberman intends to follow up with ICE to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so . "
ACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham , who is representing Soeoth and Diouf , said , " It would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who is n't even mentally ill .
...
But here , it 's happening on U.S. soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport . "
Responding to Lieberman 's written questions , Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had " medical escorts " for deportation since 2003 .
From October last year to the end of April this year , she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process .
Of those , 33 detainees received medication " because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and / or self , " she said .
" First , I am aware of , and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards , " Myers said .
She added no detainee should be " involuntarily medicated without court order , " except in emergency situations .
But both Soeoth and Diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior .
Drug Facts 
Haldol is a drug used to treat psychotic disorders and symptoms such as hallucinations , delusions and hostility " to control muscular tics of the face , neck , hands and shoulders "
 Side effects of the drug can include seizures , tremors , irregular heartbeat , difficulty breathing and other symptoms
 Cogentin is a drug used to treat symptoms of Parkinson 's disease and to offset tremors caused by other medications
 Side effects can include drowsiness , difficulty urinating , depression and delusions

Soeoth , a Christian minister from Indonesia , spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected .
Hours before he was to be sent back home on December 7 , 2004 , he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days .
See the document that shows Soeoth was injected
" They pushed me on the bench , they opened my pants , and they just give me injection , " he said through broken English .
He says he was taken to Los Angeles International Airport while in this drug - induced stupor , but two hours before takeoff , airline security refused to transport him , so ICE agents returned him to his cell at Terminal Island near Los Angeles .
Terminal Island , once a federal prison , is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation .
Soeoth 's medical records indicate he was injected with Cogentin and Haldol , even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness .
In the records , the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark Soeoth denies ever making .
ICE said in a written statement it could n't respond to specific allegations due to pending litigation .
" Department of Homeland Security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees , " the ICE statement said .
" Only trained and qualified medical professionals , including officers of the U.S. Public Health Service , may prescribe or administer medication . "
But , Diouf says , he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported .
He said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his U.S. government escorts would n't let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country .
See Diouf 's stay of deportation document
That 's when , he says , " I was wrestled to the ground and injected through my clothes . "
A government report says he was medicated because he did not follow orders .
In both cases , Diouf and Soeoth remain in the United States pending a decision in the case .
If they lose , they may land back in the hands of ICE , once again facing deportation .
Soeoth says he 's traumatized by what happened .
" I know this country [ is ] very generous to immigrants , " he says .
" What they did to me was very , very bad . "

Bloomberg 's allegation
New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg yesterday alleged " fraud " in the unofficial count of New York City 's votes , which left Obama with zero votes in 80 election districts .
" If you want to call it significant undercounting , I guess that 's a euphemism for fraud , " he said .
This contradicts what some familiar with the system thought , which was that it 's within the range of error for the sloppy , unofficial count .
Bloomberg 's spokesman , Stu Loeser , reiterated the charge in an e-mail , in which he also made clear that the charge was part of the mayor 's local campaign to take the Board of Elections out of the control of the local political parties .
There are plenty of people arguing that the same error could have been made by mistake more than 80 times ( and counting ! ) , but the mayor is less sanguine .
Certainly , if the system for administering elections was based on competence ( and if the special - interest induced gridlock in Albany had n’t prevented the State from certifying new machines some time in the last 40 or more years ) , someone might have noticed that there ’s a problem where Sen .
Obama apparently got no votes in areas where he clearly had a lot of support .
Bloomberg controls the police department , and I asked if he planned an investigation .
Loeser said he did n't think there was actually a legal issue at stake in the preliminary , unofficial vote counts .
Anyway , we 'll have a clear sense of the scale of the discrepency when the state gets an official count .
And the Harlem results , at least , are unlikely to swing the delegate count ; Clinton won the district by 4 percentage points and split the delegates anyway .
But it 's a pretty dramatic allegation .
I 'm surprised it has n't gotten more attention .

Get this one : Halloween mask sales predictor says incumbent will beat Kerry in November .
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - Forget about the guesswork from the political pundits and ignore all those election polls .
The real key to predicting the outcome of the presidential election is this year 's face - off of the Halloween masks .
It 's as unscientific as it gets , but the theory , according to some people in the costume business , is that the winner in every election since 1980 has been the candidate whose masks were most popular on Halloween .
So far this year , Bush masks have been outselling those of Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry by a 57 percent to 43 percent margin , according to one outfit , BuyCostumes.com , the online arm of Wisconsin - based costume marketer Buyseasons Inc. BuyCostumes.com says Halloween sales figures from manufacturers , national store chains and its own efforts have accurately picked the last six presidential elections .
So does this mean W. gets a second term in office ?
" It has n't failed us yet , " Daniel Haight , chief operating officer at Buyseasons , said in an interview .
" The masks are a great way for people to express their political leanings at a Halloween party or at a political gathering . "
Haight declined to disclose just how many Bush and Kerry masks the company has sold so far , saying only that several thousand had been sold of each candidate .
The company 's most popular presidential mask ?
That of former president Ronald Reagan in 1984 , Haight said .
" Bill Clinton masks are still very popular and masks of Bush cabinet members such as Condoleeza Rice and Colin Powell are also gaining popularity . "
" As a company , we 're neutral in terms of affiliation , " Haight said .
" We 're just having lots of fun with the mask predictor .
We 're not here to influence people one way or the other on how to vote .
We want the customer to influence the outcome through their wallets . "

Paint.NET ’s license is very generous , and I even release the source code .
All free of charge .
Unfortunately it gets taken advantage of every once in awhile by scum who are trying to profit from the work of others .
I like to call this backspaceware * .
They download the source code for something , load it up in to Visual Studio ( or whatever ) , hit the
backspace key over the software ’s name and credits , type in a new name and author , and re-release it .
They send it to all the download mirror sites , and do n’t always do a good job covering up their tracks .
There is currently an individual who is doing this with Paint.
NET .
I wo n’t mention them by name or link to them in order to avoid pumping up their PageRank .
Basically what they ’ve done is downloaded the Paint .
NET v3.10 source code , renamed it and changed the credits , removed the license and copyright notice ( which violates the Paint .
NET license , btw ) , plagiarized a bunch of content from the Paint.
NET website , and bundled half the plugins from the Paint.
NET forum without any of the authors ’ permission .
That last one really pisses me off .
It ’s not enough to take advantage of my generosity , he has to backstab the altruistic community as well .
“ My paint program supports all sorts of cool effects and file formats !!! ”
Yeah jerk , because you ripped off the work of 50 people by blatantly violating United States copyright law .
What ’s even more entertaining is that this is the third time this guy has done this !
He ’s also been known to do this with all sorts of other freeware applications that are nice enough to release the source code .
Oh , and did I mention when you install this guy ’s backspaceware that it uninstalls Paint .
NET ?
It also tries to use the same installation directory , %PROGRAMFILES % \Paint.NET .
( Do n’t worry I used a virtual PC )
He did n’t even remove the LICENSE .
TXT files from the plugins he stole , which correctly cite themselves as Paint.
NET plugins .
Real innovative work there , bub .
I hope he puts this on his resume and someone asks him about it during an interview – that would be an entertaining conversation to watch .
Manager : “ So you ripped off Paint . NET and a bunch of plugins , and re-released it with your name on it ? ”
Him : “ Yup ! ”
Manager : “ Cool !
Welcome to your new job at Clown Burger .
Make sure to ask customers if they want fries with that . ”
Him : “ I get free lunch right ? ”
I went and searched through my Inbox for his name because I wanted to find the e-mails I sent him the last two times he did this .
What I also found was that awhile ago I actually gave this scumface technical support when he was having trouble installing Paint .
NET !
It ’s so nice that he ’s turned around and dumped on my face to show his appreciation .
To combat this and a few other similar instances that have happened over the years , I believe I will change the way that I release the source code for Paint.
NET .
As a stopgap before the v3.20 release , the version 3.10 source code is no longer available , starting immediately , while I finalize on this decision .
It just feels like it ’s a disaster waiting to happen with the way I ’ve been releasing it so far .
Here are the changes I ’m thinking of :
I will no longer be releasing the source code for the installer .
I will no longer be releasing the source code for PaintDotNet .
Resources.dll , which has the code for loading resources as well as all the graphics ( icons , logo , etc . )
I will no longer be releasing the text and graphic resources in the source code distribution ( RESX files , icons , logos ) .
This includes the translations to non-English languages .
I am still contemplating how much of PaintDotNet.exe I want to release .
Especially parts such as the updater and core parts of the main UI that I ’ve spent a lot of creative energy on .
The goal is to dramatically increase the amount of work required to release a backspaceware version of Paint.
NET .
The first one clearly does this .
The 2nd and 3rd make it much harder to change names , credits , and logos .
The 4th one makes it much more difficult to rip off the UI or “ shell ” of Paint .
NET .
Plugin authors often need something to debug with , and I still want to ensure that people can study the source code for educational or honestly innovative purposes .
These consumers of the source code do n’t need access to the resource files : you can just use the PaintDotNet.Resources.dll and PaintDotNet.Strings.3.resources that ship with the regular download .
However , by making it more difficult to commit a “ backspace violation ” , I am hoping to put an end to this and other lazy copycat schmucks .
A lot of software implements copy protection to save profits , but I ’ve never really believed in the stuff .
It ’s unfortunate that I have to investigate these measures in order to help protect myself and others from lazy ripoff jerks .
* Someone else suggested “ thief - ware ” , but I think that implies at least a little planning and cunning .
I believe that “ backspace ” - ware correctly infers the level of simple laziness and lack of any real skill .

John McCain Gets Soros Cash
DiscovertheNetwork.org / Moonbat Central ^ | March 10 , 2005 | Richard Poe

[ history ]
Senator John McCain's Reform Institute has suffered some bad press recently due to its involvement in an influence - peddling scandal with Cablevision .
As usual , however , mainstream media have failed to go to the root of the matter .
Founded on June 26 , 2001 , McCain 's Reform Institute for Campaign and Election Issues has long served as a nerve center for the so - called " campaign finance reform " movement  a movement which has done nothing to clean up campaign finance , but has done a great deal to empower federal judges and government bureaucrats to regulate political speech , in defiance of the Bill of Rights .
Now here 's the kicker .
The list of donors published on the Reform Institute 's Web site reads like a veritable Who's Who of radical , leftwing foundations , including the Tides Foundation , the Carnegie Corporation of New York , the Proteus Fund and George Soros ' Open Society Institute .
( hat tip , Winfield Myers )
Not surprisingly , in view of the above associations , Arianna Huffington serves on the Reform Institute 's Advisory Board .
Huffington has long acted as a front for George Soros ' " campaign finance reform " efforts .
In 2000 , she organized the so - called Shadow Conventions which provided John McCain with a bully pulpit to stump for his now - infamous McCain - Feingold Act.
George Soros shouldered about one third of the cost of the Shadow Conventions .

Personally I think McCain is the most corrupt senator in Congress and belonged in jail with all the Keating Five and not in the Senate of the United States .

McCain is another political chameleon .
AND he certainly is no conservative , a hard core RINO in my opinion .
Like all of our fine powercentric politicians ( eg like the Marxist Medusa ) he will be anywhere , say anything , or do anything to gain power -- remember he was one of the first blatantly sucsessful engineers of legislation which flew in the face of the First Amendment ( McCain - Feingold ) , which Bush approved , of course .

I can't help but like the guy .
To me it looks like he says what he feels and he tries to do what he believes is right even if it might hurt him politically .
That does n't make him right all the time , but it makes him a better man than most of those worthless tools in Congress and the Senate .

The MSM is also putting Rudy Guiliani in the mix .
This is meant to undercut the true conservatives ......
Doubtful that McC or Rudy would ever get the republican nomination .
However , in the states that allow dems to vote in open primaries , I am sure McC would win in that state .

" .... he hasnt ordered the " suicide " of anyone I dont believe .... "
Well maybe not .. but he was on the committee with JOHN KERRY - where they accepted the NV accounting of our missing in action .
And .. of course Kerry was not going to force his friends to account for our men .
Maybe McCain did n't pull the trigger - but he sentenced those men to die in some stinking prison somewhere .
DON'T ANYBODY EVER TELL ME THIS MAN SHOULD BE PRESIDENT .
I knew McCain was scum when he was running against Bush and his WIFE was wearing a HILLARY PIN on her suit .
I think McCain is a snake and I would never vote for him or trust him with America .

How did the candidates rate at the Republican debate on November 28 ?
Take a look at the top picks by CNN 's political analysts and then make your choices by dragging the photos to the answer fields .
View CNN voter results
QUESTIONS : Gloria Borger
Sr. political analyst Jamal Simmons
Democratic strategist Bill Bennett
Conservative analyst 1 .
Who do you think won the debate ?
I do n't think there was a clear winner tonight McCain won because he looked like an adult Romney .
He was strong , in command , and articulate 2 .
Who seemed to know most about the issues ?
McCain was especially strong on national security , belittling Romney 's experience on the torture issue McCain was head and shoulders above the rest on being adept at the issues Depended on the issue 3 .
Who had the best response to user - generated content ?
They were all pretty much the same Huckabee 's answer on the Bible being the literal word of God was great
That 's hard to say .
Anderson did well in clarifying the questions 4 .
Who had the most disappointing performance at the debate ?
Paul did n't wow the crowd the way he sometimes does Thompson was the most surprising ; seems like he was lost without his cue cards Paul just does not come off convincing or presidential 5 .
Whose performance was most surprising ?
Thompson showed his sense of humor with his video and response to the Cheney cartoon Paul came off very direct and clear .
He is the most extreme candidate on stage but seemed quite reasonable I was surprised Giuliani went so strongly after Romney in the opening on immigration 6 .
Whose campaign got the biggest boost from the debate ?
Maybe Huckabee , who showed his easy demeanor and sense of humor
It seems like Paul and Huckabee stood out the most Romney , no doubt 7 .
Who had the most creative campaign video ?
Thompson Thompson .
I do n't know if it was creative but it certainly was the most provocative I guess I 'd give that to Giuliani ; kind of funny , but I 'm not a great judge of these things NOTE :
You must answer all questions before submitting your vote .
The Democratic race is turning out to be a battle of Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s “ top - down ” style of politics and Barack Obama ’s “ bottom - up , ” grassroots approach .
At least , that ’s the view of Joe Trippi , a senior adviser to John Edwards , who addressed the changing political climate — particularly the transformation of the Democratic party — at a panel Wednesday in Washington .
What ’s rocking the boat ?
The Internet , mostly .
Every day , it seems , the Web provides another way for average citizens to be active in the political process , instead of having the effects of politics trickle down to them .
As campaign manager for the Howard Dean presidential campaign in 2004 , Mr. Trippi was among the first strategists to harness the Web to create grassroots networks of supporters — and collect small donations from them .
But even Mr. Trippi is wowed by the grassroots movement that Barack Obama ’s bottom up campaign has created .
By successfully harnessing that power , Mr. Obama is able to compete with the powerful Clinton machine — which Mr. Trippi calls not just a “ normal ” top - down campaign , “ the best top - down campaign , the strongest one ever put together . ”
When the Dean campaign ended in early 2004 , 1.4 million blogs were on the Web , Mr. Trippi said .
Now there are 77 million .
Add in YouTube , social networking sites and widespread broadband , and you ’ve got yourself a whole new kind of campaign to run .
“ We were like the Wright Brothers , ” he said , “ this flimsy little thing with a few propellers , compared to just four years later , they ’re landing on the moon . ”
As proof , Mr. Trippi points to the disparities between donations to the Clinton and Obama campaigns .
Only 10 percent of Clinton contributors did not donate the legal maximum $ 2,300 for her primary campaign .
In contrast , only three percent of Obama donors gave the maximum .
The rest of the cash came from small sums from many more people .
Mr. Trippi made clear that he “ would still not today write the Clintons out of this , ” but noted that even if Hillary Rodham Clinton wrestles the nomination away from Barack Obama , this election cycle has proved that ground - level networking will be an important part of future campaigns .
Andres Ramirez of the New Democratic Network ’s Hispanic program presented figures suggesting that the portion of the nation ’s Hispanic population that voted for President Bush is turning back to the Democratic party — and becoming more politically active in general — in protest to the G.O.P. ’s hard - line stance on immigration it ’s held since 2006 .
And , what ’s more , he noted that the recent Arizona primary , the home state senator , John McCain , won about 22 percent of the Hispanic electorate .
Mr. Obama — the candidate pegged in the media as less - Latino friendly than Mrs. Clinton — took 28 percent of that demographic , Mr. Ramirez said .
Simon Rosenberg , the founder of the progressive N.D.N. think tank , the sponsor of the event , called Mr. McCain the “ worst candidate ” the Republicans could have chosen because he ’s the biggest throwback to old , white America , which is slowly ceasing to exist .
( Mr. McCain ’s sometimes campaign theme song , ’50s hit “ Johnny B. Goode , ” does n’t help that image , Mr. Rosenberg said . )
Considering the low approval ratings for President Bush and considering the high Democratic primary turnout , Mr. Rosenberg said the only way the Democrats could blow the November election would be to determine the nominee based on a superdelegate vote in the proverbial “ smoke - filled room ” at the party convention .
In that case , all the youthful energy the Democrats seem to have now would vanish .
Nowadays , anyway , Democrats at all levels across the country are more and more considering themselves to be “ partners in the fight , not donors to the cause , ” Mr. Rosenberg said , meaning people feel they can be a part of the process from their own homes and in their own communities — not just by volunteering at a phone bank like in the days of old .
“ And I ’d rather have one million people on my team than 200 kids in an office , ” he said .
After reading the book How Come That Idiot ’s Rich and I ’m Not ?
I ’m totally committed to setting up my own business .
One of the requirements for that is to have a business account with someone like Paypal , because its very easy to handle all your online invoicing and payments .
Paypal is secure , reliable and most important of all – easy to use .
It is used for almost every single website to make a purchase , like shopping , paying rent , paying bills ,
There are many porn sites that accept Paypal now for those tired of putting in credit card information .
When you signup for PayPal , you can start accepting credit card payments instantly .
As the world ’s number one online payment service , PayPal is the fastest way to open your doors to over 230 million member accounts worldwide .
Here ’s how to set up a Paypal account for your business .
1. Print out these instructions
2. Click here to Set Up Paypal Business Account
3. Scroll down and click where it says : “ sign up today ”
4 . Choose whether you want a personal , premier or business account
If this account is for your business , you should choose Premier Account or Business Account
Here ’s the only difference : a Paypal Business Account allows you to set up the account under your business name , much like a merchant services company .
But you need to have a business bank account and wait for your Paypal Business Account to be approved .
If you do n’t have a business bank account but you want your Paypal account under your business name , here ’s how to get around it : sign up for a Premier Account , but instead of putting your name in the name field , put your business name .
For example , if your business name is Acme Consulting , put “ Acme ” in the “ first name ” box and “ Consulting ” in the surname box .
5 . Choose your country
6. Click Continue
7 . Fill in all your info ( see note above about business name )
8. Click Continue
After your account is set up you can pay someone by Paypal , or request payment ( send an invoice ) just by going to www.paypal.com and logging in to your account .
It ’s very easy to use PayPal .
IN the unforgiving fluorescent light of Rosenfeld Hall , a dormitory on the periphery of Yale ’s campus , students crouched in a hallway and quickly stuffed their clothes into plastic grocery bags .
Shirts were left inside out , socks balled in pant legs .
Giggling , they hurried into a basement storage room , where some 40 people stood around , under stone arches and gargoyles , wearing nothing but shoes .
Lighted only by tea candles , the party had the afterglow of a literary reading : Students chatted in small groups , drifting toward the darkest parts of the room .
Arms held tight to the body , eyes unwavering from face level , they drank and smoked and talked about the fact that they were naked : “ I ’m so pale . ”
“ You look radiant . ”
“ The air feels weird without clothes — skin is this big sense organ . ”
This was no bacchanal .
A few students danced , with less body contact than normal , and the men seemed more self - conscious than the women .
When a couple started making out in the back of the room , a barefoot member of the Pundits , the student society that threw the party , asked them to leave .
“ Person - to - space ratio is very , very important , ” he explained dispassionately .
( He would not give his name because the Pundits do n’t want the Yale administration to know who they are . )
He had spent part of the night shuttling people from a meeting place in the center of campus to the party at Rosenfeld Hall .
“ We want to make sure throngs of people are n’t streaming in at once , ” he said .
“ Also , part of it is just the mystique of not knowing where you ’re going .
It ’s become sort of a hip thing to do around here . ”

Hillary rips MSNBC's Shuster
ORONO , Maine — Hillary Rodham Clinton on Saturday morning ripped MSNBC over reporter David Shuster ’s suggestion that Chelsea Clinton was “ sort of being pimped out ” by the campaign .
“ I found the remarks incredibly offensive , ” Clinton told reporters in this snowy town outside Bangor .
Earlier , she sent a letter to NBC brass that called for swift action against Shuster , who was suspended Friday by MSNBC .

“ Nothing justifies the kind of debasing language that David Shuster used and no temporary suspension or half - hearted apology is sufficient , ” Clinton wrote to NBC News President Steve Capus , who apparently had already called Clinton to personally apologize .
“ I would urge you to look at the pattern of behavior on your network that seems to repeatedly lead to this sort of degrading language , ” Clinton wrote .
“ There ’s a lot at stake for our country in this election .
Surely , you can do your jobs as journalists and commentators and still keep the discourse civil and appropriate . ”
NBC did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment .
The letter and harsh rebuke followed similar comments made by her top advisers and came a day after Shuster issued an on - air apology and was suspended .
The hubbub started Thursday , when Shuster guest - hosted Tucker Carlson ’s MSNBC show , “ Tucker . ”
In a discussion about Chelsea Clinton ’s role in calling superdelegates on behalf of her mother ’s presidential campaign , he asked whether she was “ sort of being pimped out in some weird sort of way . ”
The Clinton campaign immediately demanded an apology and floated the possibility that Clinton would no longer participate in an MSNBC debate , scheduled for Feb. 26 .
The campaign did not explain under what conditions Clinton would participate in MSNBC 's debate .
In her comments to reporters Friday , Clinton sounded ambivalent about participating in the debate .
“ We ’ve accepted a lot of debates from a lot of different sponsors , and we ’re going to wait and see how this plays out , ” she said .
“ I am a mom first and a candidate second , ” she said .
“ You know I can take whatever comes my way .
That ’s what I signed up for as a candidate and an office holder . ”
She cast Shuster ’s comments as part of “ a troubling pattern of comments and behavior that has to be held accountable . ”
MSNBC host Chris Matthews last month apologized over remarks he made about Clinton that were widely denounced as sexist .
FULL TEXT OF LETTER :
Dear Mr. Capus ,
Thank you for your call yesterday .
I wanted to send you this note to convey the depth of my feeling about David Shuster 's comments .
I know that I am a public figure and that my daughter is playing a public role in my campaign .
I am accustomed to criticism , certainly from MSNBC .
I know that it goes with the territory .
However , I became Chelsea 's mother long before I ran for any office and I will always be a mom first and a public official second .
Nothing justifies the kind of debasing language that David Shuster used and no temporary suspension or half - hearted apology is sufficient .
I would urge you to look at the pattern of behavior on your network that seems to repeatedly lead to this sort of degrading language .
There 's a lot at stake for our country in this election .
Surely , you can do your jobs as journalists and commentators and still keep the discourse civil and appropriate .
Sincerely ,
Hillary Rodham Clinton
In 1958 , a New York man named Robert Lane decided to call his baby son Winner .
The Lanes , who lived in a housing project in Harlem , already had several children , each with a fairly typical name .
But this boy – well , Robert Lane apparently had a special feeling about this one .
Winner Lane : how could he fail with a name like that ?
Three years later , the Lanes had another baby boy , their seventh and last child .
For reasons that no one can quite pin today , Robert decided to name this boy Loser .
It does n’t appear that Robert was unhappy about the new baby ; he just seemed to get a kick out of the name ’s bookend effect .
First a Winner , now a Loser .
But if Winner Lane could hardly be expected to fail , how could Looser Lane possibly succeed ?
Loser Lane did in fact succeed .
He went to prep school on a scholarship , graduated from Lafayette College in Pennsylvania , and joined NYPD ( it was his mother ’s longtime wish ) .
Although he never hid his name , people were uncomfortable using it .
“ So I have a bunch of names , ” he says today , “ from Jimmy to James to whatever they want to call you .
But they rarely call you Loser . ”
Once in a while , he said , “ they throw a French twist on it : ‘ Losier . ’ ”
To his cop friends he is known as Lou .
And what of his brother with the can ’t - miss name ?
The most noteworthy achievement of Winner Lane , how in his mid forties , is the length of his criminal record : almost three dozen arrests for burglary , domestic violence , trespassing , resisting arrest , and other mayhem .
These days Loser and Winner barely speak .
The father who named them is no longer alive .
Clearly , he had the right idea – that naming is destiny – but he must have gotten the boys mixed up .

OTTAWA – One - in - five people in Canada is foreign - born according to census numbers released Tuesday , an immigration surge unprecedented in a quarter - of - a- century and one that comes as the country grapples with acts of overt racism that fly in the face of Canada 's reputation for tolerance .
While the " neo-racism " that infects society through subtle , systemic practices has largely been the focus of anti-racism crusaders , recent reports of assaults against Asian fisherman in Ontario and open anti-Muslim sentiment in Quebec have become the subject of inquiries and commissions .
Canada garners kudos from around the world for laws promising equality for all , but experts say the true test of a tolerant nation is in day - to - day living .
" It 's important for us to have human rights written down ... but really where human rights exist is on the street , " said Marguerite Cassin , a Dalhousie University professor who has written papers on racism .
" We know we have human rights when there is an absence of ( racist ) incidents . "
The latest census figures show that 19.8 per cent of the population in 2006 was foreign born , the highest proportion since 1931 and up 13.6 per cent from five years earlier .
By contrast , the entire Canadian population grew only 3.3 per cent in the same period .
Almost two - thirds of the nation 's foreign - born population resided in Canada 's three biggest cities : Toronto , Vancouver and Montreal .
The highest percentage of newcomers to Canada were from China ( 14 per cent ) , followed by India ( 11.6 ) , the Philippines ( 7 ) and Pakistan ( 5.2 ) .
For the first time , the proportion of foreign - born immigrants from Asian and Middle Eastern countries ( 41 per cent ) outstripped those of European heritage ( 37 ) .
" The newcomers who came between 2001 and 2006 , we have about 1.1 million of them , and they added to Canada 's diverse population because they report coming from about over 200 countries , " said Statistics Canada analyst Tina Chui .
" When you look at that , Canada is like a world within a country . "
An aging population and the declining birth rate has Canada on track to becoming fully dependent on immigration for population growth by around 2030 , Statistics Canada data suggests .
Among Western nations , only Australia had a higher percentage of foreign - born residents ( 22.2 per cent ) than Canada in 2006 .
The United States had 12.5 per cent foreign - born .
Almost four decades after Canada became the first country in the world to adopt multiculturalism as official policy , the emergence of apparently racist acts raises questions about how harmoniously the races are living together .
In 2004 , the United Nations Special Rapporteur on racism found that while Canada supports ethnic diversity through policy , law and numerous government - led programs , " tangible " racism continues to exist in the country .
The Muslim population in Quebec continues to deal with what it sees as racist attitudes in everything from girls ' soccer to small - town misconceptions about Canadian Muslims .
In January , the rural town of Herouxville passed a policy paper laying out norms for immigrants that declared , among other things , that it is forbidden to stone women in public .
A commission has since been struck to hear what Quebecers feel is reasonable in terms of accommodating the practices of other cultures .
" What we 're seeing is that , in the regions of Quebec there are people who have never met minorities before ( and ) are coming out with ... outlandish statements , " said Sameer Zuberi of the Canadian Council on American - Islamic Relations .
" A lot of it has to do with people not understanding and people not knowing each other . "
Although Canadian - born , Zuberi said it was during his teen years that he began to notice that others viewed him as " different , even though I was born ( in Montreal ) . "
" I would say that is an ongoing thing , it exists and that has led to a lot of the reason why I 'm doing what I 'm doing today , " he said .
In Ontario , reports of Asian - Canadian anglers being targeted and assaulted while fishing on Lake Simcoe in the town of Georgina , 80 kilometres north of Toronto , have instigated an inquiry .
Several men face charges after the fishermen where pushed into the lake , their gear destroyed and windshields smashed .
" In a way , I 'm glad that it 's coming out , it 's coming forward , it 's being talked about , " said Avvy Go of the Metro Toronto Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic .
" I hope that this will force all Canadians to take a look at what 's happening and try to understand why , in 2007 , we still have to deal with that in Canada , supposedly one of the most multicultural societies in the world . "
Ontario Human Rights Commissioner Barbara
Hall struck an inquiry following the assaults and said it 's clear when cultures ignorant of one another meet it can set the stage for conflict .

Greater understanding of one another 's practices is key to overcoming that threat , she said .
" That 's not new , because our diversity and the constant change of populations who are coming to Canada mean that we are always having to learn about new communities , " said Hall .
" In the various places where attacks have occurred against Asian - Canadian anglers , we see what appears to be racial stereotyping , racial profiling , hostility . "
That hostility is n't confined to just two select groups .
Each year , B'nai Brith Canada releases its list of anti-Semitic events which includes everything from rocks thrown through synagogue windows to hate crimes on the Internet and toppled gravestones .
In Vancouver , a special task force has been struck amid a dramatic spike in murders as gang factions within the Indo - Canadian community wage war against one another .
In the United States , immigration issues – largely focused on Mexican immigration – loom large in political debates heading toward the 2008 presidential election and the country remains mired in the racist legacy of slavery .
Canada 's history is filled with its own sordid tales of the ugly actions that result when suspicion of newcomers overwhelms .
The internment of Japanese - Canadians during the Second World War , the Chinese Head Tax and past discriminatory immigration practices against African Americans and Jews are just a few examples , said Cassin .
Current laws prevent people from being denied access to education or participation in society based on their race or culture , " so at that kind of level , in institutional practices , there is equality , " Cassin said .
" The reality , however , is that we do differentiate among one another every day on everything , from choosing jobs , organizing promotions to who gets served in line first , all of those kinds of things . "
While overt acts of racism are easy to identify , a subtler form that Cassin identifies as " neo-racism " is a much trickier entity .
" Do we mean is something illegal , or do we mean that we 're not nice to each other ? " said Cassin .
" Or does it mean what I try to get it to mean , which is that we treat one another in racialized ways , where we 're taking our race into account when we 're making decisions or we 're making preferences . "
Moving beyond those practices will be " tough work , " Cassin added .
" Making Canada , making a country made up of people that come and will continue to come from all sorts of other countries and circumstances , it 's tough work .
It requires engagement , " she said .
" It 's not completed .
It 's a work that is something that all of us have to be part of all of the time . "

This will be hard for the Clinton campaign to spin :
His winning margins were substantial , ranging from roughly two - thirds of the vote in Washington state and Nebraska to nearly 90 percent in the Virgin Islands .
With returns counted from more than one - third of the Louisiana precincts , he was gaining 53 percent of the vote , to 39 percent for the former first lady .
Actually they do have spin :
The Obama campaign has dramatically outspent our campaign in these three states , saturating the airwaves with 30 and 60 second ads .
The Obama campaign has spent $ 300,000 more in Louisiana on television ads , $ 190,000 more in Nebraska and $ 175,000 more in Nebraska .
So why did n't Clinton compete ?
As Ambers puts it :
Ordinarily , this would be a firing offense -- how dare they let a state go uncontested ?
Two words come to mind when assessing Clinton 's apparent strategy to wait the primaries out till bigger , more fertile states : Rudy .
Giuliani .

Pakistan 's military ruler , President Pervez Musharraf , has finally set a date for national elections , meeting a key demand of opposition leader , Benazir Bhutto .
But he has stopped short of putting a time - limit on emergency rule , which was invoked on 3 November , or giving a date for his retirement as army chief .
Ms Bhutto has been urging Gen Musharraf to make a clear stand on both , or face street protests .
The two leaders have been locked in talks for several months on how to get to what Gen Musharraf has described as " full democracy " .
But his move to impose the emergency has caused an ostensible falling - out between the two , both considered crucial by the West to Pakistan 's fight against Islamist extremism .
Battles
On Friday , the government briefly placed Ms Bhutto under house arrest in Islamabad , the country 's capital , to prevent her from addressing a public meeting in nearby Rawalpindi .
Gen Musharraf imposed emergency rule after months of unrest
The police also foiled her subsequent attempt to meet the country 's " deposed " top judge , Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry .
The question the people are now asking is , is this falling - out quite what it seems ?
More cynical observers think Friday 's dramas in Islamabad and elsewhere are an exercise in mutual face - saving , a clandestine understanding that is meant to benefit both .
According to these observers , the masses in Pakistan are not yet ready to come out in full support of political leaders against a government bent on preventing street protests .
This , they say , was known to Ms Bhutto when she called Friday 's public meeting in Rawalpindi .
Without imposing emergency rule , the general appeared to have no way of getting rid of an increasingly independent court
Her subsequent detention has helped preserve the " mythical name " of the Bhuttos in Pakistan .
And , the cynics say , has also negated the impression that she , a self - declared champion of democracy , is in cahoots with Gen Musharraf , a military dictator who came to power by deposing an elected government .
As for Gen Musharraf , a mock conflict with Ms Bhutto 's Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) affords him time to get the revamped Supreme Court to endorse the legality of his re-election as president .
Nine judges were sacked and replaced after they refused to endorse Gen Musharraf 's declaration of a state of emergency , declaring it unconstitutional .
Without imposing emergency rule , the general appeared to have no way of getting rid of an increasingly independent court that was hearing , and possibly planning to overturn , the legality of his new term as president .
Observers say Gen Musharraf will not prolong the emergency rule because of pressure he is under from Western powers that want him to quit the army and hold early parliamentary elections .
' Measured confrontation '
But another set of observers believe the conflict is genuine , and arises out of Gen Musharraf 's tactics - the imposition of emergency rule and a media blackout - which Ms Bhutto considers detrimental to her interests .
PPP supporters were rounded up by police in Islamabad on Friday
These observers point out that in the past Ms Bhutto has managed to hold larger public gatherings under more oppressive regimes , and can still do that .
But her plan this time appears to be one of " measured confrontation " .
According to these observers , while another opposition leader , Nawaz Sharif , set himself on a collision course with the Musharraf regime and was exiled for a second time , Ms Bhutto adopted the course of dialogue .
This paved the way for her trouble - free return to the country after eight years of self - imposed exile .
Now that she is secure in her base , she can step up pressure on the regime to make further concessions to her party , they argue .
Alternatively , she can use the threat of public demonstrations as an instrument that could upset the applecart for the regime , with serious consequences for Gen Musharraf .
No leadership
On Friday , small - scale but persistent and widespread protests broke out in Rawalpindi , Islamabad and large parts of Ms Bhutto 's native Sindh province over her detention .
But it was obvious that her PPP made no attempt to organise the protesters or provide them with leadership .
Lawyers led early anti-emergency rule protests in Islamabad
Ms Bhutto has now arrived in Lahore , from where she is scheduled to lead a " long march " to Islamabad on 13 November .
And as she ups the ante , she has also made a conscious effort to draw another popular party of the Punjab - former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif 's PMLN - into her anti-government campaign .
On Saturday , Ms Bhutto for the first time made a categorical statement on the chief justice , saying he was still the top judge .
The statement was apparently made in response to a PMLN demand that she make her position on the issue of the sacked judges clear .
Ms Bhutto is clearly trying to force Gen Musharraf to concede to her demands one by one .
Ms Bhutto may be wary of allowing these protests to turn into a wider movement aimed at pulling down the entire edifice of Gen Musharraf 's regime
Her foremost consideration now is the elections , and she has chosen Punjab as her main battlefield .
With the PMLN and other opposition groups in tow , she hopes to lead a huge procession from Lahore to Islamabad , right across the main support base of the PMLQ , Gen Musharraf 's only real political ally .
If the PMLQ - led Punjab government arrests her , she gains in terms of a sympathy vote in Sindh and the southern districts of Punjab .
However , she may be wary of allowing these protests to turn into a wider movement aimed at pulling down the entire edifice of Gen Musharraf 's regime - an aim dear to lawyers , the rights groups and opposition parties like the PMLN .
This , observers say , would divert attention from the threat of militancy and regional instability - something Ms Bhutto will have to contend with if she becomes prime minister , and for which she will need Gen Musharraf and a willing army .
Procedure for Making the Itty Bitty Radio Telescope
Equipment Needed :
1 - DirectTV 18 - inch satellite dish with LNB and mounts
1 - Channel Master 1004IF
Materials Needed :
From builder supply store :
30 " x 30 " 3/4 " composite board or similar material for base
lazy Susan
8 - 1 1/4 " sheet metal or wood screws
wood glue or Elmer 's glue
Teflon or nylon washers
electrical tape
compass
Terminating resistors , number is dependent on number of LNB on the satellite system .
For this dish , 3 were required .
4 ' coax cable
2 ' coax cable
1 - 8 AA battery holder
1 - 9 - volt battery clip
1 - 0.1 MHz RF Choke
8 AA batteries
Table saw
Straight edge
7/16 socket wrench
Screw drivers , both Phillips and straight
Soldering gun , solder , flux
Wire cutters
Wire striper or knife
Drill motor
Bits of varying sizes
Measuring tape
Hack saw
Making the Base for the Itty Bitty Telescope
The satellite dish should come with a mounting bracket used to attach the dish to a house .
You will need to attach this bracket to a base that can turn .
This makes pointing the dish easier .
The base will need to be substantial so as to prevent the dish from toppling over .
Cut the composite board to 30 " by 30 " .
Attach the bottom of the Lazy Suzanne to the center of the composite board .
The base was attached by first drilling holes through the plywood into the base of the Lazy Susan .
These holes will need to be counter sunk so that the screw heads will not extend beyond the base .
Then the base was glued onto the base , which held the base in place while screws were also screwed from the bottom of the base into the bottom of the base of the Lazy Susan .
Attach the top of the Lazy Susan to the base of the Lazy Susan .
Pre - drill a hole through the base board and then use a bolt and washer to attach the top of the Lazy Susan .
This allows for tightening of the Lazy Susan as needed .
( Notice the 8 screws that are counter sunk that attach the base of the Lasy Susan to the baseboard . )
Paint or stain the base if desired .
Procedure for assembling the dish
Your satellite dish should come with the following items : the multi-satellite dish reflector , a mounting bracket used to attach the dish to the house , an arm that attaches the LNB to the dish and the LNB receiver , plus various screws and washers .
You will need to install the terminating resistors on all but one of the LNB outputs .
For this dish there were 4 LNB outputs , thus requiring 3 terminating resistors .
These will help reduce signal loss .
Insert the 4 ' coax cable through the LNB arm before attaching it to the LNB .
Attach the LNB to the LNB Arm .
To reduce the height of the dish , the mounting bracket was shortened .
The mast was cut off just below where it started to curve , about 11 " from the base .
Only the lower portion will be used .
Attach the lower portion of the mast to the mounting bracket .
Use Teflon washers or nylon washers to help make the mast and the dish glide against each other easily .
Attach the mounting bracket to the top of the Lazy Susan .
Procedure for assembling the power supply
You will need 12 volts of DC power to operate the Channel Master meter .
Eight AA will provide the power through a battery holder and 9 - volt connector .
RFID tags are useful for a huge variety of applications .
Some of these applications include : supply chain management , automated payment , physical access control , counterfeit prevention , airline baggage management , and smart homes and offices .
RFID tags are also implanted in all kinds of personal and consumer goods , for example , passports , partially assembled cars , frozen dinners , ski-lift passes , clothing , EZ - Pass toll collection devices , and public transportation tickets .
Implantable RFID tags for animals allow concerned owners to label their pets and livestock .
Verichip Corp. has also created a slightly adapted implantable RFID chip , the size of a grain of rice , for use in humans .
Since its introduction , the Verichip was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , and this tiny chip is currently deployed in both commercial and medical systems .
A great deal of information is available on RFID technology .
Some introductory Web pages are listed here .
Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) is the latest phase in the decades - old trend of the miniaturization of computers .
RFID transponders are tiny resource - limited computers that do not have a battery that needs periodic replacement .
RFID tags are inductively powered by their external reading devices , called RFID readers .
Once the RFID tag is activated , the tag decodes the incoming query and produces an appropriate response by using the energy of the incoming radio wave to power the chip long enough to respond .
RFID tags can do a limited amount of processing , and have a small amount ( < 1024 bits ) of storage .
