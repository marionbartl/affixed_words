Girl must spend EVERY night of her life in hospital after developing unique diabetic condition
Alice Halstead is only 18 years old , but will have to sleep in hospital for the rest of her life because a single night out could kill her .
While girls her age are going to university and discovering bars , Alice has never got drunk , gone clubbing , or stayed out late .
She treats each day as if it is her last due to her unique and unpredictable condition that has baffled doctors around the world .
Alice having a Plasma exchange in 2007 .
The teenager has spent two and a half years in hospital due to her unique diabetic condition .
Despite her illness she is determined to raise money for charity
Alice has an extreme form of diabetes , that if treated does not limit her life expectancy , but meand she has to be monitored around the clock .
The one in 6.7 billion condition causes the teenager 's blood sugar to vary wildly and she needs hourly treatment to stop her slipping into a diabetic coma .
Without a cure Alice has told she faces every night of her life in a hospital bed .
In a unique twist the vital insulin pumped into Alice to control the diabetes and save her life also makes her extremely poorly - reacting and causing potential deadly blood clots .
This Christmas will be her third in hospital and she has spent the last two and a half years there .
Alice has never had a boyfriend , never been to a pub and has only ever had once drink of alcohol - a glass of champagne on her 18th birthday , which had to be when she was supervised and surrounded by doctors .
' I do find myself thinking that in many respects I am very lucky '
At the age of 16 , she was a normal , healthy teenager with hardly a care in the world .
When she started feeling weak and lethargic blood tests revealed her unique condition .
Speaking from the hospital bed in Airedale Hospital in Keighley , West Yorks , she said : ' My condition is one of a kind .
Nobody knows if I will ever get out of hospital , I could spend the rest of my life here - it's a terrible thought .
' I spent 16 living a healthy , normal life and I never thought I would be in the situation I am in now or spend years in hospital .
' I was diagnosed with Type One diabetes on June 7 , in 2006 , but very quickly it became apparent this was n't an ordinary form of the condition .
' It 's been an absolute rollercoaster since I first went to my doctors and after taking tests I could see from his face something was n't right .
' I was told that it was very serious and rushed to the paediatrics ward .
I sat there in a daze , with my legs trembling trying to contemplate what the future held for me - I had no idea what it all meant and how it could change my life .
' I had central lines put into my heart - these are tubes that administer the insulin directly .
But my weak immune system meant infections kept coming back , and I have also been diagnosed with Endocarditis , a infection of the heart valve .
' I 've now had 22 central lines put in , and have three blood clots , which makes it very difficult to insert another one - which I need to give me my insulin intravenously .
' I am completely unique , no medical professionals have found anyone else like me . '
Alice Halstead has baffled doctors with her condition , which means she must spend every night in hospital
On the rare occasions Alice goes shopping , she has to be incredibly careful to avoid crowds of people who could knock over the pump she is constantly attached to .
She has been unable to take her GCSEs or A Levels and at the start of her diagnosis , none of the doctors knew what was wrong .
A series of blood tests were taken in March 2007 and her blood was sent around the world - results showed she was totally unique antibody levels in her body had rocketed .
Her insulin level was mindboggling high at 85,000 milligrams - a normal person 's insulin levels should be between 0 and 120 .
And the insulin she was being given to keep her alive was actually making the condition worse .
It was being bound to the antibodies , stored and then released later , causing her blood sugar to plummet .
An intravenous dextrose drip was also attached to her in the hope that it would maintain her blood sugar levels .
Various drugs were also pumped into her body in the hope that something would work and keep the dangerous antibodies away .
Eventually they began to slowly disappear but Alice 's condition stayed the same and she now has the immune system of a newborn baby .
Doctor Phillip Holland , who treats Alice at Leeds General Infirmary , said he had never seen a similar case .
He said : ' Alice 's condition is unique in the way that it binds a large quantity of insulin .
' Alice and her family have coped remarkably well with everything - I hope in part it is because we have always been open and honest with her .
She has taken a very pragmatic and sensible approach to it all .
' We are all hoping that the antibodies stay away and that Alice can one day live a normal life . '
Alice has used her time in hospital to raise awareness of others with the same condition .
She was granted a wish by the Rays of Sunshine charity and was taken to London in July 2009 to see the Lion King .
' You never know what 's going to happen however poorly or well you are , so I just enjoy each day like it 's my last '
She was so inspired by her experience and by meeting other ill children in hospital that she began to tirelessly raise money for the charity and has already collected £ 11,000 .
She said : ' Spending two years in hospital makes you realise that there is always someone worse off than yourself .
' I have met so many ill children and their families and sadly not all those children have survived .
' After my trip I wanted other children to be able to have a similar opportunity to me .
' Despite all the problems I have , I do find myself thinking that in many respects I am very lucky - mainly because of all the support I get .
' I do believe that being ill makes you a better person , you appreciate what you have in life and enjoy the simple things that mean so much to you as a individual .
' We do n't always have the opportunity to choose what happens in our lives but we do have the choice to make a difference to what really matters .
' It 's hoped that one day I might be able to lead a normal life , but you never know what 's going to happen however poorly or well you are , so I just enjoy each day like it 's my last . '

Giving away absolutely free of charge , with no lien , mortgage , or other encumbrance of any sort , the undisputed world - record holder in the " loudest vacuum cleaner on the face of the Earth " category !
Act now to take advantage of this truly unique opportunity !
" Wow " your friends with this incredible Hoover !
To accurately describe this fine piece of machinery , I will need to be rather wordy , so please bear withme on this matter .
Imagine you are on the runway at D / FW airport , right in front of one of the jet exhaust deflectors .
A Boeing 747-400 has just taxied on to the runway about 8 feet in front of you , and holds there , awaiting clearance for takeoff .
After a few short moments , clearance is given .
The pilot keeps the brakes firmly applied as the co-pilotgently places his hand on the throttles , then , in an instant , violently shoves all four of them forwardto maximum thrust ; right up against the stops .
The ensuing cacophony resulting from the dissonance between the screaming whine of the turbinesspinning at ten bazillion RPM and the 65,000 MPH blast of air and choking exhaust blasting you intothe cold , sooty metal of the deflector is utterly deafening .
Just as the pilot of the 747 releases the wheel brakes , and the silvery , tubular behemoth commences itstrip toward the other end of the runway and into the wild , blue yonder , air traffic control realizes theyhave made a deadly mistake ; they had previously cleared an Airbus A380 , the largest plane in theworld , to land on the same runway , in the opposite direction !
Frantically , they radio the two planes in avain attempt to prevent the impending disaster , but to no avail .
The planes meet nose - to - nose in a gutwrenching , mind - numbing collision .
Add that noise to the already earsplitting din that was beingemitted by the first plane .
While all of this is happening , the air traffic control supervisor has notified the airport 's fire departmentand they have rolled to the scene just as this tragedy takes place .
Their sirens are blaring as they pullup , only adding additional decibels to the already unbearable level of noise you are experiencing .
Youreardrums feel like red hot razor blades fired from a 12 gauge shotgun careening around inside yourcranium .
You honestly wish a 2 - ton piece of the shrapnel flying from the ruins could just catapult yourway and sever your head , putting you out of your misery once and for all .
It never happens ; you survivethis , the most miserable moment of your entire life , surrounded by carnage , the noise level absolutelyunbearable , with blood now flowing profusely from what used to be your ears .
Take the entire scene and insert it into the humungous wind tunnel at the Chrysler factory .
Run thewind tunnel up to about 350 MPH .
Take the noise you are now being subjected to , and triple it .
I 've had people tell me I 'm wrong , that this thing is much worse than I 've described , and I 'm beinggentle just to be able to unload it on some poor , disadvantaged housewife in an act of masochism , thinly veiled as generous , selfless philanthtopy .
I expect the competition for this beauty to be fierce , but if you want it , just email me and I 'll set it outon the curb for you .
If you need help finding the place after I give you the address , just let me know .
I 'llturn the lovely contraption on and you can follow the roar .
Do n't worry , it 'll drown out the highwaysounds from the semis , and the traffic choppers overhead and you 'll have no problem getting here , even if you 're just pulling out of your drivewayDo n't get me wrong , it does what it 's supposed to do ; it cleans the floor .
I 'm just tired of cleaning the blood from the walls that sprays out of my ears when I use this little gem .

We are the rich , the haves , the developed .
And most of the rest — in Africa , South Asia , and South America , the Somalias and Bolivias and Bangladeshes of the world — are the nots .
It 's always been this way , a globe divided by wealth and poverty , health and sickness , food and famine , though the extent of inequality across nations today is unprecedented :
The average citizen of the United States is ten times as prosperous as the average Guatemalan , more than twenty times as prosperous as the average North Korean , and more than forty times as prosperous as those living in Mali , Ethiopia , Congo , or Sierra Leone .
The question social scientists have unsuccessfully wrestled with for centuries is , Why ?
But the question they should have been asking is , How ?
Because inequality is not predetermined .
Nations are not like children — they are not born rich or poor .
Their governments make them that way .
You can chart the search for a theory of inequality to the French political philosopher Montesquieu , who in the mid-eighteenth century came up with a very simple explanation : People in hot places are inherently lazy .
Other no less sweeping explanations soon followed : Could it be that Max Weber 's Protestant work ethic is the true driver of economic success ?
Or perhaps the richest countries are those that were former British colonies ?
Or maybe it's as simple as tracing which nations have the largest populations of European descent ?
The problem with all of these theories is that while they superficially fit some specific cases , others radically disprove them .
It 's the same with the theories put forth today .
Economist Jeffrey Sachs , director of Columbia University 's Earth Institute , attributes the relative success of nations to geography and weather :
In the poorest parts of the world , he argues , nutrient - starved tropical soil makes agriculture a challenge , and tropical climates foment disease , particularly malaria .
Perhaps if we were to fix these problems , teach the citizens of these nations better farming techniques , eliminate malaria , or at the very least equip them with artemisinin to fight this deadly disease , we could eliminate poverty .
Or better yet , perhaps we just move these people and abandon their inhospitable land altogether .
Jared Diamond , the famous ecologist and best - selling author , has a different theory :
The origin of world inequality stems from the historical endowment of plant and animal species and the advancement of technology .
In Diamond 's telling , the cultures that first learned to plant crops were the first to learn how to use a plow , and thus were first to adopt other technologies , the engine of every successful economy .
Perhaps then the solution to world inequality rests in technology — wiring the developing world with Internet and cell phones .
And yet while Sachs and Diamond offer good insight into certain aspects of poverty , they share something in common with Montesquieu and others who followed :
They ignore incentives .
People need incentives to invest and prosper ; they need to know that if they work hard , they can make money and actually keep that money .
And the key to ensuring those incentives is sound institutions — the rule of law and security and a governing system that offers opportunities to achieve and innovate .
That 's what determines the haves from the have - nots — not geography or weather or technology or disease or ethnicity .
Put simply : Fix incentives and you will fix poverty .
And if you wish to fix institutions , you have to fix governments .
How do we know that institutions are so central to the wealth and poverty of nations ?
Start in Nogales , a city cut in half by the Mexican - American border fence .
There is no difference in geography between the two halves of Nogales .
The weather is the same .
The winds are the same , as are the soils .
The types of diseases prevalent in the area given its geography and climate are the same , as is the ethnic , cultural , and linguistic background of the residents .
By logic , both sides of the city should be identical economically .
And yet they are far from the same .
On one side of the border fence , in Santa Cruz County , Arizona , the median household income is $ 30,000 .
A few feet away , it 's $ 10,000 .
On one side , most of the teenagers are in public high school , and the majority of the adults are high school graduates .
On the other side , few of the residents have gone to high school , let alone college .
Those in Arizona enjoy relatively good health and Medicare for those over sixty - five , not to mention an efficient road network , electricity , telephone service , and a dependable sewage and public - health system .
None of those things are a given across the border .
There , the roads are bad , the infant - mortality rate high , electricity and phone service expensive and spotty .
The key difference is that those on the north side of the border enjoy law and order and dependable government services — they can go about their daily activities and jobs without fear for their life or safety or property rights .
On the other side , the inhabitants have institutions that perpetuate crime , graft , and insecurity .
Nogales may be the most obvious example , but it 's far from the only one .
Take Singapore , a once - impoverished tropical island that became the richest nation in Asia after British colonialists enshrined property rights and encouraged trade .
Or China , where decades of stagnation and famine were reversed only after Deng Xiaoping began introducing private - property rights in agriculture , and later in industry .
Or Botswana , whose economy has flourished over the past forty years while the rest of Africa has withered , thanks to strong tribal institutions and farsighted nation building by its early elected leaders .
Now look at the economic and political failures .
You can begin in Sierra Leone , where a lack of functioning institutions and an overabundance of diamonds have fueled decades of civil war and strife and corruption that continue unchecked today .
Or take communist North Korea , a geographical , ethnic , and cultural mirror of its capitalist neighbor to the south , yet ten times poorer .
Or Egypt , cradle of one of the world 's great civilizations yet stagnant economically ever since its colonization by the Ottomans and then the Europeans , only made worse by its post - independence governments , which have restricted all economic activities and markets .
In fact , the theory can be used to shed light on the patterns of inequality for much of the world .
If we know why nations are poor , the resulting question is what can we do to help them .
Our ability to impose institutions from the outside is limited , as the recent U. S. experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq demonstrate .
But we are not helpless , and in many instances , there is a lot to be done .
Even the most repressed citizens of the world will stand up to tyrants when given the opportunity .
We saw this recently in Iran and a few years ago in Ukraine during the Orange Revolution .
The U. S. must not take a passive role in encouraging these types of movements .
Our foreign policy should encourage them by punishing repressive regimes through trade embargoes and diplomacy .
The days of supporting dictators because they bolster America 's short - term foreign - policy goals , like our implicit support of Muhammad Zia-ul - Haq in Pakistan starting in the 1970s , and our illicit deals with Mobutu 's kleptocratic regime in the Congo from 1965 to 1997 , must end .
Because the long - term consequences — entire nations of impoverished citizens , malnourished and hungry children , restive , discontented youngsters ripe to be drawn toward terrorism — are too costly .
Today that means pushing countries such as Pakistan , Georgia , Saudi Arabia , Nigeria , and countless others in Africa toward greater transparency , more openness , and greater democracy , regardless of whether they are our short - term allies in the war on terror .
At the microlevel , we can help foreign citizens by educating them and arming them with the modern tools of activism , most notably the Internet , and perhaps even encryption technology and cell - phone platforms that can evade firewalls and censorship put in place by repressive governments , such as those in China or Iran , that fear the power of information .
There 's no doubt that erasing global inequality , which has been with us for millennia and has expanded to unprecedented levels over the past century and a half , wo n't be easy .
But by accepting the role of failed governments and institutions in causing poverty , we have a fighting chance of reversing it .

Raul Castro became Cuba 's leader early last year
Cuba is continuing to violate human rights and is using draconian laws to repress its citizens , according to a new Human Rights Watch report .
The communist country 's shift from Fidel Castro 's leadership to president Raul Castro has not changed conditions according to the report .
The group said that since taking office , Raul Castro had kept abusive laws firmly in place .
It is the first far - ranging report since Raul Castro took over .
The report says political and religious activists live in constant fear , and that persistent aggression is placed against dissidents .
Raul Castro has relied in particular on a Cuban law that lets the state imprison people even before they commit a crime , Human Rights Watch said .
" Despite significant obstacles to research , Human Rights Watch documented more than 40 cases in which Cuba has imprisoned individuals for ' dangerousness ' under Raul Castro because they tried to exercise their fundamental rights , " the report said .
" Rather than dismantle the repressive machinery , Raul Castro has kept it firmly in place and fully active . "
The report was secretly researched on unauthorised visits to the Caribbean island and by getting data from interviews with roughly 60 people .
The assessment comes at a crucial moment , as US President Barack Obama wants to re-set ties with Cuba .
The US Congress is also considering lifting a ban on travel to the communist - run island .
" I am a single father and it's a struggle but I have this gifted child .
There is no funding but I want to give him the best teachers and they are not cheap .
I also want to take him into a studio to record . "
Though there are no verified details as of now , retail listings have been leaked online for two Nintendo games : a sequel to Hotel Dusk and Dynamic Zan , both set for release Q1 2010 in Japan .
According to the Sinobi blog , Last Window : Mayonaka no Yakusoku ( Last Window : Midnight Promise ) is the follow - up to CING ’s DS adventure game Hotel Dusk : Room 215 .
Hotel Dusk followed a former police officer who wanted to solve the mystery behind a Los Angeles hotel during the late 70s .
According to Sinobi the sequel will be released January 14 on the DS .
No gameplay details have surfaced .
Zangeki no Regenleiv is a Wii title that fell off the radar after it was revealed just over a year ago as Dynamic Zan .
It ’s backed by developer Sandlot and will include online play for up to four players when it drops February 11th in Japan .

Advertisement Israel 's navy has intercepted a ship carrying hundreds of tonnes of Iranian weapons intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon , the Israeli military has said .
The Antiguan - flagged vessel , Francop , was boarded 160 km ( 100 miles ) off the Israeli coast , the military said , and has been towed to the port of Ashdod .
PM Benjamin Netanyahu said the arms were intended to strike Israeli cities .
In recent months Israel has stepped up efforts to combat the smuggling of arms to both Hezbollah and Hamas militants .
Hezbollah has not yet commented on the latest incident .
Iran and Syria have both rejected Israel 's allegations .
' Disguised cargo '
The Israeli military said marines had boarded the 137 m ( 450 ft ) Francop after its captain agreed to the search and no force was used .
Weapons haul reveals fragile calm
In pictures : Seized arms ship
The vessel was intercepted " near Cyprus " , the Israeli military said , though it gave no further details on where this took place .
The country 's deputy defence minister , Matan Vilnai , said the ship 's crew were not thought to have been aware of the smuggling operation .
A spokesperson for the military said there were " dozens of shipping containers , carrying numerous weapons , disguised as civilian cargo among hundreds of other containers on board " .
The spokesperson added : " The weapons originate from Iran and were intended to reach the Hezbollah terror organisation for use against the state of Israel and its citizens . "
The Associated Press news agency reported the vessel was operated by Cyprus - based shipping company United Feeder Services and the company had said the cargo was picked up in Damietta in Egypt .
ANALYSIS Paul Wood , BBC News , Jerusalem
The seizure of the Francop is being celebrated by Israeli generals and politicians as a major success .
The vessel , says the military , was carrying enough weapons to supply Hezbollah for a month or more of ground fighting .
The seizure comes after Israel carried out a joint military exercise with the Americans .
The unspoken assumption of that exercise - for many in Israel at least - is that Israel will one day carry out military strikes against Iran 's nuclear programme .
Tehran will then hit back itself and also activate Hamas and Hezbollah .
Even if that sequence does not take place , Israeli military intelligence believes the " northern front " is the most likely place for the next fight .
Syria denies weapons were on board - accusing Israel of an act of piracy - but the seizure is another sign of how impermanent is the peace in this part of the world ; how all sides are looking ahead to , and preparing for , the next round of hostilities .
The exact route of the ship has not been confirmed but Israel 's Haaretz newspaper said it originated in Iran and had docked in Yemen and Sudan before using the Suez Canal .
A United Feeder Services source told news agencies the ship was scheduled to dock in Lebanon .
The Israeli military said an Iranian document had been found on the ship .
A military spokesperson said : " All the cargo certificates are stamped at the ports of origin and this one was stamped at an Iranian port . "
However , in a news conference in Tehran broadcast on Iran 's state - run Press TV , visiting Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said the ship was not carrying Iranian - made weapons and that the cargo comprised Syrian exports to Iran .
Mr Netanyahu congratulated the army , navy and security forces on a successful action to prevent the supply of weapons .
Since Israel 's offensive in Gaza last December and January , the Israeli navy and air force have been conducting intense searches in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea for ships smuggling weapons either to Hezbollah or to Hamas in Gaza .
In February Israel said a vessel detained off Cyprus was carrying Iranian weapons to Hamas in Gaza .
Iran denied the claim .
In 2002 the Israeli navy captured the Karin - A , which was carrying some 50 tonnes of arms thought to be destined for Gaza .

Saving God is a rich and provocative book .
It aims to " save God " from idolatrous believers , who take God to be largely concerned with the welfare and destiny of human creatures .
Banning idolatry , Johnston is led to a panentheistic conception of " the Highest One , " who ( or which ) is not separable from Nature .
With echoes of Spinoza and , to a lesser extent , Whitehead , Johnston takes Supernaturalism to be spiritually irrelevant , as well as idolatrous . [ 1 ]
Idolatry is a very broad category for Johnston .
It includes supernaturalism as well as superstition ( p. 40 ) , worship of false gods and graven images ( p. 19 , p. 21 ) , perverse worship and projection of our own desires onto the object of worship ( p. 20 ) , servility to another 's will ( p. 24 ) , " anthropomorphic accretions of this or that historic faith " onto the Highest One ( p. 99 ) , " hope for a Cosmic Intervener who might confer special worldly advantages on his favorites , " ( p.158 ) and more .
Neither a work of philosophy nor of academic theology , Saving God is " offered as the expression of a certain sensibility " ( xi ) .
The sensibility is one of a confirmed naturalist ( the natural world as " causally complete and self - contained " [ p. 48 ] ) who has serious religious impulses .
The natural world is all that there is , but understood properly , it can be seen as " the site of the sacred " ( p. 187 ) .
The path to this conclusion is fascinating .
I 'll summarize it in the following paragraphs .
' God ' is seen to be a descriptive name that abbreviates ' the Highest One . ' " [ I ] f there is a Highest One , " Johnston claims , " it deserves our fealty , not arbitrarily , but because of its perfections " ( p. 95 ) .
Is the object of worship of any of the three monotheisms the Highest One ?
Well , perhaps not .
Judaism , Christianity , and Islam are all idolatrous insofar as they attempt " to evade or ignore the demanding core of true religion : radical self - abandonment to the Divine as manifested in the turn toward others and toward objective reality " ( p. 24 ) .
They are idolatrous insofar as they invoke another hidden world and promise an afterlife in that world , as a way of redirecting people 's aspirations in the " all too this - worldly interests of the religion " ( p. 24 ) .
Using a " phenomenological " method , Saving God aims to investigate what the Highest One would be like if it existed .
For a religious experience to be an experience of the Highest One , " the beneficiary of a revelation must see or hear the events as the Highest One manifesting himself .
That content must be internal to the experience and not just to the subsequent beliefs that it prompts " ( p. 68 ) .
This requires some antecedent concept of what would and would not count as the Highest One .
( You could not see a table as a snooker table unless you have some idea of what a snooker table is . )
Then , bracketing the question of the existence of the Highest One , we can ask : if this foundational revelatory experience were veridical , would it be a revelation of the Highest One ?
Does it " display the character of the Highest One ? " ( pp. 34 -5 ; 36 )
With a myriad of examples from the three monotheisms , Johnston gives a negative answer .
These religions " degrade their putative experience of Divinity by entirely wedding it to the passing and adventitious world views of their founding fathers " ( p. 39 ) .
But the real problem is that the monotheisms ' conception of " God as essentially a supernatural being " is already idolatrous ( p. 39 ) .
Johnston characterizes supernaturalism as " belief in invisible spiritual agencies whose putative interventions would violate the laws of nature , at least as those laws are presently understood " ( p. 40 ) .
He associates supernaturalism with the " spiritual materialism " of consumerists who take up a hobby of self - improvement , without any fundamental change in their lives ( p. 14 ; p. 40 ) .
So , we should eschew supernaturalism for " legitimate naturalism , " which " arises out of proper respect for the methods and achievements of science " ( p. 43 ) .
Legitimate naturalism is not scientism .
Scientism is the view that only the natural realm exists , whereas
[ l] egitimate naturalism is the view that the domain of the natural sciences is complete on its own terms : every causal transaction ultimately consists in some utter natural process , for example , mass - energy transfer .
There are no gods of the gaps .
( p. 127 )
Indeed , those who espouse " true religion " should hope that the ontological naturalism thesis is true , " [ f ] or ontological naturalism would be a complete defense against the supernatural powers and principalities that could otherwise exploit our tendency to servile idolatry and spiritual materialism " ( p. 51 ) .
We would be insulated from servitude to any supernatural beings .
From this naturalistic viewpoint , we can get to a kind of " substantive reasonableness " that allows us to appreciate the force of reasons that goes beyond the force of pure logic or decision theory ( p. 80 ) .
We can think of God ethically as " Logos gradually disclosing the requirements of substantive reasonableness . "
But then why do we need to invoke God at all ?
Well , we are fallen creatures .
Original sin comes with being human : we " are by our natures caught in an oscillation between self - will and false righteousness " ( p. 88 ) .
( Johnston gives a fascinating naturalistic account of the Fall [ pp. 82 - 8 ] . )
We are curved in on ourselves , as Luther said and Kant agreed , by our self - love .
We cannot achieve a truly ethical life by our own efforts .
The life of ordinary virtue is not " the truly ethical life , " in which you regard all other people as on a par with yourself and treat their interests as on a par with yours ( p. 90 ) .
The only thing that can set us right is to be seized by " grace " ( p. 81 ) .
" Are not the sources of redemptive katalepsis , or grace , " Johnston asks , " many and various ? " ( pp. 93 -4 ) And if the various forms of grace have a common source in the Highest One , then " the Highest One is more than the monotheisms have allowed " ( p. 82 ) .
So , how are we to understand the Highest One ?
In the first place , the Highest One has all perfections ( but we may not know what those perfections are ) .
In the second place , the Highest One could not have created anything distinct from itself .
If it had , then the perfections of the Highest One would be reflected in the separate creation .
In that case , the " joint reality made up of the Highest One and the separate creation " would be a more appropriate object of worship than the Highest One alone .
But only the Highest One deserves worship .
So there is no separate creation .
Creatures are only manifestations of the Highest One. Johnston explains , " [ w ] hat is called creation is some part or aspect or principle or mode of the Highest One .
That is why a worshipful attitude to the whole of reality is not idolatrous " ( p. 95 ) .
According to Johnston , Aquinas took God to be Existence Itself -- something like a Platonic Form ( p. 99 ) .
God is the source of all reality and cannot be ontologically dependent on anything else .
This view , coupled with Aquinas 's idea that a composite thing is dependent on its components , leads to what Johnston calls ' the identity theory of God 's nature . '
God cannot have attributes like Goodness , Justice , etc. ;
God must be his properties .
God is identical to his attributes , which are identical to each other .
So , God is a single attribute -- not part of monotheism at all ( p. 103 ) .
Moreover , the identity theory of God 's nature is at odds with Aquinas 's account of analogical predication .
And if divine predication is equivocal , we get a paradox of the Highest One :
Any differentiated knowledge of the Highest One 's nature will imply that this nature is complex , so that the Highest One is not a se , and so not the First in the order of being , and so is not , in fact , the Highest One .
The way out of this paradox is to note that " [ n] ot every whole made up of distinct parts is ontologically subordinate to those parts .
For the parts may themselves essentially depend on the whole they make up " ( p. 110 ) .
So God , the First Being , can be complex .
If complexity can enter into the nature of the Highest One , we can compare two alternative identifications , the Thomistic one and the panentheistic one :
The Highest One = Existence Itself
The Highest One = the outpouring of Existence Itself by way of its exemplification in ordinary existents
On the Thomistic identification , according to which the Highest One is Being , " the analogical basis for describing Existence Itself as Love does not lie in the essential nature of the Highest One . "
But on the panentheistic identification , the Highest One is not Being ( nor is it an ordinary existent ) ; it is a kind of activity that could be analogically described as Loving .
On this second identification , the Highest One is " Being 's Self - Giving " ( p. 113 ) .
Johnston argues that the panentheistic identification , combined with a view of analogical predication , can skirt problems that afflict traditional theism , such as the problem of unnecessary evil .
The problem of unnecessary evil " arises only with a conception of Divine Goodness that expresses the idolatrous longing for a useful god , one who will favor us with something other than his own self - revelation " ( p. 115 ) .
This suggests another way that Johnston distinguishes his view from classical theism ( p. 157 ) .
The three monotheisms would say something like this :
" The outpouring of Being by way of its exemplification in ordinary existents is for the sake of self - disclosure of Being to us . "
Johnston 's panentheist would say this instead :
" The outpouring of Being by way of its exemplification in ordinary existents is for the sake of self - disclosure of Being . "
Full - stop .
Here , I think , we see Johnston 's idea of the root of idolatry : we are so self - centered that we suppose that the Highest One is focused on us .
Johnston , citing Heidegger , takes the natural realm to be Being - making - itself - present .
Presence is disclosure , regarded as a kind of truth ( p. 129 ) .
He emphasizes that we are not Producers of Presence , but Samplers of Presence .
" Being is by its nature present ; Being 's fundamental activity is self - disclosure , " he writes ( p. 132 ) .
All possible modes of presentation are objectively there in the world , and we have evolved to access some of them .
The idea that we are Samplers of Presence -- and hence that our mental states , constituted by brain states , can be about things that exist independently of those states -- has been obscured by representational theories of mind .
I think that Johnston does a wonderful job of motivating and describing an alternative to representationalism ( pp. 129-151 ) .
In keeping with the unusual genre of Saving God , I 'll spend the remainder of this review simply saying how some of Johnston 's views strike me .
(1) Johnston distinguishes his process panentheism from pantheism that identifies God and nature .
In contrast to the pantheist ,
the panentheist will assert that God is partly constituted by the natural realm , in the sense that his activity is manifest in and through natural processes alone .
But his reality goes beyond what is captured by the purely scientific description of all the events that make up the natural realm .
( p. 119 )
However , since pantheism and panentheism " share the same ontology , " I wonder how the reality of God can go beyond the purely scientific description of all the events that make up the natural realm ( p. 126 ) .
I see how descriptions ( analogical , of course ) of God can go beyond scientific descriptions , but I do not see how panentheism can allow any reality to go beyond what can be disclosed by science .
This worry is acute with respect to the ontological status of Presence and all the objective modes of presentation .
(2) Sometimes , Johnston says , " God is partly constituted by the natural realm " ; later , Johnston says that " God is wholly constituted by the natural realm " ( p. 127 ) .
In any case , what does it mean to say that the natural realm constitutes God ( partly or wholly ) ?
Two worries come to mind : ( i ) If ' Nature ' and ' God ' are just two ways of designating the same thing , Reality , then Nature and God are identical and pantheism is true .
( ii ) Although Johnston insists on the nonidentity of Nature and God ( God is " distinct " from what constitutes God ) , the natural world is causally closed under natural law ; thus , it is difficult to see how God is anything at all -- except perhaps an epiphenomenon .
(3) Although I am no theologian , I have doubts about some of Johnston 's descriptions of Christian theology -- e.g. , that Aquinas conceived of God as a ( nonpersonal ) Platonic Form , Existence Itself , or that Christians think of an afterlife as a reward for a virtuous life in this world .
( Johnston says : " Belief in the afterlife as a reward for faithfulness is either an idolatrous conceit or evidence of a failure to assimilate the radical nature of Christ 's new dispensation " [ p. 183 ] .
Of course , Christians do not take an afterlife to be a reward for faithfulness . )
(4) It seems to me that the doctrine of analogy is stretched beyond its limits when Johnston says : The Love of the Highest One
is analogized as its outpouring in ordinary existents , its Will as self - disclosure , its Mind as the most revealing presentations found in the realm of sense , and its Power as the totality of the laws of nature .
In these respects , the Highest One has by analogy the characteristics of a person , but a person far removed from ordinary personality .
( p. 158 )
This seems to me like saying , " The National Football League has by analogy the characteristics of a penguin , but a penguin far removed from ordinary penguinity . "
(5) Johnston says illuminatingly : " What is really bad , what could render one 's life shameful or even not worth living , occurs when that conception of the good is shallow or perverted or confused . "
Fine , but then he continues : " If God takes hold of us , then we will be safe from this .
If he does not , then one 's conception of the good will remain unredeemed " ( p. 179 ) .
How does it make even analogical sense to say of a panentheistic God , who has no independent causal powers , that he " takes hold of us " ?
(6) What Johnston calls ' legitimate naturalism ' is that " the domain of the natural sciences is complete on its own terms " ( p. 127 ) .
It is simply the naturalism that expresses " proper respect for the methods and achievements of science " ( p. 43 , p. 127 ) .
These characterizations are far from equivalent : a classical theist could agree with everything that Johnston says about the methods and achievements of science , without agreeing that the domain of the natural sciences is " complete on its own terms " ( however that is interpreted ) .
(7) Johnston says that the Highest One , to be of salvific interest , must be a unity that embraces the diversity of polytheism ( p. 94 ) .
But he gives no reason to think this .
Classical theists can agree with him that Kant 's idea of moral law cannot save us ; in trying to follow it , we are still mired in our self - deceiving self - wills .
Nevertheless all that follows is that we can't become less turned in on ourselves by our own efforts -- but , of course , that 's what Christianity holds .
(8) " The choice between classical theism and panentheism , " Johnston says ,
is if you like a choice between a first principle and the expressive activity of that first principle .
The latter is the more inclusive object of worship , for it includes not only the serene perfections of Existence Itself , but the perfections inherent in its universal act of outpouring and self - disclosure .
In that sense , panentheism appears to provide a more suitable theological description of the Highest One. ( p. 120 )
I wonder .
As a matter of logic , it seems that the first principle is a precondition for its ( its ) expressive activity .
Its expressive activity can't be superior to what has the expressive activity .
And I do n't see why either a first principle or its expressive activity should be ( or could be ) an object of worship .
(9 ) Johnston suggests that the structure of presence may impose evolutionary constraints .
He mentions " the antecedent structure of the limited variety of modes of presentation that can in principle be accessed by the variety of neural systems that might get going in that environment " ( p. 153 ) .
But how can there be an antecedent structure of modes of presentation ?
The modes of presentation which show me that you are overjoyed , or are grief - stricken , or are embarrassed or jealous could not have existed before there were beings who are overjoyed , or grief - stricken or embarrassed or jealous .
There could not be an " antecedent structure of the limited variety of modes of presentation that can in principle be accessed by the variety of neural systems that might get going " in the environment , for this reason : however objective the modes of presentation are , they themselves are ontologically dependent on the existents that present them .
( 10 ) Johnston says , rightly in my opinion , that there is no soul [ or self ] existing separately from our brains and bodies ( p. 184 ) .
But it does not follow that our personal identity over time " is actually secured by certain patterns of personal identification with what then become our future selves " ( p. 184 ) .
Is your taking some future ( imagined ) person to be yourself the same as her being yourself ?
Being yourself over time can be secured by the continued exemplification of your first - person perspective .
You do not need a separately existing soul or self .
Despite these worries and disagreements , I found Saving God to be original , complex and insightful .
( See , for example , Johnston 's well - founded hostility to " ready - to - wear righteousness " [ p. 172 ] . )
However one reacts to Johnston 's naturalistic reinterpretation of Christianity and the other monotheisms , one may still applaud his rejection of idolatrous uses of religion to serve human ends .

According to human rights lawyer John Sifton , the CIA tortured some of its detainees in the War on Terror so severely that it had to take measures to keep them alive so they could continue being tortured .
Sifton , who is the executive director of One World Research , told an interviewer for Russia Today that there was both a CIA detention program and a military detention program and that “ The CIA program was by far the most secretive . …
That ’s the one that only had a few dozen detainees at any given time — but it ’s the one that saw the biggest abuses , the most serious forms of torture . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ In the military , there was actually a larger number of deaths than with the CIA , ” Sifton continued .
“ The CIA engaged in some horrendous abuses , but they appear to have taken precautions to have actually prevented people from dying — which might sound humanitarian , but in fact was kind of sickening . ”
“ The military was n’t so careful , ” Sifton added .
“ The military subjected a lot of people to the same techniques , but without the precautions , and as a result a large number of detainees in military custody died . …
While they did n’t use the worst forms of torture , like waterboarding , they often used sleep deprivation , forced standing , stress positions . …
When you combine these techniques … they cause excruciating pain … and the military used them on thousands and thousands of detainees . ”
Sifton commented that what he found most shocking was “ the cold , clinical fashion in which they went about designing the program .
They did n’t want to commit outright physical torture … so they went to psychologists and lawyers and they tried to design a program which was , in their minds , legal . …
They tried to make it legal and safe , but they just made it even more grotesque . ”
Claims of detainee deaths under torture have been public knowledge for some time , although perhaps not amounting to “ a large number ” as alleged by Sifton .
Last month , however , the Washington Independent reported that in the last few years the military has simply stopped reporting detainee deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq altogether , even those from natural causes .
According to the Independent , “ Human Rights First ’s report , Command ’s Responsibility , based on its study of autopsy reports and interviews with military personnel , witnesses and physicians , found that between August 2002 and February 2006 nearly 100 detainees had died ‘ while in the hands of U.S. officials in the global ‘ war on terror . ’
Although the military had deemed 34 of those deaths suspected or confirmed homicides , Human Rights First counted a total of 45 cases where the facts suggested ‘ death as a result of physical abuse or harsh conditions of detention . ’
What ’s more , in almost half the cases surveyed , ‘ the cause of death remains officially undetermined or unannounced . ’
Overall , the group found , by the beginning of 2006 , ‘ eight people in U.S. custody were tortured to death . ’”

There are also documented allegations of CIA involvement in detainee deaths , though it is unclear whether any of those deaths occurred within the CIA ’s own system of secret prisons , as Sifton charges .
Last year , when Scott Horton interviewed Jane Mayer , author of The Dark Side , about the CIA program , he asked , “ One of the lingering mysteries in Washington has been what happened to the CIA internal probe into homicides involving the program .
You note that CIA Inspector General ( IG ) John Helgerson undertook a study and initially concluded , just as the Red Cross and most legal authorities in the United States and around the world , that the program was illegal and raised serious war crimes issues .
Helgerson was summoned repeatedly to meet privately with Vice President Cheney , the man who provided the impetus for the program , and it appears as a result of these meetings the IG ’s report was simply shut down . ”
“ Helgerson ’s 2004 report had been described to me as very disturbing , ” Mayer replied , “ the size of two Manhattan phone books , and full of terrible descriptions of mistreatment . …
We know that in addition , the IG investigated several alleged homicides involving CIA detainees , and that Helgerson ’s office forwarded several to the Justice Department for further consideration and potential prosecution . …
Why have there been no charges filed ?
It ’s a question to which one would expect that Congress and the public would like some answers . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
More recently , however , the McClatchy Newspapers ran a story titled “ Assessing CIA culpability in detainee deaths will be tricky . ”
The story indicated that “ there are at least five known cases in which agency personnel potentially were implicated in the deaths of detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan , according to a 2005 letter from Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , to the CIA , ” but also indicated that “ those deaths took place under wartime conditions , not in the CIA ’s once - secret program for interrogating top al Qaida suspects by using techniques such as waterboarding , or simulated drowning . ”
According to Sifton , “ Our information is that the Obama administration essentially put the CIA out of business with respect to detaining people .
They no longer have their own secret prison program . ”
In January of this year , as one of his first acts as president , Barack Obama ordered the CIA ’s detention centers shut down , and this past summer , Attorney General Eric Holder announced the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate abuses in the CIA detention program .
ADVERTISEMENT
Because nobody has been held accountable , however , and much of what went on is still being concealed , Sifton is concerned that it “ causes a moral culpability issue worldwide .
President Obama may have closed the prisons and ended the programs , but … it creates a stain that has yet to be cleansed . ”

They have been battered by vandals and defaced by graffiti taggers .
They have secured diamonds , handmade tortellini and other valuable commodities .
They have provided the clattering soundtrack of dawn and dusk , the steel canvas of struggling artists , the most compelling evidence that the city does , indeed , sleep .
And now , on orders of the City Council , roll - down gates have joined the ranks of fatty foods and cigarette smoke : they have been legislated against , some right into extinction .
The Council voted on Monday to ban the kind of security gates that completely shield commercial storefront windows and doors from view  ones that resemble old - fashioned auto garage doors , with narrow horizontal slats that rise up like a steely sort of curtain  while permitting the kinds of gates common in suburban shopping malls that allow passers - by to see inside .
Along Court Street in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn , a gentrifying commercial and residential strip in what remains an Italian stronghold , the gradual ban on solid gates  there are probably tens of thousands of them  was as well - received as a property tax hike .

As part of a general migration from darcs to git as my default SCM system ( a migration whose reasons include magit being so much better than darcsum ) , i’ve been tidying up a bit my emacs configuration files and factoring out a small set of libraries that people may find useful .
The new git repository , clonable from http://git.hacks-galore.org/jao/emacs.git and browsable online here , contains a subdirectory called lib with the code i’ve factored out so far :
emms contains add - ons for the Emacs multimedia system , including OSD notifications , lyrics retrieval and a play - random - album facility .
net is a handbag of networkish utilites : mailbox query and display , emacs - w3 m sessions and a weather info fetcher .
themes is my own color theme engine , implemented on top of the custom - themes package included in Emacs 23 .
Defining new color themes is , i think , short and sweet .
skels contains a collection of skeletons and related utilities that i use to insert templates in new files .
sys is a set of system utilities , most of them from my times as a Mac aficionado and , therefore , probably bit -rotten .
Except for jao - osd , which gives you ( very rudimentary ) access to aosd notifications within emacs .
org contains an assortment of extensions for org-mode .
tracker is actually a C program that i use to query the tracker daemon that indexes all my documents .
The actual queries are performed and displayed in emacs by an Anything extension of mine that i have n’t yet extracted from my configuration as a separate library , and that can be found there .
bmk is a ( web ) bookmark manager that i do n’t use anymore ( all my bookmarks are kept in org files these days ) .
There ’s also a directory called external with other emacs packages that i use unmodified .
As i said , the idea is that the libraries above should be usable independently of my specific configuration bits , which are contained in the custom folder .
The files in that folder will give you additional hints on how to customize the libraries .
With very few exceptions , all these packages are anything but well - documented , but perhaps you ’ll find some bits useful .
A long delayed project of mine is to use this blog to go through all of them in a series of posts that we could call TEOS , The Emacs Operating System .
They would be not only about how the individual libraries work together , but , most importantly , about how they integrate with each other and with other stock Emacs packages to provide an operating environment that , in my humble opinion , surpasses any other commonly used operating system in terms of productivity and extensibility .
An Elisp Machine where you are in control and have all the fun .
I ’ve been playing with the idea of joining PragProWriMo and make this part of a book writing project that would explore in detail TEOS , with intermediate Emacs users in mind .
If i finally go for it , you may consider this post as the first in the series , but i have n’t made up my mind yet .
Be it as it may , i hope you ’ll find some elisp snippets above worth stealing for your own Emacs Operation System .

Bill O'Reilly is mad at me because I 'm not mad enough about taxes .
Last week on " The O'Reilly Factor " , we talked about California 's and New York 's enormous budget deficits and planned tax increases .
Those states would have big surpluses had they just grown their governments in pace with inflation .
But of course they did n't .
Now the politicians act like their current deficits are something imposed on them by the recession .
But that 's nonsense .
They created the problem with their reckless spending .
Let 's look at the particulars .
Had the government of New York state grown at the rate of population and inflation over the past 10 years , it would have a $ 14 billion surplus today .
Instead , spending grew at twice the rate of inflation .
So New York has a $ 3 billion deficit .
To dent California 's deficit , bureaucrats will withhold an extra 10 percent from every taxpayer -- at least from those who do n't flee the state .
New York planned to raise the price of new license plates , but then backed off .
The visible tax was unpopular .
But the hidden taxes grow .
Hidden taxes are more pernicious because they disguise what we pay for government .
We blame merchants , not our legislators , for the high price of gasoline , liquor , cigarettes and phone calls , but the money goes to the political thieves .
New York imposes a gas tax of 61 cents a gallon -- almost a quarter of the cost of the gas .
New York City taxes cigarettes at $ 4.25 a pack .
Washington state collects $ 26 per gallon of hard liquor .
Illinois politicians take a sneaky cut when you buy junk food :
They add 6.25 percent to the cost of soda and candy .
My phone bill lists seven different taxes -- unintelligible stuff like a " Public Safety Commission Surcharge " and an " MCTD tax . "
The payroll tax is one of the biggest hidden taxes .
You assume that you know what you pay because it 's listed on your paycheck , but that 's actually only half of it .
Employers must pay an equal amount -- money that otherwise would have been part your salary .
O'Reilly was most indignant about the visible taxes .
" You , Stossel , are going to be paying 45 percent of your money to the government ! " he said .
I replied that I already pay more than that , since I live in New York City .
But I apparently was not indignant enough , because later in his show he told comedian Dennis Miller , " Stossel does n't get it . "
O'Reilly is right about my not being furious .
It 's not that taxes do n't anger me .
They do .
But I 'm more angry about the arrogance of the ruling class .
It reminds me of Walter Williams ' riff : " Politicians are worse than thieves .
At least when thieves take your money , they do n't expect you to thank them for it . "
Taxes , even counting hidden taxes , are not the real measure of what the thieves take .
The true burden of government , the late Milton Friedman said , is the spending level .
Taxation is just one way government gets money .
The other ways -- borrowing and inflation -- are equally burdens on the people .
( State governments can't inflate , but they sure can borrow . )
O'Reilly told me that America is ready for a tax revolt .
I hope he 's right .
But I do n't think it will happen until more people see the ruling elite for what it is : a gang of arrogant bullies that has the audacity to believe that they know how to direct our lives better than we do .
That 's why , bad as the taxes are , I 'm more upset about ObamaCare , Medicare , the " stimulus , " the auto bailout , the bank bailouts , the Fannie / Freddie bailouts , the trillions in guarantees , and on and on .
The politicians ' spending schemes represent presumptuous interference in our lives .
They are an assault on our autonomy .

On the Evolution of a True Democracy Founded on True Knowledge of Reality : Globalisation as the Interconnected Ecology of Political States and Reality .
.. by nature man is a political animal .
Hence men have a desire for life together , even when they have no need to seek each other ’s help .
Nevertheless , common interest too is a factor in bringing them together , in so far as it contributes to the good life of each .
The good life is indeed their chief end , both communally and individually ; but they form and continue to maintain a political association for the sake of life itself .
Perhaps we may say that there is an element of good even in mere living , provided that life is not excessively beset with troubles .
Certainly most men , in their desire to keep alive , are prepared to face a great deal of suffering , as if finding in life itself a certain well - being and a natural sweetness .
( Aristotle , Politics )
Mankind has tried the other two roads to peace - the road of political jealousy and the road of religious bigotry - and found them both equally misleading .
Perhaps it will now try the third , the road of scientific truth , the only road on which the passenger is not deceived .
Science does not , ostrich - like , bury its head amidst perils and difficulties .
It tries to see everything exactly as everything is .
( Professor Garrett P. Serviss ) .
Introduction to Politics
Politics is derived from the Greek words ' Polis ' which means community and ' Poli ' meaning many .
Politics can be defined as the laws , methods and practices of group which makes decisions ( i.e. a government over a community ) .
The past two thousand years have confirmed the philosopher Aristotles ' famous assertion that ' Man is a political animal ' .
According to Aristotle , an important constituent of happiness is friendship , the bond between the individual and the social aggregation , between man and the State .
Man is essentially , or by nature , a social animal , that is to say , he cannot attain complete happiness except in social and political dependence on his fellow man .
This is the starting point of political science and political philosophy .
That the State is not absolute , as Plato taught , that there is no ideal State , but that our knowledge of political organization is to be acquired by studying and comparing different constitutions of States , that the best form of government is that which best suits the character of the people .
These are some of the most characteristic of Aristotle 's political doctrines .
( Catholic Encyclopedia , 1911 )
History has also confirmed that political systems have a tendency towards dictatorship and self interest , and these human instincts must be tempered with the truth , as Plato wrote ;
The society we have described can never grow into a reality or see the light of day , and there will be no end to the troubles of states , or indeed , my dear Glaucon , of humanity itself , till philosophers are kings in this world , or till those we now call kings and rulers really and truly become philosophers , and political power and philosophy thus come into the same hands , while the many natures now content to follow either to the exclusion of the other are forcibly debarred from doing so .
This is what I have hesitated to say so long , knowing what a paradox it would sound ; for it is not easy to see that there is no other road to happiness , either for society or the individual .
( Plato , Republic )
Unfortunately , because of a failure of philosophy / metaphysics to understand what is ultimately true ( i.e. to understand reality as the source of truth ) we live in a time of postmodern relative cultural truths that leads to many conflicts and causes humanity great harm .
This allows societies to be manipulated by our more primitive emotions ( rather than reason / truth ) as Julius Caesar observed ( and which is very relevant to our modern world ) .
Beware the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor , for patriotism is indeed a double - edged sword .
It both emboldens the blood , just as it narrows the mind .
And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed , the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry .
Rather , the citizenry , infused with fear and blinded by patriotism , will offer up all of their rights unto the leader and gladly so .
How do I know ?
For this is what I have done .
And I am Caesar . ( Julius Caesar )
In this webpage you will find some wonderful quotes on politics from Plato , Aristotle , Cicero , Caesar , Machiavelli , Hobbes , de Montaigne , Hume , Bismarck , Mussolini , Einstein , Lenin & Stalin .
The central purpose of this page though , is to introduce a new metaphysical foundation for politics ( see links on side of page ) .
This is never an easy thing to do , as Machiavelli wrote ;
There is nothing more difficult to plan , more doubtful of success , more dangerous to manage than the creation of a new system .
The innovator has the enmity of all who profit by the preservation of the old system and only lukewarm defenders by those who would gain by the new system .
( Machiavelli , 1513 )
Nonetheless , I have a great belief in the wisdom of philosophy , that ultimately truth has a unique power to change the world for the better , as David Hume so elegantly stated it ;
And though the philosopher may live remote from business , the genius of philosophy , if carefully cultivated by several , must gradually diffuse itself throughout the whole society , and bestow a similar correctness on every art and calling .
( David Hume , 1737 )

Famous Philosophers & Politicians Quotes on Politics & Political Philosophy
Quotations by Plato , Joseph Stalin , Albert Einstein , Michel de Montaigne , David Hume , Bertrand Russell , John Ralston Saul
' And I think that you too would call it propaganda when people are enticed into a change of opinion by promises of pleasure , or terrified into it by threats ? '
' Yes , propaganda and deceit always go together . '
( Plato , Republic )
... Societies are n't made of sticks and stones , but of men whose individual characters , by turning the scale one way or another , determine the direction of the whole .
( Plato , Republic )
( Joseph Stalin )
Of course the old system is breaking down , decaying .
That is true .
But it is also true that new efforts are being made by other methods , by even means , to protect , to save this dying system .
You draw a wrong conclusion from a correct postulate .
You rightly state that the old world is breaking down .
But you are wrong in thinking that it is breaking down of its own accord .
No , the substitution of one social system for another is a complicated and long revolutionary process .
It is not simply a spontaneous process , but a struggle ; it is a process connected with the clash of classes .
Capitalism is decaying , but it must not be compared simply with a tree which has decayed to such an extent that it must fall to the ground of its own accord .
No ; revolution , the substitution of one social system for another , has always been a struggle , a painful and a cruel struggle , a life and death struggle .
And every time the people of the new world came into power they had to defend themselves against the attempts of the old world to restore the old order by force , these people of the new world always had to be on the alert , always had to be ready to repel the attacks of the old world upon the new system .
In speaking of the capitalists who strive only for profit , only to get rich , I do not want to say that these are the most worthless people capable of doing nothing else .
Many of them undoubtedly possess great organising talent , which I would not dream of denying .
We Soviet people learn a lot from the capitalists .
But if you mean people who are prepared to reconstruct the world , of course you will not be able to find them in the ranks of those who faithfully serve the cause of profit .
.. The capitalist is riveted in profit and nothing can tear him away from it .
( Joseph Stalin )
There is not , nor should there be , an irreconcilable contrast between the individual and the collective , between the interests of an individual person and the interests of the collective .
( Joseph Stalin , Interview by H. G. Wells , 1934 , Penguin Book on Interviews )
How could politics be a science , if laws and forms of government had not a uniform influence upon society ?
Where would be the foundation of morals , if particular characters had no certain or determinate power to produce particular sentiments , and if these sentiments had no constant operation on actions ?
( David Hume , Enquiries Concerning Human Understanding , 1737 )
It seems then , say I , that you leave politics entirely out of the question , and never suppose , that a wise magistrate can justly be jealous of certain tenets of philosophy , such as those of Epicurus , which , denying a divine existence , and consequently a providence and a future state , seem to loosen , in a great measure , the ties of morality , and may be supposed , for that reason , pernicious to the peace of civil society .
( David Hume , Enquiries Concerning Human Understanding , 1737 )
In ancient times , bodily strength and dexterity , being of greater use and importance in war , was also much more esteemed and valued , than at present .
...
In short , the different ranks of men are , in a great measure , regulated by riches .
( David Hume , 1737 )
A man who has cured himself of all ridiculous prepossessions , and is fully , sincerely , and steadily convinced , from experience as well as philosophy , that the difference of fortune makes less difference in happiness than is vulgarly imagined ; such a one does not measure out degrees of esteem according to the rent - rolls of his acquaintance .
... his internal sentiments are more regulated by the personal characters of men , than by the accidental and capricious favors of fortune .
( David Hume , 1737 )
Each practice has its advantages and disadvantages .
Where birth is respected , unactive , spiritless minds remain in haughty indolence , and dream of nothing but pedigrees and genealogies : the generous and ambitious seek honour and authority , and reputation and favour .
Where riches are the chief idol , corruption , venality , rapine prevail : arts , manufactures , commerce , agriculture flourish .
The former prejudice , being favorable to military value , is more suited to monarchies .
The latter , being the chief spur to industry , agrees better with a republican government .
And we accordingly find that each of these forms of government , by varying the utility of those customs , has commonly a proportional effect on the sentiments of mankind .
( David Hume , 1737 )
Ever since men became capable of free speculation , their actions , in innumerable important respects , have depended upon their theories as to the world and human life , as to what is good and what is evil .
This is true in the present day as at any former time .
To understand an age or a nation , we must understand its philosophy , and to understand its philosophy we must ourselves be in some degree philosophers .
There is here a reciprocal causation : the circumstances of men's lives do much to determine their philosophy , but , conversely , their philosophy does much to determine their circumstances .
( Bertrand Russell p.14 )
Modern definitions of truth , such as those as pragmatism and instrumentalism , which are practical rather than contemplative , are inspired by industrialisation as opposed to aristocracy .
( Bertrand Russell )
Never depend upon institutions or government to solve any problem .
All social movements are founded by , guided by , motivated and seen through by the passion of individuals .
( Margaret Mead )
Yes , a dictator can be loved .
Provided that the masses fear him at the same time .
The crowd love strong men .
The crowd is like a woman .
( Benito Mussolini )
( Mussolini ) The crowd does n't have to know .
It must believe .
If we only give them faith that mountains can be moved , they will accept the illusion that mountains are moveable , and thus an illusion may become reality .
He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster .
And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you .
( Friedrich Nietzsche )
We should be similarly wary of accepting common opinions ; we should judge them by the ways of reason not by popular vote .
( Michel de Montaigne )
There is a huge gulf between the man who follows the conventions and laws of his country and the man who sets out to regiment them and to change them .
( Michel de Montaigne )
Peoples nurtured on freedom and self - government judge any other form of polity to be deformed and unnatural .
Those who are used to monarchy do the same .
( Michel de Montaigne )
Constitutional parliamentary government is a very high order of regime , based on special and diffused knowledge , as well as on many judicious compromises - what you English call ‘ give and take . ’
To entrust it to the hands of ignorant men , theorists , visionaries , enthusiasts utterly unversed in political history and actualities , is sheer folly , or rather dangerous madness .
The only thing for such people is strong authority , which of course should be just , high - minded , and , if possible , benevolent .
On the other hand , unrestricted authority and its exercise harden officials , who are but men , after all .
Too much red - tapism is noxious ; but neither is it wise to set too narrow limits to the power and dignity of the State .
( Prince Bismarck , 1890 )
The most successful tyranny is not the one that uses force to assure uniformity but the one that removes the awareness of other possibilities , that makes it seem inconceivable that other ways are viable , that removes the sense that there is an outside .
( Allan Bloom , The Closing of the American Mind )
A big part of our problem is that politicians are elected for only a few years at a time .
In that time , they have to provide benefits that can be seen quickly , like construction jobs , new factories and shopping malls .
Since social and environmental problems take years to be revealed and just as long to be averted , different politicians will be around to take the credit or the blame when they become critical .
So people elected into office find themselves naturally concentrating on short - term fixes , like helping a pulp - and - paper company open a new mill .
They know they will be long gone by the time the effects of deforestation or dioxin contamination from that mill are felt by the public .
( David Suzuki , Naked Ape to Superspecies )
( John Ralston Saul - The Unconscious Civilisation )
There is a certain terrifying dignity to the big ideologies .
With the stroke of an intellectual argument the planet is put in its place .
Only the bravest or the most foolish of individuals would not become passive before such awe inspiring destinies .
I advocate world government because I am convinced that there is no other possible way of eliminating the most terrible danger in which man has ever found himself .
The objective of avoiding total destruction must have priority over any other objective .
( Albert Einstein , 1947 )
Problems cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that created them .
( Albert Einstein )
Exchange Of Letters With Members Of The Russian Academy
Any government is in itself an evil in so far as it carries within it the tendency to deteriorate into tyranny .
However , except for a small number of anarchists , every one of us is convinced that civilized society cannot exist without a government .
In a healthy nation there is a kind of dynamic balance between the will of the people and the government , which prevents its degeneration into tyranny .
It is obvious that the danger of such deterioration is more acute in a country in which the government has authority not only over the armed forces but also over all the channels of education and information as well as over the economic existence of every single citizen .
I say this merely to indicate that socialism as such cannot be considered the solution to all social problems but merely as a framework within which such a solution is possible .
( Albert Einstein , 1947 )
My personal opinion is that those methods are in general preferable which respect existing traditions and habits so far as that is in any way compatible with the end in view .
Nor do I believe that a sudden transference of economy into government management would be beneficial from the point of view of production ; private enterprise should be left its sphere of activity , in so far as it has not already been eliminated by industry itself by the device of cartelization .
There are , however , two respects in which this economic freedom ought to be limited .
In each branch of industry the number of working hours per week ought so to be reduced by law that unemployment is systematically abolished .
At the same time minimum wages must be fixed in such a way that the purchasing power of the workers keeps pace with production .
Further , in those industries which have become monopolistic in character through organisation on the part of the producers , prices must be controlled by the state in order to keep the issue of capital within reasonable bounds and prevent artificial strangling of production and consumption .
In this way it might perhaps be possible to establish a proper balance between production and consumption without too great a limitation of free enterprise and at the same time to stop the intolerable tyranny of the owners of the means of production ( land and machinery ) over the wage - earners , in the widest sense of the term .
( Albert Einstein , 1934 )
The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is , in my opinion , the real source of evil .
( Albert Einstein , 1949 )
Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands , partly because of competition among the capitalists , and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of the smaller ones .
The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organised political society .
This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties , largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who , for all practical purposes , separate the electorate from the legislature .
The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population .
Moreover , under existing conditions , private capitalists inevitably control , directly or indirectly , the main sources of information ( press , radio , education ) .
It is thus extremely difficult , and indeed in most cases quite impossible , for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights .
( Albert Einstein , 1949 )
This crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism .
Our whole educational system suffers from this evil .
An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student , who is trained to worship acquisitive success as a preparation for his future career .
I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils , namely through the establishment of a socialist economy , accompanied by a educational system which would be oriented toward social goals .
In such an economy , the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilised in a planned fashion .
A planned economy , which adjusts production to the needs of the community , would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man , woman and child .
The education of the individual , in addition to promoting his own innate abilities , would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow - men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society .
( Albert Einstein , 1949 )
Quotations from Aristotle , Politics
We find that Aristotle has no clear cut answer to the question ‘ which is the best form of constitution ? ’
But finds plenty of warrant in the Politics for saying that the rule of one outstandingly good human , backed by just laws , is most desirable , if only it can be obtained .
( Introduction , Politics )
The problems posed by ethical and political philosophy are not of a kind that can be solved once and for all and handed on to posterity as so much accomplished ; and that the problems are still the same problems at the bottom , however much appearances and circumstances may have altered in twenty three centuries .
How can humans live together ?
The world has grown smaller and more humans are forced to live together .
The problem is larger , more acute and more complicated than it was when ancient philosophers first looked at it .
How in particular can a top - dog and an under - dog be made to live together ? ’
( Introduction , Politics )
.. by nature man is a political animal .
Hence man have a desire for life together , even when they have no need to seek each other ’s help .
Nevertheless , common interest too is a factor in bringing them together , in so far as it contributes to the good life of each .
The good life is indeed their chief end , both communally and individually ; but they form and continue to maintain a political association for the sake of life itself .
Perhaps we may say that there is an element of good even in mere living , provided that life is not excessively beset with troubles .
Certainly most men , in their desire to keep alive , are prepared to face a great deal of suffering , as if finding in life itself a certain well - being and a natural sweetness .
( Aristotle , Politics )
The society that loses its grip on the past is in danger , for it produces men who know nothing but the present , and who are not aware that life had been , and could be , different from what it is .
( Aristotle , Politics )
All who have meditated on the art of governing mankind have been convinced that the fate of empires depends on the education of youth .
( Aristotle )
For the real difference between humans and other animals is that humans alone have perception of good and evil , just and unjust , etc .
It is the sharing of a common view in these matters that makes a household and a state .
( Aristotle , Politics )
To leave the number of births unrestricted , as is done in most states , inevitably causes poverty among the citizens , and poverty produces crime and faction .
( Aristotle , Politics )
Phronimos , ‘ possessing practical wisdom ’ .
But the only virtue special to a ruler is practical wisdom ; all the others must be possessed , so it seems , both by rulers and ruled .
The virtue of a person being ruled is not practical wisdom but correct opinion ; he is rather like a person who makes the pipes , while the ruler is the one who can play them .
( Aristotle , Politics )
It is clear that those constitutions which aim at the common good are right , as being in accord with absolute justice ; while those which aim only at the good of the rulers are wrong .
( Aristotle , Politics )
The usual names for right constitutions are as follows :
( a) Monarchy , aiming at the common interest : kingship .
( b) Rule of more than one man but only a few : Aristocracy ( so called either because the best men rule or because it aims at what is best for the state and all its members ) .
( c) Political control exercised by the mass of the populace in the common interest : Polity .
This is the name common to all constitutions .
It is reasonable to use this term , because , while it is possible for one man or a few to be outstanding in point if virtue , it is difficult for a larger number to reach a high standard in all forms of virtue – with the conspicuous exception of military virtue , which is found in a great many people .
And that is why in this constitution the defensive elements is the most sovereign body , and those who share in the constitution are those who bear arms .
The corresponding deviations are : from kingship , tyranny ; form aristocracy , oligarchy ; from polity , democracy .
For tyranny is monarchy for the benefit of the monarch , oligarchy for the benefit of the men of means , democracy for the benefit of the men without means .
None of the three aims to be of profit to the common interest .
( Aristotle , Politics )
A man who examines each subject from a philosophical standpoint cannot neglect them : he has to omit nothing , and state the truth about each topic .
( Aristotle , Politics )
Thus it is thought that justice is equality ; and so it is , but not for all persons , only for those that are equal .
Inequality also is thought to be just ; and so it is , but not for all , only for the unequal .
We make bad mistakes if we neglect this ‘ for whom ’ when we are deciding what is just .
The reason is that we are making judgements about ourselves , and people are generally bad judges where their own interests are involved .
( Aristotle , Politics )
So we must lay it down that the association which is a state exists not for the purpose of living together but for the sake of noble actions .
( Aristotle , Politics )
.. the mass of the people ought to be sovereign , rather than the best but few - is not without difficulty , but has perhaps some truth in it .
( Aristotle , Politics )
But it is not at all certain that this superiority of the many over the sound few is possible in the case of every people and every large number .
There are some whom it would be impossible : otherwise the theory would apply to wild animals - and yet some men are hardly any better than wild animals .
( Aristotle , Politics )
To let them share in the highest offices is to take a risk ; inevitably , their unjust standards will cause them to commit injustice , and their lack of judgement will lead them into error .
On the other hand there is a risk in not giving them a share , and in their non participation , for when there are many who have no property and no honours they inevitably constitute a huge hostile element in the state .
But it can still remain open to them to participate in deliberating and judging .
( Aristotle , Politics )
.. nothing emerges so clearly as the fact that the laws , if rightly established , ought to be sovereign , and also that officials , whether individually or as a body , ought to have sovereign power to act in all those various matters about which the laws cannot possibly give detailed guidance ; for it is never easy to frame general regulations covering every particular .
We said ‘ laws rightly established ’ , but we have not yet discovered what sort of laws these ought to be , so the old problem remains .
For as constitutions vary , simultaneously and in like manner the laws too inevitably vary , and are sound or bad , just or unjust ; but this much is clear , that the constitution must set the pattern for the laws .
( Aristotle , Politics )
We begin by asking whether it is more expedient to be ruled by the best man or by the best laws .
Those who believe that to be ruled by a king is expedient think that the laws enunciate only general principles and do not give day - to - day instructions on matter as they arise ; and so , they argue , in any skill it is foolish to be guided always by written rules .
For the same reason , it is obvious that the constitution which goes by laws and written rules is not the best .
On the other hand , rulers cannot do without that general principle in addition : it provides something which , being without personal feelings , is better than that which by its nature does feel .
Every human soul must have feelings , whereas a law has none ; but in compensations , one might say , a man will give sounder counsel than law in individual cases .
( Aristotle , Politics )
Perhaps here we have a clue to the reason why royal rule used to exist formerly , namely the difficulty of finding enough men of outstanding virtue .. ( Aristotle , Politics )
Then , when a large number of men of similar virtue became available , people no longer tolerated one - man rule but looked for something communal , and set up a constitution .
But the good men did not remain good : they began to make money out of that which was the common property of all .
And to some such development we may plausibly ascribe the origin of oligarchies , since men made wealth a thing of honour .
The next change was to tyrannies , and from tyrannies to democracy .
For the struggle to get rich at all costs tended to reduce numbers , and so increased the power of the multitude , who rose up and formed democracies .
And now that there has been a further increase in the size of states , one might say that it is hard to avoid having a democratic constitution ( Aristotle , Politics )
. .we would have to say that hereditary succession is harmful .
You may say the king , having sovereign power , will not in that case hand over to his children .
But it is hard to believe that : it is a difficult achievement , which expects too much virtue of human nature .
( Aristotle , Politics )
.. for desire is like a wild beast , and anger perverts rulers and the very best of men .
Hence law is intelligence without appetition .
( Aristotle , Politics )
The right constitutions , three in number - kingship , aristocracy , and polity - and the deviations from these , likewise three in number – tyranny from kingship , oligarchy from aristocracy , democracy from polity .
( Aristotle , Politics )
A democracy exists whenever those who are free and are not well - off , being in the majority , are in sovereign control of government , an oligarchy when control lies with the rich and better - born , these being few .
( Aristotle , Politics )
Plato , The Republic , Political Philosophy Quotes
... what we can be positive about is what we have just said , namely that they must be given the right education , whatever that may be , as the surest way to make them behave humanely to each other and the subjects in their charge .
( Plato )
... our purpose in founding our state was not to promote the happiness of a single class , but , so far as possible , of the whole community .
Our idea was that we were most likely to justice in such a community , and so be able to decide the question we are trying to answer .
We are therefore at the moment trying to construct what we think is a happy community by securing the happiness not of a select minority , but of a whole .
( Plato )
... the community suffers nothing very terrible if its cobblers are bad and become degenerate and pretentious ; but if the Guardians of its laws and constitution , who alone have the opportunity to bring it good government and prosperity , become a mere sham , then clearly it is completely ruined .
( Plato )
Their military training will ensure success in war , but they must maintain unity by not allowing the state to grow to large , and by ensuring that the measures for promotion and demotion from one class to another are carried out .
Above all they must maintain the educational system unchanged ; for on education everything else depends , and it is an illusion to imagine that mere legislation without it can effect anything of consequence .
( Plato )
' Both poverty and wealth , therefore , have a bad effect on the quality of the work and the workman himself . '
' Wealth and poverty , ' I answered .
' One produces luxury and idleness and a passion for novelty , the other meanness and bad workmanship and revolution into the bargain . '
( Plato )
If they are well brought up , and become reasonable men , they can easily see to all we have asked them to , and indeed a good many things we have omitted , such as the position of women , marriage , and the production of children , all of which ought so far as possible to be dealt with on the proverbial basis of " all things in common between friends " .
' Yes , they can deal with all these problems . '
' And once we have given our community a good start , ' I pointed out , ' the process will be cumulative .
By maintaining a sound system of education you produce citizens of good character , and citizens of sound character , with the advantage of a good education , produce in turn children better than themselves and better able to produce still better children in their turn , as can be seen with animals . '
( Plato )
The State which we have founded must possess the four cardinal virtues of wisdom , courage , discipline and justice ...
Justice is the principle which has in fact been followed throughout , the principle of one man one job , of ' minding one 's own business ' , in the sense of doing the job for which one is naturally fitted and not interfering with other people .
( Plato )
And the quality of good judgement is clearly a form of knowledge and skill , as it is because of knowledge and not because of ignorance that we judge well .
( Plato )
So the state founded on natural principles is wise as a whole in virtue of the knowledge inherent in its smallest constituent class , which exercises authority over the rest .
And the smallest class is the one which naturally possesses that form of knowledge which alone of all others deserves the title of wisdom .
( Plato )
' Assume , then , ' I said , ' that this was the sort of result we were doing our best to achieve in choosing our soldier - class , and in educating them physically and mentally .
Our whole object was to steep them in the spirit of our laws like a dye , so that nature and nurture might combine to fix them indelibly their convictions about what is dangerous , and about all other topics , and prevent them being washed out by those most powerful solvents , pleasure , so much more effective than soap and chemicals , and pain and fear and desire , the most effective of all .
This kind of ability to retain in all circumstances a judgement about danger which is correct by established standards is what I propose to call courage , unless you have any alternative to suggest . '
( Plato )
' What the expression is intended to mean , I think , is that there is a better and a worse element in the character of each individual , and that when the naturally better element controls the worse then the man is said to be " master of himself " , as a term of praise .
But when ( as a result of bad upbringing or bad company ) one 's better element is overpowered by the numerical superiority of one 's worse impulses , then one is criticized for not being master of oneself and for lack of self control .
'( Plato )
' And , what is more , the greatest variety of desires and pleasures and pains is generally to be found in children and women and slaves , and in the less reputable majority of so called free men . '
' Certainly '
' While the simple and moderate desires , guided by reason and judgement and reflection , you will find in a minority who have the advantages of natural gifts and good education . '
' True '
' This feature too you can see in our state , where the desires of the less reputable majority are controlled by the desires and the wisdom of the superior minority . '
( Plato )
' Because , unlike courage and wisdom , which made our state brave and wise by being present in a particular part of it , discipline operates by being diffused throughout the whole of it .
It produces a concord between its strongest and weakest and middle elements , whether you define them by the standard of good sense , or of strength , or of numbers or money or the like .
And so we are quite justified in regarding discipline as this sort of natural harmony and agreement between higher and lower about which of them is to rule in state and individual . '
( Plato )
'... that in our state one man was to do one job , and the job he was naturally most suited for ..
And further , we have often heard and often said that justice consists of minding your own business and not interfering with other people . '
( Plato )
' Interference by the three classes with each other 's jobs , and interchange of jobs between them , therefore , does the greatest harm to our state , and we are entirely justified in calling it the worst of evils . '
( Plato )
Justice in the individual is now defined analogously to justice in the state .
The individual is wise and brave in virtue of his reason and ' spirit ' respectively : he is disciplined when ' spirit ' and appetite are in proper subordination to reason .
He is just in virtue of the harmony which exists when all three elements of the mind perform their proper function and so achieve their proper fulfillment ; he is unjust when no such harmony exists .
( Plato )
The principles are important .
First , the interest of the state or society counts for everything , that of the individual for nothing .
Second , the only difference between men and women is one of physical function - one begets , the other bears children .
Apart from that , they both can and should perform the same functions ( though men on a whole , perform them better ) and should receive the same education to enable them to do so ; for in this way society will get the best value from both .
( Plato )
We must , if we are to be consistent , and if we 're to have a real pedigree herd , mate the best of our men with the best of our women as often as possible , and the inferior men with the inferior women as seldom as possible , and keep only the offspring of the best .
( Plato )
And among the other honours and rewards our young men can win for distinguished service in war and in other activities , will be more frequent opportunities to sleep with a woman ; this will give us a pretext for ensuring that most of our children are born of that parent .
( Plato )
' Is there anything worse for a state than to be split and disunited ?
or anything better than cohesion and unity ? '
( Plato )
' Have n't you noticed how , in a trade like the potters ' , children serve a long apprenticeship , watching how things are done , before they take a hand in the work themselves ? '
' Yes I have '
' Ought n't the Guardians to take just as much care , when they are training their children , to let them see what their duties are and get used to them ? '
' It would be absurd if they did n't '
' And besides , any animal fights better in the presence of its young . '
( Plato )
The society we have described can never grow into a reality or see the light of day , and there will be no end to the troubles of states , or indeed , my dear Glaucon , of humanity itself , till philosophers are kings in this world , or till those we now call kings and rulers really and truly become philosophers , and political power and philosophy thus come into the same hands , while the many natures now content to follow either to the exclusion of the other are forcibly debarred from doing so .
This is what I have hesitated to say so long , knowing what a paradox it would sound ; for it is not easy to see that there is no other road to happiness , either for society or the individual .
( Plato )
The philosopher is in love with truth , that is , not with the changing world of sensation , which is the object of opinion , but with the unchanging reality which is the object of knowledge .
( Plato )
... there are some who are naturally fitted for philosophy and political leadership , while the rest should follow their lead and let philosophy alone .
( Plato )
'... we shan't be unfair to our philosophers , but shall be quite justified in compelling them to have some care and responsibility for others .
We shall tell them that philosophers in other states can reasonably refuse to take part in the hard work of politics ; for society produces them quite involuntary and unintentionally , and it is only just that anything that grows up on its own should feel it has nothing to repay for an unbringing which it owes to no one .
" But you , " we shall say , " have been bred to rule to your advantage and that of the whole community , like king bees in a hive ; you are better educated than the rest and better qualified to combine the practice of philosophy and politics .
You must therefore each descend in turn and live with your fellows in the cave and get used to seeing in the dark ; once you get used to it you will see a thousand times better than they do and will recognise the various shadows , because you have seen the truth about things right and just and good .
And so our state and yours will be really awake , and not merely dreaming like most societies today , with their shadow battles and their struggles for political power , which they treat as some great prize .
The truth is quite different : the state whose rulers come to their duties with least enthusiasm is bound to have the best and most tranquil government , and the state whose rulers are eager to rule the worst . '
( Plato )
' If you get , in public affairs , men who are so morally impoverished that they have nothing they can contribute themselves , but who hope to snatch some compensation for their own inadequacy from a political career , there can never be good government .
They start fighting for power , and the consequent internal and domestic conflicts ruin both them and society . '
' True indeed '
' Is there any other life except that of true philosophy which looks down on political power ? '
' None that I know of '
' And yet the only men to get power should be men who do not love it , otherwise we shall have rivals ' quarrels . '
' That is certain '
' Who else , then , are we to compel to undertake the responsibilities of ruling , if it is not to be those who know most about good government and who yet value other things more highly than politics and its rewards ? '
' There is no one else '
( Plato )
' You must realise , I suppose , ' I went on , ' that there must be as many types of individual as of society ?
Societies are n't made of sticks and stones , but of men whose individual characters , by turning the scale one way or another , determine the direction of the whole . '
( Plato )
Nicolò Machiavelli
Historian and statesman , born at Florence , 3 May , 1469 ; died there , 22 June , 1527 .
His family is said to have been descended from the old marquesses of Tuscany , and to have given Florence thirteen gonfaloniers of justice .
His father , Bernardo , was a lawyer , and acted as treasurer of the Marches , but was far from wealthy .
Of Nicolò 's studies we only know that he was a pupil of Marcello Virgilio .
In 1498 he was elected secretary of the Lower Chancery of the Signory , and in later years he held the same post under the Ten .
Thus it chanced that for fourteen years he had charge of the home and foreign correspondence of the republic , the registration of trials , the keeping of the minutes of the councils , and the drafting of agreements with other states .
Moreover he was sent in various capacities to one or other locality within the State of Tuscany , and on twenty - three occasions he acted as legate on important embassies to foreign princes , e. g. to Catherine Sforza ( 1499 ) , to France ( 1500 , 1510 , 1511 ) , to the emperor ( 1507 , 1509 ) , to Rome ( 1503 , 1506 ) , to Cæsar Borgia ( 1502 ) , to Gian Paolo Baglione at Perugia , to the Petrucci at Siena , and to Piombino .
On these embassies he gave evidence of wonderful keenness of observation and insight into the hidden thoughts of the men he was dealing with , rather than of any great diplomatic skill .
After the defeat of France in Italy ( 1512 ) the Medici once more obtained control of Florence ; the secretary was dismissed and exiled for one year from the city .
On the discovery of the Capponi and Boscoli plot against Cardinal Giovanni de ' Medici , Machiavelli was accused as an accomplice , and tortured , but he was set free when the cardinal became Pope Leo X .
Thereupon he retired to some property he had at Strada near San Casciano , where he gave himself up to the study of the classics , especially Livy , and to the writing of his political and literary histories .
Both Leo X and Clement VII sought his advice in political matters , and he was often employed on particular missions affecting matters of state , as , for in stance , when he was sent to Francesco Guiccardini , the papal leader in the Romagna and general of the army of the League , concerning the fortification of Florence .
He made vain efforts to secure a public post under the Medici , being ready even to sacrifice his political opinions for the purpose .
He returned home after the sack of Rome ( 12 May , 1527 ) when the power of the Medici had been once more overthrown , but his old political party turned against him as one who fawned on tyrants .
He died soon afterwards .
Machiavelli's writings consist of the following works :
Historical : " Storie Fiorentine " , which goes from the fall of the Empire to 1492 , dedicated to Clement VII , at whose request it had been written .

Machiavelli's character as a man and a writer has been widely discussed , and on both heads his merits and demerits have been exaggerated , but in such a way that his demerits have preponderated to the detriment of his memory .
Machiavellism has become synonymous with treachery , intrigue , subterfuge , and tyranny .
It has been even said that " Old Nick " , the popular name of the Devil among Anglo - Saxon races , derives its origin from that of Nicolò Machiavelli .
This dubious fame he has won by his book the " Principe " , and the theories therein exploited were further elaborated in his " Discorsi sopra Livio " .
To understand the " Principe " right it must be borne in mind that the work is not a treatise on foreign politics .
It aims solely at examining how a kingdom may be best built up and established ; nor is it a mere abstract discussion , but it is carried on in the light of an ideal long held by Machiavelli , that a United Italy was possible and in the last chapter of the work he exhorts the Medici of Florence ( Giuliano and Lorenzo ) to its realization .
His aim was to point out the best way for bringing it about ; he did not deal with abstract principles and arguments , but collected examples from classical antiquity and from recent events , especially from the career of Cæsar Borgia .
So that the " Principe " is a political tract with a definite aim and intended for a particular locality .
To gain the end in view results are to be the only criteria of the methods employed , and even the teachings of the moral law must give way to secure the end in view .
Good faith , clemency , and moderation are not cast overboard , but he teaches that the interests of the state are above all individual virtues .
These virtues may be useful , and when they are a prince ought to exercise them , but more often in dealing with an opponent they are a hindrance , not in themselves , but by reason of the crookedness of others .
Whosoever would prevail against the treachery , crime , and cruelty of others , must himself be beforehand in misleading and deceiving his opponent and even in getting rid of him , as Cæsar Borgia had done .
While on the other hand Gian Paolo Baglione made a mistake , by omitting to imprison or put to death Julius II , in 1506 , on the occasion of his unprotected entry to Perugia ( Discorsi sopra Livio , I , xxvii ) .
Again , a prince must keep clear of crime not only when it is hurtful to his interests but when it is useless .
He should try to win the love of his subjects , by simulating virtue if he does not possess it ; he ought to encourage trade so that his people , busied in getting rich , may have no time for politics ; he ought to show concern for religion , because it is a potent means for keeping his people submissive and obedient .
Such is the general teaching of the " Principe " , which has been often refuted .
As a theory Machiavellism may per haps be called an innovation ; but as a practice it is as old as political society .
It was a most immoral work , in that it cuts politics adrift from all morality , and it was rightly put on the Index in 1559 .
It is worth noting that the " Principe " with its glorification of absolutism is totally opposed to its author 's ideas of democracy , which led to his ruin .
To explain the difficulty it is not necessary to claim that the book is a satire , nor that it is evidence of how easily the writer could change his political views provided he could stand well with the Medici .
Much as Machiavelli loved liberty and Florence he dreamed of a " larger Italy " of the Italians .
As a practical man he saw that his dream could be realized only through a prince of character and energy who would walk in the steps of Cæsar Borgia , and he conceded that the individual good must give way to the general well - being .
As a historian Machiavelli is an excellent source when he deals with what happened under his eyes at the various embassies ; but it should be remembered that he gives everything a more or less unconscious twist to bring it into conformity with his generalizations .
This is more marked even in his accounts of what he had heard or read , and serves to explain the discrepancies in the letters he wrote during his embassies to Cæsar Borgia , the " Descrizione " , etc. , the ideal picture he drew of affairs in Germany , and his life of Castruccio Castracane , which is rather an historical romance modelled on the character of Agathocles in Plutarch .
He knew nothing of historical criticism , yet he showed how events in history move in obedience to certain general laws ; and this is his great merit as an historian .
His natural bent was politics , but in his dealings with military matters he showed such skill as would amaze us even if we did not know he had never been a soldier .
He recognized that to be strong a state must have its standing army , and he upholds this not only in the " Principe " and the " Discorsi " but in his various military writings .
The broad and stable laws of military tactics he lays down in masterly fashion ; yet it is curious to note that he lays no great stress on firearms .
His style is always clear and crisp and his reasoning close and orderly .
What poetry he has left gives no proof of poetic talent ; rather , the comedies are clever and successful as compositions and only too often bear undisguised traces of the moral laxity of the author ( this is shown also in his letters to his friends ) and of the age in which he lived .
His " Mandragola " and " Clizia " are nothing more or less than pochades and lose no opportunity of scoring against religion .
Machiavelli did not disguise his dislike for Christianity which by exalting humility , meekness , and patience had , he said , weakened the social and patriotic instincts of mankind .
Hence , he mocked at Savonarola though he was the saviour of democracy , and he had a special dislike for the Holy See as a temporal power , as he saw in it the greatest obstacle to Italian unity ; to use his own expression , it was too weak to control the whole peninsula , but too strong to allow of any other state bringing about unity .
This explains why he has no words of praise for Julius II and his Italian policy .
It was merely as an opportunist that he courted the favour of Leo X and Clement VII .
On the other hand , when death came his way he remembered that he was a Christian and he died a Christian death , though his life , habits , and ideals had been pagan , and himself a typical representative of the Italian Renaissance .

Thomas Hobbes , Political Philosophy of Leviathan
Thomas Hobbes ( 1588 - 1679 ) saw Society as a giant machine ( perpetually in motion ) , thus the title of his great work , The Leviathan , which is founded on Mechanics ( the Motion of Bodies / Matter ) .
In Leviathan , Hobbes argues that the natural state of man ( without any civil government ) is war ,
'... the life of man solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short .
...
The condition of man ... is a condition of war of everyone against everyone . '
( Hobbes , Leviathan , 1651 )
According to Hobbes , man in the state of nature seeks nothing but his own selfish pleasure , but such individualism naturally leads to a war in which every man 's hand is against his neighbour .
In pure self - interest and for self - preservation men entered into a compact by which they agreed to surrender part of their natural freedom to an absolute ruler in order to preserve the rest .
The State determines what is just and unjust , right and wrong ; and the strong arm of the law provides the ultimate sanction for right conduct .
( Catholic Encyclopedia : Obligation , 1911 )
Thus Thomas Hobbes supports an absolute monarchy , where power resides in the king or queen , as this absolute power to create and enforce laws was necessary for justice and the formation of a moral society .
Hell is Truth Seen Too Late ( Thomas Hobbes )
For by Art is created that great Leviathan called a Commonwealth or State which is but an Artificial Man ; though of greater stature and strength than the Naturall , for whose protection and defence it was intended ; and in which , the Soveraignty is an Artifical Soul , as giving life and motion to the whole body .. ( Thomas Hobbes , Leviathan )
For the laws of Nature ( as justice , equity , modesty , mercy , and , in sum , doing to others as we woud be done to ) of themselves , without the terror of some power , to cause them to be observed , are contrary to our natural passions , that carry us to partiality , pride , revenge and the like .
( Thomas Hobbes , Leviathan )
... in the first place , I put for a general inclination of all mankind , a perpetual and restless desire of power after power , that ceaseth only in death .
( Thomas Hobbes , Leviathan )
During the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe , they are in that conditions called war ; and such a war , as if of every man , against every man .
( Thomas Hobbes , Leviathan )
To this war of every man against every man , this also in consequent ; that nothing can be unjust .
The notions of right and wrong , justice and injustice have there no place .
Where there is no common power , there is no law , where no law , no injustice .
Force , and fraud , are in war the cardinal virtues .
( Thomas Hobbes , Leviathan )
No arts ; no letters ; no society ; and which is worst of all , continual fear , and danger of violent death : and the life of man , solitary , poor , nasty , brutish and short .
( Thomas Hobbes , Leviathan )
Moral philosophy is nothing else but the science of what is good , and evil , in the conversation , and society of mankind .
Good , and evil , are names that signify our appetites , and aversions ; which in different tempers , customs , and doctrines of men , are different .
( Thomas Hobbes , Leviathan )
The source of every crime , is some defect of the understanding ; or some error in reasoning ; or some sudden force of the passions .
( Thomas Hobbes , Leviathan )
Corporations are may lesser commonwealths in the bowels of a greater , like worms in the entrails of a natural man .
( Thomas Hobbes , Leviathan )
Intemperance is naturally punished with diseases ; rashness , with mischance ; injustice ; with violence of enemies ; pride , with ruin ; cowardice , with oppression ; and rebellion , with slaughter .
( Thomas Hobbes , Leviathan )
Aristotle in his first book of Politiques affirmes as a foundation of the whole politicall science , that some men by nature are made worthy to command , others only to serve .
( Thomas Hobbes , Philosophical Rudiments Concerning Government and Society , 1651 [ Rudiments ] , iii. 13 . 46 . )
They that live under the government of Democracy , attribute all the inconvenience to that forme of Commonwealth .
( Thomas Hobbes , Leviathan , ii. xviii .
94 . )
In a Democracy , look how many Demagogs [ that is ] how many powerful Orators there are with the people .
( Thomas Hobbes , Rudiments , x. 6 . 153 . )
The government it self , or the administration of its affairs , are better committed to one , then many .
( Thomas Hobbes , Rudiments , x. 16 . 163 . )
The most part are too busie in getting food , and the rest too negligent to understand .
( Thomas Hobbes , Leviathan , i. xv. 79 . )
To be seduced by Orators , as a Monarch by Flatterers .
( Thomas Hobbes , Leviathan , ii . xix . 96 . )
Reason is the Soul of the Law .
( Thomas Hobbes , Dialogue ... Common Laws . )
Ambition , and Covetousnesse are Passions that are perpetually incumbent , and pressing .

Interview with Benito Mussolini
( Penguin Book of Interviews .
Benito Mussolini interviewed by Emil Ludwig , 1933 )
‘ If a man has ideas in his head , let him come to me , and we will talk things over .
But when Mazzini wrote that letter , he was guided more by feelings than by his reason . ’
‘ I am not clear whether you regard Napoleon as a model or a warning . ’
He sat back in his chair , looked rather gloomy , and said in a restrained tone :
‘ As a warning .
I have never taken Napoleon as an exemplar , for in no respect am I comparable to him .
His activities were of a different kind from mine .
He put a term to a revolution , whereas I have begun one .
The record of his life has made me aware of errors which are by no means easy to avoid . ’
Mussolini ticked them off his fingers .
‘ Nepotism .
A contest with the papacy .
A lack of understanding of finance and economic life .
He saw nothing more than that after his victories there was a rise in securities . ’
‘ Does history give any record of a usurper who was loved ? ’
Mussolini , after a pause , even hesitatingly , he rejoined :
‘ Julius Caesar , perhaps .
The assassination of Caesar was a misfortune for mankind . ’
He added softly , ‘ I love Caesar .
He was unique in that he combined the will of the warrior with the genius of the sage .
At the bottom he was a philosopher who saw everything sub specie eternitatis .
It is true that he had a passion for fame , but his ambition did not cut him of from human kind . ’
‘ After all , then , a dictator can be loved ? ’
‘ Yes , ’ answered Mussolini with renewed decisiveness .
‘ Provided that the masses fear him at the same time .
The crowd love strong men .
The crowd is like a woman . ’
‘ I often read Byron and Leopardi .
Then , when I have had enough of human beings , I go for a voyage .
If I could do whatever I liked , I should always be at sea .
When this is impossible , I content myself with animals .
Their mental life approximates to that of a man , and yet they do n’t want to get anything out of him ; horses , dogs , and my favourite the cat !
Or else I watch wild animals .
They embody the elemental forces of nature !
Q : ‘ Should a ruler be inspired rather with contempt for mankind than with kindly feelings ? ’
He regarded me with the inscrutable expression which is so common to him , and said softly :
‘ More sympathy , more compassion ; much more compassion . ’
Q : ‘ Again and again , in exceedingly well - turned phrases , you have declared an increase in your own personality to be your aim in life , saying , “ I want to make my existence a masterpiece ! ” , or , “ I want to make my life dramatically effective . ”
Sometimes you have quoted Nietzsche ’s motto , ‘ Live dangerously ’
How then , can a man with so proud a nature write : “ My chief aim is to promote the public interest ? ”
Is there not a contradiction here ? ’
He was unmoved .
‘ I see no contradiction .
It is perfectly logical .
The interest of the community is a dramatic affair .
By serving it , therefore , I multiply my own life . ’
I was ataken back and could find no effective repartee , but I quoted to him his own words : “ I have always had an altruistic outlook on life . ”
“ Unquestionably , ” he said .
“ No one can cut himself adrift from mankind .
Three you have something concrete - the humanity of the race from whose loins I sprang . ”

" You must be the change you wish to see in the world . "
( Mohandas Gandhi )
" When forced to summarize the general theory of relativity in one sentence : Time and space and gravitation have no separate existence from matter .
...
Physical objects are not in space , but these objects are spatially extended .
In this way the concept ' empty space ' loses its meaning .
...
The particle can only appear as a limited region in space in which the field strength or the energy density are particularly high .
...
The free , unhampered exchange of ideas and scientific conclusions is necessary for the sound development of science , as it is in all spheres of cultural life .
...
We must not conceal from ourselves that no improvement in the present depressing situation is possible without a severe struggle ; for the handful of those who are really determined to do something is minute in comparison with the mass of the lukewarm and the misguided .
...
Humanity is going to need a substantially new way of thinking if it is to survive ! " ( Albert Einstein )
Our world is in great trouble due to human behaviour founded on myths and customs that are causing the destruction of Nature and climate change .
We can now deduce the most simple science theory of reality - the wave structure of matter in space .
By understanding how we and everything around us are interconnected in Space we can then deduce solutions to the fundamental problems of human knowledge in physics , philosophy , metaphysics , theology , education , health , evolution and ecology , politics and society .
This is the profound new way of thinking that Einstein realised , that we exist as spatially extended structures of the universe - the discrete and separate body an illusion .
This simply confirms the intuitions of the ancient philosophers and mystics .
Given the current censorship in physics / philosophy of science journals ( based on the standard model of particle physics / big bang cosmology ) the internet is the best hope for getting new knowledge known to the world .
But that depends on you , the people who care about science and society , realise the importance of truth and reality .

Monkey business : Photos taken by an orangutan prove a Facebook sensation
A 33 - year - old photographer has become an online sensation with pictures of her daily life at a Vienna zoo enthralling thousands of fans .
But Nonja is no ordinary snapper - she is an orangutan .
Her pictures have won over more than 20,000 fans on Facebook since the zoo launched an online photo album of her work on Tuesday .
Artist at work : Nonja , a 33 - year - old orangutan , examines her camera inside her enclosure at a Vienna zoo
Nonja 's companion poses for this thoughtful shot .
The orangutan 's photos are attracting an army of fans on social networking website Facebook
She is proving so popular that hundreds more fans are becoming her online ' friends ' each hour .
However , the blurry images of Nonja 's climbing rope and food and her companion 's shaggy red - brown fur have won lots of admiring comments from fans , the photographer herself appears not so interested .
Using a specially - adapted Samsung ST 1000 digital camera , Nonja is rewarded with a raisin that drops out of the equipment each time she takes a snap .

The Vienna Tiergarten zoo set up the project to help keep Nonja and her three hairy ape friends entertained in their enclosure .
' Of course the apes do n't care about the pictures , they are just an accidental side product , ' zoo spokesman Gerhard Kasbauer said .
' They just know that when they press the button , a raisin pops out . '
The popularity of Nonja 's online album means she is now on her way to becoming a fully - fledged orangutan icon .
Her photos can be seen on her Facebook p age here .

Update by SusanG : Mother Mags looks on the bright side , in comments :
Let me show you something .
And when I say " something " , I mean something .
See the red arrow , and where it 's pointing ?
That arrow is pointing to a place that changed humanity forever .
You can divide all of history between the time before and the time after what happened where that arrow points .
You see , that arrow is pointing to the spot , the very spot , where Neil Armstrong became the first human to step on another world .
Yeah .
This image is from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , and it shows the Apollo 11 landing site .
We 've seen it before , but this time LRO is in its 50 km mapping orbit , so the resolution on this image is far higher -- about 50 or so centimeters ( 20 inches ) .
In this image , the tracks made by Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin as they scampered on the Moon for 2 hours and 31 minutes are obvious .
You can even see the lander footpads , each just less than a meter ( a bit over a yard ) across .
The bright spots south of ( below ) the lander are various scientific packages they installed , including the Lunar Ranging Retro Reflector and the Passive Seismic Experiment .
If I 've got the scale right , the faint dark trail going to the upper left is where they put the TV camera .
Somewhere between that and the lander is the flag .
The Sun was shining straight down in this image , so the flag is n't visible .
The image above is only one part of a bigger shot :
That big feature to the right is West crater .
As the astronauts rode the lunar lander down to the surface , Armstrong saw that the computer was going to put them down right in the rubble field west ( left ) of the crater .
He took control , and with literally seconds of fuel left , put the lander safely down where you see it in this image .
His cool hand saved the mission ; had they landed among the rubble the lander could have hit a boulder , or landed so lopsided they would not have been able to take off again .
Note the picture 's scalebar .
If this were the Earth , you could stroll across this image in maybe 10 minutes .
Encumbered as they were in their spacesuits , and lacking time , Armstrong and Aldrin never got very far , and certainly not to West crater .
Pity ; it 's interesting .
Look at the rubble around it !
Those boulders which almost wiped out our first attempt to land on the Moon must have been excavated by the impact , and would have provided instant insight into the Moon 's deeper layers .
Of course , we went back five more times .
There was plenty of interplanetary booty to be nabbed .
I love these pictures from LRO !
I 've waited for years to be able to see images like this , and they are just as I imagined them .
And they come at a propitious time , when the fate of our exploration of space is changing rapidly , and decisions on its future are to be made .
It 's at just this time we most need to be reminded of what we can do when we strive for what seems to be impossible , and when we set our sights , quite literally , beyond the horizon .

Maria is occupied with trying to earn her doctorate , and she 's far too busy for adventures .
But when the library books she needs are unexpectedly borrowed ( by a dragon ) she finds herself on a quest to find the books , the dragon , a sword , courage , and the greatest cake recipe in the world ... not to mention the last chapter of her thesis .
A Ukrainian chemistry student was killed when a stick of chewing gum apparently exploded in his mouth , Ukrainian media report .
RIA Novosoti , the Russian news agency , says the incident occurred while the unidentified 25 - year - old student at Ukraine 's Kiev Polytechnic Institute was working at a computer at his parents ' house in the city of Konotop .
" A loud pop was heard from the student 's room , " ukranews.com reports , quoting an aide to the police chief .
" When his relatives entered the room they saw that the lower part of the young man 's face had been blown off . "
The report says a forensic examination found that the gum was covered with an unidentified chemical substance , thought to be some type of explosive material .
Investigators found that the student often dipped his chewing gum into a packet of citric acid and had inadvertently dipped it instead into a similar - looking packet holding explosive material that was also on his desk .
Local police feared the substance might explode if they sent it to Kiev for analysis , so experts from the capital have been summoned to Konotop , RIA Novosti reports .

I followed the recipe exactly , this is a moist , delicious cake .

If you love fresh ginger , this is the ginger - cake for you !
It differs from Gingerbread in that it is not so dark ; it is more golden colored , and does not have any molasses .
But the fresh ginger taste is strong and wonderful .
I topped the cake with whipped cream .
Also I used a large glass baking dish and baked using convection oven at 325 for 30 - 35 minutes .

This cake is fantastic !
It just dances on your tongue !
It was so moist !
This is not your typical ginger cake -- there is no molasses .
So it is a nice light cake with lots of ginger sparkle .
And I did n't even add the fresh ginger the recipe called for -- just the powdered ginger .
It was quite a hit with my guests .
I made an orange glaze for the cake , but really ... it was pointless .
One : it did n't need any embellishment , and two : the orange taste was totally overruled by the ginger flavor .
Go the powedered sugar route as she says .
Thank you Margorita

Made this along with a pound cake for a large family party .
When people heard " ginger cake " they made a beeline for the pound cake .
Once the pound cake was gone , a few brave souls tried this one , and within minutes , word had spread .
It was literally devoured in about four minutes .
( I come from a long line of sweets lovers . )
Anyway , I made a glaze of 1/2 stick melted butter , 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and about 3
Tbsp ginger brandy and poured it over the top .
It was great !!!
Thanks for a recipe I will be using over and over .

Rating : 4 stars I think I have found the perfect holiday dessert to serve to family and friends !
This cake was neither too sweet nor too bland .
Perfectly moist and chockful of flavour .
To make it even more satisfying and visually appealing I baked the cake in portions so it was about 1 inch high and cut it into squares .
Alonside a apple compote , a scoop of ice - cream and some caramel drizzled over the entire dish it was fit to impress .

With the amount if fresh and ground ginger needed I thought the ginger flavor might possibly be too intense .

One scientist practically celebrates the news of the death of one critic , saying , " In an odd way this is cheering news ! "
Another bemoans that the only way to deal with skeptics is " continuing to publish quality work in quality journals ( or calling in a Mafia hit ) . "
And a third scientist said the next time he sees a certain skeptic at a scientific meeting , " I 'll be tempted to beat the crap out of him .

This Christmas season has prompted some reflection on the phenomenon of cars simultaneously bearing Christian fish symbols and bumper stickers proclaiming that a child has been elevated to honor student status at a particular school .
Is such a bumper sticker truly consistent with Jesus ’s teachings on humility ?
I could n’t find good statistics on what percentage of public school students are on the honor roll , but this article reports 15 percent in one school district .
Let ’s say the average honor student is roughly at the 93rd percentile .
As the Chinese population is 1.34 billion , if we assume that the distribution of intelligence and diligence is the same in the U.S. and in China , perhaps a more humble bumper sticker would read “ My child is almost as smart and hard - working as 94 million people in China ” .
Anyone else have a good idea for a humble bumper sticker ?

It will be remembered as the day the greens bombed Copenhagen with limousines .
Picture updated at 12:30 PM – Anthony
From the Telegraph , the tale of elitist excess begins :
On a normal day , Majken Friss Jorgensen , managing director of Copenhagen ’s biggest limousine company , says her firm has twelve vehicles on the road .
During the “ summit to save the world ” , which opens here tomorrow , she will have 200 .
“ We thought they were not going to have many cars , due to it being a climate convention , ” she says .
“ But it seems that somebody last week looked at the weather report . ”
Ms Jorgensen reckons that between her and her rivals the total number of limos in Copenhagen next week has already broken the 1,200 barrier .
The French alone rang up on Thursday and ordered another 42 .
“ We have n’t got enough limos in the country to fulfil the demand , ” she says .
“ We ’re having to drive them in hundreds of miles from Germany and Sweden . ”
And the total number of electric cars or hybrids among that number ?
“ Five , ” says Ms Jorgensen .
“ The government has some alternative fuel cars but the rest will be petrol or diesel .
We do n’t have any hybrids in Denmark , unfortunately , due to the extreme taxes on those cars .
It makes no sense at all , but it ’s very Danish . ”
But wait , there ’s more !
The airport says it is expecting up to 140 extra private jets during the peak period alone , so far over its capacity that the planes will have to fly off to regional airports – or to Sweden – to park , returning to Copenhagen to pick up their VIP passengers .
As well 15,000 delegates and officials , 5,000 journalists and 98 world leaders , the Danish capital will be blessed by the presence of Leonardo DiCaprio , Daryl Hannah , Helena Christensen , Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Prince Charles .
A Republican US senator , Jim Inhofe , is jetting in at the head of an anti-climate - change “ Truth Squad . ”
The top hotels – all fully booked at £ 650 a night – are readying their Climate Convention menus of ( no doubt sustainable ) scallops , foie gras and sculpted caviar wedges .

General Motors says it will shut down Saab after talks to sell the brand to Dutch carmaker Spyker Cars collapsed , marking the third time this year that a deal by GM to sell an unwanted brand has fallen through .
GM said it had a small window of time to complete the deal and issues arose during the sale talks that could not be resolved .
GM Vice President John Smith said representatives from GM , Spyker and the Swedish government were still in discussions Friday morning when talks fell through .
Smith declined to elaborate on the reasons .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" We 've been trying to restart , if you will , an investment process without a great deal of time , " Smith , who is in charge of GM 's corporate planning and alliances , said during a conference call with reporters .
" Like everybody , we would have preferred a different outcome , and we all worked very hard for that different outcome and we 've come up short . "
GM first sought a buyer for Saab in January as part of its restructuring , which included plans to cut the number of its brands to four from eight .
It was previously in talks to sell Saab to a consortium led by the Swedish sports car maker Koenigsegg Group AB , but it turned to Spyker after Koenigsegg withdrew from the talks in November .
Speculation has since been rampant on the future of Saab .
Earlier this week , GM Chairman and CEO Ed Whitacre told reporters he had " a sense it 's possible " that the sale to Spyker would go through , but conceded the brand would close by the end of the year if the talks fell apart .
On Monday , China 's Beijing Automotive Industry Holdings — originally part of the Koenigsegg consortium — announced it had agreed to buy some powertrain technology from Saab .
It gave no details of costs or timing of that purchase .
On Friday , Beijing Autos said it wants to explore further cooperation with GM's Saab Automobile such as " new energy vehicles . "
GM 's failure to sell Saab is the third deal to sell an unwanted brand that has fallen through this year .
In September , auto dealership chain owner Roger Penske scrapped plans to buy Saturn after an agreement to get cars from France 's Renault fell through .
GM is now phasing out Saturn .
GM 's board last month ended a deal to sell the European Opel brand to a group led by Canadian auto parts maker Magna International Inc. , fearing that Opel was too heavily integrated into GM 's global operations and that GM technology would fall into the hands of competitors .
GM will keep and restructure Opel , which unlike Saab , is considered critical to its international vehicle development .
One success has been GM 's effort to sell Hummer .
The brand is going to Chinese heavy equipment maker Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Corp .

Arts has announced plans to make more than 1500 staff redundant by April 2010 , as well as the cancellation of at least 12 games that are currently in development .
At the same time , the publisher has just bought out PlayFish , developer of popular social networking games for around $ 300 million USD , according to Gamasutra EA hopes to save $ 100 million USD annually as a result of the lay - offs and cancellations , with the redundancies spread across all devisions .
900 developers , 500 publishing staff and 100 corporate suits are set to go , according to reports .
The studios which will be most heavily affected are EA Redwood , Tiburon , Mythic and EA Black Box .
The news follows on from EA 's recently published financial reports , which revealed a net loss of $ 391 million across the July - September period , an increase of 26 percent compared to the same period in 2008 .
" Laying off employees and closing facilities is never pleasant , " said EA Chief John Riccitiello .
" We have a lot of compassion for those impacted but these cuts are essential for transforming our company . [ / i ] " " he continued .

Through history , as natural selection played its part in the development of modern man , many of the useful functions and parts of the human body become unnecessary .
What is most fascinating is that many of these parts of the body still remain in some form so we can see the progress of evolution .
This list covers the ten most significant evolutionary changes that have taken place – leaving signs behind them .
10 Goose Bumps Cutis Anserina
Humans get goose bumps when they are cold , frightened , angry , or in awe .
Many other creatures get goose bumps for the same reason , for example this is why a cat or dog ’s hair stands on end and the cause behind a porcupine ’s quills raising .
In cold situations , the rising hair traps air between the hairs and skin , creating insulation and warmth .
In response to fear , goose bumps make an animal appear larger – hopefully scaring away the enemy .
Humans no longer benefit from goose bumps and they are simply left over from our past when we were not clothed and needed to scare our own natural enemies .
Natural selection removed the thick hair but left behind the mechanism for controlling it .
9 Jacobson ’s Organ Vomeronasal organ
Jacobson ’s organ is a fascinating part of animal anatomy and it tells us a lot about our own sexual history .
The organ is in the nose and it is a special “ smell ” organ which detects pheromones ( the chemical that triggers sexual desire , alarm , or information about food trails ) .
It is this organ that allows some animals to track others for sex and to know of potential dangers .
Humans are born with the Jacobson ’s organ , but in early development its abilities dwindle to a point that it is useless .
Once upon a time , humans would have used this organ to locate mates when communication was not possible .
Single ’s evenings , chat rooms , and bars have now taken its place in the process of human mate - seeking .
8 Junk DNA L- gulonolactone oxidase
While many of the hangovers from our “ devolved ” past are visible or physical , this is not true for all .
Humans have structures in their genetic make - up that were once used to produces enzymes to process vitamin C ( it is called L - gulonolactone oxidase ) .
Most other animals have this functioning DNA but at some point in our history , a mutation disbled the gene – whilst leaving behind its remnants as junk DNA .
This particular junk DNA indicates a common ancestry with other species on earth , so it is particularly interesting .
7 Extra Ear Muscles Auriculares muscles
Also known as the extrinsic ear muscles , the auriculares muscles are used by animals to swivel and manipulate their ears ( independently of their head ) in order to focus their hearing on particular sounds .
Humans still have the muscles that we would once have used for the very same reason – but our muscles are now so feeble that all they can do is give our ears a little wiggle .
The use of these muscles in cats is very visible ( as they can nearly turn their ears completely backwards ) – particularly when they are stalking a bird and need to make the smallest movements possible so as to not frighten its future meal .
6 Plantaris Muscle
The plantaris muscle is used by animals in gripping and manipulating objects with their feet – something you see with apes who seem to be able to use their feet as well as their hands .
Humans have this muscle as well , but it is now so underdeveloped that it is often taken out by doctors when they need tissue for reconstruction in other parts of the body .
The muscle is so unimportant to the human body that 9 % of humans are now born without it .
5 Wisdom Teeth
Early humans ate a lot of plants – and they needed to eat them quickly enough that they could eat a sufficient amount in one day to get all of the nutrients they needed .
For this reason , we had an extra set of molars to make the larger mouth more productive .
This was particularly essential as the body lacked the ability to sufficiently digest cellulose .
As evolution made its selections , our diets changed , our jaws grew appropriately smaller , and our third molars became unnecessary .
Some human populations have now all but completely stopped growing wisdom teeth , while others have almost 100 % likelihood of developing them .
Life can get pretty deep .

4 Third Eyelid
If you watch a cat blink , you will see a white membrane cross its eye – that is called its third eyelid .
It is quite a rare thing in mammals , but common in birds , reptiles , and fish .
Humans have a remnant ( but non-working ) third eyelid ( you can see it in the picture above ) .
It has become quite small in humans , but some populations have more visible portions than others .
There is only one known species of primate that still has a functioning third eyelid , and that is the Calabar angwantibo ( closely related to lorises ) which lives in West Africa .
3 Darwin’s Point plica semilunaris
Darwin ’s point is found in the majority of mammals , and humans are no exception .
It is most likely used to help focus sounds in animals , but it no longer has a function in humans .
Only 10.4 % of the human population still has this visible left - over mark of our past , but it is possible that a much larger number of people carry the gene that produces it as it does not always cause the ear tubercle to appear .
The point ( shown in the picture above ) is a small thick nodule at the junction of the upper and middle sections of the ear .
2 Coccyx
The coccyx is the remnant of what was once a human tail .
Over time we lost the need for a tail ( as tree swinging was replaced by hanging out at the local water hole grunting neanderthal gossip ) , but we did not lose the need for the coccyx : it now functions as a support structure for various muscles and a support for a person when he sits down and leans back .
The coccyx also supports the position of the anus .
1 Appendix
The appendix has no known use in modern humans and is often removed when it becomes infected .
While its original use is still speculated on , most scientists agree with Darwin ’s suggestion that it once helped to process the cellulose found in the leaf - rich diet that we once had .
Over the course of evolution , as our diet has changed , the appendix became less useful .
What is particularly interesting is that many evolutionary theorists believe that natural selection ( while removing all of the abilities of the appendix ) selects larger appendices because they are less likely to become inflamed and diseased .
So unlike the little toe , which may eventually vanish and is equally useless , the appendix is likely to stay with us for a long time – just hanging around doing nothing .
The following story is a potential fictional time line for the day the dollar died .
I hope not to instill fear or loathing but to give everyone some perspective on a POSSIBLE outcome which does not really take much of a reach to come to any conclusion .
Despite popular belief and promises from those who wish to rob you of your savings and investments , the collapse of the dollar might just be an event measured in hours , not days as their control is not what it seems .
Mike was less than an hour from home in Minnesota after dropping his load off in Fargo but knew he needed to top his tank off this Sunday evening to insure his rig would make it home .
He pulled into the Petro Truck Stop just outside of Fargo and hopped out of the cab into the bitter twenty below temperatures which he could not believe had already hit at ten oclock at night .
He slid his fuel card into the pump waiting for the next prompt when the SEE ATTENDANT  message flashed in the screen .
He blustered , figured it was another card problem and whipped out his Master Card and slid it in after the pump reset and again the SEE ATTENDANT  message flashed up .
 What the hell is going on ?  he thought to himself as he wandered into the long line of drivers boisterously yelling at managers and clerks alike .
Tom finished up his shift on the docks at the Nestle warehouse in Hampton , Georgia at exactly 11 oclock at night and decided that because of the scuttlebutt he had been reading on the message boards , it may not be a bad idea to pick up a few cans of food and some toilet paper at the local Wal - Mart Super center .
Even though it was a Sunday night , they were always stocked and it was just five minutes out of the way to his home .
As he walked inside the store , his mouth dropped .
It looked like the day after Thanksgiving sale with every register open and ten plus people deep at 11:30 p.m.  Oh my God !  he gasped as he walked in grabbing the last shopping cart with the wheel that was half locked up .
As he walked as fast as he could to the aisle with the paper goods , he looked at all the shelves then noticed the clerk who looked stunned himself .
 How in the SAM HELL does Wal - Mart sell out of Toilet Paper son ?  he screamed at the eighteen - year - old kid .
 Sir , I dont know what is going on .
Is the world ending ?
Im a little freaked out ! the clerk stammered .
Tom realized that he was not to blame and as he calmed down said to the kid  Son , I dont know what is going on either .
It must be an ice storm on the way .
Are you folks getting another truck soon ?
The clerk said in a very low voice  Sir , I think there are two coming at 2 a .m.
I would wait here if I were you .
With that information
Tom slinked outside to his car and called his wife at home just before midnight to tell her he would be staying to wait on the Wal - Mart trucks .

1730 ET February 21 , 2010
It was a typical Sunday night in my household , a tremendous dinner , nice weather in Florida and of course a chance to chat with my friends online about the events of the world .
The big news was that on Friday , February 19 , 2010 the US Dollar Index closed at 69.07 far below any level in history and of course shattering all known technical support .
As I grabbed a glass of Port and settled in front of my computer at 5 p.m. Eastern to watch the Asian fireworks and watch Bloomberg and CNBC - Asia on my computer , I noticed the Middle Eastern markets closed in horrid shape .
The Israeli market closed three hours after the open and down 22 % for the session .
The Saudi markets closed after one hour and down 41 % .
Other regional markets did not open or were shut down due to national emergency declarations .
As I tuned in expecting the usual repeat on Bloomberg , it was live with a somewhat excited news babe reading information from a blog reporting rumors  that the CEOs of Citigroup and Bank of America were in meetings since 11 a.m. with the New York Fed .
At that point , it was time to put the port up and break out the hard stuff .
Gold had closed at a record high again , up some $ 37 to finish Fridays session up at $ 1289 and change so I figured it would be jumping again with all of this worldly instability on display .
I searched the boards and feeds like mad , looking for anything on an Iranian attack or outbreak of war elsewhere in the world but nothing was found at all .
As 6 p.m. Eastern flipped up on my watch , CNBC interrupted their programming with a live update from New York instead of Australia or Tokyo about the meeting at the NY Fed .
Bloomberg also broke from their Asian coverage with a brief story but no details as to why there was a meeting today or who else was there .
As the New Zealand markets opened , the prices went nuts but shockingly to the upside .
Their markets shot up 11 % on the open to break over the 3900 price level but that was not the story .
As the futures opened in Chicago for the evening session , no matter where you were in the world that day or night , you printed that screen at 6:04 p.m.
Eastern time as the prints were staggering :
Gold UP $ 212.15 to $ 1501.15
Silver UP $ 39.13 to $ 81.06
US DOLLAR INDEX DOWN 9.5869 or just over 14 % to 59.4830
US S&P FUTURES DOWN 49.13
US DOW FUTURES DOWN 472
NASDAQ FUTURES DOWN 135
Holy Smokes !
This was an absurd way to start the night and my phone started ringing along with text messages and emails out my wazoo .
The sense of panic was evident on Bernie Los face as he came on to the air discussing what was happening in the futures market and fortunately he announced that Jim Rogers would be joining him after the next break .
As the commercial started at 6:09 p.m.
Eastern the scroll at the bottom of the screen was bright red with the headline :
ALL U.S. EQUITY FUTURES ARE LOCK LIMIT DOWN .
TRADING SUSPENDED UNTIL 0900 ET MONDAY FEB 22 .US DOLLAR BEING SOLD ACROSS THE BOARD
By 6:15 the Euro was trading at $ 1.92 , the Kiwi ( New Zealand Dollar ) at $ 1.26 , the Aussie Dollar well beyond par at $ 1.39 and the Canadian Loonie rocketing past par to $ 1.33 .
The U.S. Dollar was in a full - fledged collapse and the world was putting money anywhere they could to escape the carnage .
As the New Zealand equity markets struggled to handle the order flow an announcement emerged at 6:27 p.m.
Eastern time that they would no longer accept U.S. dollars within their nation for the next 72 hours until the United States Federal Reserve Bank introduced stability measures .
That instantly turned a huge move to the upside to down 17 % in less than three minutes and soon thereafter , trading was suspended by 7 p.m. Eastern time .
Instead of waiting to see what was next , I left at 6:51 p.m. to run down the street and take $ 500 from the local grocery store ATM , returning just in time for the top - of - the - hour news .
1900 ET
The Australian markets attempted to open but due to order imbalances they were delayed twenty - seven minutes .
It was a buying frenzy in Australia also as the Aussie Dollar was skyrocketing higher and gold continued to gain , now up $ 273.20 per ounce in less than two hours of trading .
The Chicago board was going to make a statement at 8 p.m. ET and the world was holding its collective breath because something bad was happening again in the United States and everyone wanted to buy into foreign markets to escape the American disaster on the horizon .
After a brief opening , the Australian government followed suit with the New Zealand announcement and suspended acceptance of the U.S. Dollar for commerce until further notice .
The Japanese were very quiet in the mean time as they announced at 7 p.m. they would keep their markets closed but the huge move in the Yen caused massive concerns as noted by the central bank .
The yen appreciated from a close of 79.8213 on Friday the 19th to an opening of 48.7326 in less than an hour of trading .
Nobody wanted dollars and even fewer people it was discovered wanted the British Pound .
The Pound for the first time in its history was worth less than 100 yen and it was well on its way to joining the US Dollar in a death spiral .

2000 ET
The internet is crawling .
Message boards were lit up with record numbers of participants .
Rumors swirled about declarations of martial law , bank holidays , secret wars and other crazy things .
Yet my phone messages , conversations , texts and emails told me there was something very very wrong .
Two of my friends called me to tell me the consequences of the failed 30 - year - bond auction last Thursday came home to roost over the weekend .
Citi and BoA were rumored to have a huge CDS obligation due to the interest rates being blown outside of the norm and the 6.05 % yield from the auction cost the banks an estimated $ 400 billion each if they were forced to settle open swap contracts and derivative issues by Monday or the end of the month .
The swaps and derivatives which were to prevent the collapse may actually have finally started it but nobody could verify anything that was happening as the NY Fed looked like a war zone with hundreds of cameras around the building and reporters speculating endlessly on every cable channel .
2100 ET
I did not know who to believe but when Bloomberg played the excerpt from Jim Rogers  interview just after the top of the hour where he said  this is what a currency collapse looks like and if you were not prepared , you were wiped out  really resonated with everyone on the Bloomberg set and throughout the news worldwide .
The Chicago Futures were closed by order of the CFTC and SEC and that was the big announcement but it was assumed anyways because there was no way the COMEX or anyone else could possibly have kept up with the demand for precious metals as the last print had gold over $ 1579 per ounce and worse , the base metals closing at obscene prices like $ 6.79 per lb. for copper !
The Shanghai markets were ordered open for domestic participants only and no overseas selling was allowed nor trading in US Dollars thus allowing the communists to manage their banking situation without outside influence .
Unfortunately a rumor was confirmed on FNC later in the hour that Chinese troops were deployed to all U.S. and British bank branches inside their nation .
That only permeated the panic already felt on the internet and in the air .
The news at the top of the hour was even more shocking .
2200 ET
CNN led the hour off with coverage of the FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2010 ?
with breaking news about two hedge fund managers committing suicide in their offices in New York .
That did not help the confidence level nor did the statement from Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner at 10:09 p.m.
Eastern that the government was in full control of the situation and that the panic world wide was unwarranted .
When he finished the statement assuring that the financial markets would probably open on time in the morning , the snicker from CNBCs team of Gasparino and Griffith spoke volumes about what was really occurring .
2300 ET
Somehow a picture of Goldman Sachs CEO Blankfein and JP Morgans CEO Jamie Dimon entering the New York Federal Reserve building was leaked out and broadcast on cable news and financial news outlets causing more discussions and a genuine sense of panic to grip everyone .
Reports about credit cards not working for the last two hours nationwide were swamping the newsrooms but no comments from VISA , Master Charge or anyone else was forthcoming .
0000 ET February 22 , 2010
It was officially a panic .
Reports on local news stations about grocery store shelves being cleaned out and ATM machines running out of money hours ago and not being refilled were broadcast nationwide .
Even my local station had a story about accessing the reporters bank account online and all they got was a very scary message as they attempted to reach his banks web page :
404-NOT FOUND
0100 ET
WWOR and WCBS started reporting that gas stations in the New York City and northern New Jersey areas were running out of gas even though credit cards did not work .
The cable news stations and financial news networks just recycled earlier news with updates at the top of the hour .
The world markets were closed and everyone was holding their breath to see what happened the next morning .
0200 ET
As I struggled to stay awake , NY Federal Reserve President Denis Hughes came to the microphones with Dimon , Blankfein and shockingly Ben Bernanke .
Hughes immediately deferred to Bernanke who said that the President would address the nation at 7 a.m.
Eastern Time and that he felt the crisis was averted for the moment and that everyone should have faith in the United States policy of a strong currency and banking system .
After that statement was concluded , Bloomberg switched to a banking analyst from Singapore who said that the U.S. was now a hulking smoking black hole in the ground and the only thing it was good for was to return those worthless dollars back to THAT  nation so THEY  could burn them to stay warm this winter .
0300 ET
Someone on the message board posted a story from WTOP that military police were seen setting up roadblocks throughout Washington , D.C.
There was no video or other confirmation within that hour .
I had to make double strength coffee at that point in time but instead set my alarm for 0500 to try to grab a nap .
I was not about to miss what was going to be a day to remember in American history .

0509 ET
So sue me !
I hit my snooze button then realized I fell asleep with the computer and television on and the news was flying .
In big bold red at the top of CNBCs screen was the announcement COUNTDOWN TO SPEECH and a counter moving towards 0700 Eastern .
As I flipped the channels half awake , I noticed a BREAKING NEWS announcement on CNN and there was a feed from WSB in Atlanta , GA with their helicopter video of the Georgia State Patrol closing off all streets within three blocks of the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta and also around the Federal Home Loan Bank .
That sent a chill down my spine as I flipped back on to the computer to see over two hundred unread emails and message upon message about shortages , internet outages , credit card problems and worst of all , gas stations running out of fuel .
The other shocker was the suspension of international flights in many U.S. cities as the suppliers put every airline on C.O.D. effective immediately at 2:30 a.m. Eastern Time and that suspended a ton of flights inside the United States and worldwide .
The cascading effects were stunning , even to those of us who were warning about it .
0530 ET
Several European markets attempted to open in coordination with Middle Eastern markets but the declines were so severe that within ten minutes of trading the authorities shut them all down within a half hour :
Russia  35 %
Saudi Arabia  43 %
Israel  22 %
Switzerland  17 %
Germanys DAX  41 %
CAC 40  29 %
FTSE 100  32 %
The Euro was up another 10 % against the dollar and the Swiss Franc was now worth over $ 1.40 U.S .
As the discussions about the problems with the U.S. dollar accelerated , banks were being shut down in Europe in nation after nation to prevent runs .
Sadly for the Brits , the Sterling was now trading so poorly in Europe that it was worth just 1/3 of a Euro at some trading desks .
By the top of the hour , video of riots in front of banks in Frankfurt and Glasgow were broadcast nationwide .
At 5:55 a.m . Eastern the news took a dark turn with this BREAKING NEWS headline :
OBAMA AND BERNANKE TO SPEAK TO THE NATION AT 6 A.M. EST
0600 ET
The speech was low key , solemn and to the point .
Obama announced a one - week bank holiday .
All credit card transactions and all collection actions of any sort were hereby suspended for seven days .
All financial markets were closed until further notice .
All mortgage and bill payment due dates were suspended for thirty days and no past due notices nor penalties were to be allowed by Federal Law .
All schools were closed for seventy - two hours be they public or private .
The city of Washington , D.C. was hereby declared to be under a state of martial law and all citizens were ordered to observe a curfew from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. daily .
Just as that sunk in , Ben Bernanke stepped up to the microphone to announce that President Obama , Treasury Secretary Geithner and all of the Federal Reserve Presidents along with himself were going to depart for Geneva for an emergency meeting of the G - 20 , IMF , World Bank and United Nations Financial Stability Working Group .
Bernanke also announced that Citigroup , N.A. and Bank of America were hereby nationalized and placed under control of the United States Treasury under the auspices of the FDIC and that Sheila Bair would have an announcement at 8 a.m. Eastern .
As he finished the announcement , an obviously exhausted Federal Reserve Chairman concluded by assuring the citizens of the nation that a stable currency was their only goal from this meeting of world financial leaders .
I noted he did not say what currency though he was referring to .

By now , CNBC , Fox Business and Bloomberg were knee deep in wall - to - wall coverage but so were the broadcast and cable networks .
America was on the brink was the preaching and screaming and the bulls  were being gored by the permabears every time they uttered any statements about how weve been through worse  etc. , etc .
The announcement of the seizure by the FDIC of two of the largest banks in the world was pretty standard and short .
The follow up statement by Ms. Barr though is what caused every newsroom to take pause when she stated that further consolidations will be announced in the next seventy - two hours . 
The Bubblemedia was stunned and even shocked when Canada announced that they would attempt to open their financial markets for two hours of trading and that their banks would be open for normal domestic customers and business from 10 a.m. until noon Eastern time .
Everyone on television looked at each other and just asked  How ? 
0900 ET
I had forgotten to call in sick to work but then again the phone call from the company owner was pretty much a well now what  as we laughed in a gallows humor discussion .
He understood why I was home and he had already told the employees that he was closing at noon and would reopen when we could actually collect real money on what we sold and leased out .
I told him I would call him at home later or meet him with a bottle on the golf course in the morning , weather permitting .
The chilling video of the Federal Reserve heads , Geithner and Obama boarding Air Force One to leave for Geneva from Washington , D.C. really had an impact on me .
1000 ET
The Canadian markets opened up 10 % in ten minutes then rolled over down 31 % by 10:30 .
The scary part was that the Canadian dollar kept on rising even though commodity trading was suspended and everyone was wondering just what gold would be priced at if the markets were allowed to trade .
As the day wore on , it was a blur of shocking story after shocking story .
The President and his entourage arrived in Switzerland along with other world leaders but little was discussed or disclosed .
The reports of banks being fire bombed by nuts throughout parts of the U.S. made the international news and caused all of us to feel somewhat uncomfortable as to what was next .
The 8 p.m. interruption of normal prime time programming with a FEMA NEWS ALERT which lasted ten minutes and was repeated at the top of every hour with little if any information caused even more panic in the masses .
Today I watched our dollar die in a matter of hours even though I knew how it was killed months if not years ago .
I just wondered how bad the announcement out of Geneva was going to be as our bankers and politicians sold our souls out to save their rear ends .
I also wondered if I would ever sleep again .

Lauren Johnson has got a wicked case of the sniffles .
( foxnews.com )
" irretractable psychogenic disorder , " and caused by stress .
Still , with only 40 cases documented in the world , it 's a rare problem that does n't seem to have easy solutions .
Johnson does get a little bit of respite .
When she sleeps and enters into REM sleep , she apparently stop sneezing .
You can see a video of Johnson on NBC's Today show below :
That 's a whole lotta Kleenex .
Lauren Johnson is a 12 - year - old girl who says she just cannot stop sneezing .
The middle schooler caught a cold two weeks ago , and can't seem to shake the urge to sneeze , saying she can sneeze up to 12,000 times a day .
Doctors call the condition " machine gun sneezing . "
Johnson , who has been unable to attend school due to the sneezing , has visited six doctors seeking a cure for the non -stop sneezing , with no results so far .
One doctor thinks Johnson 's unique symptoms could be a case of

( PhysOrg.com ) --
The timing of molar emergence and its relation to growth and reproduction in apes is being reported by two scientists at Arizona State University 's Institute of Human Origins in the Dec. 28 online early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
From the smallest South American monkeys to the largest African apes , the timing of molar development and eruption is closely attuned to many fundamental aspects of a primate 's biology , according to Gary Schwartz , a researcher at the Institute of Human Origins and an associate professor in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change in ASU 's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences .
" Knowing the age when the first molar appears in the mouths of most primates allows researchers to predict a host of life history attributes , such as gestation length , age at sexual maturity , birth spacing , and overall lifespan .
Humans are unique among primates because our life histories are so slow and thus our molars emerge relatively late .
Given that apes are our closest living relatives , understanding the broader context of when the characteristic slower development of humans evolved is of great interest , " Schwartz explains .
" We 've known quite a bit about the timing of molar development in chimpanzees , which is important because they are our closest living relative .
However , we 've known virtually nothing about when this important event occurs in other wild - living ape species - until now , " says lead author Jay Kelley , a research affiliate at ASU 's Institute of Human Origins and an associate professor in the Department of Oral Biology at the University of Illinois , Chicago .
Because of the difficulties in obtaining tooth emergence ages from animals in the wild , Kelley opted for other means ; he searched for specimens in museums .
At the Zoologische Staatssammlung in Munich he found skulls of a wild - shot orangutan ( Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus ) and gorilla ( Gorilla gorilla gorilla ) that preserved emerging first molars .
" Like annual growth rings inside trees , the cells that produce teeth ( both the enamel and underlying dentine ) leave behind a trace of their presence , not as annual markers , but as growth lines that appear every day , " says Kelley .
By slicing the teeth in half , he and Schwartz were able to examine these incremental growth lines in ape individuals that died as their first molars were just erupting into their mouths .
" Because teeth preserve this phenomenal internal chronometer , we were able to count up how many days it took the first molars to form .
In apes and monkeys , first molars start forming very close to the time of birth .
As the first molars were still erupting in our specimens , development was incomplete and the final growth line was laid down on the day those animals died .
Therefore , by counting backwards from the final growth line to the day of birth , we determined their age at death and thus the age at which that molar was erupting " says Schwartz .
Using this novel approach , the two scientists were able to mark the age of the gorilla 's first molar emergence at 3.8 years , nearly identical to that of a wild chimpanzee's .
The orangutan's age at first molar emergence was surprisingly much later , at 4.6 years , which falls closer to the age of approximately 6 years in modern humans .
" We were excited to discover this much older age for the orangutan , since orangutans have much slower life histories than the other two great apes , " says Kelly .
However , he and Schwartz caution that though the later emergence age in these large Asian apes is closer to that for modern humans , these latest findings should not be taken to indicate some special evolutionary relationship between the two .
" Rather , it is in keeping with what you would expect given the relatively slow pace of growth and long period of infant dependency that evolved separately in the lineage leading to orangutans and that leading to modern humans , " says Schwartz .
The work by Kelley and Schwartz also has implications for understanding the evolution of human life history .
" We can use the same techniques to calculate ages at first molar emergence from the fossils of early hominids that just happened to die while their first molars were erupting , " says Kelley .
" The close correspondence between age at first molar emergence and the timing of life history events that we found in great apes and modern humans means that we can have confidence that first molar emergence ages in the early hominids will provide equally accurate knowledge about their life histories . "
Their findings are detailed in the article " Dental development and life history in living African and Asian apes . "

We joined the U.S. Foreign Service nearly 40 years ago in the same entering class , but we took very different paths to get there .
One of us grew up amid hardship and segregation in the Deep South , the first in her family to graduate from high school , a Black woman joining a profession that was still very male and very pale .
The other was the product of an itinerant military childhood that took his family from one end of the United States to the other , with a dozen moves and three high schools by the time he was 17 .
There were 32 of us in the Foreign Service ’s class of January 1982 .
It was an eclectic group that included former Peace Corps volunteers , military veterans , a failed rock musician , and an ex–Catholic priest .
None of us retained much from the procession of enervating speakers describing their particular islands in the great archipelago of U.S. foreign policy .
What we did learn early on , and what stayed true throughout our careers , is that smart and sustained investment in people is the key to good diplomacy .
Well - intentioned reform efforts over the years were crippled by faddishness , budgetary pressures , the over - militarization of foreign policy , the State Department ’s lumbering bureaucracy , a fixation on structure , and — most of all — inattention to people .

Do we have biases on collections ?
After writing the post about when your collection becomes clutter , I ’ve kept wandering back to my earlier post about Kyoichi Tsuzuki ’s Happy Victims exhibition , because he has said some pretty profound things that made me re-evaluate my perceptions .
In particular this paragraph has been sticking to me :
I do n’t want to say it ’s stupid , but imagine it : A very small room , the person does n’t have a lot of money but they spend all their money on books , and they fill their small room with books , you would n’t say they ’re stupid .
Right ?
But a small room filled with Comme des Garçons , looks really stupid , no ?
That is our prejudice — that the person who spends all their money on books looks better than the person with Comme des Garçons .
There ’s a hierarchy : Books have the highest position , then records , and fashion is kind of on the bottom .
But it ’s all the same .
It ’s how your passion flows .
So I started looking at collections of books people have at home in their personal libraries and in particular , how they displayed them
“ Home Library cost : $ 110,000 ” — Source : BusinessWeek
Eva Designs
Those libraries look elegant , refined , and spacious .
One might even call it minimalist , with the lack of frills around the area .
But in essence , it ’s just space taken up to store STUFF , all the books that have been collected over the years , and surely read & beloved by the family .
However if we look at someone spending money on clothes or something less - than - equal in our eyes , we feel as though it is a waste of money .
$ 6500 Closet
$ 18,000 Closet
“ A $ 40,000 home for your clothes ” — Source : BusinessWeek
And the above pictures look like a waste of money to many , and a waste of space .
I mean , really , a whole room for shoes & clothes ?
Yet , they are both collections .
Those clothes and shoes have been in essence , collected and stored over the years , surely beloved & used by the family ( or one girl ?
I do n’t know ) .
It is because books are considered a worthy pursuit of academics .
Never mind that your library is mostly filled with Japanese manga or books about vampires or love stories .
It is a far better thing to be enamoured with the written word and to display it , rather than to be in love with wearing different shoes and making up different outfits .
Right ?
Regardless of how you rank the different types of collections , we can all benefit from Concojones ’ comment :
You ’re right that not all collectors are hoarders , but even a devoted collector can benefit from applying the 80/20 principle to their collection : only keep the nicest pieces and give them your full attention .
3 things I learned from Tsuzuki :
1. Collections in my eyes , HAD been ranked before
I had previously felt guilty for collecting jewelery , until I realized that it was my passion & I ’d rather borrow books instead of owning them .
2. Collections are possessions of a similar nature that you are proud to display and cherish
If it is n’t worthy to you , to cherish and display your collections , then it is just clutter .
And as commented above , apply the 80/20 principle and only keep your favourite pieces to give them your full attention .
3 . Do n’t collect items just for their perceived image
Posted by John , December 20th , 2009 - under United States , US imperialism .
Tags : China , Chinese imperialism , Copenhagen , Copenhagen climate summit , Global economy , Global Warming , Globalisation
You can only understand the failure of Copenhagen by understanding imperialism .
Imperialism is primarily the rivalry between major powers like the US and China .
As a subset of this competition these powerful nations subjugate weaker ones economically , politically and militarily .
Since the collapse of the state capitalist regimes in Eastern Europe and the USSR , and the elimination of Russian imperialism as a competitor , the US has been the dominant economic and military power around the world .
The shift by Deng Xiao Ping from state capitalism to market capitalism ( or more accurately state controlled market capitalism ) has created China as a competitor to American economic dominance and over time to US military dominance .
When Marx was writing , the colonial period – the time when capitalism expanded around the globe – still existed but was coming to an end .
The first world war ushered in the era of imperialism ( although socialists like Lenin and Bukharin had identified its essence before then . )
In essence their ideas about imperialism can be summarised as the centralisation of capital and the internationalisation of production .
A century later and that concentration and internationalisation are so much deeper and intense .
By the beginning of the 20th century the division of the world had become complete and there was no room for the expansion of German capitalism outside its borders ( apart from a few more or less minor colonies ) except by military means against its main competitors – Great Britain , and increasingly the United States .
The first and second world wars were examples of the imperialist battle to re-divide the world .
The present period resembles the world before the first world war .
American imperialism stands triumphant .
Yet it faces the growing strength of China , a growing strength that eventually will challenge US economic and political dominance , and ultimately military dominance .
US capitalism at home is in a poor state .
It has massive debts that fund its military adventures in places like Afghanistan and Iraq and give it the wherewithal to man US bases in over 100 countries around the world .
These adventures are not about terrorism or democracy or women ’s rights .
They are about cornering China .
The US economy remains stagnant , a situation that in part has been arrested by close economic relationships with China .
China has become not only a supplier of cheap consumer goods to the US but also a profitable playpen for sections of the American bourgeoisie .
Further Chinese and Middle Eastern oil money has been an important part of the financial stabilisation that has enabled the US economy to stave off a possible banking system collapse .
The US response to the growth of Chinese capitalism has been both to encircle and integrate it .
The Chinese response appears to be a growing assertion of influence over its immediate region and attempts to expand into less developed areas like Africa and occasionally challenge the US .
This creeping imperialism will grow stronger as the Chinese economy grows stronger .
Any actions of the US and China have to be seen through the prism of imperialist competition .
Their slow tango of death is nowhere more evident than in Copenhagen .
The final report merely said that nations would take action to limit global warming to 2 degrees centigrade .
Goodbye Tuvalu .
Goodbye Bangladesh .
A non-binding , non-targeted piece of poly waffle is what both United States imperialism ( as historically the world ’s biggest polluter ) and Chinese imperialism ( about to become the world ’s biggest polluter ) wanted , to protect and extend their own power .
Both see their future dominance as threatened by any agreement which does not limit the power of the other .
They are not just climate change do - nothings .
Their game of environmental imperialism is a systemic response to the very way their economies and the world economy are organised .
So they came up with platitudes about taking measures to stop the climate warming more than 2 degrees centigrade .
They forgot the apple pie and mom and its Chinese equivalents .
Such an agreement is like peace dealings before war – so much paper .
The systemic drive to dominance of each version of capitalism would render even a binding deep targets agreement worthless because both imperialist nations fear it would challenge their future dominance – almost ‘ environmental peace in our time ’ .
Like colonialists and imperialists dividing up Africa , South America , Asia and the Middle East , the aim of the US and China in Copenhagen was for them to divide the world among themselves , but in mutually exclusive terms of benefit to one or the other .
As a generalisation China , the faux friend , had the support of the developing countries , the US of its usual allies , apart from Europe .
Of course , China cares nothing for the G77 developing nations .
As the second most powerful imperialist nation on the earth , it cares only for extending and deepening its economic power around the globe .
To stop the polluters destroying our earth will require the overthrow of Chinese and American imperialism .
The working class in both countries has the historic duty to save the planet by destroying their imperialist overlords .
The first step in a world free from imperialism and anthropogenic global warming is organising in our own countries to build a democratic mass movement for action now to combat global warming .
For whatever reason , I can't help but continually muse over the myriad unfulfilled promises generated by the software engineering , research and development communities over the past few decades plus , the duration of my own involvement .
Coming out of Boston in the mid-to - late ' 80's , there 's a veritable laundry list of AI and then OOP associated promises of software heaven as yet unfulfilled .
I think of the " formal methodologies " craze going back to the early 70's and my father 's day up through , say , the earlier part of this decade .
( While I do anachronistically find Jackson 's now " outdated " books still full of well written problem solving wisdom , I do n't see so many flowcharts , or object hierarchy , or object state or data flow diagrams these days . )
And on a very related note , whatever became of the relatively bright promise of software construction via specification , and ( IMHO ) relatively lovely specification notations such as Z ?
Whatever came of Gelertner 's vision of massive , distributed tuple spaces , ( or Jini for that matter ) fronted by advanced data visualization on every desktop ?
Where are our catalogs , commercial or otherwise , of plugable " software components ? "
Why is " SETI at Home , " of all the possible application domains , still probably the best known and most widely disseminated example of massively distributed computing ( if I have my terminology right ) ?
And on and on ....
So I 'm very curious .
What are the unfulfilled software technology promises most noteworthy to LTU members ?
And just as important , which of these were but ill conceived pipe dreams ?
But at the same time , which of these promises of yore might still warrant fulfillment with further time , effort and research ?

The latest Rasmussen Poll has disastrous news for Republicans -- and disquieting news for for the rest of us too :
In a three - way Generic Ballot test , the latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds Democrats attracting 36 % of the vote .
The Tea Party candidate picks up 23 % , and Republicans finish third at 18 % .
Another 22 % are undecided .
Among voters not affiliated with either major party , the Tea Party comes out on top .
Thirty - three percent ( 33 % ) prefer the Tea Party candidate , and 30 % are undecided .
Twenty - five percent ( 25 % ) would vote for a Democrat , and just 12 % prefer the GOP .
The look on Eric Bolling 's face , filling in for Neil Cavuto yesterday on Fox News , contemplating this news said it all :
He thought the Tea Party and Republicans were one and the same thing !
In fact , he spills as much :
Bolling : Is n't the tea party just another wing of the Republican Party ? ...
Are n't we just splitting the party ?
Well , not exactly .
Like Republicans , the Tea Party folks are fervently anti-Obama .
But as Republicans like Lindsey Graham are discovering , the Tea Partiers are so arch - conservative they hate BOTH parties , and consider Republicans to be sellouts of their true - blue conservative ideals .
Now , this may appear to be good news for Democrats , since it means the Right is splitting its vote .
And over the short term , as we saw in the NY - 23 race , it may well be .
But there is an ominous quality to this that should be disturbing to everyone .
The GOP thought it could unleash this tide of right - wing populism and prosper -- but are discovering that it 's not such an easy thing to control .
And what they 're unleashing is a flood of right - wing extremism in the process .
Because as the " Tea Party " gathering we saw this past weekend in Spokane made crystal - clear , the " Tea Parties " are one of the most massive conduits for mainstreaming extremist beliefs in our history :
More than 1,000 people , including local sheriffs , state representatives , lawyers , families and blue - collar workers , gathered in Post Falls last month to hear a former Arizona sheriff blast the federal government .
About 500 met last week in another event organized by the Campaign for Liberty – a coalition of about 10 Inland Northwest groups hoping to create a forum to share ideas and create a louder voice in politics .
Some are n’t afraid to use the word militia .
“ We need to rob that word back from the people who villainize it , ” said Schaeffer Cox , a 25 - year - old from Fairbanks , Alaska , eliciting a roar of approval from the crowd in Post Falls Wednesday night .
It was the second Freedom Festival held at the Post Falls Greyhound Park – evidence , some say , of a new rise of the militia movement in America , but one that blurs the line between extremism and mainstream .
...
Wednesday ’s meeting was the first event locally since the large gathering on Veterans Day for a speech by Richard Mack , a man described by Potok ’s organization as “ an iconic hero of the militia movement . ”
Mack wrote a book with Randy Weaver in the 1990s about the federal siege at Ruby Ridge and was part of a successful lawsuit against the Clinton administration challenging sweeping gun control legislation .
Mack was joined at the Post Falls event by Washington state Rep. Matt Shea and Idaho state Rep. Phil Hart .
County sheriffs were invited to dine with Mack before his speech .
Spokane County Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich missed most of the dinner but said he enjoyed Mack ’s speech .
“ I did n’t hear hate .
I heard the exact opposite , ” Knezovich said .
“ I heard respect .
Respect for states , respect for individual rights , for the job of the sheriff . ”
Knezovich said he received more invitations to Mack ’s speech than any other event since he was elected sheriff in fall 2006 .
Everywhere he went , it seemed , people asked if he planned to go .
“ I thought to myself , ‘ If that many people would like me to attend this event , I ’ll do that , ’ ” Knezovich said .
Mack has long been a speaker on the constitutionalist circuit , gaining fame in the militia movement in the 1990s .
“ There ’s really a remarkable amount of anger out there that this movement reflects , ” Potok said .
Still , Potok added , “ it ’s a little shocking that Richard Mack , given his ideas , could draw such a large crowd , including so many public officials . ”
When you have law - enforcement officials and state legislators showing up to support citizen militias and " oath keepers " who believe the federal government is about to swoop down in black helicopters and round up citizens to imprison them in concentration camps ...
Well , that 's a problem for everyone .
It 's like the 1990s on steroids .
Back then , it produced a notable spate of domestic terrorism .
This time around , with so many more people being successfully recruited , one can only imagine the violence that awaits us all .
Ben Goldacre , Saturday 7 November 2009 , The Guardian
Obviously it ’s pleasing to see , in the storm of commentary over Professor Nutt ’s sacking , that everyone outside of politics now recognises the importance of scientific evidence in devising laws .
But a strange reasoning twitch has appeared , in the arguments of politicians and right wing commentators .
Science can tell us about the molecules , they say , about their effect on the body , and the risks .
But policy is a separate domain : a matter for judgement calls on social and ethical issues .
Only politicians , they say , can determine the correct way to send out a clear message to the public .
It is not a matter for science .
Interestingly this is wrong .
Alongside research into the risks of drugs , lots of research has also been done examining the deterrent impact of different laws , classifications , and levels of enforcement .
Since every piece of research has its own imperfections ( and nobody has yet conducted a randomised controlled trial on drugs policy ) you can make your own mind up about whether you find this research compelling .
One strategy is to compare different countries .
A World Health Organisation study from 2008 , published in the academic journal PLOS Medicine , compared drug use and enforcement regimes around the globe .
It was clear : “ globally , drug use is not distributed evenly and is not simply related to drug policy , since countries with stringent user - level illegal drug policies did not have lower levels of use than countries with liberal ones . ”
Alternatively you can compare drug use between states within one country , if they have very different enforcement regimes , as happened when some parts of the US liberalised their laws a few decades ago .
In 1976 Stuart and colleagues found that cannabis use in Ann Arbor , Michigan , was n’t affected by reductions in cannabis penalties , when compared with three neighbouring communities which kept penalties the same .
In 1981 Saveland & Bray looked at national drug use surveys from 1972 to 1977 and found that cannabis use was higher in the ‘ decriminalised ’ states , both before and after the changes in law , and when they looked at rates of change , although cannabis use was increasing everywhere , the most rapid increase was actually in the states with the most severe penalties .
In the same year Johnson and colleagues used survey data on high school use and found decriminalisation had no effect on attitudes or beliefs about drugs .
These studies are old , of course , but only because the liberalisations in the law which they rely on for data happened a long time ago .
Another line of evidence comes from “ before and after ” studies , when laws are changed .
Cannabis use in the UK dropped , of course , after cannabis was moved from class B to class C. Prohibition of alcohol in the USA from 1920 to 1933 is the most famous example : here , alcohol use fell dramatically when prohibition began , and the price of alcohol rose to 318 % of its previous level .
But by 1929 , this initial impact had begun to wear off , and rapidly : alcohol consumption had risen to 70 % of pre-prohibition levels , was still rising when prohibition was repealed , and the price had fallen to only 171 % of pre-prohibition levels .
Notably , this reversion to old patterns of use occurred despite escalating expenditure on enforcement , which rose by 600 % over the same period .
There are many more examples .
This is not an unresearchable question .
It is clear that there are many other factors at play in all of these studies , and if they are not sufficiently rigorous for the government , or a brief informal dip into the literature is not enough ( it should n’t be ) then they should commission more formal research : because it is a basic tenet of evidence based policy that if you discover a gap , you flag it up , and commission more work to fill it .
This is important for one simple reason .
If you wish to justify a policy that will plainly increase the harms associated with each individual act of drug use , by creating violent criminal gangs as distributors , driving the sale of contaminated black market drugs , blighting the careers of users caught by the police , criminalising 3 million people , and so on , then people will reasonably expect , as a trade - off , that you will also provide good quality evidence showing that your policy achieves its stated aim of reducing the overall numbers of people using drugs .
Conde Nast CEO
Charles Townsend said Monday he was shutting down four magazines , including the awarding winning Gourmet , parenthood title Cookie and two of the company ’s bridal magazines , Modern Bride and Elegant Bride .
It was the biggest one - day bloodbath in the publishing company ’s 100 - year history .
Hundreds of people will be tossed out of work .
The company said it would keep the Gourmet cookbooks and television programming but shut the monthly magazine .
Bride ’s , the last surviving bridal book , will move to monthly from six times a year .
Industry sources had estimated that Conde Nast could lose $ 200 million this year .
The closings come after the management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. completed a three - month study of the American magazine publishing giant that is headed by billionaire chairman S.I.
Newhouse , Jr. , and is part of his family ’s Advance Publications empire .
In the memo released to staffers this morning , Townsend said :
“ We have now completed an extensive review of our business — an important undertaking given the dramatic changes in the U.S. economy .
The review has led us to a number of decisions designed to navigate the company through the economic downturn and to position us to take advantage of coming opportunities .
“ Condé Nast ’s success comes from the ability of our publications to attract readers with a wide range of interests , as well as advertisers who value them .
But in this economic climate it is important to narrow our focus to titles with the greatest prospects for long - term growth . ”
Survival during the civil war in Tajikistan ( former USSR )
Hi !
I promised to write about survival during the civil war .
I was a little busy , so it took a long time .
I would be glad if I can help people who want to survive during the crisis .
You can answer me at the following addresses tornado_ii@mail.tj , bda@broen.ru , bda@broen.com .
I like your site !
Good luck .
The Soviet Union this is not Russia .
And Russia is not only Saberia , balalayka , vodka and very cold climat .
But it seems many people in the world ( particularly in the U.S. ) think so .
Recently I saw a clip on MTV , where it all happened .
Vodka , balalayka , bears , snow , and a Russian general in the tank :)
See this clip - Basement Jaxx - Take Me Back To Your House ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLeOiDF99Yo).USSR was Federation of the 15 republics .
Many republics of the USSR were also federations .
For example , full title main republic of USSR was Russian Federal Socialist Republic .
Of course , many issues were resolved only central government in Moscow .
But there were many issues , in which the central government did not intervene .
Tajikistan was the smallest Soviet republic .
But a little republic - does not mean backward republic .
I lived in the city of Dushanbe , the Tajik capital .
This is a large European city ( about 1,000,000 inhabitants ) , which is home to 1 / 5 the population of Tajikistan .
All this I wrote that in the Soviet Union lived by ordinary people .
Like you .
They little was thought about politics .
They little was think about religion .
Not because people were not allowed to think about politics or religion .
Not at all .
Just a few people interested about it .
Even now in the former Soviet republics , now independent states of the people are indifferent to religion .
But things quickly changed .
Very strange that yesterday you were living in one country , but today this country is not .
But there are 15 new independent countries .
At first time , nothing has changed .
The Sun just shone .
The sky remained blue .
On the streets riding the same cars , buses .
Nothing has changed .
But suddenly on TV , radio and newspapers began to talk a lot about Islam .
On TV started showing news and films from Iran .
In the news on TV women were dressed in black hijab .
Only black hijab .
Only identical black clothes .
The Iranian films is were only on a religious theme .
In the streets beganto appear strange young men .
They dressed like people in Afghanistan .
And these people to spoke : do n't wear European clothes .
On lampposts in streets have been established loudspeakers , which 5 times a day transmit appeal for a Mohammedan prayer .
It seemed to me that I am in Afghanistan or Iran .
Russian on the streets began to cry - you go to Russia .
Or do not go away , to be our slaves .
But this is my city .
I was born here !
And my parents were born here .
I do not want to go anywhere .
Can not say that these situation liked everything .
While the streets were quiet , and the government preferred to do nothing against these people .
But it was not very smart idea .
Many people were against a secular government .
These people wanted Islamic government .
Islamic government as in Iran .
Or as in neighboring Afghanistan .
And these people have organized a big demonstration in the city center .
Thousands of people were shouting - freedom !
We do not want communism !
We need democracy and freedom !
And we want Islamic government .
The government could not suppress the antigovernment demonstration .
In another place , it organized a demonstration of his supporters .
Almost a month thousands of people were on the two main squares .
In islamic square the idea of democracy and freedom have forgotten .
And only shouted - islam , the Islamic Republic !
In another square the people shouted - not an Islamic republic !
But what about the other people in the city ?
They also gather in the square .
And on this square the people shouting - islamists , go away !
The Communists , go away !
All go home !
But reasonable people no one heard .
The government gave weapons to its supporters .
The Islamists have distributed weapons to its people .
To understand , who the enemy , islamic militants used on clothes and cars white tapes , and their opponents used red tapes .
For example , the militant in clothes with a red tape is the communist , the militant in clothes with a white tape is islamic militant .
All people in two squares go crazy .
On the streets stolen cars were traveling at high speed , in which armed men were sitting .
On islamist cars - white flags .
On communist cars - red flags .
The police do nothing .
The government is silent .
On the streets only people with red or white flags .
And they kill each other .
On the streets of the puddles of blood , lying dead people .
And on TV only Indian films .
And the concerts of national music .
On radio - only music .
No information in TV and radio , only films and music .
Why the government was powerlessly ?
Simply nobody in government and in police was not ready for real independence .
Soviet Union has broken up very quickly and unexpectedly for all .
In soviet time was low crime level , therefore the local police struggled with small crimes .
Serious crimes - the murders , the armed robberies , large contraband of drugs was happened very seldom .
Antigovernmental demonstrations in soviet time never was not .
But the situation quickly changed .
If the police cannot stop riots in the streets , the army will need to help government .
If the police cannot stop riots in the streets , the government need help army .
Armies in this new state too were not .
Those few parts of the former Soviet army which were in independent Tajikistan , were on border with Afghanistan .
They obeyed commands from Moscow .
The famous KGB was mightily only in Hollywood films .
Groups of Islamites have grasped my city .
The government began to be supervised by them .
But they did not supervise all country .
Later the city was stormed the militants from the Popular Front of Tajikistan ( so communistic groups later began to be called ) , some time later the city again was grasped by insurgents from United Tadjik Opposition ( so began to be called islamist group ) .
So was some times , while the Popular Front definitively has not won .
The situation in Dushanbe remained relatively calm in all time .
Large shooting was not , but little shooting happened constantly .
But for this situation all have become accustomed .
Excluding the time when militants from both sides stormed city .
When I write - Islamites or communists , all not absolutely so .
Both parties were not against Islam and not against ideas of communism .
In many respects it was struggle of clans for the power .
It was war between well developed industrial North and poorly developed agrarian South .
Besides , even in such small country there were separatists .
Mountain areas tried to create independent state .
The leaders of both parties were not real communists or real islamists .
One of leaders of Islamites - Shodmon Jusuf , held a high post in Communist Party .
In a Soviet period he spoke about friendship between the people .
During civil war he on TV declared hostages of all russian people in Tajikistan .
And if Russia intervenes in war in Tajikistan all hostages will be killed .
This statement was supported by other leader of Islamites - Otahon Latifi .
In a Soviet period he was the known journalist of the central Moscow newspaper .
One of main leaders of Peoples Front - Sangak Safarov has spent 23 years in prison .
Sangak precisely not was the communist .
But this person has stopped Islamites .
Without Sangak Safarov Tajikistan was to become the second Afghanistan .
Now to business .
How to survive in the country where there is no order ?
How it is possible to get used to firing , to death in streets ?
It is possible .
If you are in this situation , you get used to this faster , than you think .
I will result an interesting example .
My father 's friend - the fan of a distant radio communication on short waves .
It has contacted the radio fan from Belfast , Northern Ireland .
During conversation he heard a strange sounds .-
What is this sounds ?-
All is simple .
In the next street shoot insurgents out of IRA .
When these insurgents will finish the shooting , and I will go to grocery shop .
When the father to me has told this story , I could not understand , how it is possible to get used to death .
How it is possible not to pay attention to sounds of shooting in streets ?
But when all it happens in streets of my city , I have understood all .
People can get used to all troubles .
Or nearly so to all troubles .
At first you very much are afraid of shooting .
You are afraid to leave the house .
But it is impossible be in house constantly .
At your home can will end foods , and you will be compelled to leave the house .
You will need to work , or you will die of hunger .
At the very beginning of civil war belligerent parties try to avoid unnecessary victims .
They try not to kill civilians .
Militants will do n't kill civilians specially .
Civilians will be in relative safety .
But it does not mean that you can easy walk on a city during street firing .
Certainly , it not always so .
This situation was not in each civil war .
At disintegration of the USSR there were some more civil wars .
For example , war between Armenia and Azerbaijan began as civil war .
During this war civilians have been killed by militants from both parties .
Only later both parties have created the present armies , and these armies tried not to kill civilians .
The weapon .
It is a complicated question .
All depends on a situation .
If crowd of furious people break door in your house , the weapon is very necessary for you .
With an automatic rifle in hands , or with something serious , you can protect yourselves .
Some shots - and militants will understand that you is the real hero .
As in the American films .
One good guy against bad guys .
The problem in that , in a life all will be not so .
At cinema one good guy kills it many bad guys .
In the real life much bad guys kill one good guy .
Remember this , your main task is to survive !
You not the hero .
Heroes die the first .
At threat of an attack you will need very strong metal door .
If fight goes nearby , and you houses , do not leave the house .
It is not necessary to look from a window to look who there shoots .
Steer clear of windows .
Find as much as possible closed place where the casual bullet will not get you .
And this door should open outside , not to inside your home .
The strong door is your rescue .
Now you do not need to be the hero .
Let militants try to break your strong metal door .
Let shoot through your door .
Let them screaming : open a door !
Do not shoot at the answer , and do not answer them .
You not the idiot , and you will do n't open a door .
Sit silently .
They will not try long to open your door .
Also they will not use dynamite .
What for this to waste time ?
Around many other doors .
Yes , I has absolutely forgotten .
Strong lattices at windows too are important , if you live on the first or second floor .
And dense curtains or jalousie at windows .
Your salvation is the strong door , lattices at windows , and a large supply of water and canned food .
About the decision of a problem with water and meal well wrote by Ferfal .
I will not repeat again about it .
But I will return to a question on the weapon .
Perhaps you think , what I against the weapon during civil war ?
This is not true .
Do n't think that if you have a weapon , you in safety .
The pistol or a rifle only will help you to survive .
Or will help quickly to die .
The weapon is useful , if you or your house are attacked by robbers .
Several persons you can neutralise .
And if it is more , 10,20,50,100 ?
Militants will be too much .
And at them other problems .
They kill each other .
While you without the weapon , you are not too interesting to them .
But if you are armed , all militants will shoot at you .
It seems that this is madness - to be on the streets without a weapon when the street many armed militants .
But my opinion - to be with the weapon in the street during disorders - is equivalent to suicide .
What weapon you take ?
A rifle ?
You will hide it in a pocket ?
Will try to hide under clothes ?
It is good , if in the street it is cold , and the person in a coat will not cause special suspicions .
And if you go in the street in long , free clothes , but the weather in street is very hot ?
It will be very suspicious .
Well , all of you wish to go with a rifle , having hidden it under clothes .
You were surrounded with some people with weapons .
They will wait for you , while you will use the rifle ?
OK !
You killed them .
In next second another militants killed you .
Maybe ,
You will need the weapon which easily can be hidden .
For example , a pistol or Israeli UZI .
With this weapon you have more chance , but still you will not be a winner .
The armed people surrounded you again .
You quickly killed your enemies .
And in next second another militants killed you again .
Maybe , the weapon is not necessary for you .
No , I so have not told .
It can to you it is required , when civil war starts to come to an end .
While there is no new government .
In streets already there are no militants .
But there is a lot of weapon .
At this time the armed robberies in streets become an everyday occurrence .
Here then the weapon is required to you .
Gangsters will be afraid with you to communicate , if at you in hands an automatic pistol or UZI .
In many countries the weapon freely is on sale .
You can buy any weapon if you have money .
But there are countries where weapon sale is forbidden or strongly limited .
In the USSR there were strict rules about weapon purchases .
In soviet time legally possible to buy only a fowling piece .
And only under the special permission .
After disintegration of the USSR rules have changed , but all the same remained very strict .
Now in Russia resolved the pneumatic weapon , shooting by balls from a steel ( it is possible to buy exact copy áë - 47 ) , electric shock gun and other means for self - defence , but legally possible to buy only a fowling piece .
But the rifle is very inconvenient for the latent carrying !
Recollect history .
During the Russian Revolutions and Civil War partisans cut down the butt and barrel of rifles to create a " hand made pistol " known as an " obrez " ( see http://homepage3.nifty.com/LAMPOPO/Foto1/Obrez.JPG).
A sawn - off shotgun very convenient weapon for the latent carrying .
ATTENTION !
In Russia manufacturing and storage of sawn - off shotguns is forbidden .
This criminal offence .
I do not urge you to do it !
Think , can , in your country it is forbidden .
If it is forbidden , do not do it !
That is still important .
You should will learn to use the weapon .
Otherwise , what for it to you ?
Think well , can to you it is necessary seriously wound or even to kill the person .
Or even several people .
If you are not ready to this , you do not need the weapon .
If you have decided to get the weapon , you must ready to shoot .
If you scream to the armed insurgents : stop , I will shoot , insurgents will long not think .
They will simply shoot you , take your weapon , and will go further .
Think of it .
And always remember that murder this serious criminal offence !!!
But what if you were on the street during the riots ?
Or you urgently need to get from one end of town to another , or leave the city ?
Explore your city .
For example , the majority of people can all life in a city , but know only its small part .
They know only habitual routes .
From the house before work , and back .
The majority of people well know only several districts . .
Also it is all .
It is enough for a normal life .
If you have appeared in unfamiliar district , you can always ask the help for passers - by .
Or you look a map if it at you is .
Probably , it is impossible to know on 100 % all streets in a big city .
But you should at least roughly oriented in every district of your city .
Without the aid of maps , without a GPS navigator .
Only your eyes , ears and head .
Think , if you find yourself in an unfamiliar area during the fighting ?
Who you ask about the road ?
You go to militants and ask road for insurgents ?
Well , you understand me .
Clothes .
Do n't use military style clothes , do n't use clothes reminiscent of the military .
You must use comfortable clothes , use clothes in dark colors .
Remember - you are not militant , you are just ordinary civilians .
One more important question .
You must to go on foot , or to go by the car ?
Certainly , to go by the car it is easy , convenient and safe .
But only not during street disorders in a city .
The car is very convenient purpose for militants .
Besides , all basic roads to a city will necessarily reliably are blocked .
If firing has found you in the street , do not panic .
You must hide .
Find shelter .
Wait for the firing termination , not important , how many will pass time .
Simply wait .
When the firing termination you must to think , do you really need to go further ?
If you were noticed by the armed people , do not try to run .
A bullet all the same faster .
The running man will be guaranteed killed .
Wait , while militants will go to you .
You must be not afraid and worry .
You must answered to questions relaxed .
Tell the truth .
You the civilian , you must urgently to leave a city .
Or you urgently should go to in other city district .
Without a panic .
If you will beat , do not resist .
Insurgents are armed , and they can kill you .
Demand to conversation with their commander .
Tell to commander , what for and where you go .
Try to convince insurgents that you not the spy , you the civilian .
You need go to further .
Perhaps , it will work .
I hope , to you will carry and militants will not kill you .
Documents .
Passports .
Identification cards .
If you have to get out of a city during street disorders you should think of it .
Look , you go away of the country where there is a civil war .
But in your new country documents will be necessary to you .
Will interest nobody that your passport is destroyed together with your house .
The passport , the driver 's licence , other documents are very important !
Keep them in your pocket .
About electric power .
With an electricity you will have big problems .
It is good , if you have a portable generator .
But if you live in an apartment house , you will be very difficult to use it .
It very strongly rustles and allocates smelly exhaust gases .
Certainly , if you absolutely do n't have the electricity , you must have the generator .
But if the electricity in your home have at least some hours per day it is possible to try to use ordinary computer 's UPS .
Or try to use car 's accumulator and AC / DC converter 12 V -> 220 V .
For a desktop luminescent lamp , for portable TV or a radio receiver energy will suffice at 5 - 6 hours .
And if use LED a lamp energy will suffice at 8 - 10 hours or even more .
Communications and News .
In the time of civilian war very important know current situation in your country , in your city .
Local radio or TV can be under control of militants and broadcasted false news or broadcasted only music .
Wired and cell phones can be not work .
Access to Internet can be blocked .
You do n't nothing know .
How to be in such situation ?
For example , you must go to another district in your city .
How you know about the situation in this district ?
You need independent channel for communications and information .
It is good , if you have satellite TV , satellite phone , and satellite Internet .
But this is expensive things .
Optimum choice is radio on battery with range short waves and handheld radio transceiver ( as know walkie - talkie ) .
Fuel and the stove .
You will be need fuel or electricity to cook food .
But if there will be no electricity and the magistral gas how it to make ?
Certainly , if you live in the country near to wood or near to a coal mine , fuel for you not a problem .
But if you live in a city , gasoline , kerosene or gas will be the most accessible fuel .
You will be needed the stove , which will work on this fuel .
Modern stoves , such as Primus OmniFuel it 's very good stoves .
See this video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tdja7UCIt0Y.
I read this comment about this stove : " I used the titan - version of the omnifuel as reliable stove during a long stay in the high mountains between Hinudkush , Pamir and Karakorum in the northeastern most region of Afghanistan as a ISAF - soldier participating reconnaissance - patrols near the tajik or pakistani border .
I had no problems with that stove and will hopefully use it again in similar situations .
I used white gas from our rescues - center as well as propane / butane ..... "
Very nice recommendation !
Modern stoves work well on any liquid fuel or gas .
But these stoves have one problem .
Fuel for these stoves must be high quality ( white gas ) .
In time of civilian war you will needed simple classic stove .
The stove for any bad fuel .
I think , old classic stoves may be better than , modern stoves ( See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fYj0f0Lu04&feature=related).Money.
During the civil war money will faster depreciate .
Hyperinflation will start .
Each day begins with the new prices .
Forget about the stability of money !
The money will be printed by any local government .
So always was and be during civil war .
After falling of the USSR the money has printed all new recognized and not recognized states .
There was the most different money , some governments on old Soviet roubles pasted local mark ( look the reference - money of not recognized Dnestr Moldavian Republic http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/s30051959/view/109787/? page=1 ) .
Independent Tajikistan too has printed the money very similar to old Soviet roubles ( http://www.kcshop.com/imagegallery/Tajikistan.htm).
Look money of the former republics USSR - http://pulman.livejournal.com/111070.html?
thread=403166 .
Money during civil war In Russia ( 1918 - 1920 ) - http://bb.1asphost.com/banknotes/gallery_1.htm.
It 's not money , it 's simply paper .
How to save the money in crisis time ?
I totally agreewith Ferval , instead of money you need gold .
Gold is easy to store , its price remains stable .
But in addition to gold 's nice to have a stable foreign currencies .
During the civil war I would divide the money on 3 part .
50 % of my money I has translated in euro and I will store these money in reliable European bank .
I think , to store large amounts of money in dollars it 's too much risk .
25 % of money I would translate in gold .
25 % of percent I would translate in cash U.S. dollars and euro .
Now I would recommend cash American dollars and Euros .
Despite the inevitable collapse of the U.S. ( I think the U.S. will disappear as the USSR ) , the U.S. dollar for a long time will remain the primary currency .
Euro is still too new currency , and many people do n't know about euro .
I think , your need for cash money on 50 % in dollars , 50 % in euros .
Other independent stable currencies , such as the Swiss franc , British pound , Japanese yen , for too many people is unknown money .
Many people simply do not know how to look like such banknotes .
The House .
The house in time of civilian war .
On this site I read interesting letter about civilian war in ex-Yugoslavia .
In this letter author wrote very smart ideas about anti crisis house .
I fully agree with these thoughts .
If You have money and time , You must build such house .
In this house will be safe , it 's ideal house for civilian war .
But if
You do n't have money and time for building ideal house or your house is destroyed , You can build simple , cheap and warm house .
This is house in earth or dugout ( in East Europe this house know as " zemlyanka " ) .
In properly constructed dugout enough comfortable .
In classical dugout for you will be cool in summer and warm in winter .
In addition this house very difficult to detect .
To my regret , I do n't find references in English language about building dugout .
But on sites in Russian language is photos and pictures that will help you understand , how to build this house ( how to build the dugout ( in russian http://www.vrazvedka.ru/main/learning/obmundirov/varenishev_04.html and http://www.fortification.ru/library/gerbanovsky/009.html).I found site of people group , that build the perfect ecological village ( they believe in crazy ideas , but their experience can it is useful ) .
On the first step they built the dugouts ( http://www.zunigor.narod.ru/Zemlynka/zemlynka.html).
They made very good dugouts but in next year these dugouts has flooded groundwater ( one year later http://www.slavnoe2006.narod.ru/may.html).
If You decide to build this , You must remember about this problem .
See these links about modern dugout in United Kingdom .
This man ready for bad times !
( http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2004/03/287791.html, http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/jul/26/ethicalliving.lifeandhealth)Original idea for anticrisis home in Poland ( http://www.obrazky.pl/schron).
Even the dugout can be very comfortable ( http://funlog.ru/pics/samaja_komfortabelnaja_zemljanka:10179.html).The car .
About the car during the crisis is well has written Ferfal .
My main recommendation - this car must easy to use and repair .
Let this car outside look as garbage , but this car must be have is very reliable engine .
The diesel engine or the gasoline engine ?
What engine to choose ?
The diesel engine is arranged easier , than gasoline engine .
The diesel engine is more economic .
Maybe ,
You must to choose diesel car , after all diesel fuel more cheaply and less flammable , than gasoline .
But the car with diesel engine very exacting to quality of fuel .
And the diesel engine is very difficult to repair .
Therefore , it is better to choose a car with gasoline engine .
And this car must work on any bad gasoline , after all the quality of gasoline will be disgusting .
Little advertising .
For bad roads , I recommend 2 automotive brands .
This is a classic model of Lada Niva and classical models UAZ .
Of course , these cars were designed more than 30 years ago and not very comfortable .
They aredifficult for manage , these cars has no steering booster .
See this video ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk7zqSLwewk suzuki samurai vs. lada niva , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUHHANKAOQo lada niva ( LADA vs HUMMER ) , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIpRju_pJAM real russian OFF ROAD ) .
Of course , there are still many other important issues , but I wrote about the most important .
Good luck !

Oh The Brütality Of Assassin's Creed 2
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Saturday , 17th of October 2009 - 04:17 PM ]
Well low and behold , Ubisoft mind readers have plucked those simple thoughts and unspoken upgrades from my head .
One of the major ones was the guard types , but also the fact that you can no use all of Ezio 's weapons and steal weapons from guards and use them in a very brutal way .
Meaning you can even use his hidden blades as a normal attack .
I 'm sure you have all seen the weapons from the other videos , or skipped down to the one below .
So I 'm not going to discuss them outside of the fact that Ubisoft has given them more of a real world feel when using .
Some are sluggish and are used and wielded like if you were holding them .
Also each will leave you with a look and feeling of " Fuck that had to hurt ! "
Just as if you had it happen to you .
The thing I 'm really excited for those is the three different types of guards though .
The Brute , The Scout , and The Agile .
The brute is exactly how it sounds and is a lot like most of the guards from the first .
Except that they are dumber , searching and spotting wise .
You can pretty much turn a corner and hide and they will run right by .
Unlike The Scout that works similar , just less powerful and can spot you amongst a group of people you are hiding in .
They are also the same guys that will stab in hay carts to see if you are in there .
So what about The Agile ?
They are quick guards that can employ all of the free running skin Ezio can in the game .
Sometimes it looks like even better than .
Mainly because it will alter path , speed , direction , and everything based on how you the player are running about .
From the looks of it , making combat 200 % more complex than before .
If it was n't for all the games before Assassin 's Creed 2 comes out , it would be a long and horrible wait for it .
This game gets even better with each new Developer 's Diary that Ubisoft throws out there .
Terminator is not fiction , its here , its happening , now .
Have you seen the movie Terminator ?
Ever thought it could be real ?
Well , it is real , the day has come .
Its not in the future , its happening , right now .
Robot war has already begun .
There are UAVs flying over our head daily .
UAVs are planes without human pilot .
They can create mission on their own and destroy target .
Right now , this second , there are at least 35 Predator drones in the skies over Iraq and Afghanistan .
Around the world , robot prototypes exist that are mobile , armed and operate without human control .
Living insects are being combined with machines for military use which can carry biological weapons .
Watch this interesting small documentary with P. W. Singer ( former coordinator of the Defense Policy Task Force for Barack Obama )
This is not a movie , this is happening , now .

The battle against candida is familiar to many .
Some struggle for years with fatigue , weight gain and recurring infections , only to be told by doctors that it 's " all in your head . "
The luckier ones realize the cause behind their symptoms early on , only to be handed endless prescriptions for drugs that eventually are n't enough to fight back .
Candida has become increasingly resistant to pharmaceutical antifungal drugs .
It is more important than ever to turn to natural methods like olive leaf extract and finally turn the tables on candida .
Widespread use of olive leaf is fairly new ; it was first made available to practitioners in 1995 .
However , studies showing the benefits of olive leaf have been conducted since the 1960's and 70's , such as one study in Hungary which showed olive leaf to be highly effective in combating illnesses caused by viruses and bacteria .
Oleuropein is the active component in olive leaf extract ( and also what gives uncured olives their bitter flavor ) .
Enzymes in the body convert oleuropein into elolenic acid , which enhances immunity so the body can effectively destroy viruses , pathogenic bacteria , and fungi .
Experts like Dr. Morton
Walker , author of , believe this potent herb to be a far superior solution for candida than common medical remedies .
He states that olive leaf extract has the unique ability to actually kill fungi instead of just inhibiting their growth .
This is what makes olive leaf extract such a powerful weapon against candida
In addition , olive leaf is regarded as safe and nontoxic in the recommended doses , quite unlike pharmaceutical remedies which can cause a slew of negative side effects , including damaging liver and heart health .
Olive leaf extract is most often taken in capsules , which should be standardized to as much as 20 percent oleuropein .
The higher the level of oleuropein , the less capsules need to be taken for optimal results .
Common dosage levels range from four to twelve 500 mg capsules of olive leaf extract standardized to 20 percent oleuropein .
Start with a lower dose and work upward as needed .
Many people with candida experience die - off symptoms when they use olive leaf extract .
This occurs when mass amounts of candida throughout your system die off at the same time .
Symptoms are typically flu - like , such as headaches , chills and foggy thinking .
This usually only last a few days .

Leela Yellesetty looks at the media and political reaction to the recent killings of five police officers in the Seattle - Tacoma area .
THE EXECUTION - style shooting of four police officers November 29 in a coffee shop in Lakewood , Wash . , is being used by politicians to drive a law - and - order agenda -- but other crucial social issues surrounding the case are being ignored .
The killing of four officers in the suburb of Tacoma - - the worst attack on law enforcement in state history -- came just a month after Seattle Police Officer Timothy Brenton was shot while in a parked patrol car on October 31 .
The killing followed the firebombing of four Seattle patrol cars on October 22 .
For public officials and the mainstream media , these events only reinforce the image of heroic law enforcement , risking their lives in the line of duty -- and , tragically , justify more violence through increased tough - on - crime policies .
" I am shocked and horrified at the murder of four police officers this morning in Pierce County , " said Gov. Christine Gregoire .
" Our police put their lives on the line every day , and tragedies like this remind us of the risks they continually take to keep our communities safe . "
Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire
King County Sheriff 's Office spokesperson Sgt. John Urquhart called the five officer slayings " an assault on society ... We stand between guys like this and the rest of society .
When we 're attacked like this , like Timothy Brenton was and these four law - enforcement officers were , this is an attack on everybody . "
However a closer look at the context paints a much different picture of the " heroes " in blue .
First of all , the reason there 's such an uproar surrounding these attacks is because they are so rare as to be nearly unprecedented .
Contrary to common wisdom , you are at a much lower risk as a police officer than if you are on the receiving end of the law .
Police have never made the list of the top 10 most dangerous jobs , making the occupation much safer than , say , a farmer or taxi driver , to name a few on the list .
But deaths of people in these professions rarely make the news .
Nor are violent criminals the main threat .
A 2007 study pointed out that more than half of all police deaths were car accidents .
By one author 's calculations , " Take out traffic accidents and other non-violent deaths , and you 're left with 69 officers killed on the job by criminals last year .
That 's out of about 850,000 officers nationwide . "
The last officer killed in the line of duty in Seattle before the recent shooting was Joselito " Lito " Barber , whose patrol car was hit by an SUV in 2006 .
The last shooting death was in 1994 .
Even this case was in the context of an arrest , rather than an unprovoked execution .
By contrast , according to a 2007 report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics , from 2003 through 2005 , at least 2,002 people died during their arrests by state and local law enforcement officers .
The number of arrest - related deaths increased 13 percent over the course of the three years studied .
The figures could be higher , however : law - enforcement records of those killed by police are notoriously unreliable .
Reports of police killing or seriously injuring people in this city just in the last year are too numerous to list here .
There was the brutal beating of Malika Calhoun at the King County Sheriff 's Department .
The trial of the officer involved has now been put on hold following Officer Brenton 's shooting .
Equally disturbing is this video of a young man who was thrown headfirst against a wall so hard he was put into a coma and remains permanently brain damaged as a result .
The victim , Christopher Harris , had nothing to do with the crime that police were investigating .
He just saw cops running toward him and ran .
No 24 - hour - news coverage was devoted to Harris ' plight , and no public memorials or charities were created in his honor .
NONE OF this justifies the shooting of the police officers .
But it does raise the question of why some lives seem to count more than others .
The double standard also helps explain why some people have come to feel that the police motto " serve and protect " does n't apply to them .
The police response here to the two shooting incidents raises further questions about their commitment to justice -- as opposed to simple revenge .
As with the shooting of Officer Brenton , the hunt for a suspect in the Lakewood shootings was on immediately .
Citizens were initially urged to be on the lookout for " a Black man in his 20s or 30s , between 5 - feet - 7 - inches and 5 - feet - 10 - inches , " wearing a black coat and blue jeans .
Soon thereafter , police focused their energies on apprehending 37 - year - old Maurice Clemmons , who they believe was wounded by one of the officers in the attack .
On the night of November 29 , police surrounded a house in Seattle 's Leschi neighborhood where Clemmons was believed to be hiding , and spent hours trying to drive him out " using loudspeakers , explosions and even a robot sent into the house , " the Associated Press reported .
However , when they finally entered the home , nobody was there .
Police then turned to the surrounding neighborhood .
This was n't covered by the mainstream media , but according to one resident of a communal house next door , residents were ordered to evacuate their home .
Afterwards , police proceeded to flood it with tear gas -- making it impossible to reenter due to toxic fumes .
From there , the manhunt expanded , with hundreds of people responding to the $ 125,000 offer for information on Clemmons ' whereabouts .
Police chased trails of blood all over the city .
On early Tuesday morning , December 1 , an officer came upon Clemmons in a stolen car in south Seattle .
The Seattle police reported that as the officer drew his gun , the suspect " reached into his waist area and moved . "
The report added , " The officer fired several times , striking the suspect at least twice . "
Clemmons went down near some bushes and was taken into custody .
When medics from the Seattle Fire Department arrived , they pronounced him dead at the scene .
However , details connecting Clemmons to the case remain hazy .
Apparently , blood was found in an abandoned pickup truck that belonged to Clemmons .
And Pierce County Sheriff Department spokesman Ed Troyer told the Tacoma News - Tribune that Clemmons indicated the night before the shooting " that he was going to shoot police and watch the news . "
Police claim to have in custody multiple people who allegedly helped Clemmons after the attacks , and are still searching for other suspected accomplices .
The evidence against these individuals remains to be seen .
WHILE POLICE prepare their case against what they call Clemmons ' " partners in crime , " law - and - order politicians are using Clemmons as a poster boy for stiffer sentencing .
" This guy should have never been on the street , " said Brian Wurts , president of the police union in Lakewood .
" Our elected officials need to find out why these people are out . "
In particular , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has drawn fire for commuting Clemmons ' sentence years earlier , due to the fact that he was 17 when he committed an armed robbery - - a crime for which he received a 95 - year sentence .
Clemmons has been in and out of prison since that time .
But the real question is why he was n't in a mental institution instead of on the street .
Clemmons was charged in Washington state earlier this year with assaulting a police officer and raping a child , and investigators in the sex case said he was motivated by visions that he was Jesus Christ , and that the world was on the verge of the apocalypse .
But he was released from jail after posting bail .
In an evaluation of Clemmons dated October 19 , psychologists Melissa Dannelet and Carl Redick wrote :
Based on Mr. Clemmons ' documented criminal history , information obtained through interviews and treatment , and a review of risk factors , it is our professional opinion that he presents with increased risk for future dangerous behavior and for committing future criminal acts jeopardizing public safety and security due to past illicit behaviors .
Those risk factors included " previous violence , young age at first violent incident , relationship instability and prior supervision failure , " Dannelet and Redick wrote .
However , the two said they had " insufficient grounds " to recommend Clemmons be civilly committed to a mental institution .
Clemmons appeared to be suffering from no mental disease when they interviewed him October 14 for 75 minutes in jail , they reported .
One has to wonder if the decision to return Clemmons to the street rather than commit him has anything to do with the proposed $ 310 million in cuts to Washington state hospitals in the next two years .
According to the Washington State Hospitals Association , plans to close two wards will have a worsening impact on the already insufficient number of mental health beds for involuntarily detained patients .
An additional $ 12.9 million in cuts would eliminate funding for community support services for individuals discharged from state hospitals .
AS A man with a violent past who is clearly in need of psychological help , it seems plausible that Clemmons did shoot the officers in Lakewood .
But the media and law enforcement have also claimed to have an ironclad case against the suspect in the earlier shooting -- of Officer Brenton in Seattle .
Christopher Monfort , a 41 year old charged in connection with both the shooting of Brenton and the firebombing of patrol cars , is now paralyzed from the waist down after police shot him in a confrontation at his Tukwila apartment complex in suburban Seattle .
Investigators were led there on a tip from a neighbor that Monfort 's car fit the description in a police bulletin .
Eyewitnesses could only make out that the car was light colored .
But police believe the car in question was the same one caught on camera twice by patrol cars in the area at around the same time as the shooting : a white or light - beige 1980 to 1983 Datsun 210 coupe that might have rear - window louvers and a defective right tail light .
Anyone who has seen The Thin Blue Line , a documentary film about a wrongful conviction , will at least hesitate before accepting this assertion .
Even Seattle Assistant Chief Jim Pugel cautioned at the time , " We 're not saying this absolutely , that it is the vehicle " identified by witnesses to the shooting .
The police searched Monfort 's home and reported they had discovered a cache of weapons , including a .223 caliber rifle , which a ballistics test identified as the firearm used in the murder of Officer Brenton .
In addition , they claimed to have found a considerable amount of bomb - making materials .
The crowning piece of evidence connecting Monfort to both crimes , police claim , is a DNA test , which apparently links him to a flag bandana found at the scene of the arson and a flag at the shooting site .
All this may sound convincing , especially in the way it is reported in the media .
But Monfort is supposed to be , under the law , innocent until proven guilty .
And a cursory look at the history of cop -killer convictions will reveal that emotion and the rush to convict can sometimes get in the way of justice , to put it mildly .
It is not unknown for police departments to fabricate or fudge evidence , or for lab results to be much less conclusive than reported .
Add this to the fact that Monfort does not seem a likely candidate for the crime .
His family members expressed shock and disbelief at his arrest .
Longtime family friend Vicky Malone said she was mystified that Monfort could be considered a suspect :
I do n't get this .
People that run around and kill cops have tons and tons of other stuff in their record , and Chris had no gang stuff , I know that ... You do n't see people that commit real violent crimes that have never been caught for anything .
She added that Monfort was always worried about being targeted because of his race .
Besides a couple traffic tickets , Monfort had no prior criminal record .
To the contrary , at age 21 , he had applied to be a police officer in California .
More recently , he studied criminal justice at Highline Community College in a Seattle suburb , later transferring to the University of Washington to earn a degree in law , societies and justice in 2008 .
He also worked as volunteer at the ACLU and at a juvenile detention center .
One of his professors at Highline who became a mentor was Garry Wegner , who spent 20 years as the deputy director of the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission , the organization that trains many of the state 's law enforcement officers .
Wegner , who described Monfort as " a mature , stable individual , " said he was shocked to hear that his former student is the suspect in Brenton 's slaying .
" You 've shaken me to my toes , " he told a Seattle Times reporter .
" He 's one of those people you thought would make a difference , a positive , constructive difference . "
Despite his political passions , no friends or acquaintances from his past believed that Monfort would resort to violence to get his views across .
Whoever killed Officer Brenton , his death , along with those of the Lakewood officers , is being used to mount a right - wing , law - and - order campaign .
Law enforcement agencies and their political supporters have seized the opportunity to claim a greater share of public resources at a time when budget cuts are forcing cutbacks of vital government services .
In fact , even before the recent series of events , public safety remained the number one priority of the Seattle city government , despite crime rates being at a 40 - year low .
With schools , libraries , public health , food assistance and a host of other social services facing budget cuts , the number of cops on the streets continued to increase .
Plans to build a new $ 200 million jail in the city are on hold , but still on the table .
Now , local politicians will be bolstered in their insistence in continuing down this path , and law enforcement has lost no time in ramping up harassment and profiling of communities of color .
This is an absurd solution in a state that plans how many prison beds will be needed in the future based on third grade reading scores -- and then proceeds to cut school funding .
Pursuit of this police - vs. - social spending strategy is bound to produce more young people condemned to a life of violence .
The only way to end this downward spiral is a struggle to demand an end to police brutality , and the poverty and racism on which it thrives .
Jeffery L. Sheler , religion correspondent for U.S. News and World Report , has written a biography of Saddleback Church pastor Rick Warren in Prophet of Purpose : The Life of Rick Warren .
The most interesting revelation in the biography may well be that Warren ’s “ traditional ” marriage was actually an “ arranged ” marriage of sorts :
Perhaps one of the most interesting parts of the biography , however , is the section about Warren\ ’s marriage .
By all appearance and comments from people who know the couple , Rick and y Warren have a happy and satisfying marriage .
However , this was far from the truth in the beginning of the relationship .
Through interviews with Sheler , Rick and Kay Warren disclosed that they were not attracted to each other nor had feelings for each other when they agreed to be married .
Instead , they believed that God had spoken to each of them saying this is the person they should marry .
Rick recalled the day when he was invited to speak at the church where Kay\ ’s father was a pastor .
As he ascended the steps to the stage to speak he looked over and recognized Kay , who was then dating his best friend , playing the piano .
He said he heard God clearly tell him that this is who he will marry .
At the time he had a hard time believing that because he didn \’t love Kay and she was madly in love with his best friend .
But still he kept the revelation in mind .
After his best friend broke up with Kay , Rick asked her on a date .
On their second date , Rick asked Kay to marry him .
At the time , Kay didn\’t love Rick but felt that God was leading her to say yes .
She recalled hearing God say , “ I \ ’ll bring the feelings . ”
… On their wedding day , the two were “ virtual strangers , ” Sheler writes .
They also had a horrible honeymoon and suffered intensely from misunderstandings and other marital problems in the beginning of their marriage .
The stress from the marriage problems coupled with Rick\ ’s workload was so bad that he ended up in the hospital .
Meanwhile , Kay said that she didn \’t believe in divorce so she felt that she was sentenced to a life of suffering .
Low dose aspirin is widely given to people who have had heart problems
The use of aspirin to ward off heart attacks and strokes in those who do not have obvious cardiovascular disease should be abandoned , researchers say .
The Drugs and Therapeutics Bulletin ( DTB ) study says aspirin can cause serious internal bleeding and does not prevent cardiovascular disease deaths .
It says doctors should review all patients currently taking the drug for prevention of heart disease .
The Royal College of GPs says it supports the DTB 's recommendations .
Low - dose aspirin is widely used to prevent further episodes of cardiovascular disease in people who have already had problems such as a heart attack or stroke .
Given the evidence , the DTB 's statement on aspirin prescription is a sensible one
Prof Steve Field , Royal College of GPs
This approach - known as secondary prevention - is well - established and has confirmed benefits .
But many thousands of people in the UK are believed to be taking aspirin as a protective measure before they have any heart symptoms .
Controlled trials Between 2005 and 2008 , the DTB said four sets of guidelines were published recommending aspirin for the " primary prevention " of cardiovascular disease - in patients who had shown no sign of the disease .

These included people aged 50 and older with type 2 diabetes and those with high blood pressure .
But the DTB said a recent analysis of six controlled trials involving a total of 95,000 patients published in the journal the Lancet does not back up the routine use of aspirin in these patients because of the risk of serious gastrointestinal bleeds and the negligible impact it has on curbing death rates .
Dr Ike Ikeanacho , editor of the DTB , said : " Current evidence for primary prevention suggests the benefits and harms of aspirin in this setting may be more finely balanced than previously thought , even in individuals estimated to be at high risk of experiencing cardiovascular events , including those with diabetes or elevated blood pressure . "
' Sensible statement ' Professor Steve Field , chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners , said the DTB was an excellent source of independent advice for medical professionals .
He said : " Given the evidence , the DTB 's statement on aspirin prescription is a sensible one .
" The Royal College of General Practitioners would support their call for existing guidelines on aspirin prescription to be amended , and for a review of patients currently taking aspirin for prevention . "
June Davison , senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation said : " It is well established that aspirin can help prevent heart attacks and strokes among people with heart and circulatory disease - so this group of people should continue to take aspirin as prescribed by their doctor .
" However , for those who do not have heart and circulatory disease the risk of serious bleeding outweighs the potential preventative benefits of taking aspirin .
" We advise people not to take aspirin daily , unless they check with their doctor .
" The best way to reduce your risk of developing this disease is to avoid smoking , eat a diet low in saturated fat and rich in fruit and vegetables and take regular physical activity . "

Governments are always tempted to use their central banks and treasuries as their own personal money pots .
Since the creation of the first central banks in Western Europe in the seventeenth century , governments have succumbed to the temptation to borrow from the monetary authority to fund government - sponsored enterprises , private enterprises , and sometimes even the treasury .
The temptation continues because , who better to fund expansion off - budget than the creator of money , itself ?
It is interesting to illustrate how our current ...
I did n’t know that Apple was entering the health care industry ?
The Consumerist reports that they ’ve had two readers in the past year come to them with complaints that Apple refused to service their broken computers because cigarette smoke is a bio-hazard .
Both customers purchased extended warranties and after the computers stopped functioning , they brought them into their authorized Mac service center .
After several days , they both received news that their staff would be unable to work on their computers because the second hand smoke is a bio-hazard , making their extended warranty void .
It ’s unclear as to whether or not Apple is n’t fixing the computers because they believe that the smoke - contaminated computers are hazardous to their technician ’s health , or if they wo n’t fix them because they believe that the smoke damaged the computers .
Does Apple really care about their employees THAT much that they do n’t want to subject them to second hand smoke via a computer ?
This is one strange case that ’s for sure , all I know is that if I had purchased an extended warranty on top of a $ 2,000 computer , and then Apple refused to fix my computer when something broke down , I ’d be more than a little upset .
Both customers have taken their complaints to Steve Jobs himself , but have n’t successfully pleaded their case yet .
We ’re still waiting to hear the exact details about these cases , but in the meantime , if you ’re a smoker , I ’d think twice before purchasing an Apple computer or an extended warranty .

On the one hand they are basic elements of communication and fundamental to our culture , on the other hand they are cultural goods and an artistic work .
You are able to see just the first aspect , but when it comes to software you ’ll see copyrights and patents even on the most elementary fonts .
Therefore we want to give you a free alternative :
This is why we founded the Libertine Open Fonts Project . ”
Philipp H. Poll Press echo „ Hard to believe but true is the variety of Linux Libertine [... ] “
„ It resembles the Times and is qualitatively at least as good . “
03/2009 „ A typographically very felicitous and additionally free available Font is Linux Libertine – a font , which is well suitable as replacement for Times New Roman . “
02/2008 „ A little bit like the Times , but more beautiful .
This is how one can fittingly describe Linux Libertine . “
Praegnanz.de
10/2006 Our Profile
We work on a versatile font family .
It is designed to give you an alternative for fonts like T*mes New Roman .
We ’re creating free software and publish our fonts under terms of the GPL and OFL .
Please have a look at the paragraph concerning the license .
It is our aim to support the many western languages and provide many special characters .
Our fonts cover the codepages of Western Latin , Greek , Cyrillic ( with their specific enhancements ) , Hebrew , IPA and many more .
Furthermore , typographical features such as ligatures , small capitals , different number styles , scientific symbols , etc. are implemented in this font .
Linux Libertine thus contains more than 2000 characters .
In this huge amount of glyphs , there still may be small mistakes that we ask you to report for the improvement of the Libertine Font Family .
You may also write us , if you would like to see a new feature added ( see the section “ Contribute ” for details ) .
2. – Styles – Finished and ready for use in professional segments , contains kernig information , western ligatures , OpenType - Tables , small caps , etc . Finished and ready for use in professional segments , still in further development .
Further features like above .
A bold variant of regular .
A bold variant of the italic .
This is a small capital variant of regular .
Each font already contains a european set of it in the private area .
OpenType -capable programs can easily switch to small caps , but there is also a seperate font wich allows an easy switch for users who do n’t have OpenType - support .
Organic Grotesque ( non-linear Sans - Serif ) in development .
3. – OpenType – “ OpenType ” is the latest magic word in digital typography .
Microsoft and Adobe have developped a Standard which supports much more than just typesetting in a line .
We wo n’t give you a whole abstract of OpenType features , but we will describe the OpenType functions that we have implemented into Linux Libertine .
For further information see : Wikipedia , Adobe .
Unfortunately few user programs make use of OpenType - features , yet .
The positive list indeed is short but a new innovative Tex / LaTex compiler has full OpenType- support : XeTex / XeLaTex .
The following PDF shows you the advantages and use of XeTex and Libertine : Libertine - XeTex -EN.pdf .
Table Properties Example smcp
c2sc Every style of Linux Libertine contains so called small capitals .
They are , as the name implies , little majuscules which have been manually edited from scaled down versions of capitals to look nicely in titles and for emphasis in running text .
With these two tables you can switch majuscules and miniscules to small capitals .
liga
hlig
dlig
These tables are for ligature substitution .
The liga - table is for standard ligatures , like ff , fi , fl ...
The hlig - table is for historic ligatures like st und ct , which are seldom used anymore .
The dlig - table is for discretionary ligatures , such as tz. frac LinuxLibertine contains some true fractions ( in the form “ ¼ ” ) .
One - glyph fractions exist for fractions with the denominator two , three , four , five , six , seven und eight .
Others , like 1/10 can be composed of “ 1 / ” plus inferior 10 .
The frac - table is responsible for the automatic substitution of the ASCII - input ( i.e. 1/2 ) with the real glyph “ ½ ” .
pnum
tnum
onum
zero LinuxLibertine contains different sets of numbers .
The default is the tnum - set , ( Fig : 1st line ) .
They are so called “ table - numbers ” , which are all the same height and width .
Besides there exists the same number style also as a proportional set ( pnum , Fig : 2nd line ) , this means that the numbers have different widths .
The 1 is thinner , for example , than the 8 .
This looks practically always better than the monospaced set , but in tables this set of numbers would of course not align into neat columns .
In longer texts one might want to use medieval numbers ( also known as minuscle numbers ) , which will better harmonize with the alphabetical glyphs because of their different ascenders and descenders .
This number - set also exists in a monospaced variant ( Fig : line 3 , thin zero because of the thin monospace ) and proportional set with different widths ( Fig : line 4 ) .
When majuscules , minuscles and numbers are being mixed ( as i.e. in Internet - addresses ) , confusion may arise in distinguishing between O ( Oh ) and 0 ( zero ) .
Therefore Linux Libertine contains two marked Zeros – one proportional and one tabular .
The zero -table regulates the automatic substitution from normal to marked zero .
salt
ssXX
These tables contain a list of stylistic alternatives ( salt ) or a certain subset of it ( ssXX ) .
LinuxLibertine for example contains a German variant of the capital umlauts Ä , Ö and Ü , where the dots are nearer to the glyphs .
These are standard since version 2.6 .
For all those who will not use these glyphs not as German umlauts , but rather as emphasized vowels ( like with Ë ) there is the ss01 - style - set .
The ss02 - style - set uses more flexible forms of some capitals , such as of K and R .
Via the salt - table , nearly all glyph - variants can be shown but need to be selected separately .
An example for this behavior is the new German Versal - Eszett , that is being used automatically with capitalization or small caps .
Those who do not want this behavior can have the Versal Eszett substituted by SS by using the salt - table .
For speakers of Swiss German , you can change all occurances of the esszet to ss / SS by using the ss03 - style - set .
fina
In some scripts there are special glyphs for word - endings .
For example there is a word - ending - sigma in the Greek alphabet .
Because Greek keyboards have both characters available , the fina - table will only substitute the innerword - sigma against the word - ending - sigma for all languages but Greek .
sinf
sups
For many scientific publications superiors ( sups ) and inferiors ( sinf ) are needed .
Linux Libertine contains all numbers , as well as the entire basic Latin alphabet , in their optimized superior and inferior forms .
Additionally , the plus and the minus glyph , among many others are included .
Unlike the computer simulated inferiors and superiors ( i.e. those used by “ M$ Word ” ) which are generated by simply scaling and repositioning ( shown here in red ) , the inferiors and superiors found in this stylistic set ( shown here in green ) are modified to fit the optical weight of the original Libertine - glyphs .
ccmp
The table for contextual chaining substitution ( ccmp ) allows the substitution of certain characters in a defined surrounding .
In the latin alphabeth this is especially useful in case of the minuscle f , whose long characteristic overbording neck collides with leftwarding glyphs .
For example with the question mark or accented minuscles .
Typical examples are shown left ( red ) .
The Libertine contains besides the regular f also a short - necked variant .
In case of problematic chains the regular f is substituted in favour of the short - neck one and a collision is thereby prevented ( green ) .
A further use of the ccmp-table is the manual accentuation of letters .
Is the vertical bar - accent being combined with an i , for example , it comes to a conflict with the i-dot .
The ccmp-table then substitutes the i for a dotless ı. aalt “ aalt ” stands for “ show all Alternatives , ” this table contains all possible related glyphs for the selected one .
For example , if an “ a ” is given , the result you would be shown is the superior and inferior a , the related small capital and a further alternative for the small capital ...
At the end we must mention , that unfortunately most programs ( also proprietary ones ) do n’t support OpenType yet – and if they do , it is only rudimentarily implemented .
But we see the problem ambivalently : what the OpenType - Fonts lack , software wo n’t support , and vice - a- versa .
As far as we know there are a few serious efforts in the software - world :
XeTex ( see above )
The Scribus - Developers work at a wider support .
The OpenOffice - Website mentions first steps to support OTFs .
The Gimp already knows automatic ligature - substitution , but more complex support of OpenType lacks because of too simple implementations in the Pango - library .
Under Windows and MacOS at least Adobe Indesign supports all of the implemented functions found in Linux Libertine .
4. – Specialties – The capital Eszett or Versal - Eszett For more than a century , typographers kept demanding the Eszett wide acceptance in the versal setting .
Finally , the DIN - Institut ( German Standarization ) submitted a petition to the ISO , which derived , that in April 2008 the Versal Eszett was given a position in Unicode ( at U+1E9E ) .
Linux Libertine has itself developed a form at the basis of Andreas Stötzner ’s proposal ( Signa Nr.9 ) .
Two of them exist : a capital and a small capital form ( see right figure ) .
Further information can be found at Wikipedia : Versal - Eszett .
Kerning Kerning is standard in quality fonts , but how much time and effort the designer wants to spent is quite different .
During the last years , the standard method was to define a one - by - one Kernpair table .
Now OpenType fonts can offer a more elegant solution : a kern - by - classes table where groups of similar characters are seen as one kern group , i.e .
V and W have nearly the same left and right geometry , and so are in the same kern group .
Linux Libertine utilizes this feature , and therefore it may not be supported in simple or old software that it does n’t understand GPOS kerning too well .
Doublekonsonant -
ligatures
The German language makes use of many doubled consonants , which often formerly had their own glyphs in the Fraktur .
These doublekonsonants have in Linux Libertine their own ligatures again .
The new German orthography has abolished the 3rd-Konsonant - diminution - rule , and so the German got some typographically ugly words ( like Flussschifffahrt ) .
The Doublekonsonant - ligatures of Libertine will make a better form .
Additionally they help the reader to register the glyph group as having just one phonetic value .
Another positive consequence is the more compact word presence and the shortening of the long German word chains .
Scientific
characters Especially in the natural sciences , special characters are often needed .
In mathematics , for example , the Greek letters have long standing historical use as variables .
In chemistry , one uses equilibrium arrows regularly , and biologists may need gender signs once in a while .
Though you will still need a special editor to generate complex formulas , you can use Libertines scientific possibilities to set simple equations in running text .
Hinting ( displaying on screen )
On optical devices , the resolution is often too bad to show glyphs in their full beauty .
While printers , especially laser printers , nowadays reach 300dpi easily , PC - users still are stuck with their 75 dpi monitors .
Glyphs must therefore being rasterized .
A complex technique , that is called “ Hinting ” , can be used to show glyphs clearly also at small sizes , while the glyphs metrics must be deformed to fit to the monitor ’s pixels .
The effect is a clearer view on screen , but the font looks temporarily different from the later printer - output .
“ Hinting ” itself is so far no real “ specialty ” , because all good fonts do have it , but the font designer needs good knowledge and special software , to be professional in his “ hinting ” .
Latest Linux - Systems often have a socalled Auto - Hinter , which makes it possible to see unhinted fonts on screen quite clear nontheless .
Since version 2.7 Linux Libertine ’s TTFs contain TrueType-Hinting for better rastering on Windows ( see fig . ) or Wikipedia : Hint .

In a nutshell : Changing the font is allowed as long as the derivative work is published under the same license again .
Pedantics keep claiming that the embedded use of GPL - fonts in i.e .
PDFs requires the free publication of the PDF as well .
This , of course , is absolute nonsense , because - to our opinion - the font is not significantly changed by the embedding .
To abolish the conflict some members of the FSF have written an addition to the license : the so called “ Font Exception ” .
Our fonts ’ GPL contains this font exception ( since version 2.7 ) .
Since version 2.1.9 LinuxLibertine is also licensed under the OFL , which will clarify usability - conflicts .

" Lehman ’s fate was sealed not in the boardroom of that gaudy Manhattan headquarters .
It was sealed downtown , in the gloomy gray building of the New York Federal Reserve , the Wall Street branch of the U.S. central bank . "
~ Stephen Foley , UK Independent
Stephen Foley is on to something .
Lehman Bros. did n’t die of natural causes ; it was drawn - and - quartered by high - ranking officials at the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve .
Most of the rubbish presently appearing in the media , ignores this glaring fact .
Lehman was a planned demolition ( most likely ) concocted by ex-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson , who wanted to create a financial 9 - 11 to scare Congress into complying with his demands for $ 700 billion in emergency funding ( TARP ) for underwater US banking behemoths .
The whole incident reeks of conflict of interest , corruption , and blackmail .
The media have played a critical role in peddling the official " Who could have known what would happen " version of events .
Bernanke and Paulson were fully aware that they playing with fire , but they chose to proceed anyway , using the mushrooming crisis to achieve their own objectives .
Then things began to spin out of control ; credit markets froze , interbank lending slowed to a crawl , and stock markets plunged .
Even so , the Fed and Treasury persisted with their plan , demanding their $ 700 billion pound of flesh before they ’d do what was needed to stop the bleeding .
It was all avoidable .
Lehman had potential buyers — including Barclays — who probably would have made the sale if Bernanke and Paulson had merely provided guarantees for some of their trading positions .
Instead , Treasury and the Fed balked , thrusting the knife deeper into Lehman ’s ribs .
They claimed they did n’t have legal authority for such guarantees .
It ’s a lie .
The Fed has provided $ 12.8 trillion in loans and other commitments to keep the financial system operating without congressional approval or any explicit authorization under the terms of its charter .
The Fed never considered the limits of its " legal authority " when it bailed - out AIG or organized the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JP Morgan pushing $ 30 billion in future liabilities onto the public ’s balance sheet .
The Fed ’s excuses do n’t square with the facts .
Here ’s how economist Dean Baker recounts what transpired last September 15 :
" Last September , when he ( Bernanke ) was telling Congress that the economy would collapse if it did not approve the $ 700 billion TARP bailout , he warned that the commercial paper market was shutting down .
This was hugely important because most major companies rely on selling commercial paper to meet their payrolls and pay other routine bills .
If they could not sell commercial paper , then millions of people would soon be laid off and the economy would literally collapse .
What Mr. Bernanke apparently forgot to tell Congress back then is that the Fed has the authority to directly buy commercial paper from financial and non-financial companies .
In other words , the Fed has the power to prevent the sort of economic collapse that Bernanke warned would happen if Congress did not quickly approve the TARP .
In fact , Bernanke announced that the Fed would create a special lending facility to buy commercial paper the weekend after Congress voted to approve the TARP . "
( " Bernanke ’s bad Money , " Dean Baker , CounterPunch )
The reason Bernanke did not underwrite the commercial paper market was , if he had , he would n’t have been able to blackmail congress .
He needed the rising anxiety from the crisis to achieve his goals .
Here ’s a clip from an editorial in the New York Times ( admitting most of what has already been stated ) that tries to put a positive spin on the Fed ’s behavior :
" Mr. Nocera says that almost everyone he ’s ever spoken to in Hank Paulson ’s old Treasury Department agrees that without the immediate panic caused by the Lehman default , the government would never have agreed to make the loans needed to save A.I.G. , a company it knew very little about .
In effect , the Lehman bankruptcy caused the government to panic , which in turn caused it to save the firm it really had to save to prevent catastrophe .
In retrospect , if you had to choose one firm to throw under the bus to save everyone else , you would choose Lehman … .
it is quite likely that the financial crisis would have been even worse had Lehman been rescued .
Although nobody realized it at the time , Lehman Brothers had to die for the rest of Wall Street to live .
( " Lehman Had to Die So Global Finance Could Live , " Sept. 14 , 2009 , New York Times )
So , according to the muddled logic of the NY Times , everything worked out for the best so there ’s no need to hold anyone accountable .
( Tell that to the 7 million people who have lost their jobs since the beginning of the meltdown . )
This latest bit of spin is pure cover - your - ass journalism , an attempt to rewrite history and absolve the guilty parties .
The fact is , Paulson and Bernanke deliberately created the crisis in order to jam their widely - reviled TARP policy down the public ’s throat .
The Times thinks the public should be grateful for that because , otherwise , the crooked insurance giant , AIG , would not have been bailed out and Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street heavies would not have been paid off .
The reason panic spread through the markets after Lehman filed for bankruptcy , was because the Reserve Primary Fund , which had lent Lehman $ 785 million ( and received short - term notes called commercial paper ) could n’t keep up with the rapid pace of withdrawals from worried clients .
The sudden erosion of trust triggered a run on the money markets .
Here ’s an excerpt from a Bloomberg article , " Sleep - At - Night - Money Lost in Lehman Lesson Missing $ 63 Billion " :
" On Tuesday , Sept. 16 , the run on Reserve Primary continued .
Between the time of Lehman ’s Chapter 11 announcement and 3 p.m. on Tuesday , investors asked for $ 39.9 billion , more than half of the fund ’s assets , according to Crane Data .
 Reserve ’s trustees instructed employees to sell the Lehman debt , according to the SEC .
 They could n’t find a buyer .
 At 4 p.m. , the trustees determined that the $ 785 million investment was worth nothing .
With all the withdrawals from the fund , the value of a single share dipped to 97 cents .
 Legg Mason , Janus Capital Group Inc. , Northern Trust Corp. , Evergreen and Bank of America Corp. ’s Columbia Management investment unit were all able to inject cash into their funds to shore up losses or buy assets from them .
Putnam closed its Prime Money Market Fund on Sept. 18 and later sold its assets to Pittsburgh - based Federated Investors .
 At least 20 money fund managers were forced to seek financial support or sell holdings to maintain their $ 1 net asset value , according to documents on the SEC Web Site .
 When news that Reserve Primary broke the buck hit the wires at 5:04 p.m. that Tuesday , the race was on . " ( Bloomberg )
This is what a run on the shadow banking system looks like .
Bernanke and Paulson pinpointed the trouble in the commercial paper market and used it to put more pressure on Congress to approve their bailout bill .
Bloomberg again :
" It was commercial paper and the $ 3.6 trillion money market industry that traded the notes that came close to sinking the global economy — not a breakdown in credit - default swaps or bank - to - bank lending … .
 Like ice - nine , the fictitious substance in Kurt Vonnegut Jr. ’s 1963 novel Cat ’s Cradle , a single seed of which could harden all the world ’s water , commercial paper was the crystallizing force that froze credit markets , choking off the ability of companies and banks to borrow money and pay bills . "
( Sleep - At - Night - Money Lost in Lehman Lesson Missing $ 63 Billion , Bob Ivry , Mark Pittman and Christine Harper , Bloomberg News )
Bernanke could have fixed the problem in an instant .
All he needed to do was provide explicit government guarantees on money markets and commercial paper .
That would have ended the bank - run pronto .
But he chose not to .
He chose to wait until Congress capitulated so he could net $ 700 billion for his banking buddies .
According to the UK Telegraph :
" On Thursday night , the Treasury went literally down on his knees before Nancy Pelosi , speaker of the House of Representatives , begging her to agree taxpayer money to bail out the financial system .
Bernanke , a scholar of the financial panic that caused the Great Depression , told fearful lawmakers there would n’t be a banking system in place by Monday morning if they did n’t act .
Paulson talked openly about planning for martial law , about how to feed the American people if banking and commerce collapsed . "
Despite their dire warnings , on Monday morning , the banking system was still intact , just as it was a full month later when the first TARP funds were handed out to the big banks .
It was all a hoax .
The problem was n’t the banks toxic assets at all , but the commercial paper and money markets .
The Fed and Treasury knew that they could count on Congress ’s abysmal ignorance of anything financial ; and they were n’t disappointed .
On October 3 , 2008 , Congress passed the Financial Rescue Plan ( TARP ) .
Paulson ’s fear - mongering had triumphed .
Here ’s a quick look at the Lehman chronology :
On Sept. 15 , 2008 , Lehman Bros. filed for bankruptcy sending the Dow plummeting 504 points .
On Sept. 17 , the Dow falls 449 points in reaction to AIG bailout .
On Sept. 29 , the Dow tumbles 777 points after House votes " No " on TARP .
On Oct. 3 , the House passes Financial Rescue Plan ( TARP ) .
The Dow falls 818 points .
On Oct. 7 , the Fed creates the Commercial Paper Funding Facility to backstop the commercial paper market .
Two weeks later , Bernanke announces the Money Market Investor Funding Facility to make loans of longer maturities .
These are the two facilities which relieved the tension in the markets , not the TARP funds .
It ’s clear that Bernanke knew exactly how to fix the problem , because he did so as soon as the TARP was passed .
Here ’s economist Dean Baker in The American Prospect :
" Bernanke was working with Paulson and the Bush administration to promote a climate of panic .
This climate was necessary in order to push Congress to hastily pass the TARP without serious restrictions on executive compensation , dividends , or measures that would ensure a fair return for the public ’s investment .
 Bernanke did not start buying commercial paper until after the TARP was approved by Congress because he did not want to take the pressure off , thereby leading Congress to believe that it had time to develop a better rescue package .
( " Did Ben Bernanke Pull the TARP Over Eyes ? " , Dean Baker , The American Prospect )
The American people have been ripped off by industry reps working the policy - levers from inside the government .
That ’s the real lesson of the Lehman bankruptcy .
Happy anniversary .
The Best of Mike Whitney
A system that turns brain waves into FM radio signals and decodes them as sound is the first totally wireless brain - computer interface .
For now , 26 - year - old Erik Ramsey , left almost entirely paralyzed by a horrific car accident 10 years ago , can only express vowel sounds with the system .
That ’s less than can be accomplished with wired brain - computer interfaces .
But it ’s still a promising step .
“ All the groups working on BCIs are working toward wireless solutions .
They are very superior , ” said Frank Guenther a Boston University cognitive scientist who helped developed Ramsey ’s system .
In the last decade , brain - computer interfaces , or BCIs , have made the jump from speculation to preliminary medical reality .
Since Wired reported on quadriplegic BCI pioneer Matthew Nagle four years ago ( “ He ’s playing Pong with his thoughts alone “ ) , the interfaces have been used to steer wheelchairs , send text messages and even to Tweet .
They ’re so advanced that some researchers now worry about BCI ethics — what happens when healthy people get them ?
And they ’re concerned about the threat posed by hackers .
But as amazing as these early BCIs are , they ’re far from street - ready .
Systems based on translating electrical signals captured by electrodes on patients ’ scalps are notoriously slow , capable of producing about one word a minute .
If researchers put electrodes directly into patients ’ brains , the results are better — but that raises the possibility of dangerous infection .
And from a purely practical point of view , wires just get in the way .
The implant system tested by Ramsey , as described in a paper published Wednesday in Public Library of Science ONE , was originally developed by Philip Kennedy , founder of Neural Signals , a company that specializes in BCIs .
Several electrodes are implanted in Ramsey ’s cerebral cortex .
Beneath the skin of his skull is an amplifier that gathers the electrodes ’ signals , and an FM transmitter that sends them to a nearby computer .
Using a neurological model constructed by Guenther , Ramsey ’s brain activity is mapped to corresponding mouth and jaw movements .
Another program decodes the signals , and synthesizes them in the sound of a tinny , but human - like voice .
“ The system produces the sound output in about 50 milliseconds .
That ’s the time it takes for sound output to come from a motor cortex command in a normal individual , ” said Guenther .
The three wires in Ramsey ’s brain are only sufficient for making vowel sounds , said Guenther .
But the researchers plan to add more electrodes , perhaps as many as 32 .
That would be more difficult to control , but would also allow Ramsey ’s thoughts to better mimic natural tongue and jaw movements , ultimately letting him form consonants as well .
For now , the computer that translates Ramsey ’s mental broadcasts is still in a laboratory .
“ But our goal is to have him transmit directly to a laptop , ” said Guenther .

David Roberts thought he was chatting online to a teenage girl but it was his wife A suspicious wife posed as a teenager online to catch her husband propositioning girls in a chatroom , Cardiff Crown Court has heard .
Cheryl Roberts , 61 , pretended to be a 14 - year - old girl and was asked by David Roberts , 68 , to meet for sex .
Roberts admitted engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and making and possessing illegal images .
He was given a three - year community order and banned from having access in person or online to under 18s .
The couple have now split up and are getting divorced .
Different computer
The court heard that mother - of - two Mrs Roberts became suspicious about the amount of time her husband was spending in his study and of a message which popped up on their computer while he was out .
While Roberts was chatting online in his study , Mrs Roberts used a different computer in the living room at their home in Pantygog , Bridgend , and pretended to be a schoolgirl .
Cheryl Roberts called the police after catching her husband propositioning schoolgirls for sex Roberts propositioned the " girl " , unaware he was chatting to his wife , the court was told .
Prosecutor Martyn Kelly told the court that Roberts , a former pub landlord who used the nickname ' Corky ' online , also used a webcam to film himself carrying out acts of indecency - which his wife could see on her PC just yards away .
Illegal images Mrs Roberts was so shocked by the behaviour of her husband of almost 20 years she brought in police , who seized his computer and found dozens of illegal child porn images .
Roberts believed he had been caught through downloading the images and did not know until weeks later that it was his wife who had called the police .
The court heard that , when interviewed , Roberts denied having sex with any schoolgirls but admitted he was " prepared to do so " .
Byron Broadstock , defending , said : " He 's brought shame on himself and his family . "
Psychiatrists ' reports said Roberts might have a brain disorder which causes him to be an exhibitionist .
Mr Broadstock said Roberts had been going through a dark patch at the time , was anxious to know why he had behaved in that way and would welcome treatment .
Claude Knights , director of children 's charity Kidscape , said : " The offences that he has committed are very serious indeed and his wife must be commended for the active part that she played in bringing him to justice . "

You may remember Rex Rammell , the long - shot candidate who is seeking to become Idaho ’s next governor , for his “ joke ” earlier this year about hunting President Obama .
Well , he is back in the news , thanks to a scheduled gathering of LDS elders he is hosting next month to discuss the Mormon prophecy that a time will come when the US Constitution will hang “ upon a single thread ” and LDS leaders will step - forward to save the nation :
The internet has been been crying “ wolf ” again .
Right now the rumor is that this design is for a future Porsche Supercar , built to pick up where the Carrera GT left off .
This concept was rendered by Emil Baddal , who is also working with Lamborghini on the successor to the LP670 .
This representation is very unique , but also seems to follow a strategy that has been going well for Porsche lately .
Its profile is a blend of a stretched G37 and a Bugatti Veyron , with a dash of P4 / P5 Italian spark thrown in .
The headlights sweep up and back , kind of like a flattened Cayenne face .
The rear deck looks a little long for a front - engine car , so perhaps we can hope for a well balanced mid-engined chassis .
The car looks cool and it ’s certainly supercar - ish .
But it may not be Porsche enough for me .
As I said , both the Cayenne and Panamera had controversial styling from the start , but they were always identifiable as Porsches .
The same was true with the Carrera GT .
I do n’t know if this concept does that .
The Carrera GT was a completely unique car , and stunning to look at .
But you also knew without a doubt it was a Porsche .
Whether or not this is Porsche ’s next supercar remains to be seen .
One thing I am certain of is that Porsche will build a super car in the next 5 years .
Their work on the 911 continues to only get better .
The Panamera is big news , and I see new Cayennes everywhere .
The performance their “ normal ” cars possess is world - class .
It would be wrong of them to deprive us of a Porsche - built , record - seeking supercar .
I imagine when there is a new Porsche super car , it will be terrifyingly fast , fantastic in the corners , unique , and beautiful .
I do n’t think the wolf is here this time , but I ’m keeping an eye out .

UPDATE : Late this afternoon , FOX News explained the erroneous report was a result of a misunderstanding .
--------
Whatever precipitated the ill feelings that the White House has toward FOX News , the network was n't doing itself any favors today .
Speaking on the morning broadcast ( see video below ) , Fox News host Martha MacCallum reported that President Obama opted to watch an HBO documentary about his presidential campaign instead of last night 's election results .
Said MacCallum :
" Robert Gibbs , the press secretary , has been speaking with some reporters and he was asked , ' So why did n’t the president watch last night ? ' "
" And Robert Gibbs said , ' Well , he was actually watching , you know , the HBO special about his year - long campaign and how it all went . '
So he was watching that last night . "
The problem with that ?
It 's not true .
Many news organizations attended the morning briefing and The Vote obtained a transcript .
Gibbs never said the president watched the documentary last night .
He was asked that question but replied that he did n't know .
He was asked if the president watched the returns .
To that , Gibbs replied that the president was not sitting in front of the TV watching them .
On the topic of the documentary , Gibbs was asked if the president liked it .
He replied that Obama had seen it before and did enjoy it .
How MacCallum came to her conclusion is a mystery .
But the damage is done .
Because as soon as the report aired , other organizations echoed the charge .
Take Newsbusters -- the conservative media watchdog organization .
They put up the video and reported what FOX said verbatim .
While the conservative " Townhall " website repackages the video , puts their logo on it , and makes it available not only their site but on YouTube .
Sure , FOX can issue a correction .
NewsBusters and Townhall can remove their blogs .
But the misinformation has already been spread .
And putting the genie back in the bottle is impossible to do .
----------
Hey , we 'll never report you if you 're watching a documentary .
But if we do , we 'll let you know about it on Twitter !
Before we get to the UFO story … how about the snow ?
As I anticipated , we got very little in Louisville as the ground was too warm as were the temperatures most of the time and the city did indeed end up wasting tax payer money by putting down the brine solution on the roadways only to see it all get washed away by rain .
But , Snow White and I spent much of last week in North Carolina with a few days at Apple Hill Farm .
It ’s a wonderful place and you should go and visit .
Llamas , Alpacas , horses , donkeys and a whole host of dogs including Knox , Magic , Chi Chi and Botox .
Apple Hill Farm near Banner Elk , NC got about 20 inches of snow .
Check out this wonderful Christmas video created during the first part of the snow storm with Knox , Magic , Chi Chi and the other animals bringing you some Christmas cheer .
The proprietor has a blog that tells of daily life at Apple Hill Farm , NC .
What ’s going on in Moscow ?
As of Sunday evening , about half of the continental United States was under snow cover .
Europe also was getting lots of snow but in Moscow , it seems that they have been under a UFO cover .
If you recall , as President Obama was in Stockholm , Sweden getting his Nobel Peace Prize , a very odd event in the sky took place over Norway .
There was a strange cloud and blue object over the region .
People were perplexed .
The Russian government announced that it was simply a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that went awry .
It was not lost on many the irony of the Russians test firing a weapon of war at the very time that people were gathering to talk about peace .
But , many people did not buy the story .
Now , it comes to light that recently that a large pyramid looking object parked itself over Kremlin City in Moscow for several hours .
Pravda reported that it was seen on December 18 .
But , apparently the pyramid event actually took place 9 days before and there are charges that Pravda deliberately changed the dates as a bit of subterfuge , which only expands that mystery of the original “ missile test ” and the pyramid story .
This video report was supposedly posted on December 11 .
The Daily Mail has three different video shots of the object and says that a former British Ministry of Defence analyst calls it “ extraordinary ” and that a spokesman from Jane ’s News says they have no idea what it is .
The Pravda report came in the last week .
But , eyebrows have been raised because the event that was seen by thousands of people and captured by at least two video cameras really happened on the eve of the Nobel Peace prize ceremony , or around the same time as the errant missile test .
Here is a night time amateur video .
Now , UFO enthusiasts claim that the two events were not coincidental nor man made .
Apparently there was also a “ wormhole ” vortex siting over China at the same time as the other two events .
They suppose that beings from other worlds are trying to send us a message .
Some say that the image which hovered over the Kremlin looked like Darth Vader ’s attack imperial cruisers .
However , there are those who make the point that the mile wide pyramid story is a hoax .
They point out that , if the object was seen by so many people , then how come there are only a handful of video views .
Others say that there is a rational explanation such as a reflection or some other optic phenomena or even a weather balloon .
There have been a rash of UFO reports in Moscow of late , one such event took place on October 7 when an odd circular cloud formation was seen over Moscow .
So , take your pick … look at the links as there are lots of videos for you to view yourself .
One way or another , there is something odd going on in Russia by the government , hoaxers or extra-terrestials !
I want to know if the pyramid was at night , how come there are daylight videos and photos ?
And how come it was n’t reported by more people or shot by professional photographers ?
Weather Bottom Line :
As expected , our best chance for snow did not happen until late Saturday with the passage of a cold front and even then there was n’t much .
The ground was too warm .
I did see some folks at church with a little snow on their cars but for me , it was all absent though it was on my car around midnight .
There will be another system ejecting through the southern stream around Christmas Eve .
At this point , it looks like the main low will be coming up out of the SW US and into the plains just to our west .
So , we get rain .
Some of the models do an odd thing and have the low get hung up in Western Illinois with a push of cold air through the Ohio Valley .
Perhaps this is an occlusion taking place but its still weird to look at on a map .
Anyway , there is some evidence to suggest the low is indeed occluding by Friday and we get wrap around snow as the low eases northeast .
Do n’t think it will be much snow but perhaps some .
Otherwise , it will be chilly but the prospects of a white Christmas are rather remote .
One thing that should be interesting is that all of that snow in the Mid Atlantic states should still be on the ground when it begins to rain on top of it around Christmas which may make for an interesting melting / rain flooding event .
Pirates are n't generally known for taking inspiration from America 's Founding Fathers , but the lone Pirate Party member in the European Parliament is calling for an Internet " Bill of Rights . "
Two weeks ago , MEP Christian Engstr�m announced that he was partnering with the Greens to work on an Internet Bill of Rights that would one day be submitted to the European Parliament — and he wanted the collective wisdom of the " swarm " to help him draft such a document .
Engstr�m 's own key principles were three : a set of fundamental rights ( privacy , etc ) , network neutrality , and " mere conduit " protection for ISPs .
It 's his view that the European Parliament may be ready to take up such a document now that it has laboriously finished hammering out the Telecoms Package , a set of reforms that included some mild protection against Internet disconnections .
He may be right , but hearing about another Internet " Bill of Rights " makes our collective eyes here in the Orbiting HQ glaze over just the teensiest little bit .
Significant Internet policies , like network neutrality , are difficult to implement ; bundling net neutrality with a list of other controversial rights ( decriminalizing P2P use , for instance ) makes such a project almost impossible to pass .
It 's not as though an Internet Bill of Rights is a new project ; indeed , the idea keeps popping up .
Just a week before Engstr�m 's announcement , Internet historian Ian Peter called for a set of " Ten Commandments " for the Internet and suggested that the UN - backed Internet Governance Forum might draft such a document .
Groups involved with the IGF have been trying to do this for years .
In 2005 , an Internet Bill of Rights was first proposed " following an appeal ( IBR , 2005 ) authored by the former chair of the European Data Protection Agencies Council , Stefano Rodot� , that highlighted the necessity of a ' Charter of the Rights of the Net . ' "
In 2006 , the call was repeated at the IGF meeting in Athens .
In 2007 , Boing Boing ( which is now excited about Engstr� 's project ) praised an IGF Bill of Rights that included " really kick - ass values . "
The Internet Rights and Principles group was formed to draft such a document and did some work between the next IGF meetings .
It is still active , but it 's not clear how much work continues to be done .
Internet - bill - of - rights.org , at one time a hub for the movement , no longer exists .
More than four years after the Charter of the Rights of the Net was proposed , no such document guides the way that governments around the world approach the Internet .
Going back even further , EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow took inspiration from a different founding document and penned the " Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace . "
The Declaration was " utopian " in more ways than one ; it singled out cyberspace as a " non-space , " a new world without borders or territory in which governments had no say .
It was also hugely pompous in its grandiosity .
" Governments of the Industrial World , you weary giants of flesh and steel , I come from Cyberspace , the new home of Mind , " it opened .
" On behalf of the future , I ask you of the past to leave us alone .
You are not welcome among us .
You have no sovereignty where we gather ...
" You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve .
You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts .
Many of these problems do n't exist .
Where there are real conflicts , where there are wrongs , we will identify them and address them by our means .
We are forming our own Social Contract .
This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world , not yours .
Our world is different . "
The Internet has muddled along pretty decently so far without any such founding documents , and past attempts at crafting them have n't come to much .
But with the ' Net becoming increasingly crucial to people 's lives , perhaps it 's time for a Bill of Rights after all .
If so , though , it faces the familiar obstacles : what organization would pass such a Bill ?
And who can agree on what it should say once you really try to include everyone : ISPs , content providers , public interest groups , law enforcement , and 4 chan ?
AMO Development Changes in 2010
The AMO team met in Mountain View last week to develop a 2010 plan .
We 've been wanting to change some key areas of our development flow for a while but we needed to make sure time was budgeted in the overall AMO and Mozilla goals .
As usual , the timeline will be tight , but the AMO developers do amazing work and as our changes are implemented , development should just get faster .
I 'll give a brief summary of the changes we 're planning ; a lot of discussion went into this and I 'm not going to be able to cover everything here .
If you 've been in the AMO calls or reading the notes you probably already know most of this .
Migrating from CakePHP to Django
This is a big undertaking and we 've been discussing it for quite a while .
We 're currently the highest trafficked site on the internet using CakePHP and along with that we 've run into a lot of frustrating issues .
CakePHP has serviced AMO well for several years , so it 's not my intention to bad mouth it here , but I do want to give a fair summary of why we 're moving on .
Please also note that AMO is still running on CakePHP 1.1 which is , I think , a year out of date ?
Three substantial issues :
Useful Database Abstraction Layer : CakePHP has a concept of database abstraction , but we did n't find it powerful enough .
When it did work it would return enormous nested arrays of data causing massive CPU and memory usage ( out of memory errors plague us on AMO ) .
When it did n't work , we 'd end up doing queries directly which kind of defeats the purpose .
We could n't use prepared statements so we'd have to escape variables ourselves .
There was no effective caching built - in and since we just had huge arrays as a response there was no effective way to invalidate the cache we were using ( see : Caching is easy ; Expiration is hard ) .
The DB layer should return objects that are easy to cache and easy to invalidate .
The built - in Django database classes ( combined with memcache ) should work fine for us here .

The built - in Django database classes ( combined with memcache ) should work fine for us here .
Effective unit tests : I 've beat the drum about our unit tests before but the simple matter is that it 's really difficult to do them right with the tools we are using .
Our test data is already very limited , but if we try to run all our tests right now they 'll run out of memory ( and take forever ) .
The CakePHP method of mocking controllers and models was inadequate for what we needed and difficult to deal with .
We want our unit tests to run quickly , from the command line , and be independent from each other so there are n't intermittent problems to waste our time with .
We 'll be using Django 's built - in testing framework .

Better debugging : Debugging in CakePHP amounts to defining a DEBUG level and seeing what is printed on the screen ( usually the giant arrays ) .
We supplemented this with Xdebug where we needed it , but that 's still not enough .
A framework should have excellent logging and on - the - fly debugging that displays a full traceback ( often something will fail deep within CakePHP and we 'll get the file / line where PHP gave up , but not the line in our code that started the problem ) , the values of variables , the page headers , server settings , SQL that was run , what views and elements are in use , etc .
We 're planning on using a combination of pdb , IPython , and the django - debug - toolbar to make all of this easily accessible while developing .
Those are the major issues we 're having right now , but if you want to dig into the comparison some more check out our discussion wiki pages , but realize the majority of discussion happened in person .
Moving away from SVN
We moved AMO into SVN in 2006 and it 's treated us relatively well .
Somewhere along the line , we decided to tag our production versions at a revision of trunk instead of keeping a separate tag and merging changes into it .
It 's worked for us but it 's a hard cutoff on code changes , which means that while we 're in a code freeze no one can check anything in to trunk .
As we begin to branch for larger projects this will become more of a hassle , so I 'm planning on going back to a system where a production tag is created and changes are merged into it as they are ready to go live .
Most of the development team has been using git -svn for several months and , aside from the commands being far more verbose , we have n't had many complaints .
We 've discovered Git is a much more powerful development tool and we expect to use it directly starting some time next year .
As of now , we expect to maintain the /locales / directory in SVN so this change does n't affect localizers but we 'll keep people notified if there are any changes to that process .
Continuous Integration
I mentioned excellent testing being one of the reasons we 're moving to Django .
Along with that testing is the opportunity for continuous integration .
We plan on using Hudson as the framework for our continuous integration .
With excellent test coverage and quick feedback from Hudson this should drastically lower our regressions and boost our confidence when we deploy .
Speaking of which ...
Faster Deployment
For most of 2009 we 've pushed on 3 week cycles .
2 weeks of development , 1 week of QA and L10n .
Delays and regressions being what they are , I think we averaged a little better than a push a month .
This is a fairly rapid cycle for a lot of development shops , but I feel like it 's holding us back .
We 've heard a lot of success stories about shorter cycles and I 'd like to aim for deployment ( optionally , of course ) of a few times per week .
By shortening the development cycle we reduce the stress of :
the developers : Everyone likes to see what they 've done go out quicker and it means less conflicts with others when the patches are smaller .

the QA team : Right now we dump 2 weeks of work on them and say we need it done right away .
With smaller cycles they can verify small changes as they go and not be overwhelmed .

the localizers :
Every time we release we dump a bunch of changes on these fantastic people and tell them we need them back in a week .
Most of the time they plow forward and get them done on time .
If they do n't though , they are stuck with waiting for the next 3 week cycle .
If we push often , it 's not a big deal .

the product managers :
These guys come up with crazy ideas for us to implement and then they stare at graphs and numbers to see if it worked .
With shorter cycles they can get faster feedback about what works and what does n't .

the users :
Faster release cycles means bugs that are fixed in the repository are fixed on the live site sooner .
' nuff said .
Process Data Offline
Much of AMO relies on cron jobs to get things done .
All the statistics , add - on download numbers , how popular an add - on is , all the star rating calculations , any cleanup or maintenance tasks - these are all run via cron and they are so intensive that the database has trouble keeping up .
We 're planning on utilizing Gearman to farm all this work out to other machines in incremental pieces instead of single huge queries .
Any heavy calculating that can be done offline will be moved to these external processors which should help improve the speed of the site and make all our statistics more reliable ( as currently the cron jobs have a tendency to fail before they are complete ) .
Improve the Documentation
Documentation is a noble goal of many developers but it rarely gets enough attention .
We evaluated our current documentation and found it is woefully out of date .
By being on a wiki that is rarely used it does n't get updated except when someone tries to use it and sees it 's not right .
We 're hoping to change that by moving the developer documentation into the code repository itself .
We 'll be able to integrate with generated API docs , style the docs however we want , and check in changes right along with our code patches .
When someone checks out a copy of AMO , they 'll get all the documentation right along with it .
We 'll use Sphinx to build the docs .
The outline above details several large , high - level changes but there are a lot of other plans for smaller improvements as well .
This post got a lot longer than I was expecting , but I 'm really excited about the direction AMO is headed for 2010 .
As these changes are implemented the site will become more responsive and reliable , and we 'll be able to adapt to the needs of Mozilla 's users even faster .
As always , feedback and discussion are welcome and stay tuned for further back end improvements .
A spate of drug overdoses reported at a Melbourne women 's prison may be a bitter pill for Corrections Victoria , but anyone who has spent time in jail would be far more sanguine about the news .
However shocking the law - abiding public may find jail overdoses , the attitude of most prisoners would be that it's a consequence of a lifestyle choice and no more than that , with the result that they almost unthinkingly risk their lives every day - and by its failure to allow needle exchange programs , the Victorian Government could be considered complicit in this .
Drugs Credit : Jason South
That little is done is scandalous .
Research shows that 50 per cent of prisoners have a history of injecting drug use and about half of these continue to inject while in prison .
If further evidence of the problem is needed , consider the fact that , in 2007 , 35 per cent of prisoners tested positive to hepatitis C antibodies - 40 times higher than in the general population .
Even more unsavoury than the attitudes of prisoners are the lengths drug users inside prison walls will go to get high .
Heroin , amphetamines , marijuana , small quantities of ecstasy and , more rarely , LSD are mostly smuggled into prisons by visitors .
Drug - sniffing dog teams circulate between prisons so drug couriers hide dope in body cavities - vaginas or backsides .
Five weeks after snubbing Canadian readers , Amazon.com announced Tuesday that it has begun shipping the Kindle e-book reader north of the border .
" We know that Canadians have been waiting for it .
We 're super - excited to bring it them , " Kindle director of product management , Jay Marine , said Tuesday morning .
He did not want to address what specifically caused the delay in getting the device to Canada .
As to why the reader is only available through Amazon U.S. , as opposed to the company 's Canadian distributor , Marine said , " It 's simply the fastest way we could get it to Canada . "
The e-book reader costs $ 259 ( U.S. ) .
Import fees are extra – Amazon 's website estimated them this morning at $ 31 per unit .
The unit ships in a week .
The Kindle comes equipped with access to 3G networks , meaning it can access your paid content outside of wireless hotspots with no additional fees .
The Kindle will have access to 300,000 book titles and more than 90 periodicals , including Canadian newspapers and magazines .
When people asked him , which they often had , why he with his love of intricate structure had never attempted a systematic exposition of the world - view which underlay his writings , his reply was that he did not do it because it had already been done by Schopenhauer .

Anti-trust probes also said underway in 14 states ...
Brad Friedman Byon

On Thursday we reported that Florida 's AG office was investigating the recent acquisition of Diebold 's voting machine unit by its larger / largest " competitor , " ES&S , for possible violations of anti-trust statutes in the state .
Today , the New York Post reports that the U.S. Dept. of Justice is also actively investigating the same thing --- along with 14 states in total --- and may " file a suit to unwind the deal " next month ...
The Department of Justice could vote down an already - completed merger of the two biggest makers of voting machines .
The Justice Department , Florida and 13 other states have opened investigations into the September marriage between Election Systems & Software and Diebold 's Premier Election Solutions , which played a controversial role in the 2004 presidential election , according to a source with direct knowledge of the process .
Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) is planning to hold hearings on the matter next month , the source said .
Even though the merger gave ES&S a whopping 70 percent of the voting - machine market share , the $ 5 million deal was too small to require government approval .
Now , the Justice Department is looking into the matter and next month could file a suit to unwind the deal , the source said .
Though the Post story seems to be based on a single , unnamed " source , " they also note that " A Diebold spokesman confirmed the Ohio ATM maker was cooperating with a Justice Department investigation . "
And while there are other " Justice Department investigation [s ] " that Diebold is also cooperating with --- as The BRAD BLOG noted early this year , when the company 's Chief Financial Officer was forced to stop down : " [ Diebold has been ] been facing a class - action securities fraud lawsuit from shareholders since 2005 ; under SEC investigation since 2006 ; and under DoJ investigation since 2007 ; and admitted overstating ' 07 earnings in early 2008 " ---
Reuters coverage of the story offers more direct confirmation of the DoJ probe of this particular matter .
" Diebold spokesman Michael Jacobsen said in an email that the company was cooperating with the Justice Department review of the sale , " they report tonight .

Bev Harris deserves much credit here , both for helping to get the anti-trust ball moving when the merger was first announced in September , as we reported at the time , but also for providing the DoJ a great deal of information , statistics , financial and legal analysis demonstrating the monopolistic nature of the sale , and the harm it presents to our already in - tatters system of election in the U.S. .

by Dan Eden for Viewzone Honey bees are dying all over the globe .
Here 's why !
Since 2007 , the media has been reporting about the dramatic loss of bees in Europe and North America .
As many as 50 % to 90 % of the bee populations have simply vanished , leaving their hives empty and forcing farmers to demand investigations to determine the cause .
At first it was only the honeybees that were decimated -- then the bumblebee populations began to disappear .
Bumblebees are responsible for pollinating an estimated 15 percent of all the crops grown in the U.S. , worth $ 3 billion , particularly those raised in greenhouses .
Those include tomatoes , peppers and strawberries .
The crisis was eventually given a name : Colony Collapse Disorder or CCD .
CCD is a " fake disease ! "
The most popular theory , aside from the varroa mite [ right ] and cellphone RF radiation , has been the belief that a virus -- similar to AIDS -- has infected the bees .
A team led by scientists from the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health , Pennsylvania State University , the USDA Agricultural Research Service , University of Arizona , and 454 Life Sciences found a significant connection between the Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus ( IAPV ) and colony collapse disorder ( CCD ) in honey bees .
A team of scientists from Edgewood Chemical Biological Center and University of California San Francisco identified both a virus and a parasite that are likely behind the recent sudden die - off of honey - bee colonies .
Using a new technology called the Integrated Virus Detection System ( IVDS ) , which was designed for military use to rapidly screen samples for pathogens , ECBC scientists last week isolated the presence of viral and parasitic pathogens that may be contributing to the honeybee loss .
But it now appears that a much more basic culprit has killed the bees -- Bayer Corporation .
Colony Collapse Disorder is poisoning with a known insect neurotoxin called Clothianidin , a pesticide manufactured by Bayer , which has been clearly linked to massive bee die offs in Germany and France .
UPDATE : April 8 , 2012
The current issue of Science Daily publishes solid proof that Bayer 's Imidacloprid is the latest culprit .
This , after initial findings that their product , Clothianidin , cause widespread bee deaths and was banned in several European countries .
Farmers were apparently encouraged to switch to a similar pesticide , Imidacloprid , which as now been found to be even more deadly .
Read about HERE " Lu and his co-authors hypothesized that the uptick in CCD resulted from the presence of imidacloprid , a neonicotinoid introduced in the early 1990s .
Bees can be exposed in two ways : through nectar from plants or through high - fructose corn syrup beekeepers use to feed their bees .
( Since most U.S. - grown corn has been treated with imidacloprid , it 's also found in corn syrup . )
In the summer of 2010 , the researchers conducted an in situ study in Worcester County , Mass .
aimed at replicating how imidacloprid may have caused the CCD outbreak .
Over a 23 - week period , they monitored bees in four different bee yards ; each yard had four hives treated with different levels of imidacloprid and one control hive .
After 12 weeks of imidacloprid dosing , all the bees were alive .
But after 23 weeks , 15 out of 16 of the imidacloprid - treated hives -- 94 % -- had died .
Those exposed to the highest levels of the pesticide died first .
The characteristics of the dead hives were consistent with CCD , said Lu ; the hives were empty except for food stores , some pollen , and young bees , with few dead bees nearby .
When other conditions cause hive collapse -- such as disease or pests -- many dead bees are typically found inside and outside the affected hives .
Strikingly , said Lu , it took only low levels of imidacloprid to cause hive collapse -- less than what is typically used in crops or in areas where bees forage . "
On January 21 , 1986 a patent was filed , and granted on May 3 , 1988 , for imidacloprid in the United States ( U.S. Pat. No. 4,742,060 ) by Nihon Tokushu Noyaku Seizo K.K. of Tokyo , Japan . [ 6 ]
On March 25 , 1992 , Miles , Inc. ( later Bayer CropScience ) applied for registration of imidacloprid for turfgrass and ornamentals in the United States .
On March 10 , 1994 , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approved the registration of imidacloprid .
It is one of Bayer 's top agricultural products .
Here 's the situation ...
One of the most important crops is corn .
It 's used as a feed for chickens and pigs and cattle .
It 's used in flour and in the production of high fructose corn syrup .
Just about everything we eat depends on corn .
Recently , with the energy crisis , corn has also been pressed to make ethanol to run our cars .
But corn has an enemy called the root worm .
( E)-1-(2-chloro-1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl)-3-methyl-2-nitroguanidine
Trade named : Poncho 600 , Prosper and Elado , a Nitroguanidine subgroup of nicotinoids produced by Bayer Corporation and registered in 2003 .
This pesky bug , called diabrotica vergifera vergifera , [ right ] burrows in the newly forming roots of the corn plant and causes the plant to wither and eventually die .
Farmers have long sought some type of pesticide to kill the bug and , in 2003 , Bayer Pharmaceutical introduced a new products called Clothianidin and Imidacloprid .
Their own studies showed that these pesticide were highly toxic to bees but justified the widespread use because it could be applied to corn seed and would be buried in the soil where it would presumably be harmless to other creatures .
In theory , farmers were instructed to buy special machines that would coat their seeds multiple times with clothianidin and a special adhesive , dry the seeds , and then plant them .
The poison is supposed to stick to the seed coat and to be toxic to the rootworm as it attempts to burrow in to the newly forming roots .
Bayer , who make the pesticide , and Monsanto , who make the adhesive , have patented the method of coating their proprietary seeds with clothianidin and imidacloprid , which are now growing all over the globe .
Oooooops !
The first clue that Colony Collapse Disorder was a simple case of poisoning -- similar to the DDT bird kill - off decades ago -- was when clothianidin was used on corn crops in Germany 's Baden - Wuerttemberg state .
In July of 2007 , the German crop was infested with the rootworm .
The German government ordered that every possible method should be used to eradicate this pest , including the use of clothianidin ( and now Imidacloprid ) .
Shortly after the seeds were planted , in May of 2008 , some 330 - million bees abruptly died !
The global phenomenon of has continued to this day .
According to the German Research Center for Cultivated Plants , 29 out of 30 dead bees had been killed , in the 2008 study , by direct contact with clothianidin .
Philipp Mimkes , spokesman for the German - based Coalition Against Bayer Dangers , said : " We have been pointing out the risks of neonicotinoids for almost 10 years now .
This proves without a doubt that the chemicals can come into contact with bees and kill them .
These pesticides should n't be on the market . "
An investigation revealed that the seed coating did not stay in the soil but was introduced to the air ( and the rest of the plant ) by simple abrasion -- the rubbing together of seeds -- as they are stored , moved and injected in to the soil by farming machines .
German authorities suggested that the seeds were not treated with a special polymer , called a " Sticker , " which makes the pesticide adhere to the seed .
But it is noted also that the formulation of clothianidin does not require this " sticker " in typical applications and most farmers find this additional coating too cost prohibitive .
The German government quickly banned this pesticide and gave compensation to the farmers and issued a strong warning against using this chemical in agriculture .
According to the German Federal Agriculture Institute , " It can unequivocally be concluded that poisoning of the bees is due to the rub - off of the pesticide ingredient clothianidin from corn seeds . "
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( May 30 , 2003 ) : According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( May 30 , 2003 ) : " Clothianidin has the potential for toxic chronic exposure to honey bees , as well as other nontarget pollinators , through the translocation of clonianidin redidue in nectar and pollen . "
[ In the same report ]
" The fate and disposition of clothianidin in the environment suggest a compound that is asystemic insecticide that is persistent and mobile , stable to hydrolysis , and has potential to leach to ground water , as well as runoff to surface waters . "
" Clothianidin is highly toxic to honey bees on an acute contact basis ( killing 50 % of tested populations at greater than 389 mg / kg ) .
It has the potential for toxic chronic exposure to honey bees , as well as other nontarget pollinators , through the translocation of clothianidin residues in nectar and pollen .
In honey bees , the effects of this toxic chronic exposure may include lethal and / or sub-lethal effects in the larvae and reproductive effects in the queen . "
Clothianidin & Imidacloprid = neurotoxins
The cigarette industry used to brag that one or two cigarettes does n't give a person lung cancer .
Likewise , the pharmaceutical companies are quick to show that feeding bees a specific amount of neurotoxins , like clothianidin and Imidacloprid , does n't kill the bees .
And , of course , this is true .
While small traces of clothianidin or imidacloprid may not kill bees outright , it can and apparently does interfere with their ability to navigate to and from the hive .
The pollen that they manage to bring back to the hive is then further concentrated and exposed to the entire colony , causing suppression of their immune systems and subsequent infection by any number of parasites and pathogens .
This is exactly what beekeepers and farmers have been reporting -- half empty , infested bees or abandoned hives with no dead bodies to be found anywhere .
It has also been noted that the empty colonies are absent the usual parasitic bugs that typically take advantage of an abandoned hive .
The colonies appear sterile .
People dressed as bees demonstrate against pesticides 21 April 2007 in front of the Bayer headquarters in Brussels .
Three millions bees have been dying each year since the introduction on the market of the pesticide manufactured by Bayer .
Poster reads :' Gaucho Bayer , only kills if one uses it . '
Not Just Corn
The tragedy in Germany and France showed that bees who became exposed to clothianidin also infected bee colonies that were not harvesting corn pollen , thus spreading the toxin to regions at some distace to areas cultivating corn plants .
It is theorized that they could have become disoriented and mingled with bees from other colonies or contaminated the pollen of plants where other bee colonies were also pollenating .
Then there is this new evidence that a similar chemical , imidacloprid , also marketed by Bayer , can produce colony collapse at levels far below those used in agriculture !
What 's going on here ?
Same old story ...
Will they ever replace the bees ?
Money talks .
Agro-business is huge and their influence is deep in the sciences and politics .
Their own scientists must know very well that their product has threatened the global population of bees , yet they allow the conspiracy theories of a mysterious " Colony Collapse Disease " to endure .
Clothianidin and imidacloprid ( another pesrticide also banned by Germany and France ) account for much of Bayer 's agrochemical profits .
I used to think of Bayer as the company that made aspirin and medicine , but I recently saw a list of poisons that they made and marketed to kill everything from microbes to insects .
It seems odd to me that a company that makes poisons also makes medical cures ...
Is there a link there ?
Perhaps it 's just different sides of the same dollar or Euro .
And then there is the Nazi connection to Bayer 's " mother " corporation , IG Farbin .
That will open a few eyes if you bother to do the research .
We need justice .
Bayer developed , manufactured , experimented and lobbied to get these pesticides on the market and they hindered their recall when proof was known about how damaging they were .
Years passed as the bees around the globe have died in large numbers .
Bayer killed the them .
Will Bayer replace all the bees ?
UPDATE ( 08 - 18 ) 18:37 PDT --
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is refusing to disclose records about a new class of pesticides that could be playing a role in the disappearance of millions of honeybees in the United States , a lawsuit filed Monday charges .
The Natural Resources Defense Council wants to see the studies that the EPA required when it approved a pesticide made by Bayer CropScience five years ago .
The environmental group filed the suit as part of an effort to find out how diligently the EPA is protecting honeybees from dangerous pesticides , said Aaron Colangelo , a lawyer for the group in Washington .
The EPA granted conditional registration for clothianidin in 2003 and at the same time required that Bayer CropScience submit studies on chronic exposure to honeybees , including a complete worker bee lifecycle study as well as an evaluation of exposure and effects to the queen , the group said .
The queen , necessary for a colony , lives a few years ; the workers live only six weeks , but there is no honey without them .
" The public has no idea whether those studies have been submitted to the EPA or not and , if so , what they show .
Maybe they never came in .
Maybe they came in , and they show a real problem for bees .
Maybe they 're poorly conducted studies that do n't satisfy EPA 's requirement , " Colangelo said .

You 're basically right .
If their ethics historically were okay with creating a chemical used to murder innocent humans for profit , then to hell with the bees , I 'm sure for what they care .
Thanks for the article . :-)
Regards , - Robert G
It 's still a little early , but some serious candidates are starting to emerge .
Here 's an early top 5 list .
1. Justin Fontaine , Minnesota - Duluth
It 's a really tough decision between Fontaine and teammate Jack Connolly .
Overall , I still think Fontaine is a bit more dangerous , though I was more impressed with Connolly this past weekend .
2. Marc Cheverie , Denver
He 's easily the most valuable player in college hockey , thanks in part to Adam Murray 's disappointing implosion .
He 's got shutouts in half of his starts this year , which is pretty impressive .
3. Matt Read , Bemidji State
He 's always been one of the best players in the CHA , but now he 's emerged as one of the best player 's in the country .
4. Mark Olver , Northern Michigan
He 's consistently put up points on a team that has n't been all that consistent this year .
5. David McIntyre , Colgate
Way more assists than goals , but he 's putting up a lot of points .
He 's also one of only four seniors in the top 20 nationally in scoring .
A couple other names to watch ...
Bill Sweatt , Colorado College -
Big point totals so far , but 14 of his 19 points have come against Michigan Tech or Robert Morris
Blair Riley , Ferris State - Multiple goals in 4 out of his 14 games .
Jeff Petry , Michigan State - He 's playing up to his abilities on a resurgent team
Brendan Smith , Wisconsin - Most talented offensive defenseman in the country .
Normally by this stage in a console generation 's lifespan , we'd have at least one eye trained on the consoles around the corner .
Not so this time .
Nope , this time there are just too many compelling reasons why the PS3 and Xbox 360 ( we 're not including the Wii in this particular debate ) should hang around for several more years at the least .
We 've jotted down the ten we think are most salient .
1 ) Modern Consoles Evolve
Avatars+REVOLUTIONISED+our+Xbox+experience+( hence , +the+' New+Xbox +Experience ' ) , +while +PlayTV+means+you+need+never+miss+an+episode+of+'Tom+Selleck's +Moustache + A- Go-Go'+again!
Remember the ( not so ) good old days when you bought a console and you pretty much knew what it could do from the outset ?
The PS2 , for instance , could play music , DVD movies and games … and that was about it .
Sure , later in its life you could get a network adapter to take it online , and it had all sorts of peripherals ( guns , microphones , guitars ) that helped evolve what it was capable of , but really , the system 's functionality did n't change a great deal from picking it up on the store shelf to retiring it to the back of the cupboard .
Fast forward to the PS3 and Xbox 360 – systems that are permanently net - connected and that have decent storage capabilities ( unless you own the Xbox 360 Arcade , in which case – go buy a 120 GB HDD for it now ) – and it's a completely different story .
Think about how these systems have changed and are continuing to change .
Since the PS3 launched , for instance , its multimedia functionality has become a whole lot more flexible – it now supports far more video formats than it originally did .
Its online service has also improved drastically , with revamped friends lists , redesigned Store interfaces and other changes , while all sorts of other things have been added over time – the trophy system , the ability to play PSone games downloaded from the PlayStation Store , upscaling PSone games , PS2 games and DVD videos , XMB functionality , and so on .
And then there are services that have been introduced , like VidZone – streaming music video clips on demand , and , which turns your PS3 into a Personal Video Recorder .
As for the Xbox 360 , well we 've seen regular updates to the system 's front end since its inception .
1080 p video output was added , the Marketplace got its own blade , Windows Live Messenger functionality was integrated in , and then we had the ' New Xbox Experience ' which was a major dashboard overhaul , introducing avatars and the ability to install games to HDD , as well as a new GUI .
Plus , while the system may not play Blu-ray discs , it has been trying to keep up in terms of SD and HD video content .
1080 p streaming has now launched in a number of territories including Australia , while the U.S. has had a decent video marketplace for ages .
Throw in Facebook , Twitter and Last.fm integration and the system 's functionality is almost unrecognisable .
2 ) Higher Development Costs Means Safer Games
Woeful+licensed+games+can+simply+be+ignored+now,+but+what+if+they+were+all+that+the+eye+could+see ?
It already costs a fair sack of cash to make a blockbuster title for PS3 or Xbox 360 .
The number of man hours that goes into the creation of something like GTA IV , Modern Warfare 2 or Uncharted 2 is insane , and total development costs can run from millions to tens of millions .
And that 's before you even start marketing and manufacturing it .
Development costs have been steadily rising since the industry 's inception , but with each new console generation it typically jumps , as all sorts of research is required to get up to speed on the new hardware , while with each new level of visual fidelity expected , asset creation takes longer and costs more .
Generational jumps tend to represent significant changes , after all .
A character that would have been comprised of a couple of thousand polygons on PS2 or Xbox for instance , jumps up to tens of thousands on PS3 or Xbox 360 .
It 's important to note , however , that progress obviously does n't stop within a generation - a car in Forza Motorsport 3 has ten times as many polygons as a car in Forza 2 , for instance .
The use of the hardware will always improve , but as soon as you jump to new hardware , the ground starts shaking beneath developers ' feet and there 's a heap if shoring up that needs to be done before things settle down , and that costs money .
The upshot is that while many developers and publishers are already reluctant to take risks with PS3 and 360 games ( because blockbusters cost so much to make ) , a new generation of consoles would require an even more significant investment , and you can bet that we 'll see a lot of licensed games and paint - by - numbers titles initially .
Conversely , the longer a system is on the market , the more streamlined development becomes and the more viable fringe titles become .
After all , the bigger the install base , the more mega niches are likely to form .
3 ) Sequel Delays
Just as development costs have been rising ever since videogames came into being , so too has the length of time it takes to develop a triple A title .
The resources required are staggering , and as soon as you move to new hardware , the longer it 's going to take to make an ambitious title .
It already takes two to three years to make a great PS3 or Xbox 360 … who wants to wait four to five years for GTA V ?
4 ) 3D Gaming Is Coming … Without New Hardware
This+would+look+so+much+cooler+in+3D.+It'd+be+like,+<i>woah+dude</i>+it's+coming+right+for+me!
3D is undoubtedly going to be one of the most significant changes to gaming over the next few years , and the good news is we do n't need new gaming hardware to do it !
The PS3 in particular seems poised to be a leading light in this area , as Sony will have the 3D TV range to really show off the capabilities of 3D gaming , and is being quite vocal in this area . : " Next year , in tandem to the Sony 3D TV product launch , PS3 also plans to launch 3D game titles , not just first - party , but we 're also actively supporting third - party 3D software development . "
The timeline for the system is for all PlayStation 3 consoles to be upgraded with firmware adding support for 3D by the fiscal year ending March 31 , 2011 .
That is HUGE news .
Whether it will be backwards compatible or not , the PS3 will be set for all new titles moving forward to support it .
3D is going to change the gaming landscape and that sexy black box ( or cheap - looking black box if you have a Slim ) under your TV has the hardware partners and the data throughput to do it all at 1080 p .
The future is not so certain for the Xbox 360 .
Sure , there are 3D titles being created for the system , such as Avatar ( which is also coming to PC and PS3 in 3D ) , but how well the system will handle 240hz 1080 p 3D and how consolidated Microsoft 's approach to the technology will be , remains to be seen .
5 ) New Control Interfaces Are Coming … Without New Hardware
There are other big things on the horizon for the PS3 and Xbox 360 aside from 3D .
Yes , we 're talking about the PS3 Wand and Natal .
How much they 'll change the landscape is obviously debatable , but the point is that in the right hands they 'll help reinvent how we interact with our consoles and our games .
As mentioned earlier , this is a generation of machines that will never grow stagnant – it's a constant evolution of functionality ; a constant process of redefining what gaming is .

So is it any surprise that more twenty - and thirtysomethings in Britain are living at home with their parents than at any time in the past 20 years ?
The Office for National Statistics says many young adults in their mid-20s and early 30s , and especially men , are increasingly postponing the transition to adulthood .
One in three " adult - kids " who have not left the parental nest say they are still living at home because they cannot afford to get a toehold on the property ladder by buying or renting .
But others , who have been dubbed kippers – kids in parents ' pockets – are , say the demographers , staying through choice .
In the past , British children have tended to leave home earlier than their European cousins but the latest ONS figures , published today , show that 25 % of men aged 25 to 29 now live with their parents .
This is almost double the proportion of women in their late 20s ( 13 % ) who still live at home .
The official statistics also show that , for more than 10 % of men who have reached their early 30s , home is still with the parents ; this compares with 5 % for women of a similar age .
The statisticians show also that among those who have left the family nest there has been a shift away from their moving in with a partner to living alone or sharing with others .
The demographers say the reasons behind the change vary according to social class , and that the last 20 years since 1988 have seen changes in the opportunities and constraints faced by young people in their transition to independent living .
On the one hand , the massive expansion in higher education has seen the number of undergraduate students triple since 1970 , from 414,000 to 1.27 million .
On the other hand , the collapse of the youth labour market during the 1980s has been followed by a continuation of high unemployment rates despite periods of relative economic buoyancy .
" The recent recession has been accompanied by a sharp increase in unemployment rates among young adults , " says an article by Ann Berrington , Julie Stone and Jane Falkingham of Southampton University , published in the latest edition of Population Trends .
The authors say that recent graduates , especially men , are increasingly returning to live with their parents after graduating .
The demographers call this group the " boomerang children " .
Their numbers are being swelled by the increasing levels of student debt they have accumulated by the time they finish their studies .
And those with few educational qualifications are increasingly facing long periods of unemployment and can't afford to leave home .
The lack of jobs is being compounded by changes in the housing market .
Even those in work cannot afford to move out of the family home as first - time buyers now face house prices that are , on average , five times average incomes , compared with a multiple of three times 20 years ago .
But they add that these factors only partly explain why people are also postponing forming families and perhaps marriage .
" It is also a reflection of the changing roles of men and women and changing expectations of normative ages for partnership and family formation , " say the authors .
" It is unclear the extent to which remaining in ( or returning to ) the parental home is an outcome of choice rather than constraint for these ' emerging adults ' . "
The authors do say that their results suggest that the transition to residential independence among young adults is becoming increasingly protracted and reversible for all age groups .
Even when they do finally leave the nest , the twenty - and thirtysomethings are still postponing the moment of settling down with a significant other .
This is borne out by the fact that the average age for forming a stable partnership and having children is rising among more affluent young adults .
The report notes : " Over the past 20 years there has been a move away from living in a new family ( especially a couple ) and a move towards living outside a family ( either alone or sharing with others ) .
" Moreover , although a minority are living outside a family at a given point in time , many more are likely to have experienced this type of living arrangement at some point during young adulthood . "
These changes mean that " many more advantaged young adults appear not ready to settle down during their 20s and are likely to return to the parental home before setting off once more " .
The social scientists add : " For this latter group of ' emergent adults ' , living with a parent may often be the preferred option until partnership or family formation . "
The study also shows up strong regional variations around Britain in the pattern of adult offspring still living with their parents .
The proportion of " kippers " is highest in Northern Ireland , the West Midlands , outer London and parts of the north - east beyond Tyneside and Wearside .
The proportion of those living at home with their parents is lowest in inner London , south Yorkshire and west Yorkshire , partly because of the greater number of colleges in the region .
Stay at home kids
• Young adults in their mid-20s and early 30s are more likely to be living with their parents in 2008 than in 1998 .
• This is more likely to happen in Belfast , Glasgow , Birmingham and outer London .
• When they do eventually leave home , young adults are more likely to be living alone or sharing with others than " settling down " with a partner .
• Young men who are unemployed are increasingly likely to be living at home in their early 20s .
• More college graduates – boomerang kids – are returning home to live with their parents in their early 20s .
• Twice as many men as women are living at home with their parents .
Detroit Probate Administration Lawyers
Since April 2000 , probate in Michigan is simpler than it used to be .
However , it still entails multiple legal filings and many other responsibilities .
Our Detroit estate administration lawyers act on behalf of heirs and personal representatives ( formerly called “ executors ” ) , handling all phases of the process .
If you have recently lost a family member and would like assistance with an estate that will be handled in a Michigan probate court , contact our firm to make arrangements for an initial consultation .
What To Know About Intestate Probate
If you pass away without a will , then the court will distribute the estate according to Michigan ’s intestate succession laws .
If you are married , your assets will pass to your spouse .
If you are not married , your assets will pass to your children , or , if you do not have children , to your parents .
However , before your estate passes to your next of kin , it will go through a lengthy court process .
This can be incredibly expensive and time - consuming for your loved ones .
It is much better to create a will to designate your beneficiaries and avoid probate .
Unsupervised Probate
In Michigan , probate is usually “ unsupervised ” – which provides a flexible and inexpensive process where the appointed administrator on behalf of the estate identifies heirs , manages assets , pays debts , files income tax returns , files required documents with the probate court , and distributes the assets according to the terms of the will .
The process may be concluded in six months , or may take years , depending on the complexity of the estate .
Supervised Probate And Probate Courts
At any time , usually when an heir or potential heir expresses a concern about the administration of the estate , the court can require that the process be “ supervised . ”
In supervised probate , every detail of administration of the estate must be approved by the probate judge .

Howard Hallis has been drawing pop culture icons , historical figures , and just about anything he can think of since 1997 .
He 's has n't stopped drawing since that year because what he 's working on is The Picture of Everything .

Over the years , Hallis has been making this picture in sections , and in some of these selections you can sorta see parts where those sections appear to have been combined ( though it could be just a fold in the paper ) :
You can find the whole picture on Hallis ' site , complete with a key to who's who and what 's what , but I warn you :
Odds are that you 'll be like me and have your mind blown by the sheer size of this " work in progress . "
[ The Picture of Everything ]
Yesterday I spent a fun day in sunny Glasgow as part of the Aye Write ! literature festival .
One of the speakers was the always entertaining and witty Steve Jones , the geneticist and writer from UCL and alumnus of Edinburgh University .
He spoke on modern aspects of evolution and genetics , but what stuck most in my mind most from his talk was nothing about science , but something on US penal policy instead .
When discussing the social behaviour of animals , Professor Jones made reference to Richard Reid , the infamous shoebomber .
Unable to be put to death , he was instead sentenced to life imprisonment in one of America ’s ‘ Supermax ’ prisons , ADX Florida .
Within these , prisoners are kept in solitary confinement under surveillance via close - circuit TV ; they are only allowed to leave their cell for one hour a day and this is usually for exercise , which has to be done alone .
Cells are soundproofed , gray and featureless , and inmates are fed on ‘ junk loaf ’ ; food containing no stimulating flavour whatsoever .
In other words , the whole experience is made to deprive all prisoners of stimuli and contact with other humans .
When Richard Reid was sentenced , the judge told him “ You will die alone , the only sound you will hear is your own whimpering ” .
“ Except , ” warned Prof .
Jones , “ No - one in these prisons ever dies with a whimper but with loud screaming , as they inevitably lose their minds . ”
Humans , like most animals , are social creatures ; we thrive and live on the contact we make with other members of our species .
Remove that contact , and we would not know what to do .
Except lose our minds and souls .
Further evidence of Supermax prison ’s damaging effects is present in this rather weighty report by Craig Hanley of the University of California , Santa Cruz .
( Unfortunately in order to read the whole thing you need access through an academic account , which is always inconvenient and silly . )
At 34 pages long , it outlines in painful detail the individual mental , physical and sociological problems caused by these intense prisons .
As such , it is more depressing then listening to Portishead whilst residing in a bedsit in Slough .
More specifically , he found that prisoners in these cells suffer from increased rates of “ Negative attitudes and affect ; insomnia ; withdrawal ; hypersensitivity ; ruminations ; cognitive dysfunction ; hallucinations ; loss of control ; irritability , aggression , and rage ; paranoia ; hopelessness ; lethargy ; depression ; a sense of impending emotional breakdown ; self - mutilation ; and suicidal ideation and behaviour . ”
So nothing too major then .
In fact , as part of his literature review , he found that “ Many of the negative effects of solitary confinement are analogous to the acute reactions suffered by torture and trauma victims , including post - traumatic stress disorder or PTSD and the kind of psychiatric sequelae that plague victims of what are called ‘ deprivation and constraint ’ torture techniques . ”
Overall it was found that all studies in which prisoners were placed in supermax prisons with no control over their release showed increased rate of mental illness .
Now , some of the more skeptical readers may ask , “ Is this the fault of the prisons themselves though ? ”
This should be addressed , as more aggressive criminals would be placed in supermax prisons and are the people more likely to suffer from mental illness .
This may account for an increased rate , but this cannot be helped and is surely worsened by the increased social stress and isolation which supermax prisons impose .
( There is also the increased rate of physical illness that occurs , which does not seem to correlate with criminal behaviour . )
To me , supermax prisons are a shame on America ’s penal system and a shocking form of punishment in a so - called developed country ; the United Nations has already described them as “ inhuman and degrading ” .
I ’m sure you ’ll join me in agreeing that penal systems are their to punish but also rehabilitate ; how the hell can this be possible when the inmates are effectively tortured for years and their mental state systematically broken down ?
If you ’re as angry as I am with this , I ’m not sure what I can suggest to improve this situation except note that there is a link to Amnesty International to the right .

The government 's controversial broadband tax has been given the green light by chancellor Alistair Darling in his pre-Budget report .
The £ 6 - a - year levy will be imposed on all households with a fixed line phone .
The money made will be put into a fund to ensure rural areas of the UK do not miss out on super - fast broadband services .
Mr Darling said the government would provide super - fast broadband to 90 % of the UK by the end of 2017 .
Announcing the tax , Mr Darling said : " We are modernising the UK 's digital infrastructure and , in the process , creating thousands more skilled jobs .
" We have provided funding to help extend the opportunities of the broadband network to more remote communities .
" We now want to go further , so we can provide the next generation of super - fast broadband to 90 % of the population by the end of 2017 . "

The broadband tax has attracted criticism from within the industry with some experts saying the fund will fall short of what is needed to provide fast broadband services to all areas of the UK .
The money is earmarked for the 30 % of homes that experts think will be by - passed by commercial fast broadband plans .
It is estimated that the broadband tax would raise about £ 170 m a year , which is some way short of BT 's estimate of £ 5 bn needed to provide super - fast fibre services to every UK home .
The Conservatives have vowed to scrap the tax if they win the next general election .
Shadow culture secretary Jeremy Hunt has been given the Conservative remit for broadband .
He has said the Conservatives will favour a market - led approach with public funds only considered once the market has taken broadband as far as it can .
Currently BT is committed to rolling out next - generation broadband to about 40 % of the UK with Virgin Media offering speeds of up to 50 M bps ( megabits per second ) to about half of UK homes .

“ Morning Joe ” co-host Joe Scarborough on Wednesday reacted with disbelief to reports that President Donald Trump had tried to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions to walk back his recusal from the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election .
Scarborough was particularly appalled by Trump believing that Sessions ’ primary job as attorney general was to protect him personally from falling into legal jeopardy .

“ I think it ’s so cute that this president thinks that attorney generals are supposed to be their personal lawyers , ” he said .
“ And by cute , I mean completely ignorant — something that a four - year - old , while smearing chocolate on the side of a wall , might think .
That ’s actually not cute at all .
Not cute at all .
Actually pretty depressing . ”
Scarborough also found himself stunned at reports that Trump refused to return Sessions ’ phone calls in the wake of his recusal from the Russia probe .
Panelist Kasie Hunt said that Trump ’s refusal to return Sessions ’ calls struck her as unbelievably childish .
“ It is an extraordinarily petty way to react to something , ” she said .
“ And give Jeff Sessions some credit here for doing the right thing on actually recusing himself . ”

The Electronic Commerce Protection Act , Canada 's anti-spam bill ( Bill C - 27 ) passed through the House of Commons yesterday as a motion to support sending the bill to the Senate received approval .
The bill received all - party support but will undoubtedly face an intense lobbying campaign at the Senate .
Copyright lobbyists , real estate agents , and marketing survey companies were among the most aggressive lobby groups seeking changes when the bill was considered by the Industry Committee .
Clement stood his ground and the resulting bill is a good one .
Indeed , the lobbying efforts and attempts to weaken the bill did not go unnoticed .
During yesterday 's discussion in the House , NDP MP Brian Masse , the party 's representative on the Industry Committee , noted " when it gets to the Senate we will see whether or not there is going to be another lobby effort either to kill the bill or to weaken it some more . "
Meanwhile , Liberal MPs who failed to garner support for their reforms were still pressing for changes .
MP Siobhan Coady stated " while the Liberal Party believes the bill remains unnecessarily restrictive to legitimate business in its approach in many regards , we will support the bill at third reading as action must be taken against spam .
We will monitor the legislation closely going forward to ensure that it does not stifle legitimate electronic commerce in Canada . "
Getting C - 27 through the House is a big step , but the lobby attempts to water down the bill will no doubt be back for another round as the bill hits the Senate .
This is an open letter to Hollywood movie producers , studios , directors and anyone else out to inadvertently ruin the cartoons , video games & toys that I grew up with by creating and releasing terrible films .
Stop .
Just stop it already .
There are tons of talented screenwriters out there that have written some great original work .
Give them a chance .
You 'll spend less and you 'll no longer be destroying the building blocks of my childhood entertainment .
I think I speak for most of my generation ( somewhere between generation X and generation Y ) in this regard .
Hollywood , I understand that you have optioned at some point a Thundercats CGI live - action movie .
I first read the news a couple years ago , but now it seems that this movie is slated for 2010 and is currently on hold .
I implore you , do not destroy this honorable franchise with some over the top action movie that makes no sense and loses the focus of the original cartoon .
Lion - O deserves better than to be mangled on screen in some sort of twisting of the Thundercats struggle to be a family and fight the annoyingly cunning Mum-ra .
I think you recently learned that lesson with the horrendous crap fest that was Speed Racer .
Let 's take a look at just a select few of the other piles that you , Hollywood , have released over the years that have played their part in figuratively burning the entertainment staples of my childhood into ash , in my opinion of course .
Scooby - Doo & Scooby - Doo 2 : Monsters Unleashed
Who had the bright idea to actually keep Fred 's afghan ?
The film version was updated from the 1969 original series , but yet , Fred still was wearing an afghan .
How did any of those kids make it out of primary school ?
In the cartoon , the stereotypes embodied by each of the four human characters was comical and endearing .
On film , it was just lame .
The jokes were dull and the animated Scooby may as well been drawn with crayon .
In my opinion , this movie helped to ruin the careers of all those involved , and send Freddie Prinze Jr. straight to DVD purgatory .
It was n't all bad , the self deprecating jokes were appreciated , but should a film based on a classic cartoon really have to make fun of itself to be appealing ?
It was a success though , as the kids enjoyed it .
The first film grabs a 28 % rating on Rottentomatoes.com which shows that anyone old enough to use the internet did n't really dig on it .
Transformers & Transformers 2 : Revenge of the Fallen
The animated Transformers movie was awesome .
You know , the one released back in 1986 .
This film capped off one of the greatest cartoon series ever .
While Optimus Prime and friends have seen many iterations over the years , none has been so over the top as the recent live action CGI feature films .
Yes , at one point this year I did endorse leaving work early to go see Transformers 2 but that does n't mean I loved the films .
Though # 9 on that list still makes their existence worth it .
Hollywood knew they had to get these ones right otherwise risk the wrath of fanboys everywhere .
While the transforming was awesome , the obnoxious over the top and destructive action sequences were a little much .
Try counting how many innocent people were killed in the battle scenes on the city streets .
Is that a requirement in a Michael Bay film ?
The gritty & sweaty filmography and commercialism for General Motors ruined these movies for me , and consequently by proxy , the cartoon itself .
The first film gets a 56 % rating on Rottentomatoes.com while the second gets a lousy 19 % proving that in order to make a sequel , you do n't have to tack on an extra 30 minutes of nonsense and a Transformer with a cane .
Super Mario Bros .
Now as an adult I can look back on this disaster and appreciate it for it 's camp value similar to remembering the first time I got struck out in baseball .
At the time , I was baffled , confused and wondering what just happened .
But now , I see that there is an inherent lesson in all of it .
A moment of clarity ensues .
That is , if you are going to make a movie based on a classic video game - make sure it at least makes sense , a little bit .
Instead we got some strange dark back lot production that turned Koopa into the creepy guy at the park and the Mario Bros .
into slack jawed plumbers amazed that they can walk upright .
So much has been said about this waste of film over the years , that I really can't say much more .
It was the first movie made that was based on a video game and should have been the last .
Most importantly , it was based on Mario Bros. , which was THE video game of my youth and completely brought me into the fold of the gaming world .
Even the actors ( some of whom were praised for their performances ) regretted being in the film .
Says Bob Hoskins , who played Mario , " The worst thing I ever did ?
Super Mario Brothers . "
Super Mario Bros. has an 11 % rating on Rottentomatoes.com earning a solid spot on Time Magazines list of top 10 worst video game movies ever .
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles I - III
While the first movie was like someone scratching a record and a chalkboard simultaneously , it was still fun .
The silliness of the cartoon was there , but the effects were n't ready for that kind of film which caused it to become something of a farce .
The second and third films were strictly overkill .
Or should I say roadkill ?
While the second film was successful , the third bombed and seemed to have been written by scared and tired fourth graders .
These movies added realism to a cartoon that was no where near realism .
The magic of the cartoon is you could have turtles that mutated and grew up to be ninjas , trained by a giant rat .
Turning that into film , with the rubberized costumes just tore apart the illusion and fantasy with supposed realism .
Only with the 2007 release of the animated TMNT film did Hollywood get it right .
Keeping with the animation brought the franchise back to life properly and with respect .
The first movie ranks at 46 % on Rottentomatoes.com while the second and third come in at 36 % and 32 % respectively .
The Turtles casual attitude towards violence and their campy idiotic behavior was easily overlooked in a cartoon , not so much when they became " real . "
Masters of the Universe
Where Conan succeeded in portraying the exploits of a mostly naked large sword wielding barbarian fighting off supernatural bad guys , Masters of the Universe failed miserably .
Frank Langella , clearly lost on his way to brunch , somehow ended up in the role of Skeletor .
While the film did star a young Courtney Cox , it also starred the square jawed Chelsea Field as Teela , not wearing the traditional slave girl type outfit , but instead fully clothed and stomping on my prepubescent fantasies .
A whopping 17 million was the eventual take home , which paid the bill of 17 million to create the film .
Really , filming in damp alleyways and creating a magical keyboard cost 17 million ?
Or was that just the cost of baby oil for Dolph Lundgrens ' chest ?
Masters of the Universe holds a 13 % rating on Rottentomatoes.com and is possibly the most blatant destruction of a toy line from my youth .
G.I. Joe : Rise of Cobra
I stand corrected .
This movie is the most blatant destruction of a toy line from my youth .
As a stand alone action film that has nothing to do with G.I.
Joe , it might have been a tiny bit better and not open to such criticism from self righteous geeks such as myself .
Of course it was a huge success at the box office , even though the previews themselves ensured I would not be forking over any cash to see this movie in theaters .
The original G.I . Joe team did not need power suits .
They completed the mission on skill and teamwork ( thankfully one of the values that actually did make it into the film . )
The mix of slow - mo and outrageous action with unpredictable and incoherent flashbacks left me checking the time status to see how much was left in the film .
This was n't G.I. Joe , this was " Tough Action Guys in Power Suits Against Bad Guys with Nanotechnology . "
The look they gave Cobra Commander and the Baroness ' struggle with her inner demons was the icing on the crap cake .
Oh , and if your top secret hideout is infiltrated by the enemy - why would you then return to your now not - so - top secret hideout ?
I know there will be a sequel , but Hollywood , I would n't count on the same turnout .
At least learn from Transformers 2 . I know we have .
Oh , and Channing Tatum is about as engaging as an actor as a can of beans .
G.I. Joe : Rise of Cobra garners a 36 % rating on Rottentomatoes.com which would cause Sgt. Slaughter to break something , or someone .
At least he got a small check .
Dishonorable mentions go to the recent Dragonball Z disaster ( not exactly a cartoon I grew up with but terrible nonetheless , ) the Flintstones movies which actually were n't that bad because the cartoon itself was based on a television show , Underdog and the forgettable Garfield movies .
Why was Odie a real dog but Garfield was animated ?
Weak .
I implore you Hollywood , learn from these examples .
Cease trying to make new films based on staples of my youth .
It tears a piece of my geek heart each time you take a beloved and enjoyed franchise and destroy it with your misguided attempts at reinventing it on film .
I know you are trying to get a He - Man live - action remake made .
Do n't bother .
And while the CGI in a Voltron Movie would probably be pretty damn awesome , leave it alone .
By the power of Greyskull , go back to making original films with well written screenplays instead of big budget flops based on classic cartoons and toys .
I know , you 've made some money off some of these films , but does it always have to be just about the bottom line ?
Entertain us , do n't bludgeon us with our childhood memories .
Hollywood , I thank you for your time .
What were some of your favorite toy lines or cartoons that were destroyed by Hollywood ?
Or have you heard something I have n't in regards to future films ?
Please let me know in the comments !
When we look upon the typewriter , we tend to think of it as a somewhat romantic , antiquated technology for the English major in us to write that great mystery novel we 've been toying with -- not something we 'd imagine anyone would still be using in a professional setting .
Unfortunately for New York 's boys in blue , that 's exactly the situation they find themselves in .
According to NY Post , the city has plunked down $ 982,269 in a contract with New Jersey - based Swintec to provide thousands of new manual electric typewriters bound for NYPD offices over the next three years , with another $ 99,570 going to a company for maintaining the current lineup .
While arrest reports have thankfully gone the way of computers , property and evidence vouchers continue to be written up out the old fashioned way , with officers complaining about having to seek out ribbons when they ( often ) run dry .
In some way , it 's kind of funny ... but mostly , it 's just sad .

NEW Update ( 2018 ) : Since I 'm brewing less beer these days , I went back to my original method of saving the yeast cake in multiple plastic containers in the fridge .
When I was brewing a lot more beer , I was going through a lot more yeast , so the second method worked a little better at the time .
I just needed to plan ahead and make a starter a couple days before brew day .
Now that I do n't plan out my brew days as much and just brew as I have time , being able to grab a portion of a saved yeast cake out of the fridge is more convenient .
Both methods work very well , so either will work for you depending on how often you brew and what fits best into your process .
Update :
When I was brewing a lot more often & ten gallons at a time , I started " saving " yeast a little differently than previously mentioned on this site .
Both methods work great and save a ton of money on yeast , but I find my new method to be a good way to preserve the quality of the yeast in case you wo n't be re-pitching it for awhile .
Both methods are solid , so choose whatever best fits your brewing schedule / system .
Yeast Starter Method ( NEW )
A friend of mine in the beer club mentioned using 2 - liter plastic bottle blanks / preforms for saving yeast , and he knew someone at a plastic manufacturing plant that gave him a case of their " defects " which just means they did n't quite meet weight & size specifications .
I decided to try it out .
The nice thing about this method is that I feel much more comfortable saving yeast this way for extended periods of time .
Since there is n't as much trub / break material and no hops to worry about , you have a pretty clean specimen of yeast .
This method requires a little more thinking ahead since you should ( need ) to make a starter a day or two before your brew .
I say " need " because 1 vial of saved yeast is n't really enough to pitch directly into a batch of anything higher than 1.030 starting gravity .
You could always pitch a couple vials if you do n't have time to make a starter though .
If you do n't want to make a starter , consult the yeast calculator on MrMalty.com .
I typically make a 800 - 1000 ml starter using 1/2 cup DME for an average ( 1.040 -1.060 ) batch of beer .
Make a large ( 1500 - 2000 ml with 1 cup DME ) yeast starter , chill , and pitch your vial / smack - pack of yeast Allow the starter to ferment out completely .
This usually takes 2 - 3 days , and you 'll know it 's done when the yeast drops out and your wort / beer clears up .
Sanitize a small funnel and 5 - 6 yeast caps & vials ***
Position the sanitized vials in a container that allows them to sit upright for filling Pour out mostly all of your starter wort / beer , leaving only enough to swirl the yeast into suspension .
This usually takes a little getting used to , but you can eyeball it the first time .
Sanitize the lip of your starter flask , swirl the slurry in the bottom to get everything into suspension , then funnel the slurry into your vials .
Screw on your caps and label the vial with the strain of yeast it contains
Where to find the Vials ?
I did a search for these vials online and they can be a little difficult to find .
The plastic caps can be purchased at several online homebrew stores like Northern Brewer , MoreBeer , and Midwest Supplies .
You can also save and reuse White Labs vials if you have some sitting around .
Here 's a link Shawn P. sent me via email after reading through this tutorial of where to get vials :
Shawn also tested out some 50 ml centrifuge tubes that he said are easy to find and worked great .
Here 's the link to those for anyone interested in giving them a try : - http://www.novatech-usa.com/
Products / Plastic - Centrifuge - Tubes Harvesting Yeast Cake
The question of how to save and reuse yeast gets brought up on a lot of online homebrew forums , so I thought that I 'd write up a little how - to to show people what 's worked for me .
Before You Start Quick Tips : * SAFETY TIP *
I only use plastic containers to save yeast because they can withstand the pressure that sometimes builds up with saving yeast .
That way , I can have a completely sealed container and not worry about any funk getting in .
If you choose to go with glass , make sure you do n't completely seal the vessel .
Use a stopper with an airlock or some other method that will allow pressure to escape .
Make a 6 gallon batch of beer when you know you 're going to save the yeast cake .
When you transfer your beer into the fermenter , leave the last gallon of break material and hops behind so it does n't end up in the saved yeast slurry .
Always pitch up in gravity
Only save yeast for 2 to 3 generations to avoid mutations
Even when using plastic containers for your yeast , you should vent the pressure on these every 2 - 3 weeks in the fridge just to release extra pressure .
I 've made the mistake of not venting pressure on these over time , only to end up with a yeast volcano that I can't use on brew day .
What 's Needed to Save Yeast ?
All you need to save yeast is a few 16 oz plastic beer bottles ( as seen above ) , a funnel , some type of label , and an empty 6 - pack holder .
The reason I use plastic bottles instead of glass is simple .
Even though the yeast will be stored in the refrigerator , they are still working and putting off CO2 at the lower temperature .
The plastic bottles can handle quite a bit of pressure without bursting .
When I pull the yeast out of the fridge on brew day , often times the bottle is under quite a lot of pressure and is very hard to press in on .
How Long Can the Yeast be Saved Before Use ?
I typically try to reuse my yeast within a month or two , but I 've heard of people using it several months later without any problems .
If you have saved yeast for longer than 2 or 3 months , it would probably be best to make a starter to check if the yeast is still viable ( which it almost definitely should be ) .
I 've had good luck pitching straight from the bottle at least 2 months after saving the yeast .
When Should the Yeast be Saved ?
I like to keep mostly all of my beers in the primary fermenter for at least 2 weeks .
This gives the yeast plenty of time to eat through the sugars and clean up any of their byproducts .
It also allows the yeast to drop out of suspension so you can be sure you 're getting most of the yeast at the bottom of the fermenter .
What Type of Beers Can Yeast be Saved From ?
I typically save yeast from lower gravity beers like English Bitters , Scottish 60 /- , American Wheat , Cream Ales , Blond Ales , etc .
By saving yeast from lower gravity beers , you are putting less stress on the yeast and ensuring that what you end up with will be fresh and wo n't produce any off - flavors .
NOTE : Always try to pitch up when saving yeast .
For example , do n't pitch a yeast slurry from a 1.060 beer onto one that 's 1.040 .
You may experience some off - flavors when doing this .
Also , I usually do n't save any yeast from beers over 1.060 as a general rule .
By that point , the yeast may start producing undesirable flavor characteristics .
I also only usually save 2 or 3 generations of yeast before starting over .
When saving yeast at home you can only be so clean and will likely cause some yeast mutation down the road .
I remember having a slurry of WLP002 that was a few generations old and the beer I made with it tasted more like a Belgian .
It was n't infected , but the flavor profile of the yeast had definitely mutated .
Yeast Saving Procedure
Now that I 've given you a little background on what you need to get started , here 's my procedure for saving yeast : Sanitize three 16 oz plastic beer bottles along with the other equipment you use to transfer your beer .
Siphon your beer off the yeast cake , but be sure to leave about 1 / 2 inch of beer behind to help get the yeast back into suspension .
Once the beer has been siphoned off the yeast cake , arrange the sanitized beer bottles in the empty 6 - pack holder .
You can see how I distribute them above .
With the lid on your fermenter , swirl the bucket to get the yeast back into suspension with the little bit of beer you have left .
If you still have chunks of yeast sticking to the bottom , use a sanitized spoon to stir them into your slurry .
If you 're using a bucket for a fermenter , be careful not the scratch it with the spoon .
A plastic spoon would be your best bet here .
When you have gotten your beer and yeast mixed up into a slurry , place your sanitized funnel into the plastic beer bottles and begin filling them up .
I find that I can fill three 16 oz beer bottles from a standard yeast cake .
You may want to sanitize an extra bottle if it 's your first time saving yeast .
I typically will fill each bottle about 3 / 4 of the way and then go back if I have any yeast slurry left over .
Once the bottles are filled , screw down the sanitized cap fairly tight to ensure a proper seal .
Dry off the top of the cap and apply a label that gives the strain of yeast and the date it was saved .
I like to use the little round garage sale stickers that come in a variety of colors .
This helps me keep track of the different strains easily .
The above pictures show what the yeast slurry looks like after it 's settled and been in the fridge for awhile .
You can distinctly see the yeast on the bottom of the bottles .
The pictures on the right show the different strains of yeast that are stored in my kegerator .
Reusing Saved Yeast UPDATE ( 2/7/2014 ) - I 've had a few people email me about how long the saved yeast lasts in the fridge .
I typically like to use the yeast within a few months in an ideal world .
That being said , the longest amount of time I 've held the yeast for has been about 6 months .
After that , I 'd probably just get a new yeast packet from the homebrew shop and start over .
Also , the bottles can build up a good amount of pressure and it can be hard to get them open without the yeast spraying all over the place .
On brew day , take your yeast slurry out of the refrigerator and slowly unscrew the lid .
Depending on the yeast you saved , it may just sit there or it could try to explode out of the bottle .
I 've had both happen to me .
If you want , you can pour off some of the beer that 's sitting on top of the yeast , but I usually pour the whole thing into the new wort .
Let the yeast warm up to around room temperature so you do n't shock it when pitching it into your fresh wort .
I 've actually forgotten to take the yeast slurry out of the fridge until right before I pitched , and I did n't notice any off - flavors by pitching cold .
It 's just better for the overall yeast health if the slurry is close to the temperature of the wort .
For beers with a medium starting gravity ( 1.050 to 1.065 or so ) I will pitch one of my saved slurries , or 1/ 3 of a yeast cake .
There 's a really nice yeast calculator on Mr. Malty ( Jamil Zainasheff 's Website ) that calculates how much yeast you should pitch depending on your starting gravity .
Personally , I do n't use this website but several people do with great success .
If a beer is over 1.075 , I typically pitch 2 slurries and call it a day .
Before I pitch the yeast , I 'll give the bottle a good shake .
This gets everything suspended and makes it easier to get all the yeast into your new batch of wort .
After that , just follow your normal fermentation procedure .
If you have any questions about saving yeast or anything else , please feel free to contact me at the email address listed on the bottom of this page .
Thanks for looking and happy brewing !

In the video here , members of a CFR symposium admit they are flummoxed by “ crazy people ” telling the truth about flu vaccinations on the internet .
The CFR says it has to get its act together and dispense more palatable propaganda — for instance , that there is more mercury in a tuna sandwich than the flu shot .
When was the last time you injected a tuna sandwich directly into your bloodstream ?
One has to wonder if the members of the CFR symposium actually believe this nonsense or if they are peddling it because they think it will sell vaccines to the sheep .
The 1500 percent increase in autism since 1991 is directly related to thimerosal in vaccines , not the consumption of tuna salad .
[ efoods ]
It is not clear if the academics in the video got their shots .
If they believe the vaccine is safe and we are crazy , they should grab their kids and rush down and ask for a shot from one of the multi- dose bottles of the H1N1 vaccine , which contain thimerosal .
In New York , all injectable versions of the shot will contain thimerosal .
We should n’t expect the CFR to tell us the truth about the danger of vaccines .
For instance , the Norwegian Medicines Agency is reporting that people are suffering serious side effects from the Pandemrix vaccine .
“ Numbness , dizziness , loss of taste and sense of smell , nausea and watering , are some of the first reported side effects of the swine flu vaccine in this country , ” Dagbladet , a Norwegian newspaper reports .
The Norwegian Medicines Agency has received reports that 21 people have suffered serious or unusual side effects .
“ In addition Medicines Agency said that many patients have struggled to come forward with reports of side effects . ”
In other words , the true number of people suffering from side effects remains to be seen .
However , numerous cases of serious reactions to the vaccine are now appearing , although the corporate media plays these down as rare occurrences .
No matter .
The CFR , the CDC , and the government expect you to play Russian roulette with your health .

The heavy - handed tactics used recently by police against G20 protesters in Pittsburgh has Constitutionalists up in arms once again about the government 's infringement upon the human right of free speech , which is protected by the First Amendment .
If anyone knows anything about America , it is supposedly this — all Americans have the right to free speech .
But just when , exactly , are we justified in exercising this right ?
Is every American permitted to say whatever he wants , whenever he wants , wherever he happens to be ?
Can I come into your home and read aloud The Ethics of Liberty from cover to cover while you have no recourse but to submit to my demand ?
Can I organize a peaceful assembly at the 50 - yard line of Soldier Field during the middle of a professional football game ?
Can I march into an NBC studio and demand that they break into programming so I can petition the government for a redress of grievances ?
I assume you answered in the negative for the above three questions .
But what is the common denominator in the justification for " denying free speech " in each of those questions ?
The common denominator is property rights .
The right to freedom of speech is completely dependent upon property rights .
I do not have the inalienable right to say whatever I want if I am standing in your house .
Soldier Field and NBC studios are also private properties wherein permission must be granted from the property owners in order for others to use their facilities to " exercise free speech . "
Individual property rights are absolutely essential to free speech .
If you have no place to stand upon the face of the Earth that is yours , then you cannot exercise your inalienable right to free speech without the permission of the owner of whatever property on which you find yourself .
And any such " rights " given by permission can be rescinded at any time .
But what about public property ?
Is n't that supposedly " owned " by everyone ?
That 's what they say , but this nonsensical , communistic ownership concept absolutely fails to guarantee free speech .
You say we all own the sidewalk and street in front of city hall ?
Really ?
Then how do I get permission from the other property owners ( everyone who is not me ) in order to protest on the public land outside of city hall ?
Do I need everyone 's permission ?
In that case , no protest will take place .
Do I just need the majority ?
Then the minority are n't really owners , since they cannot do what they wish with their own property .
Or do I need no one else 's permission ?
Can I do whatever I like on the sidewalk and street because I " own " a miniscule fraction of them ?
Hint : None of the above .
Our solution to public property is to give the responsibility for maintaining these commons to government bureaucrats ( GBs ) .
We do n't get to vote on how each piece of commons will be utilized each and every hour of each and every day 'we instead elect GBs to handle that responsibility .
Now the intended use for sidewalks and streets is for people to travel from Point A to Point B .
If a giant sinkhole were to open up in front of city hall and swallow a big chunk of sidewalk and street , the public would certainly demand that the GBs repair it so it could be returned to its functional state .
When GBs see a public demonstration clogging the sidewalk and street , they view it the same as a sinkhole : " Our job is to keep these transportation corridors open and functional , and so we must act to restore their intended functionality . "
This is all perfectly reasonable .
They are paid with tax dollars to do exactly that .
If they give preferential treatment to some groups over others or allow for sidewalks and streets to be used for something other than their intended function , then they are not fulfilling their duties .
The lowest common denominator must be satisfied , because everyone is paying for the public land , and so everyone must be given the same service .
Of course the practical end result of this is that the government in effect owns the public commons .
If you wish to exercise free speech on its property , you must have its permission .
You have no inalienable right to speak your mind on public property , because it is not yours .
Please let that sink in .
" I helped pay for the sidewalk " is NOT equivalent to " I own the sidewalk . "
" We all own the sidewalk " is NOT equivalent to " I own the sidewalk . "
And if you do n't own the sidewalk , James Madison , then you have no inalienable rights to exercise there .
Now let 's move back to " private " property .
Consider the citizens who " own " property in the form of land — all paid off with title stashed away in the safety deposit box down at the bank .
Surely they can enjoy their human right to exercise free speech on their own land , can't they ?
Well , actually , no .
In this country , all land is rented from the government .
If property taxes ( rents ) are not paid , then the government can exercise its ownership prerogative upon the land and eject the tenants .
The government also holds the Eminent Domain card .
There is no such thing as private land in the United States .
So you see , property tax is the fee charged by the government for the " land owners " of our country to engage in " free speech " upon " their land . "
This is not free speech , but rather " fee speech . "
You can say whatever you want while you sit on your couch as long as you keep paying the government for the privilege to do so .
This is your very own little " Fee Speech Zone " that you have temporarily leased from the government .
There is no free speech for you in the United States of America , because you have no place to stand within its borders that you can call your own .
You must ask or pay for government permission to speak ( and work , and travel , and — but I digress ... ) .
As witnessed on the streets of Pittsburgh , the government can exercise its prerogative to restrict , throttle , and forbid fee speech on its property , and you , my friend , are on government property right now .
Fee speech is all you 've ever had .
You can have a government , or you can have inalienable rights .
Choose one , but then please , do not complain that you do not have the other .
Frustrated by Premier Dalton McGuinty 's refusal to hold public hearings on the controversial 13 per cent HST , the 25 - member Progressive Conservative caucus stormed out of the Legislature 's daily question period today shortly after it began .
" You have lost touch , " Conservative Leader Tim Hudak told McGuinty before the stunt took place , accusing the Liberals of being afraid of a public backlash over the tax .
" If Premier McGuinty is going to show that level of contempt for taxpayers by forcing through the largest sales tax grab in the history of this province without any kind of public hearings . . . we see no point in proceeding with question period today . "
The tax takes effect next July 1 and will combine the 8 per cent provincial sales tax with the 5 per cent federal GST into a 13 per cent harmonized sales tax .
The move means an extra 8 per cent tax on thousands of items such as gasoline and veterinarian 's bills , to name just two examples .
While McGuinty said the tax will streamline costs for business and be offset for most people by income tax cuts , Hudak maintained the day - to - day costs will mount up for ordinary citizens .
" They can not handle another massive sales tax increase . "
He would not call on the federal Conservative government , which is giving Ontario $ 4.3 billion to implement the HST , to hold public hearings and would not say what his own party would do with the tax if elected in the 2011 province - wide vote .
The Tories ' protest left nine bewildered New Democrat MPPs as the only opposition in the House .
It was left to New Democrat Leader Andrea Horwath to hammer McGuinty on the harmonized sales tax for most of the 48 minutes that remained in question period when the Tories stormed out .
The New Democrats , who also oppose the HST and want public hearings on the issue , said Monday that the provincial Conservatives should convince their federal cousins in Ottawa not to pass legislation that would allow Ontario to harmonize its sales tax .
" If the Tories really want to do something productive they can go talk to Stephen Harper and tell him not to pass the enabling legislation in the federal House , " NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said , referring to the Conservative prime minister .
" New Democrats believe it 's extremely important to bring the voices of the people into this legislature and let the government know what the people are telling us about their concerns with the HST . "
Outside the house , Hudak acknowledged his party 's opposition to the HST stands in stark contrast to the federal Conservatives , but said his job is to focus on the Ontario government 's actions , not Ottawa's .
" My federal colleagues will make their own decisions , " he said .
`` Our battle is to stop this massive sales tax grab here . "
People across the province view the HST as a " greedy tax grab , " and are encouraging his party to use every tactic it can to force public hearings , said Hudak .
" Outraged taxpayers are encouraging us to use any tools that we have at our disposal to make sure that we have public hearings on this bill , " he said .

The government is expected to extend the fall session closer to Christmas to pass the HST legislation in time to deliver personal and corporate tax cuts meant to soften the impact of harmonization .
Those cuts would kick in on Jan. 1 , six months ahead of the HST .

If you ask anyone what makes a blog popular , they ’ll say content .
No matter how many clever headlines tell you otherwise , content is still king .
If your content does not offer value in one way or another , people will simply not visit your site .
The two steps to building a successful and popular blog are simply : writing great content and having people talk about it .
Blog ’s do n’t grow on their own ; they grow through people sharing them .
By having people “ talk about ” your content , I simply mean people sharing your content .
This could be via word of mouth , Twitter , Facebook , or even a link from their own blog .
The latter example , surprisingly ( or not ) is what I ’m going to look at today .
What are the most popular posts on the top blogs out there ?
What are they writing that gets people talking and linking to them ?

Based on the findings here , you can apply the results to your own blogging ventures and produce the type of content that you know people respond to .
After all , it ’s been proven to work for these guys , so why should n’t it for you ?

3 Key Things I ’ve Learned
Hopefully with these 20 examples you have tons of ideas for blog posts in your industry .
Although this took me hours to put together ( and to find the most linked to blog posts ) I believe there is more than enough value in this post to make up for it .
Here are three things that really stood out for me while writing and researching this article :
1. Length Matters –
What you say is far more important than how much you say , but length does matter ( do n’t worry , I wo n’t be putting penis englargement links here ) .
The longest post had 9,334 words while the shortest only had 232 .
On average , however , the posts had 1,610 words .
I do n’t know about you , but the majority of blogs I see do n’t put 1,610 words worth of value into their posts .
Maybe it ’s time to start ?
2. Resource Posts Get Links –
This actually amazes me , but blog posts that just linked to other blog posts ( on the same sites ) managed to get thousands of links .
Of course it helps if you have an established blog already , but I ’m surprised other bloggers are linking to these pages .
This is definitely something I ’m going to incorporate into my own sites in the future .
3. Show How to Utilise Services – A good majority of these 20 posts were showing people how to utilise services — whether that was social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter , or stats programs like Google Analytics .
If you can teach people how to get the most out of a service , it seems like they are more than happy to talk about you .
Of course , it would be best to pick something relevant to your niche rather than just the examples posted here .
So , 2,250 words later , I ’ll find out if this blogging analysis has helped me write blog posts that get links .

Today is the last day of the first decade of the 21st century and third millenium .
Please do n’t get pedantic on me about there not being a year zero and therefore the decades begin with years ending in 1 and not 0 .
I know the whole story – I choose to count my decades ( like most people ) from 0 - 9 .
The 70s does not include 1980 .
It does not seem like we have yet reached a consensus on what to call this past decade – the “ aughts ” , the “ naughties ” or what .
In any case I would like to muse about science and skepticism over the last 10 years as I did about 2009 earlier this week .
Rather than consider single news items , since we are covering an entire decade I want to write about those big issues that skeptics have dealt with over the last 10 years , and sum up how I think it went .
My goal is to offend as many people as possible ( not really , but I often feel as if it might as well be ) .
9/11 Truthers
This was the decade of the 9/11 truth movement – of course because 9/11 happened in 2001 .
But 9/11 truth can also stand in for any big evil government conspiracy .
The first half of the decade the truthers made their biggest impact , and polls at the time ( polls are tricky , but taken at face value ) indicate that as many as a third of Americans thought the Bush administration had something to do with 9/11 .
Whether this meant it was an inside job , or they were just covering up their own incompetence is where interpretation gets tricky .
But either way – many people saw Loose Change and thought that something fishy was going on .
But the skeptical movement , and some notable science outlets , like Popular Mechanics and NIST , fought back hard .
We pointed out all the flaws in the arguments of the truthers – anomaly hunting for example , and countered them fact by fact .
Eventually the truther movement was fairly marginalized and the general perception is that they are a bunch of conspiracy - mongering nutcases .
This is definitively a big win for the skeptical movement over the aughts .
But there are still truthers ( as the comment section of this post is likely to evidence ) .
Now they seem largely to stick to the straw man that the skeptics are saying we should uncritically believe everything the government tells us about everything .
It was never about that .
Be skeptical of the government all you want .
But that does not mean you can weave elaborate grand conspiracy theories out of inuendo and pseudoscience .
ID / Creationism
I also put the ID / creationist crowd ( or CDesign Proponentsists ) in the loser column for the last decade .
They lost major legal battles , like Dover .
They have failed to gain any legal ground , despite desperate flailing for a strategy since their big loss at Dover .
They have tried hard – going for the academic freedom gambit , but that does not seem to have any real traction .
I think the bottom line is that the scientific community simply has their number .
They know how to deal with creationists now .
Now creationists are just target practice for budding skeptics .
Expelled was also a big fail .
It may have fired up the absolute core of the religious right , but it failed to gain any objectives for ID .
It made an absolute fool of Ben Stein , and exposed the dirty tactics of ID proponents .
It was good fodder to skeptics , and little more .
We have to keep an eyes on these guys – but their movement is intellectually bankrupt , and they are getting more and more desperate .
I think we can easily keep them on a losing trajectory .
Alternative Medicine
This is a tough one .
From one perspective the CAM movement has continued to gain ground over the last decade – not so much in usage ( the numbers are actually quite flat ) but in mainstreaming their propaganda .
They have convinced much of the public that natural is magically better .
They have successfully smeared Big Pharma and mainstream medicine .
They have continued their infiltration of academia and regulation .
However , I also think they are coasting on the successes of the last decade .
In the last ten years , if anything , I see more and more of a pushback against outlandish claims and the wild - west regulation that CAM advocates have been pushing for .
The mainstrem media has caught on to the fact ( unheard of in the 1990s ) that CAM is often a SCAM .
We are starting to see more and more books like Trick or Treatment .
And the British Chiropractic Associate lawsuit against Simon Singh has united the skeptical movement and large portions of the scientific community against chiropractic .
That was a big fail for the BCA ( even though the suit is still ongoing ) and if anything just showed them to be thugs who are trying to hide their dirty little secret that there is little to no evidence for many of their claims .
Maybe the tide is turning – but this is the time to increase our efforts to protect the integrity of science in medicine .
Those who are attacking science as the basis of the standard of care in medicine ( for whatever motivation ) are going to fight back hard .
And they have established a lot of groundwork .
We still have our work cut out for us , and the outcome is far from determined .
Anti-Vaccinationists
Unfortunately , the anti-vaxers have clearly had a good decade .
They emerged from a fringe group to the mainstream .
This can be measured by declining vaccination rates , pockets of very low vaccination , and the resurgence of previously contained vaccine - preventable diseases .
They have garnered some significant celebrity support , Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carey among them .
They have successfully branded themselves as vaccine experts ( which is disturbing ) and have hijacked a significant portion of the autism community .
They have successfully marketed several effective slogans , like “ green our vaccines ” , “ vaccine choice ” , and “ too many too soon . ”
And they are pushing forward with increasing vigor and resources .
It does not seem that they have yet passed their peak .
But also opposition to the anti-vaxers ( the anti-anti- vax movement ) is gaining steam .
Ironically , over the last decade the science has been mostly against the anti-vaxers .
Study after study have supported vaccine safety and soundly refuted the vaccine - autism hypothesis .
The mainstream media seems to be on our side in this one .
The public is starting to realize that these anti-vaxers are dangerous and misguided .
But we are right in the midst of this struggle – again a time when we have to push forward with increasing effort .
UFOlogy
This past decade the UFO movement has largely flown under the radar .
In the last 50 years or so belief in UFOs has waxed and waned , and the aughts were a waning decade .
I think our digital age has something to do with it .
Cameras are now ubiquitous , and yet all we get are crappy photos or videos – the smoking gun of alien spacecraft has not emerged .
Also , the news cycle is so short now that when people report seeing lights in the sky , the story is still in everyone ’s memory when the next day it is revealed that they were floating lanterns .
UFOs are just too quickly and easily debunked .
There was also no new alien phenomenon to drive the movement – alien abductions , alien implants , crashed saucers , and big government coverups were all additions of previous decades .
The past decade added nothing to the mythology – nothing to spur interest .
Perhaps we are seeing a long term waning of UFOlogy , but think it is more likely that there will be flaps in the future .
The Paranormal
Overall this was a lame decade for the paranormal .
The one big winner was ghost - hunting , due entirely to the reality TV craze .
Ghost hunters found their home in cheap reality TV mind candy for the masses .
But it ca n’t last long .
Have you ever seen one of those shows ?
Nothing happens – they are as boring as watching snails mate .
Eventually even the true - believer must be stuck with the sense that nothing is happening in these shows .
You can only hunt ghosts without actually finding one for so long before people lose interest .
Other paranormal phenomena coasted over the last decade – no breakthroughs , no new sensations , all just the same old stuff .
Of course there is always a new generation coming up , and the old will seem new again one day .
Conclusion
Looking back at these big topics a pattern emerges .
These anti-scientific movements seem to gain a foothold – either leveraging a hot issue , a celebrity backer , or a dramatic event .
Or they simply get funding and fine tune their rhetoric .
They make gains for a while , but eventually their rhetoric runs out of steam .
It ’s hard to push a wrong idea indefinitely .
Also , with their success comes the backlash .
The skeptical community is usually on the forefront of these issues ( it ’s what we do ) but the mainstream media and the scientific community eventually get on board .
And then the serious push back eventually marginalizes the pseudoscience .
They never go away entirely .
We can look at past issues , like facilitated communication , as examples .
The pattern seems to be the same .
The amount of time it takes can vary wildly , however , as is the damage they do in the short term .
And once marginalized , such movements wait in the wings for their time to come around again .
The price of science seems to be eternal vigilance .
Google is now publishing a page outlining the platform versions in use , as measured by requests to the Android Market .
In terms of Android Market statistics , this chart is …limited .
However , it is interesting , and it will be even more interesting to see how frequently the chart gets updated .
The first thing that catches my eye is how many DROID users have gotten the upgrade to 2.0.1 .
That upgrade had been out for not much more than a week by the time the statistics were culled .
The 27.7 % of users running Android 1.5 means developers should still try to support that release for the time being , if possible .
I suspect this figure will plummet to under 10 % sometime in March , as I am hopeful we will see upgrades for the HTC Hero and Motorola CLIQ in the not - too - distant future .
Of course , if the Nexus One ships ( per rumors ) and if it has Android 2.1 ( per other rumors ) , developers will be faced with having to deal with four major active releases ( 1.5 , 1.6 , 2.0 , 2.1 ) , and I will seriously start questioning the sanity of various executives in Mountain View , CA …

Hardware construction is a funny thing .
Sometimes , regardless of the money you throw at something , you just can't get products to come together any quicker .
Evidently that 's the case with Barnes & Noble 's Nook , which has seen its estimated ship date slip from today to sometime after the holidays , and now to January 11th .
There 's still a sliver of hope that you 'll be able to snag one from a high - traffic retail location on December 7th , but unless you 're planning on abandoning ship and helping the Kindle have its new best month ever , the realistic choices are pretty clear : a ) pay Tickle Me Elmo - like prices on eBay or b ) drop an IOU in a nicely wrapped box , preferably with a cute puppy .
We suggest the latter .
[ Thanks , Dave and Wes ] P.S. -
We 're also hearing that pre-orders ( even those placed moments after it was announced ) are also being pushed back , though hopefully they 'll still be received before December 25th .
I do n't know what it is with Ukrainians and building unusual wooden things , but Vasily Lazarenko has gone and built himself a car .
Under the wood it 's a 1981 Opel , but on top of the wood it 's a confusing looking sedan / convertible hybrid .
Like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde .
I mean damn that wood looks good , but I would have stuck with one design for the whole thing .
Vasily quit his job and sold two other cars in order to afford the 1.5 years and parts needed to complete this , uh , thing .
He refuses to admit what it cost to build , which means it was way too much and he regrets ever doing it .
You have talent Vasily , but lets stick to rocking chairs and toy wagons in the future , okay ?

News from Baghdad on Tuesday morning , from the New York Times :
A series of devastating car bombings rocked Baghdad on Tuesday , killing at least 121 people and wounding hundreds more , according to preliminary accounts by witnesses , the police and hospital officials ....
The attacks were the worst in Iraq since twin suicide bombings destroyed three ministries on Oct. 25 , killing at least 155 people .
They fit a pattern of spectacular attacks in the capital , followed by weeks of relative calm .
In August , two suicide car bombs exploded near the country ’s Finance and Foreign Ministries , killing at least 122 .
After you have taken a moment to mull this unspeakable rending of human lives -- not just the individuals who were killed but also the lifelong , lacerating grief of their survivors -- a rending which is a direct result of an American invasion and occupation that not only loosed a savage sectarian war in the shattered , conquered land but also actively abetted it at every turn , go back and read the last paragraph of that excerpt again .
The worst attack in -- not years , not decades -- but mere weeks .
In other words , it 's hardly been a month since the last time , of many times , over and over , like clockwork , that dozens of people were ripped to shreds in the American - caused , American - abetted , American - supported civil wars in Iraq .
Think on that , then think on this : the situation in Iraq is now being held up as a model , a goal , for Barack Obama 's massive expansion of the war and occupation in Afghanistan .
Obama himself has called the " surge " in Iraq " an extraordinary achievement , " and has at every turn promoted and propagated the myth that George W. Bush 's escalation of a hideous war of aggression was a resounding success .
This myth is based on one thing only : the fact that the peak of the ghastly death rate produced by the American occupation dropped to a somewhat less horrific level .
But as countless experts and analysts have pointed out , this drop had very little to do with the addition of some 28,000 American troops .
( And parenthetically , what a small thing the Iraqi " surge " seems now , with Obama having already launched two " surges " in Afghanistan , which will , in the end , add up to more than 50,000 troops -- with the concomitant number of mercenaries who now augment , when they do not surpass , the official military contingents in America 's imperial campaigns . )
Patrick Cockburn is the latest to put Iraq 's " model " surge in its proper perspective , in a piece this week in The Independent :
There are real parallels between the US and British intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan , but they are not the ones which the White House and Downing Street are publicising .
In both countries foreign forces were intervening in a potential or actual ethnic and sectarian civil war .
In Afghanistan this is between the Pashtun on one side and the Tajiks , Uzbeks and Hazara on the other and has been going on for 30 years .
In Iraq it is between the Kurds , Sunni Arabs and Shia Arabs .
The Sunni were the predominant community under Saddam Hussein and were displaced by the Shia after a horrendous civil war which reached its peak in and around Baghdad in 2006 - 07 .
Sunni insurgents did surprisingly well against US troops , but lost the war against the Shia .
The guerrilla war against the US in Iraq ceased because the Sunni community was being slaughtered by Shia death squads .
" Judging by the body counts at the time in the Baghdad morgues , three Sunnis died for every Shia , " Dr Michael Izady , who conducted a survey of the sectarian make - up of Baghdad for Columbia University 's School of International Affairs , is quoted as saying .
" Baghdad , basically a Sunni city into the 1940s , by the end of 2008 had only a few hundred thousand Sunni residents left in a population of over five million . "
Defeated in this devastating sectarian civil war , the Sunni ended their attacks on US troops and instead sought their protection .
The " surge " of 28,000 extra US troops who arrived in the summer of 2007 had a marginal impact on the outcome of the fighting .
Yet it is the mythical success of the US troop " surge " in Iraq in 2007 - 08 which is being used as a template for US military policy in Afghanistan two years later .
A strategy , which did not work in the way the Pentagon said it did in Iraq is now to be applied in Afghanistan where conditions are , in any case , entirely different .
Cockburn goes on to note that Obama 's strategy in Afghanistan , just like Bush 's in Iraq , is guaranteed ( by design ? ) to enflame ethnic conflict :
The Obama plan outlined last week envisages training 100,000 new Afghan soldiers and 100,000 new policemen over the next three years .
But where are these recruits to come from ?
Given the high desertion rate , the combat strength of the Afghan army is reportedly only 46,000 troops in a country that is larger than France .
These troops , and particularly the officer corps , are already disproportionately Tajik , the ethnic group to which a quarter of Afghans belong .
The US can only increase the military strength of the Afghan state swiftly by skewing it towards the Tajiks , who were always the core of opposition to the Taliban .
This will increase sectarian hatreds .
And of course , the addition of thousands more foreign forces carrying out intensified military operations in Afghanistan will mean thousands more civilian deaths -- one of the primary elements fuelling violent resistance to the Western occupation .
In other words , as always in our bipartisan Terror War , the actual policies pursued by our leaders will , of necessity , produce the opposite result of their stated aims : quelling terrorism , dampening extremism , bringing stability , and , in the words of Obama 's escalation speech at West Point , building " a better future for our children and grandchildren " by ensuring that " other peoples ' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and access opportunity . "
Let 's state it again : you cannot achieve such goals , even in the slightest degree , with the foreign policies and military actions of the Bush and Obama administrations .
You cannot invade countries , kills thousands upon thousands of innocent people , destroy societies , unleash and foment civil war , impose corrupt , violent , repressive regimes on shattered , suffering people and expect that this will somehow build " a better future " for your children and grandchildren -- much less for the children and grandchildren that you are murdering , brutalizing and traumatizing .
As we said here the other day , only an idiot could actually believe such things .
And while our leaders may be moral nullities , they are not idiots .
Therefore it is clear beyond all doubt and argument that the stated purposes for the wars in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan are deliberate , knowing , well - considered lies .
Thus all the earnest debates and commentaries on the relative efficacy of various policies aimed at achieving these completely specious goals are pointless .
In the end , such diversionary " debates " only serve the causes of war , domination , profiteering and elite power that are , in the end , the only true goals of these campaigns .
II .
Do you want more proof of the inherent subversion of the Terror War 's stated goals by the actual policies adopted by our leaders ?
Then look at Pakistan this week -- or almost any week these days -- where dozens of people were killed in the intensified civil war that has been " ratcheted up " at Washington 's insistence .
For the last year , the Obama administration has waged a relentless campaign of hectoring , pressure , humiliation and blackmail to force the Pakistani government to wage open war on Pashtun tribes and sectarian groups opposed to Pakistani collaboration with America 's growing military presence in the region .
( And please note : Washington does not object at all in principle to the retrograde religious extremism of the targeted sectarian groups in Pakistan -- or in Afghanistan , for that matter .
For one thing , many of these same groups received copious support from America during the Soviet Union 's occupation of Afghanistan .
And of course , Obama , like all of his predecessors , joyfully embraces -- even , yes , bows to -- perhaps the most retrograde , extremist religious regime on earth , Saudi Arabia .
Never believe -- not for a moment -- that it is the content of faction 's belief that determines Washington 's attitude toward it .
This determination is made solely on the basis of how that group advances -- or impedes -- American policy interests at any given time and place .
One need only look at the vicious religious extremists embraced and empowered by the United States in both Afghanistan and Iraq in the past few years to see that . )
And so , bowing to this pressure , throughout the year the Pakistani military has dutifully " ratcheted up " its attacks on its own people .
And what has been the inevitable result ?
More violence , more terrorist attacks , more instability , more extremism .
Nothing illustrates this better than two stories that were paired together on the New York Times website on Tuesday ( although only one made the front page of the print edition ) : Pakistan Told to Ratchet Up Fight Against the Taliban and Twin Attacks in Eastern Pakistan Kill at Least 66 .
Cause and effect do n't come much clearer than that .
The first story is a remarkable tale of imperial extortion that nakedly reveals the true nature of American policy in the region : play ball , by our rules -- or get it in the neck .
The administration of the new Nobel Peace Prize laureate is now openly telling the Pakistanis that if they do not kill more of their own people , then by God , the Americans are going to do it for them :
The Obama administration is turning up the pressure on Pakistan to fight the Taliban inside its borders , warning that if it does not act more aggressively the United States will use considerably more force on the Pakistani side of the border to shut down Taliban attacks on American forces in Afghanistan , American and Pakistani officials said .
But because this is the New York Times , one of the great keepers of the American exceptionalism flame , we must have this ludicrous , laughable line inserted right after these direct threats :
United States officials said the message did not amount to an ultimatum ....
The Pakistanis got the message , however :
For their part the Pakistanis interpreted the message as a fairly bald warning that unless Pakistan moved quickly to act against two Taliban groups they have so far refused to attack , the United States was prepared to take unilateral action to expand Predator drone attacks beyond the tribal areas and , if needed , to resume raids by Special Operations forces into the country against Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders ...
A Pakistani official who has been briefed on the meetings said , “ Jones ’s message was if that Pakistani help was n’t forthcoming , the United States would have to do it themselves . ”
In other words ( we 're having to use a lot of " other words " in this piece , but that 's unavoidable when translating the higher bullshit of government and media ) , this was the message of the world 's greatest beacon of freedom and goodness : " Listen up , Paki -- attack who we say or we 're going to invade your fucking country .
You savvy me lingo , Sambo ? "
Yes , it is that crude ; and yes , it is precisely that kind of condescending , dehumanizing racism that lies behind this approach .
And try to picture the smug look of smirking satisfaction that accompanied this quote from the story :
A senior administration official , asked about the encounter , declined to go into details but added quickly , “ I think they read our intentions accurately . ”
And how's this for patting the blackjack in your palm , looking around the room and saying , with a sinister smile : " Nice little shop you got here , pal .
Too bad if something , like , happened to it . "
“ We ’ve offered them a strategic choice , ” one administration official said , describing the private communications .
“ And we ’ve heard back almost nothing . ”
Another administration official said , “ Our patience is wearing thin . ”
But of course what we are talking about here is Pakistan escalating the already extensive -- and heavy - handed , civilian - killing -- " counter - terrorism " operations it has launched at Washington 's insistence in the past two years .
These attacks have been met with a wave of reprisals from the targeted groups -- as well as by attacks of uncertain provenance .
( In the world of " counterinsurgency , " where death squads and double agents abound , one can never be sure where the ultimate origin of any attack comes from -- or even if the attackers themselves know who is pulling the strings .
For more on this , see here , here and here , among many examples . )
The result of Obama 's year - long policy of escalation in Pakistan is clear : more violence , more terrorism , more instability .
Yet even after this clear evidence of failure ( according to the purported reasons for the escalation ) , what is the " new " policy after the " strategic review " ?
The same , only more so .
We can thus look forward to a lot more of this :
Militants set off two bombs on Monday night in one of the busiest markets of this eastern Pakistani city , then sprayed the crowd with gunfire , killing at least 54 people , including many women and children , and wounding at least 150 others , Pakistani authorities said on Tuesday .
News agencies reported a fresh attack on Tuesday in the same region .
A bomb near the offices of the Inter - Services Intelligence directorate in Multan killed at least 12 people , the reports said .
This was part of a series of attacks that have killed hundreds of people in the past few weeks .
As the Guardian noted earlier this month :
...[ A ] wave of attacks .. started two months ago , on the eve of an army drive into the Taliban stronghold of South Waziristan .
More than 400 Pakistanis have died since early October in attacks on UN offices , security installations and crowded bazaars .
The capital , Islamabad , increasingly resembles cities such as Kabul , with rising sandbagged walls , checkpoint - clogged streets and shopping areas bereft of foreigners and , increasingly , Pakistanis .
Nearby Rawalpindi has suffered even more attacks , including a 22 - hour siege of the army headquarters in early October that left 23 people dead and badly embarrassed the military .
And so the cycle goes on and on -- now with a Peace Laureate at its head .
Looking at this ever - growing darkness , I keep coming back to something I wrote the day after 9/11 :
Blood will have blood ; that 's certain .
But blood will not end it .
For murder is fertile : it breeds more death , like a spider laden with a thousand eggs .
And who now can break this cycle , which has been going on for generations ?
The parts were taken from Galileo when he was reburied in 1737 Two fingers and a tooth belonging to famed astronomer Galileo Galilei have been found more than 100 years after going missing , a museum in Italy says .
A collector bought the items , lost since 1905 , at auction and gave them to Florence 's History of Science Museum .
The museum said it had no doubt about the authenticity of the items .
Scientists cut the parts - plus another finger and a vertebrae - from Galileo 's body in 1737 , almost 100 years after he died .
Galileo , who lived from 1564 to 1642 , was a hugely influential physicist and astronomer who helped develop the telescope .
He was branded a heretic by the Catholic Church for supporting Copernicus 's discovery that the Earth rotated around the Sun .
This is Galileo 's middle finger , kept in a museum since its 1737 removal
The body parts were removed from him 95 years after his death , when Church authorities decreed he could be reburied in consecrated ground .
One finger and the vertebrae have been conserved in museums since then , but the other parts were passed between collectors until they went missing in 1905 .
The museum said that the discovery meant that everything taken from Galileo 's body was now back " in responsible hands " .
" On the basis of considerable historical documentation , there are no doubts about the authenticity of the items , " it said in a statement .
The items will go on display at the museum in 2010 , once renovation work is completed .

My two favorite political fact checking organizations are PolitiFact Truth - O - Meter ( run by the St. Petersburg Times ) and FactCheck ( run by the Annenberg Foundation ) .
PolitiFact recently picked their “ Lie of the Year ” and to the surprise of hardly anyone , it was Sarah Palin ’s numerous claims of Obama ’s “ death panels ” .
This lie was n’t just the choice of the editors , they also held a nationwide poll and “ death panels ” was the overwhelming choice for the biggest whopper of 2009 , receiving five times more votes than the first runner - up ( a lie from Glenn Beck ) .
And now , FactCheck has come out with their biggest lies of 2009 , listing not just one , but a dozen and a half .
The first lie in their list is also “ death panels ” , which surprised me , since FactCheck is run by the notoriously conservative Annenberg Foundation .
Could n’t they find a liberal lie to challenge the “ death panels ” whopper ?
They do attempt to balance their five conservative lies about health care with four liberal lies — we do need to be “ fair and balanced ” , do n’t we ?
But none of the “ liberal health care lies ” seem to qualify as full whoppers , they are more like exaggerations .
It is interesting to count up who was to blame for each lie .
Here are FactCheck ’s whoppers :
Health care : 5 conservative whoppers , 4 liberal whoppers .
Two lies about Flu vaccines , which came from “ viral ” emails ( no pun intended ) .
FactCheck does n’t attribute these to either side .
Three lies about the environment , two of which are from conservatives , and one from “ both sides ” .
Two lies about the stimulus bill , one from each side .
Two whoppers about Obama — one about his birth place , and one about gun control — both from conservatives .
Final score ?
Conservatives : 11 lies , Liberals : 6 lies .
And as I mentioned , this is from a conservative organization .
And conservatives also won the grand prize — making them the biggest liars of 2009 .
UPDATE : Sarah Palin hilariously claims that she is not the biggest liar of the year .
On her Facebook page , she even tries to blame the whole thing on “ Nancy Pelosi and friends who have tried to call ‘ death panels ’ the ‘ lie of the year . ' ” ( the truth is that “ lie of the year ” came from nonpartisan PolitiFact.com , and “ death panels ” was widely condemned as a lie by both liberals and conservatives ) .

A 38 - year - old former Miss Argentina , Solange Magnano , died over the weekend from complications resulting from cosmetic surgery , friends says .
" This woman who had everything is dead because she wanted to have a slightly firmer ass , " said Roberto Piazza , a fashion designer and close friend of Magnano , who frequently appeared as a runway model in his fashion shows .
Magnano , Miss Argentina 1994 , a married mother of eight - year - old twins , went under the knife at a plastic surgery centre in the capital , Buenos Aires , on Thursday hoping to tone up her derriere .
She was rushed to hospital on Friday suffering from a pulmonary embolism and died on Sunday , her friends said .
" She only underwent the procedure because she thought it was no big deal , " said Guillermo Azar , another associate from the fashion world and a close friend of Magnano .
Juan Carlos Seiler , former president of a Buenos Aires association of plastic surgeons , suggested the doctor who performed the procedure might not have been " a real professional from an approved " cosmetic surgery centre .
About 50,000 plastic surgery procedures were performed in Argentina last year , a 60 per cent increase over 2003 , with a growing number of foreigners seeking inexpensive cosmetic enhancements accounting for much of the increase .

In the state of Alaska , the word " Veco " has raised its ugly head again , and that cannot be good news for longtime Alaska Congressman Don Young :
An Alaska businessman admitted to giving gifts to Republican Rep. Don Young , the state 's long - serving sole congressman , in a confession made public this week as part of an ongoing federal investigation into political corruption in the state .
The confession , signed in 2007 by Bill Allen , the former chief of Veco , an Alaska oil services company , was released as part of Allen 's upcoming sentencing on charges that he bribed state lawmakers .
In the document , which outlines criminal activity Allen was involved in , the 72 - year - old executive admits to 13 years of gift - giving to public officials .
They include former Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens and Young , whom the document referred to as to " United States Representative A . "
Of course , there had been stories emanating all the way back to 2007 that there was some potentially unethical connectivity between Veco and Young .
The confession written by Allen , however , lay out the most explicit details of the illegal benefits Young derived from the relationship .
Despite the fact that Young reported receiving no gifts on his disclosure forms from the mid 1990s until 2008 , Allen claims that in 2007 his firm purchased a $ 1000 set of golf clubs for the Congressman ( a dollar value almost triple the minimum required amount for federal disclosure )
Recall that it was failure to disclose gifts from Veco that led to Alaska Senator Ted Steven 's conviction of seven counts last Fall ( a conviction eventually set aside due in April of this year due to prosecutorial misconduct ) .
Young is being challenged in 2010 by Democratic state legislator Harry Crawford .
The 76 year - old Congressman had his toughest electoral battle to date in 2008 , when former state legislator ( and current gubernatorial candidate ) Ethan Berkowitz held him to a five - point margin of victory ( 50 - 45 ) .
A year after St. Paul police rounded up and arrested over 200 people
who were planning to protest the Republican National Convention - but
had n't actually done anything yet - 27 plaintiffs filed a class action
suit against the city on behalf of all those arrested .
Police officers
used pepper spray , non-lethal ammunition and horses against the
protesters , none of whom was convicted of anything except not liking
Republicans .

" The city has admitted that people were arrested preemptively in
this park , " said attorney Robert Kolstad .
" They arrested them because they
were afraid of what they might do in the future , which is a dangerous
path for our government to take .
Taken to its logical conclusion , what
it means is that the government now believes that they can come to our
houses and arrest us because they think that we might do something
wrong .
Our constitution simply does n't permit that . "

White House has put out news on contentious issues late on Friday in the hope that doing so will bury it , or reduce the amount of critical scrutiny it would otherwise receive .
What is unusual is the degree to which this White House has relied on this tactic .
On Friday , Jan. 30 , President Obama revoked the ban on giving taxpayer dollars to international groups that promote or perform abortions abroad .
The president released his executive orders on detainee interrogations , closure of the Guantanamo prison , and ...

Windows / Mac : Opera 's developers have released a very unstable but promising version of their web browser into the open .
What does Opera 10.5 have to offer ?
If a quick test is any indication , faster JavaScript speed than any browser out there .
Advertisement
Based on Opera 's reports of their new JavaScript engine , Caraken , being " 7 x faster " than the standard Futhark engine built into Opera 10.10 , we ran it through Mozilla 's Dromaeo JavaScript tests , which combine Apple 's SunSpider and Google 's V8 JavaScript benchmarks .
Pure runs - per - second speed is n't everything , of course , and engines can be built specifically to max out in these kinds of tests .
That said , the results of Opera 10.5 , rolled into our last round of browser speed tests , were more than a little impressive , using Dromaeo as a measuring stick :

The chart up top is pulled from our most recent speed tests , with Opera 10.5 pre-alpha results rolled in .
It shows some , shall we say , notable improvement .
The gHacks blog put 10.5 against Firefox 3.6 beta and Chrome 's development build in the SunSpider and V8 tests and found that Opera either beat , or came very close to , Chrome , in those separate runs , and usually left Firefox in the dust .
We 'll have to put Opera 10.5 through its full paces when it 's out of its very unstable build .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
If you 're the adventurous type and do want to give the pre-alpha a try , you 'll also find improvements to the page rendering engine , new Private Browsing tabs and windows that do n't track any history , and some interface and visual design tweaks , detailed in the post below .
The big JavaScript improvements are n't as pronounced on the Mac build as on Windows , according to the development team , but are still there .
Opera 10.5 pre-alpha is a free download for Windows and Mac systems .

New Zealand is still celebrating after successfully launching its first home - grown rocket into space , however its builders are now desperately trying to find it .
The six - metre - long rocket blasted off from Great Mercury Island , an idyllic spot not far from Auckland , where U2 singer Bono once holidayed .
The noise sent sheep running .
The rocket went 150 kilometres , entered space , then turned back to Earth and plummeted into the Pacific Ocean .
This morning , a fisherman spotted part of the rocket bobbing in the water .
One of the rocket 's creators , Mark Rocket , who changed his name by deed poll , is keen to find the rest .
" It 's got delicate instrumentation and we just want to know what the GPS coordinates are and we will go and pick it up , " Mr Rocket said .
He says his team is planning to build another , much bigger rocket .
We can all look back at the wonderful decision that was made to send more troops to Korea .
If we had not , we could have been bogged down in a quagmire there that would have required 50 plus years of American lives , involvement and money .
What a wonderful decision it was to send more troops to Vietnam .
If we had not , we could have lost over 58,000 soldier ’s lives ; killed millions of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians and been forced to flee the country with our tails between our legs , deserting our allies to the horrors of communist retribution .
Good thing our wonderful leaders had the wisdom and courage to send " more troops . "
Now we are forced with the same dilemma ; send more troops or face military defeat .
The question is : why are we in Afghanistan in the first place ?
Now that time has erased the emotions of retaliation for the events of 9/11 and our country elected a new leader who campaigned on the principle of bringing an end to our involvement in these costly wars , why the call for more troops ?
Could it be we are again simply following the dictates of the power cabal as Major General Smedley Darlington Butler so eloquently outlined in his outstanding work , War is a Racket ?
Anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of our quest for empire over the past six decades realizes that Obama ’s contemplation of whether to send additional troops to Afghanistan is simply those who control him providing Obama with the opportunity to look " presidential . "
The decision to send additional troops was reached prior to the situational comedy of General McChrystal ’s leaked " confidential report " to the Washington Post and Obama ’s National Security Advisor ’s public admonishment of McChrystal ’s failure to follow the chain of command .
All of this is nothing but a well - rehearsed , though poorly camouflaged hoax .
Additional troops will be sent to Afghanistan within a very short period of time and Obama really has no say in the matter .
The question is : why ?
War is a Racket : The A ... Butler , Smedley D. Best Price : $ 2.55 Buy New $ 7.01 ( as of 05:45 EST - Details )
Could it be the US - installed puppet government in Afghanistan has new suitors who represent a very real threat to the United State ’s control of Afghanistan and her abundant natural resources ?
Is the entry of Russia and Chinese influence into Afghanistan the real reason for the need for more troops ?
Russia reportedly made its entry back in 2007 with the reopening of its embassy in Kabul .
The Russian Foreign Minister , Sergei Ivanov , met privately with President Karzai and offered military assistance through the Collective Security Treaty Organization .
( CSTO )
The CSTO is made up of Russia , Belarus , Armenia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , and Uzbekistan .
Russia is the driving force in this organization , as one might understand , due to the economic and military weakness of the other members .
There were meetings with CSTO delegation in Kabul and neither the US nor the UK were invited .
Were the US / UK coalition ( NATO ) allowed to solidify its position in Afghanistan , it would create a territorial split between Russia , China and Iran .
Russia will do whatever is necessary to prevent this growth of power and influence in the region , I believe .
Moscow is certainly concerned with the Pentagon ’s plan to deploy Special Operations forces into the Central Asian States to conduct " foreign internal defense missions . "
This translates into increasing military activity , which is better known as the " spreading of democracy , " by military force .
NATO , following the CFR - introduced agenda , is campaigning for increased cooperation with Moscow in the region to " facilitate the fading of Russia ’s lingering imperial ambitions . "
These are the words of Zbigniew Brzezinski , author of the NATO report .
Surely , Putin will see through this smokescreen .
Russia has also cancelled all of Afghanistan ’s Soviet - era debts and is moving to help Kabul rebuild the Afghan infrastructure .
The increase of trade between Afghanistan and Russia , which was at the $ 190 million mark in 2008 , is also a move to create a vision of Russia as an ally to the people of Afghanistan with the US and NATO appearing as the foreign invader .
What has prompted the governments in Moscow and Beijing to converge with the forces of NATO in Afghanistan ?
Is it purely a protectionist strategy or are those governments there for the same reason we initiated the war in 2001 : an abundance of natural resources ?
China has made its moves to secure as many of the natural resources located in Afghanistan as it can .
Almost one year ago , in November of 2008 , China , acting through the China Metallurgical Group Corporation and the Jiangxi Copper Company , secured the Aynak Copper Mine in Logar Province .
This copper mine is reported to be the largest in the world and has been basically inoperative since the Soviet Invasion in 1979 .
China has agreed to a 2.9 - billion dollar investment in the infrastructure of the area including a power plant and possible railroad into Pakistan .
If I were an Afghan citizen , whom would I support in my country , a nation that is actually contributing to a better life or one that is indiscriminately bombing my fellow citizens ?
Now , when it appears our puppet Karzai may have been influenced by a better offer from Russia , China , or both , the Obama administration , strongly supported by the neocons , is seeking to perhaps replace Karzai with a new election , suddenly proclaiming the election the US just supervised to have been corrupt .
Members of both political / criminal parties now openly support the war in Afghanistan as being necessary to our national defense , with the question being , not , do we send more troops to Afghanistan to bleed and die for oil and minerals , but how many ?
I ’m sure our influence in NATO will bring about the necessary conclusions in order to facilitate our attempt to replace our own political puppet .
Karzai has obviously jumped the traces of US control by participating in meetings outside of the US political purview with China , Russia and even in this agreement , which included Iran and Pakistan .
The construction of this pipeline was due to start last month .
Russia and China see this new pipeline as crucial to their retention of power in the region and will make the necessary military movements to insure their investments .
Financially crippled due to our continued wars for empire and the printing of billions of new dollars to repay political cronies in the financial world has left us in a precarious position in Afghanistan .
We will try to counter the financial prowess of China , to whom we owe billions and their military ties to Russia with the blood and lives of tens of thousands of new US military forces .
When China calls in our financial markers , and they will if challenged , what will become of our country ?
We are about to escalate a war we cannot win .
How long will it be before Americans care more for the lives of their children than they do for the state and refuse to participate in the madness ?

If you want Obamacare , stay ignorant .
The current attempt by today ’s White House Administration to impose more big government on the American People by way of the “ single payer option ” for healthcare is as unconstitutional as gun confiscation or the elimination of free speech .
Obamacare will be funded with a health care surcharge on the today ’s income tax , which constitutes an unapportioned direct tax on the wages and salaries of the American People , not allowed by our Constitution .
How so you might ask ?
Good question .
In order to answer that question , we must first review “ Constitutional Taxation 101 ” a course that no lawyer ever took , nor has any judge , member of Congress nor has any PhD candidate in constitutional law .
Law schools do not teach courses about the Constitution ; they teach courses about litigated cases about the Constitution .
The American People are nearly 100 percent illiterate , at all levels , when it comes to constitutional taxation .
The higher the level of ignorance among the American people , the greater the amount of fleecing that takes place .
[ efoods ]
To understand constitutional taxation , we must first understand the terms of the Constitution ’s Framers .
What is a direct tax ?
And what is an indirect tax ?
In 1787 , those terms were widely used by the Framers as they debated and drafted our Constitution .
These framers knew the meaning of these to terms .
Very simply , a direct tax taxes a “ noun ” , and an indirect tax taxes a “ verb ” .
What is a tax on a noun ?
It is a tax on something that exists .
A house exists .
A tax on a house is a direct tax .
The tax is levied on the house , and the tax must be paid .
There is no getting out of paying a direct tax .
Either the tax gets paid , or the house is eventually seized by the taxing authority .
“ Labor ” is a noun too ; and a tax on labor is a direct tax ; it is a capitation tax , which must be apportioned .
The next question that begs to be answered is , “ What is a tax on a verb ? ”
This is a tax on the happening of an event .
It is a tax on a choice a person makes .
It is a tax that can be avoided , or the burden of the tax can be shifted to another .
If you choose to buy gasoline , you choose to pay the excise tax on each gallon of gas .
You could , of course , choose to ride your bicycle and avoid the tax .
You pay the indirect tax because of choices you make .

After more than six months , and more than a few technical hurdles , NYTProf v3 has been released at last .
In this post I ’ll review the major changes and significant new features .
What ’s new in Devel : : NYTProf v3 ?
Treemap
The first big feature is a visualization of the exclusive time spent in subroutines represented as a treemap :
That ’s a treemap of a profile of perlcritic 1.088 .
The colors do n’t mean anything .
They ’re just used to visually group subroutines in the same package .
( I ’m not very happy with the colors but the JIT toolkit I ’m using does n’t make it easy to use an attractive colour range .
It interpolates a value in RGB color space .
It would be much better to interpolate the value in HSV color space . )
The treemap is interactive !
If you click on a square then the treemap is redrawn “ zoomed in ” one package level ‘ closer ’ to the package of the subroutine you clicked on .
Subroutine Caller Tracking
The subroutine profiler has been almost completely rewritten , yielding another major new feature .
It now finds and records the name of the calling subroutine .
( You might have assumed that NYTProf always did that .
In fact it guessed based on the calling file and line number , and so was easily confused by nested subroutines and closures . )
By properly tracking the calling subroutine NYTProf can now generate a more accurate call graph .
One immediate beneficiary is the nytprofcg utility ( contributed by Chia- liang Kao ) .
nytprofcg reads NYTProf profile data and generates callgrind data for viewing via Kcachegrind .
The previous guessing behaviour limited the usefulness of nytprofcg .
Now it works well , as you can see here :
I ’ve not played with it much yet .
If you do , let us know how it works out for you !
The subroutine called main :: RUNTIME in the image above is the fake name that NYTProf gives to ‘ caller ’ of the main script code .
Code run at compile time will have a top - level caller of main : : BEGIN .
BEGIN
Speaking of BEGIN s , they ’ve always been a problem because there can be many of them in a single package .
Each use statement , for example , generates a BEGIN sub that ’s immediately executed then discarded .
Previously the data for all those BEGIN s was mashed together and so almost useless .
The NYTProf subroutine profiler now renames BEGIN s by appending @linenumber to make them unique .
A whole new level of detail is opened up by this change .
( This , along with a few other new features , requires perl 5.10.1 + or 5.8.9 +.)
Goto
NYTProf now handles goto ⊂ properly .
That tail - call construct is commonly found at the end of AUTOLOAD subroutines — so it ’s more common than you might think .
The calling and called subroutine call counts and timings are updated correctly .
For the call graph , the destination subroutine appears to have been called by the subroutine that called the subroutine that executed the goto .
In other words , if A calls B and B does a goto &C , that call to C will show A as the caller .
That fits the way goto &sub works , and ensures inclusive and exclusive times make sense .
Slow Opcode Profiling
This is another major new feature .
NYTProf can now profile the time spent executing certain opcodes ( the lowest - level units of execution in the perl interpreter ) .
I originally envisaged adding the mechanism for opcodes that corresponded to system calls ( read , write , mkdir , chdir etc. ) and called the feature ‘ sys ops ’ .
Then I realised there were other perl opcodes that would be worth profiling .
The main two being match ( m /.../ ) and subst ( s/.../.../ ) .
So now the NYTProf subroutine profiler can now profile time spent in regular expressions !
Here ’s an example :
The opcodes are given pseudo - subroutine names in the package that invoked the opcode with “ CORE : ” prepended to the opcode name .
In the example above you can see two instances of CORE : match .
One accounting for matches performed in the main : : package , and another accounting for matches performed in the File : : Find : : package .
( They ’re marked ‘ xsub ’ above but I ’ve changed that to ‘ opcode ’ now . )
Profiling of ‘ slowops ’ , as I ’ve called them , is controlled by the slowops =N option .
A value of 0 turns off slowop profiling .
A value of 2 ( the default ) gives the behaviour shown above , with opcodes called in different packages being accounted for separately .
A value of 1 will put all the slowops into a single package named “ CORE : : “ .
GraphViz
Another spin - off from the work on call graphs : NYTProf now also outputs representations of the subroutine call graph as GraphViz dot language files .
These can be rendered by
a variety of viewers .
I use GraphViz by pixelglow .
Here ’s a simple example showing the calling relationship between packages in a little demo script I use for testing :
The dot file for that inter - package view is available as a link on the top - level index page of the report .
On the individual report pages for each source file there ’s a link to another dot file .
This one shows the calls into , out of , and between the subroutines in package (s ) in that source file .
For example , here ’s the call graph for the subs in the File : : Find module :
There are many things that could be improved with that graph , such as adding call counts .
Overall though , I ’m pretty happy with it .
Report Format Changes
There have been some changes to the main report columns :
There are two new columns , “ Calls ” and “ Time in Subs ” .
They show the number of subroutine calls executed on that line , and the total time spent in those subroutines due to those calls .
Both are color coded , relative to the other values in the same columns , using the same Median Average Deviation that ’s used elsewhere .
To make room for the new columns , the column showing the average statement execution time has been removed ( it was n’t much use anyway ) and the column headings tightened up .
The average value , if you ’re interested , is available as a tool - tip , as shown above .
New Options
A few new options have been added , including :
sigexit=S
Some signals will abort a process leaving a corrupt profile data file .
The sigexit option can be used to tell NYTProf to catch those signals and close the profile cleanly before exiting .
Some signals will abort a process leaving a corrupt profile data file .
The option can be used to tell NYTProf to catch those signals and close the profile cleanly before exiting .
forkdepth=N
When a process being profiled is forked the child process is also profiled .
The forkdepth=N option can be used to limit the number of generations that are profiled .
The default is - 1 ( all generations ) .
A value of 0 effectively disables profiling of child processes .
When a process being profiled is forked the child process is also profiled .
The option can be used to limit the number of generations that are profiled .
The default is - 1 ( all generations ) .
A value of 0 effectively disables profiling of child processes .
log=F
If you enable NYTProf trace output , via the trace =N option , it ’s normally written to stderr .
The log=F can be used to write the log to a specific file instead .
nytprofmerge
As I mentioned above , when a profiled process forks , the child is also profiled , with the profile being written to a new file .
So processes which have many children , like mod_perl , end up with many profile data files .
Naturally many people have expressed a wish for NYTProf to be able to merge multiple profiles into a single report .
Sadly no one has stepped up actually do the work , till now .
Nicholas Clark , who contributed the great zip compression for v2.04 ( and a major contributor to the perl core and pumpkin for the 5.8.2+ releases ) has come up trumps again .
NYTProf v3 includes a new nytprofmerge utility that ’ll read multiple profiles and write out a new , merged , profile .
It ’s very new , and somewhat experimental , but answers a very real need .
Give it a whirl and let us know how it goes .
Screencast
I gave a talk on Devel : : NYTProf at the ( excellent ) Italian Perl Workshop in October .
I covered both the features in version 3 and the phased approach I take to optimizing perl code .
You can watch the screencast .

It ’s Christmas Eve here in Ireland .
After days , and nights , of hard frost the countryside is spectacularly encased in tiny ice crystals sparking in the bright sunshine .
I ’m delighted to have stumbled into working on NYTProf .
It ’s a great project at the intersection of two of my professional passions : performance and visualization .
And I ’m delighted to give you NYTProf v3 in time for this Christmas .
Enjoy !

" Now my son is watching it avidly and he asks me to come and sit down with him just to watch Doctor Who and as a matter of fact I have got David ( Tennant ) 's autograph here just for him . "
Background : " Spice " and other herbal blends were marketed in Germany until January 2009 as substances purportedly exerting similar effects to cannabis , yet containing no cannabinoids .
These products were recently forbidden in Germany under the provisions of the German Narcotics Law after they were found to contain undeclared , synthetic cannabinomimetic substances .
The authors describe physical withdrawal phenomena and a dependence syndrome that developed after the consumption of " Spice . "
Case presentation and course : A 20 - year old patient reported that he had smoked " Spice Gold " daily for 8 months .
He developed tolerance and rapidly increased the dose to 3 g per day .
He felt a continuous desire for the drug and kept on using it despite the development of persistent cognitive impairment .
His substance use led him to neglect his duties in his professional training position .
Urinary drug screens were negative on admission to the hospital , as they were again on discharge .
On hospital days 4 –7 , he developed inner unrest , drug craving , nocturnal nightmares , profuse sweating , nausea , tremor , and headache .
His blood pressure was elevated for two days , with a maximal value of 180/90 mm Hg accompanied by a heart rate of 125 / min .
The patient stated that he had experienced a similar syndrome a few weeks earlier during a phase of abstinence owing to a short supply , and that it had quickly subsided after he had started consuming " Spice " once again .
Conclusions :
The authors interpret the symptoms and signs described above as a dependence syndrome corresponding to the ICD - 10 and DSM - IV criteria for this entity .
The physical withdrawal syndrome closely resembles that seen in cannabis dependence .
The authors postulate that the syndrome in the patient described was due to an admixture of synthetic cannabinomimetics such as JWH - 018 and CP 47497 in " Spice Gold , " in combination with the patient 's daily consumption in very large amounts .

Pre-packed herbal blends were sold in Germany and other European countries until January 2009 .
The smoke of these products is supposed to have cannabinoid - like effects when inhaled , although they do not contain any cannabis .
Several names have been given to these products , such as " Spice , " " Smoke , " " Scence , " " Yucatan Fire , " or " Skunk . "
As this drug had spread rapidly by the end of 2008 , there was an intensive discussion about any possible risk .
In December 2008 , several laboratories detected an admixture of the synthetic cannabinomimetic substances JWH - 018 and CP-47-497 .
These are in all probability the sole cause of the psychotropic effects of these smoked products ( 1 ) .
Therefore , the German Federal Ministry of Health made all products containing these substances subject to the Narcotics Law , by fast - track legislation on 22 January 2009 .
For this reason , production , trade and possession are prohibited .
There is still no reliable scientific information on the actions of these substances in man .
We have observed withdrawal phenomena after regular consumption of these substances in the form of " Spice Gold .
" A youth care worker presented a 20 - year - old patient ( 165 cm , 50.8 kg ) .
She had been taking care of him as part of a professional rehabilitation measure .
He had not participated in practical work for four weeks and now he was threatened with losing his professional training position .
As regards his drug history , the patient reported that he had been consuming illegal drugs for about three years .
At the beginning , he had only consumed hashish .
After that he had also begun to take hallucinogenic mushrooms and Salvia divinorum , a type of sage with the hallucinogenic active substance salvinoin A .
He drank alcohol very rarely ; he had never regularly consumed opiates or other illegal drugs than the above mentioned and had not done this at all in recent years .
Besides ten cigarettes per day , he has only been consuming " Spice Gold , " initially 1 g daily , for eight months .
Due to decreasing effect , he had rapidly increased the dose to a final value of 3 g daily — split into 3 to 4 doses , with the first dose early in the morning .
For this purpose , he inhaled the smoke from the herbal mixture burned in a glass pipe ( " bong " ) .
Owing to the consumption of the substance , he had often recently been listless and had had problems in thinking clearly .
A few weeks ago during a phase of abstinence owing to shortages in supply , he had developed symptoms in the form of profuse sweating during the day and especially in the night , as well as internal unrest , tremor , palpitation , insomnia , headache , diarrhea , nausea , and vomiting .
Additionally he had suddenly felt depressed and desperate .
This had lasted for two days and had only abruptly disappeared after taking the drug again .
Therefore , he no longer had the courage to discontinue the drug by himself .
In the last month , he had additionally unintendedly lost 5 kg in weight and could only sleep about five hours in the night .
As a result , the primary care physician initially prescribed zopiclone four days earlier .
The patient stated that he had taken 7.5 mg of this drug for the night .
HistoryThe patient fell ill from Langerhans cell histiocytosis at the age of four months .
When he was two years old , he was successfully treated with chemotherapy and operated for chronic otitis media .
He subsequently developed pituitary deficiency , which required substitution of growth hormone up to the age of 18 and permanent treatment of diabetes insipidus with vasopressin ( desmopressin nasal spray ) .
This constellation allows the conclusion that the patient had been suffering from the Hand - Schüller - Christian disease .
He received psychotherapy as an outpatient from the age of three to ten and again at the age of 16 , due to social withdrawal and occasional eating disorders .
The responsible psychiatrist reported that he had already diagnosed attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and this had improved during treatment with unretarded methylphenidate at up to 2 x 15 mg/d .
However , the patient denied any positive effect and reported that he had in fact discontinued this treatment after six months because of frequent impulsive and aggressive behavior .
He stated that he had felt internal unrest and nervousness in a disturbing way since early childhood and that this had been the trigger for his drug consumption , too .
His experience had been that the unrest could only be improved by cannabis or " Spice Gold . "
The patient 's half - sister was addicted to methamphetamine ( " Crystal " ) and had committed suicide at the age of 31 .
The rest of the family 's medical history was unremarkable .
Due to his previous experience of withdrawal phenomena , the patient requested medical treatment for detoxication of " Spice Gold " and therefore was admitted to hospital on a voluntary basis .
Findings on admission
The patient 's very slim build and his spinal scoliosis were striking during the examination .
The internal and neurological findings were unremarkable .
From the psychopathological point of view , the patient acted in an appropriate manner to the situation , although he was slightly anxious and insecure .
Otherwise , the alcohol breath test was normal .
Immunological rapid tests for cannabinoids , benzodiazepines , amphetamines , cocaine , opiates and methadone in urine were negative .
In routine laboratory tests , normal values were found apart from borderline anemia with Hb 8.5 mmol / L ( normal : > 8.6 ) .
The heart rate ( HR ) was 82 / min , the blood pressure 130/70 mm Hg and the ECG was unremarkable .
The first abstinent day of treatment ( day 1 ) was symptom - free .
In the evening of day 2 , the patient complained about increasing internal unrest .
As requested by the patient , zopiclone was nevertheless reduced from 7.5 mg to 3.75 mg and discontinued after one single dose .
In the following night , the patient started to sweat profusely for the first time .
From day 4 , the patient started to develop increasing internal unrest , strong desire for " Spice , " nightmares , profuse sweating , nausea , tremor , and headaches .
These symptoms did not improve after a renewed single administration of 7.5 mg zopiclone , either .
Additionally the patient reported that " he had stood beside himself . "
He had also developed the familiar intermittent feeling of electrical shocks and " twitches " around the shoulder , followed by a feeling of numbness in the right arm , radiating into the fingers and lasting for approximately one minute .
The blood pressure increased to a maximum of 180/90 mm
Hg with a maximum heart rate of 125 / min .
For two days , the blood pressure was mostly 140/90 mm Hg with a heart rate of 95 / min .
Oral single administrations of promethazine 25 mg and clonidine 0.175 mg decreased the blood pressure .
However , they hardly changed the other symptoms .
From the morning of day 7 , the symptoms disappeared and the patient felt well despite further hypertension around 140/85 mm
Hg with HR around 100 / min , lasting till his release on day 21 .
From day 10 of treatment , he was clearly irritable and reported that he had had several arguments with his parents .
This was contrary to his normal friendly behavior .
An EEG on day 14 showed an alpha - beta - mixed type without epileptiform potentials .
From day 8 of treatment , the patient complained about the familiar increasing internal unrest and nervousness .
This was especially disturbing in the night and kept him from falling asleep .
Because of the unfavorable prior experience with methylphenidate and with the suspicion of hypofunction of the dopaminergic system , the patient was treated off - label ( after prior explanation ) from day 11 with 0.175 mg pramipexole for the night .
This brought a slight improvement .
The patient reported that the unrest and his sleep at night had effectively improved after increasing the dose to 0.35 mg on day 18 .
He had only been able to sleep so well when consuming the drug .
No adverse events were reported or observed .
A second immunochemical drug screening in urine on the day of release was negative for cannabis metabolites , amphetamines , cocaine metabolites , and opiates .
The patient fully participated in a structured and addiction - specific psychotherapeutic program with group meetings using a cognitive behavioral therapy approach , taking place four times weekly .
Four days after his release , the patient returned to the hospital .
He was still well .
Nevertheless , he did not take advantage of further outpatient meetings offered to him .
Four months after his release , he returned to the hospital as an outpatient and reported that he felt well and that he was abstinent from Spice products .
However , he had consumed cannabis about four times since his release .
He stated that he had discontinued pramipexole after approximately one month , as he could now sleep well enough without either this drug or zopiclone .
In accordance with the experience of other consumers discussed in relevant Internet forums , the patient described how " Spice Gold " acted similarly to cannabis and was relaxing and sedative .
It produced ravenous cravings .
However , the main difference between " Spice " and cannabis was that " Spice " produced less euphoria .
Overall he felt that the effect of " Spice " was stronger than that of hashish .
A sample of " Spice Gold " was bought through the Internet and then examined by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy .
No cannabinoids or other familiar ingredients of illegal drugs could be detected .
The psychotropic effect of the sample was confirmed by two experienced consumers of cannabis through inhaling the smoke .
The symptoms described can be interpreted as a physical withdrawal syndrome as a consequence of the discontinuation of " Spice Gold . "
This has several similarities with withdrawal symptoms after discontinuing cannabis .
A zopiclone withdrawal syndrome is also a theoretical possibility ; this would resemble benzodiazepine withdrawal ( 2 ) .
However , the following points argue against this :- the very short - term and low dosage administration of zopiclone , - the patient 's spontaneous request for dose reduction , - the lack of observable difficulty in falling asleep and sleeping through , - the persistence of withdrawal symptoms despite renewed zopiclone administration , and - their reproducible occurrence after discontinuation of " Spice Gold .
" For this reason , this differential diagnosis was excluded as cause of this withdrawal syndrome .
Besides the withdrawal symptoms , the following other addiction criteria are also present in the described case :- dose increase , - strong desire for the substance with an urgent need for consumption , - continuous consumption despite the consequences ( " often listless and problems with thinking clearly " ) , - Neglect of other interests or duties ( participation in practical work ) .
Therefore , five dependency criteria have been fulfilled within a period of eight months , justifying the diagnosis of a dependency syndrome according to both ICD - 10 and DSM - IV .
In December 2008 , different synthetic substances were detected in " Spice " and other products mentioned before .
These substances act agonistically on the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 .
They exhibit much higher receptor affinity than natural cannabinoids .
These cannabinoids are JWH - 018 , CP - 47-497 , and homologs and stereomers of these , as well as oleamide ( 1 ) .
For this reason , the addictive disease of our patient is in all probability based on the action of these cannabinomimetics .
However , it must be pointed out that no body fluids were stored when he was admitted to hospital and therefore the detection of the actual consumption of these substances is lacking .
With this limitation , the authors ' observations serve as further evidence for the cannabinoid withdrawal syndrome — which has long been a controversial topic ( 3 ) .
This syndrome could only be established with absolute certainty as a separate clinical entity after two new developments ( 4 ) .
On the one hand , the THC content ( THC , tetrahydrocannabinol ) of the commercially available cannabis products has doubled in the last twenty years through targeted culture and artificial lighting of the plants ( 5 ) .
According to other sources , the content has even increased by factor of four ( 6 ) .
On the other hand , consumption habits have changed , in that more and more hashish is burned in a " bong " and inhaled in a single breath , instead of being mixed with tobacco and then smoked as a joint over a period of several minutes .
Then the ingredients rapidly flood into the body and produce more intensive psychotropic effects .
This typically leads to consumption of higher amounts , more intensive withdrawal symptoms and higher risk of addiction ( 7 ) .
The patient described here used a " bong . "
This form of consumption was connected with the use of high amounts of " Spice Gold " ( 3 g daily ) .
Together this may have led to a fully developed and manifest addiction disease , which is theoretically expected for these cannabinomimetic substances .
The probable ADHD may have enhanced this process , as the patient used the substance for self - treatment of his lasting disrupting unrest , nervousness and sleep disturbances .
The observations confirm the necessity of the planned classification of the mentioned synthetic cannabinomimetics as narcotic in January 2009 .
The special feature of the phenomenon " Spice " is that for the first time a synthetic drug has been commercially distributed disguised as " herbal blend . "
This must be seen as a malicious deception of the consumer .
What makes this particularly alarming is that neither JWH - 018 nor CP - 47-497 has been examined with respect to its safety when used in man .
The same applies to about 100 other cannabinomimetica with similar chemical structures which have been synthesized in recent years ( 8 ) .
Here the possibility of a wave of other cannabinomimetic " designer drugs " must be considered .
Due to the increasing knowledge about the utilization of cannabinoids for treatment of therapy resistant symptoms ( 9 ) , this should not be used as an excuse to neglect scientific studies of innovative cannabinomimetic substances .

This is the second in a four - part series on the " State of the States " being released this week on Gallup.com .
The series examines state - by - state differences in party affiliation , religiosity , consumer confidence , and employer hiring and letting go , based on Gallup Poll Daily tracking data collected throughout 2008 .
PRINCETON , NJ --
An analysis of more than 350,000 interviews conducted by Gallup in 2008 finds Mississippi , Alabama , South Carolina , Tennessee , Louisiana , and Arkansas to be the most religious states in the nation .
Vermont , New Hampshire , Maine , and Massachusetts are the least religious states .
The large data set of interviews conducted as part of the Gallup Poll Daily tracking program in 2008 provides uniquely reliable estimates of state - level characteristics .
Each sample of state residents was weighted by demographic characteristics to ensure it is representative of the state 's population .
There are a number of ways to measure the relative religiosity of population segments .
For the current ranking , Gallup uses the responses to a straightforward question that asks : " Is religion an important part of your daily life ? "
The rankings are based on the percentage of each state 's adult ( 18 and older ) population that answers in the affirmative .
The United States is generally a religious nation , although the degree of this religiosity varies across states and regions of the country .
A robust 65 % of all Americans ( across the entire U.S. population ) reported in 2008 that religion was important in their daily lives .
Additionally , at least half of the residents of all but four states ( Vermont , New Hampshire , Maine , and Massachusetts ) say religion is important in their daily lives .
And , although there is a wide range in the self - reported importance of religion , from a high of 85 % for residents of Mississippi to a low of 42 % for residents of Vermont , the distribution of religiosity by state takes the shape of a bell - shaped curve , clustered around the overall nationwide mean of 65 % .
Twenty - three of the 50 states and District of Columbia are in the range of 60 % to 70 % saying religion is important .
The accompanying map shows religiosity by state for 2008 , ranging from states that can be considered the most religious to those that are the least religious on a relative basis .
( The full data for all states appear at the end of the article . )
The map demonstrates that the relative importance of religion in Americans ' lives has interesting geographical differentiation .
Clearly , Southern states are populated by residents with relatively high religiosity , as are several other states in the middle of the country , stretching from Texas through Oklahoma to Kansas and the two Dakotas .
At the same time , states whose residents are least likely to report that religion is important tend to be concentrated in New England and the far West ( with the exception of Utah ) .
Additionally , levels of religiosity are lower in several Mid-Atlantic states .
Implications
The question of why residents of some states ( e.g. , Mississippi and other Southern states ) are highly likely to report that religion is an important part of their lives , while residents of other states ( e.g. , Vermont and other New England states ) are much less likely to report the same is fascinating , but difficult to answer simply .
Differing religious traditions and denominations tend to dominate historically in specific states , and religious groups have significantly different patterns of religious intensity among their adherents .
The states have differing racial and ethnic compositions , which in turn are associated with differing degrees of religiosity .
Certain states may attract in - migrants with specific types of religious intensity .
In addition , there may be differing " state cultures " that are themselves associated with life approaches that give varying degrees of credence to religion as a guiding force .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 355,334 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted in 2008 as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1 percentage points .
The margin of sampling error for most states is ± 1 percentage point , but is as high as ±4 percentage points for the District of Columbia , Wyoming , and North Dakota .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Catholic pilgrims have suffered eye damage after staring at the sun in the hope of witnessing an apparition of the Virgin Mary .
On one occasion in October , around 10,000 people gathered at the Knock shrine in north - west Ireland hoping to see Mary , despite pleas from an archbishop to ignore invitations to the event by a self - proclaimed spiritual healer .
Some of those present said they had seen Mary , venerated by Christians as the mother of Jesus , and attributed her presence to the sun suddenly breaking through the clouds , changing colour , appearing to come closer or spinning in the sky .
Eamonn O'Donoghue , an ophthalmologist at University College Hospital Galway in the west of Ireland , said he had several patients whose retina had been burnt by the sun during a visit to Knock .
" All of these people were under the impression that they would see strange phenomena if they looked at the sun .
It is associated with events at Knock , " Dr O'Donoghue told public radio RTE .
" If you get a burn to your macula ( a part of the retina ) you are going to see bizarre visual phenomena , " he said , comparing the effects to frequently observed damage from watching solar eclipses without adequate protection .
The patients could expect an at least partial recovery within months , he said .

Have you unleashed your inner Edwardian for the West London Shooting School’s …
But the series took a major shift at last season ’s end .
Viewers learned that one of the main characters - unbeknownst to himself - was stolen from a parallel universe , in a grieving parent ’s effort to replace a child who died .
Dunham visited an alternate reality and met Leonard Nimoy , the embodiment of sci fi for its own geektastic sake .
And when the show leaped fully into mind - bending territory - and started to wrestle with dark themes about identity and loss - it shifted from a passable “ X - Files ’ ’ knockoff to a more compelling mystery .
Now , “ Fringe ’ ’ feels more melancholy , more disturbing , and definitely more watchable .
( Lead actress Anna Torv ’s stiff persona still burdens the show , but Torv seems less wooden next to Nimoy . )
Fox seemed similarly cautious about “ Fringe , ’’ its Thursday night series about an FBI unit that investigates the unexplainable .
Last season , the series quickly fell into a rut as a mystery - of - the - week procedural : Special Agent Olivia Dunham would discover some unexplainable phenomenon , and mad scientist Walter Bishop would remember that he had experimented on just that thing back in his crazy LSD days .
Things were allowed to get only too weird before they had to be tied in a neat little knot .
“ Dollhouse ’ ’ suffers from perilously - low ratings , and there ’s a good chance it wo n’t last .
But the show ’s strange trajectory offers lessons about how to better unspool a science - fiction series .
For some maddening reason , Fox is still shying away from letting viewers know precisely what “ Dollhouse ’ ’ is ; the network ’s second - season promos did n’t mention a dystopia at all , and instead showed Dushku in leather pants , posing suggestively with a gun .
It ’s as if the network does n’t trust viewers to accept science fiction on its own , dark , sometimes - convoluted terms .
Then came an unaired 13th episode called “ Epitaph One ’ ’ - available on iTunes and on the first season DVD set - that tells a richer , broader story , set a decade in the future .
The Dollhouse mind - wiping technology has gotten into the wrong hands , mind - controlled zombies roam the streets , and a tiny corps of survivors , led by Dushku ’s consciousness in someone else ’s body , are trying to save the world .
Now that ’s science fiction .
And now that we know what ’s coming , this current season of “ Dollhouse ’ ’ has an under current of doom and a much stronger sense of purpose .
Fox ’s science - fiction series took a while - a whole season , in fact - before it let us in on that pertinent fact , sacrificing a potential audience in the process .
Sure , the Friday night show , from “ Buffy the Vampire Slayer ’’ creator Joss Whedon , came with a creepy concept in the Philip Dick vein : an evil company can erase and replace people ’s memories , and sends a stable of “ actives ’ ’ into the world with new personalities , fitted to clients ’ requests .
The show was meant to be a meditation on identity , gender , exploitation .
But for much of its first season , “ Dollhouse ’ ’ felt more like soft - porn fantasy for the Comic - Con set , as star Eliza Dushku went on “ engagements ’ ’ as essentially a high - tech prostitute .
Science fiction has always had the potential to cross over into the mainstream ; fans of ABC ’s “ Lost ’ ’ stuck around when the show started mining the intricacies of closed - loop time travel theories .
And SciFi ’s “ Battlestar Galactica , ’’ which concluded last spring , proved that viewers have a tolerance for unrelenting darkness .
In fact , the most unsatisfying thing about the series was that it had an uncharacteristically happy ending .
Yet even a network devoted to science fiction seems afraid to get caught in a genre rut .
The network recently changed its name to Syfy - the better to pretend that it ’s not just for the Trekkie types - and offered up a lighter , gentler version of science fiction with the female - friendly “ Warehouse 13 . ’’
The show is campy , filled with cheesy effects and endless banter , and while it ’s been a hit for Syfy , it feels a bit like a cop -out ; the screen lights up most when CCH Pounder , the series ’ creepiest character , drops in for occasional , ominous scenes .
Much more promising is “ Caprica , ’’ the “ Battlestar Galactica ’ ’ prequel set to premiere in January .
The two - hour premiere , about the dangers of artificial intelligence , is imbued with a sense of doom , and some scary - looking robots to boot .
Like “ Battlestar Galactica ’’ ( and “ Dollhouse , ’’ ) it proves that the best science fiction is allegory - a way to extrapolate present - day problems to dangerous extremes .
Here ’s hoping that ABC ’s upcoming series “ V , ’’ the remake of the 1980s alien invasion miniseries that premieres Nov. 3 , follows that mold and imbues its story with some of today ’s toughest themes .
If anything can save ABC ’s creatively - struggling “ FlashForward , ’’ it will be that distinctive sci - fi mix of parable and horror .
The series began with an intriguing and well - produced pilot , in which everyone on Earth lost consciousness and glimpsed the same moment , six months into the future .
But since then , the show has unfolded with maddening thorniness and logic so circular that it gets in the way of suspended disbelief .
An FBI agent has a vision of a bulletin board filled with clues about the blackout .
So whenever he sees an artifact from his vision , he puts it on the board , so his future self will see it as important .
Does he have photographic memory ?
Is he just kind of dumb ?
And if he is , do we care whether he starts drinking again , or breaks up with his wife ?
There ’s some hope that , in coming weeks , we ’ll be seeing a little less of the wheel - spinning FBI agents and a lot more of the bona fide bad guys - including Dominic Monaghan , formerly of “ Lost . ’’
And there have been a few moments when “ FlashForward ’ ’ has slowed down and delivered what the pilot promised so beautifully : a futuristic glimpse of disaster .
One recent episode opened with a flashback to the blackout , a slow - motion bus crash set to Bjork ’s “ It ’s Oh So Quiet . ’’
It was spooky and unsettling , the most satisfying sequence in the series to date .
And it was proof that the networks do n’t need to shy away from the creepiest stuff .
Go ahead .
Lay it on us .
It wo n’t be the end of the world .

NEW DELHI -- Chinese companies have proposed investing $ 50 billion to buy 6 billion barrels of oil reserves in Nigeria , the African nation 's presidential adviser on energy said Tuesday .
" Chinese companies have made proposals to buy reserves in Nigeria .
Specifically , their application is to acquire 6 billion barrels of oil reserves , which we are currently discussing , " Emmanuel Egbogah told reporters on the sidelines of an industry conference .
Mr ....
Yesterday two Los Angeles City Council committees rejected City Attorney Carmen Trutanich 's position that state law does not allow patient collectives to sell medical marijuana .
The Los Angeles Times reports that the council 's planning and public safety committees approved an ordinance that " authorizes cash contributions as long as they comply with state law , which prohibits collectives from making a profit . "
That is consistent with the ordinances of jurisdictions such as West Hollywood and with guidelines issued last year by California Attorney General Jerry Brown .
By contrast , Trutanich and Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley maintain that patients organized as collectives are allowed to grow marijuana for their own medical use but may not sell it , an interpretation of the law that would put all dispensaries out of business .
In a column last month , I speculated about how this disagreement might interact with the Obama administration 's policy of leaving patients and providers alone if they comply with state law .
Update : As Gene Berkman notes in the comments , Cooley today declared that he is determined to prosecute medical marijuana sellers no matter what ordinance the L.A. City Council passes .
" What the City Council is doing is beyond meaningless and irrelevant , " he said .
Councilman Ed Reyes replied : " We 'll let the courts decide .
We are trying our very best to work with a system that is very vague at this moment . "
[ Thanks to Cato 's Jonathan Blanks for the tip . ]
The California housing market is slowly entering phase two with the Alt - A and option ARM train quickly barreling down the tracks .
Attorney General Jerry Brown should be hearing back from some of the top option ARM lenders soon since he put a November 23rd deadline on his request for additional information .
This information should give us deeper insight in to what option ARM lenders have been doing to remedy the approaching tsunami .
It is likely that not much has been done .
Wells Fargo is attempting to remedy the issue by converting Pick - a - Pay loans to interest only loans .
It is yet to be seen how well this is going to workout or what other lenders are doing .
For all the recovery talk , housing is still seeing massive amounts of foreclosures .
On Thursday we saw the 8th consecutive month of 300,000 + foreclosure filings :
In other words , homeowners are still losing homes at a record pace .
The stock market might like this but the vast majority of Americans must be wondering why a stock market is up 60 percent when foreclosures are sky high , unemployment is still increasing , and the U.S. dollar is on a progressive state downward .
The stock market is defying all rules of logic with high price to earnings ratios and ignoring market fundamentals .
Yet in the last two decades , economic fundamentals were after thoughts with two enormous bubbles in technology and housing .
FHA Going Broke
FHA loans were never intended to become a giant part of the mortgage market .
Do n’t tell that to California .
Take for example last month ’s data that shows for Southern California , 36 percent of all homes purchased were financed with FHA insured loans .
Since FHA only requires 3.5 percent down , FHA insured loans have replaced the Alt - A and option ARMs as the new leverage product for those with miniscule down payments .
Surely this move has done wonders for the FHA right ?
“ ( WaPo ) As of Sept. 30 , those reserves had an estimated value of $ 3.6 billion , a sharp drop from the $ 12.9 billion available a year earlier , the audit found .
The current total represents 0.53 percent of all outstanding single - family - home loans insured by the FHA , well below the 2 percent portion set by law .
This is the first time reserves have fallen under that threshold since 1994 .
A year ago , the agency ’s reserves equaled 3 percent of those loans . ”
Whoops .
It must be stunning to find out that making low down payment loans in a recession is resulting in higher defaults .
The only other examples we have of this are interest only loans , subprime , Alt - A , and option ARMs .
FHA was supposed to be different because they actually looked at W - 2s ?
Of course the FHA does n’t envision a scenario that we all now find to be obvious :
“ Under the audit ’s base scenario , the FHA can cover projected losses over 30 years and have $ 3.6 billion left in its reserves if home prices stabilize by the second half of 2010 and start rising about three years later .
The agency ’s reserves could even bounce back to the required 2 percent level by the end of fiscal 2012 , the audit said .
But under the audit ’s most pessimistic assumptions , the reserves would run dry in fiscal 2011 , requiring a $ 1.6 billion cash infusion from the Treasury .
This case assumes that home mortgage interest rates would plummet to about 2 percent and trigger a significant wave of refinancing .
It also assumes that most of those borrowers would refinance out of FHA - backed loans , depriving the agency of insurance premiums .
FHA officials said that scenario is unlikely . ”
The new strategy is more housing speculation !
Wells Fargo is speculating that all those interest only loans will be in the green in a few years and the FHA is thinking that things will turn around by the middle of next year .
I ’m so glad that now instead of toxic mortgage lenders speculating on low down payment mortgages , we have the FHA playing this game .
I described in detail why housing will be in a long winter and much of it goes beyond short - term tweaks to the system .
Another bust for the housing market is the home equity machine phenomenon .
Never in our history have we seen so much money extracted from homes to fuel consumption .
People forget that many of the options ARMs have 2nd mortgages attached to the home .
Some people did not buy during the bubble yet put themselves in financial danger by refinancing their home like a piggybank .
Today ’s home is one of those examples .
Today we salute you Irvine with our Real Home of Genius Award .
The Irvine Home Equity Machine
Orange County has seen the median home price stabilize in 2009 yet this is based on higher priced homes selling at lower prices and the shift in home sales volume .
In fact , foreclosures are at an all time record high :
Source : Matthew Padilla at the O.C. Register
Clearly the above is n’t good news .
Yet if look into the data we see that 1st time homebuyers spurred by the tax credit and investors looking for quick gains are a large part of the current market .
Today ’s home takes us to the city of Irvine .
This home is the perfect example of a home equity machine :
The above is a nice 3 bedroom and 2 baths home that is listed at 1,116 square feet .
This is what you would consider a starter home for a working professional couple .
The home is currently listed for sale at $ 420,000 .
If we look at sales history we see the last recorded sale back in 2000 for $ 265,000 :
Sale History :
9/22/2000 : $ 265,000
So this is a happy ending here right ?
We have someone that bought the home for $ 265,000 and is looking to sell for $ 420,000 .
They missed selling at the peak but that is okay .
Not a bad profit of $ 155,000 without factoring in sales commission or any additional costs .
But that is where the conventional side of the story ends .
California was home to the HELOC ATM machine .
This home was anything but conventional :
Welcome to the OC folks .
So a home purchased in 2000 for $ 265,000 by 2004 had :
First mortgage : $ 315,000
Second mortgage : $ 381,500
Yes , a second bigger than a first .
But the story did n’t end there .
In 2006 they took out a third mortgage with the Orange County Teachers Federal Credit Union for $ 119,100 .
So in total by August of 2006 this home had $ 815,600 in loans !
And not once during the decade did this home sell aside from the 2000 purchase which makes this even more incredible .
And get this .
The Case - Shiller data when this home sells ( if it sells above $ 265,000 ) will register a nice price gain .
Yet the reality is some lenders are going to eat some major losses here .
That is why it is important to look at all the factors involved here .
When talking to people that did n’t grow up in the U.S. about home equity refinancing they cannot believe something like this would happen .
It does n’t compute that people were able to use their home finance vacations , cars , granite countertops , or gold plated toilets .
This was a very unique domestic issue .
Sure , many countries had major housing bubbles but very few have examples of home equity withdrawal machines like the above case in California .
And this is only one example of thousands .
Today we salute you Irvine with our Real Home of Genius Award .

NEW YORK / BOSTON ( Reuters ) - B.J. Kang may be the most feared man on Wall Street .
Galleon hedge fund partner Raj Rajaratnam ( L ) is escorted by FBI agents after being taken into custody in New York , October 16 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Brendan McDermid
When Bernie Madoff , who engineered history ’s biggest Ponzi scheme , was arrested , FBI Special Agent Kang was right at his side .
And less than a year later , there was Kang again , in a “ perp walk , ” shuffling alongside a handcuffed Raj Rajaratnam , the former hedge fund star at Galleon accused of earning millions off illegally obtained stock tips .
The question on the minds of investors , managers and lawyers inside and outside the hedge fund industry today is , who ’s next ?
Of course , no one knows for sure .
But court documents and interviews with many industry sources familiar with the case show that agent Kang may be focusing in on Steven A. Cohen and his $ 12.9 billion SAC Capital Advisors , L.P .
Reuters has learned that Kang investigated allegations of trading irregularities at SAC two years ago , though the inquiry concluded with no charges being filed against the firm .
A member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ’s securities task force , Kang is heading up the two - year - old insider trading inquiry that has collared Rajaratnam and led to criminal charges being filed against 19 others by federal prosecutors in Manhattan .
It was Kang , too , who signed most of the court applications seeking permission to place wiretaps on phones used by Rajaratnam and several other defendants , said people familiar with the investigation .
He also conducted many of the initial interviews with the key cooperating witnesses in the still unfolding case , according to court filings and people close to the probe .
The Galleon investigation has potentially produced a new lead for Kang to pursue against SAC , one of the world ’s largest and most successful hedge funds .
A cooperating witness , Richard Choo - Beng Lee , is expected to provide prosecutors with alleged evidence of insider trading he may have committed between 1999 and 2009 -- a period that includes a five - year stint at SAC , according to the court documents .
For years , Cohen ’s aggressive , quick - paced trading style and high double - digit returns have earned him both admiration and envy in investing circles .
SAC ’s flagship onshore fund , S.A.C. Capital Management , L.P. , which was launched in 1992 , has returned 30 percent net per annum through October 31 , 2009 , according to marketing material .
“ Everyone wants to knock down Steve Cohen , but he is not a multi- billionaire for nothing .
They are having a fantastic year , ” said Bradley Alford , founder of Alpha Capital Management , which invests with Cohen .
But will Kang & Co. spoil the party ?
CHANGE AGENT
Just like Cohen , Kang avoids the limelight and refused to be interviewed for this story .
The FBI would n’t even disclose biographical information about him , including his age .
Known simply as B.J. to lawyers and others who have worked with him , Kang , who is Korean - American , once joked that he prefers using initials because his full name is too hard for most people to pronounce .
With his accounting background he is able to delve deeply into the minutiae of financial crimes .
But Kang ’s toughest challenge may lie ahead of him .
Lawyers , hedge fund traders and others with knowledge of the ongoing investigation say the agent and federal prosecutors are now focused on a number of former SAC employees whose names have cropped up during the Galleon phase of the inquiry and who also may have engaged in insider trading .
Lee , one of five cooperating witnesses in the Galleon case , is prepared to tell authorities about any insider trading he may have engaged in while working as a technology analyst at SAC from 1999 to 2004 , according to a court filing .
Most legal experts say prosecutors will have a hard time using any evidence Lee may provide given that it is relatively old .
The government ’s interest in SAC and Cohen should n’t surprise anyone .
Cohen ’s firm stands at the pinnacle of the $ 1.5 trillion hedge fund industry .
Critics have often complained that SAC gets better access to information from Wall Street firms because of its sheer size and the hundreds of millions in commissions it pays out .
Since Cohen founded SAC in 1992 , it has posted losses just once -- during last year ’s financial crisis , when the average hedge fund lost 19 percent and Cohen ’s portfolio was off 27.56 percent .
The firm exudes success .
Pricey paintings adorn SAC ’s headquarters in Stamford , Connecticut , where Cohen sits most days at the center of a giant trading floor surrounded by hundreds of employees .
Investors must commit at least $ 10 million and they pay Cohen more than most rival hedge fund managers -- a 3 percent annual management fee plus as much as 50 percent of the gains he and his traders deliver .
SAC ’s top traders typically take home lavish compensation packages that stand out even by Wall Street standards .
“ When you work for him you are paid to perform , ” Alpha Capital ’s Alford said .
“ And if you do n’t cut it , it is like in major league sports , you get sent back to the minor leagues , ” Alford said , adding “ SAC has had only one down year . ”
FIRST RUN-IN
B.J. Kang was two years on the job when he first encountered Cohen ’s hedge fund .
In 2006 , the agent was part of the prosecution team looking into alleged accounting irregularities at Canadian insurer Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd , say people familiar with the situation .
In the midst of that government inquiry , Fairfax , in July 2006 , sued SAC , James Chanos ’ Kynikos Associates and other hedge funds , claiming they had engaged in a conspiracy to drive down the price of the insurer ’s shares because they were shorting -- or betting on a decline in Fairfax ’s stock price .
Soon after , for reasons that remain unclear , the federal government ’s interest in pursuing a Fairfax accounting case began to fade .
Indeed , this summer Fairfax said it had received notification from the Securities and Exchange Commission that a parallel investigation it had been pursuing was completed and regulators had no plans to “ recommend any enforcement action . ”
In 2007 , Kang was assigned to work on a previously undisclosed investigation involving alleged trading irregularities at Cohen ’s hedge fund , said people familiar with that matter .
That inquiry , opened by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn , New York , concluded with authorities declining to take action against Cohen or anyone else associated with SAC .
But before the probe by Brooklyn prosecutors was closed , Kang interviewed former SAC analyst Andrew Tong , who had already become a tabloid sensation -- not to mention an embarrassment to SAC .
In a lawsuit earlier that year Tong had charged that his male supervisor , Ping Jiang , then a top SAC trader , forced him to perform oral sex on him before completing a trade , according to people familiar with the investigation and court papers .
Tong also alleged Jiang ordered him to take female hormones to turn him into “ the ideal analyst / trader , ” combining both male and female characteristics , the court documents note .
The case file was quickly sealed by the trial judge , making it difficult for reporters to get a glimpse at all the salacious allegations .
After the litigation ended last year , without any money exchanging hands , the court filings were quietly unsealed .
A close review of the documents , in addition to conversations with people familiar with the investigation , reveal that what most interested Kang was n’t the accusations of coerced gay sex , but Tong ’s allegations of manipulative trading at SAC .
In early 2006 , according to the court papers , Jiang directed Tong and at least two other SAC employees to take part in a manipulative trading scheme involving shares of China Yuchai International Ltd. , a Chinese - based diesel engine manufacturing company .
The court papers suggest the hedge fund took a short position in shares of China Yuchai ; betting the stock would fall in price .
The papers say Tong and others then began “ manufacturing false negative analytical reports about CYD to facilitate this manipulation . ”
The strategy did n’t work and SAC took a $ 3 million hit , which Tong claims Jiang ultimately blamed on him .
Tong alleged that Jiang used the loss as a justification to fire him and that the real reason for his dismissal was his decision to stop taking the female hormones and engaging in “ sexual conduct with Mr. Jiang , ” the documents say .
A lawyer for Jiang did n’t return several phone calls .
Tong ’s lawyer , Parisis Filippatos , said his client could not be reached for comment .
A spokesman for the prosecutors ’ office in Brooklyn declined to comment .
It ’s not clear why the investigation in Brooklyn ended without any action being taken .
Nor is it clear what precipitated the inquiry .
A related investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission into Tong ’s sexual harassment allegation was closed in April 2008 with the agency taking no action against the hedge fund or Tong ’s former boss .
But the court filings in the Tong lawsuit hint at the difficulties Kang and others in law enforcement may face in pursuing a case against SAC if any wrongdoing is ever uncovered .
In one filing , Tong recalls Jiang telling him that SAC places a premium on secrecy and guarding its trading strategies -- even from some of the fund ’s top officers .
( Click here link.reuters.com / guz74g to see a copy of a previously sealed court document from the Tong lawsuit summarizing the sexual harassment and manipulative trading allegations . )
“ Steven Cohen only wants us to make money , he does n’t care or want to know our secrets to make money -- SAC does n’t need to know and does n’t want to know , ” Tong said in the filing , quoting one of Jiang ’s instructions to him .
CAMERA SHY
Cohen is so intensely private he hates being photographed and has even bought the rights to some pictures taken by freelancers .
He has generally dealt with rumors and speculation about questionable trading strategies at SAC by simply ignoring them .
That appears to be the strategy he is pursuing this time around as well .
A lawyer for the hedge fund declined to comment .
Former SAC employees , however , have already started to talk .
Lee ’s cooperation was secured in part because of incriminating evidence that federal authorities had captured from a government wiretap on his cell phone while working at San Jose , California - based Spherix Capital .
( Kang oversaw the tap on Lee ’s phone . )
In pleading guilty on October 13 , Lee signed a cooperation agreement that requires him not only to testify about his misdeeds at Spherix , but also provide prosecutors with any evidence of alleged insider trading over an eight - year period starting in 1999 .
He worked at SAC for five of them , and the rest of the time was at Stratix Capital Management .
The Wall Street Journal previously has reported that after Spherix closed its doors in February , federal authorities encouraged Lee -- who had begun cooperating with the investigation -- to try to return to SAC .
But Cohen refused , the Journal reported , because he was suspicious of the reasons behind Spherix ’s closing .
Lee is also expected to testify about any improper trading he may have done at Stratix , a hedge fund founded by two more SAC alumni , Richard Grodin and Ian Goodman .
That fund , which counted SAC among its investors , closed in 2007 .
Grodin launched another fund , Quadrum Capital , and it too abruptly shut down this year .
A few months ago , federal authorities asked Quadrum to turn over some trading records , but the government has n’t asked for anything since , said a person close to the fund .
MAKING THE CRIMINAL CASE
Of course , Kang is n’t infallible .
A person familiar with the wiretap applications in the Galleon case cited one example he considered overreaching by Kang in trying to make a criminal case .
In that instance , Kang had to make a revision in one wiretap application because he earlier made a wrong conclusion about the identity of a person referred to as “ Adam ” in one of the taped phone conversations .
The person in question actually worked for Galleon -- not for another “ independent hedge fund , ” as Kang had thought , said this source .
Then again , Kang is n’t working alone .
The other main agent assigned to the Galleon investigation is David Makol , a seven - year veteran of the FBI ’s other major securities fraud task force based in Kew Gardens , Queens .
Makol had a featured role in the last big Wall Street insider trading prosecution , which centered around a former UBS managing director who took cash from a group of traders in exchange for providing them with advance notice of impending changes in stock recommendations by the investment bank ’s analysts .
As one of the first prosecutions to reveal the existence of an underground network of day traders and hedge fund managers who barter or buy non-public information to trade on , the UBS insider trading case has served as a road map of sorts for law enforcement in the Galleon investigation .
FRIEND OR FOE
Kang and Cohen have n’t always been adversaries .
In 2006 , Kang was involved in bringing a criminal case against a person who tried to defraud SAC and other businesses .
The case involved Michael Lair , a Montana man , who approached a lawyer defending SAC in a lawsuit the Canadian drug company Biovail Corp had filed against SAC .
The man had offered to provide SAC ’s lawyer with allegedly incriminating information about Biovail ’s attorneys for a fee .
In fact , the Biovail lawyers fired Lair shortly before he approached SAC and its lawyer .
Kang signed the criminal complaint against Lair , who was charged with trying to defraud SAC , Biovail and other companies .
In April 2007 , Lair pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 27 months in prison .
He was also ordered to forfeit some $ 300,000 in fees he had extracted from a dozen companies that he had fleeced in the scheme .
Six months later , the Galleon investigation was well under way and Kang was onto his next assignment that has opened a new window into Steven Cohen ’s world .

The latest dispute arises from a stark denial that languages have any peculiar grammatical universals of their own .
It amounts to a total rejection of Chomsky ’s core idea that the syntax of any individual language reflects an instance of a universal grammar ( UG ) .
Nicholas Evans and Stephen C. Levinson have published a paper in the wonderful journal Behavioral and Brain Sciences , “ The Myth of Language Universals : Language diversity and its importance for cognitive science ” ( uncorrected final draft available here ) .
Also published with the paper were a series of responses including many sharp retorts from generative grammarians who still firmly believe in UG .
They score their points , but the fact that the issue has returned underlines the basic fact : after fifty years of proclaiming the existence of a UG , we still do n’t know what it is .
All in all the paper and responses make for a brutal slugfest .
The question at hand : do the things that all languages have in common reflect certain universals of human thought and experience , or do they reflect the workings of a universal language faculty ?
Fifty years ago a third answer dominated : languages are learned from scratch and have no universals .
That position , however , is still so out of favor that it is not much proposed in the current quarrel .
One of the most basic quarrels about language and its origins has flared up again in a particularly fierce way .
polysynthetic languages – which typically have extreme levels of morphological complexity in their verb , but little in the way of syntactic organization at the clause level or beyond – show scant evidence for embedding . [ p. 442 ]
The centerpiece of the main paper ( known as E&L ) is its discussion of the enormous range of diversity in languages .
Diversity in form ( speech and signs ) .
Diversity in phonology .
Diversity in word classes , in organization , and basic skeleton .
Is recursive embedding your sine qua non for a UG ?
E&L reply :
I ’ve heard Derek Bickerton argue that the absence of recursion in any particular instance is no proof that it is n’t part of UG .
Languages do not have to avail themselves of every available feature .
I regret that Bickerton was not one of the respondents in this paper , but although his point is valid it leaves us wondering just what is the universal grammar .
A number of generative grammarians responded to the paper with the basic argument that examples of diversity are no proof of an absence of underlying universal rule .
It is an undeniable point , but it is not proof of UG ’s existence .
Normally in science it is up to the proposer of something ’s existence to demonstrate the claim .
It is very difficult to confirm a negative — e.g. , there is no spaghetti on any of the planets in the Andromeda galaxy — so it is up to the proposer to show that something does exist .
If you claim there is pasta in outer space , prove it .
Of course , many linguists are trying to demonstrate the UG ’s existence and they may mean only that their effort is still worth pursuing .
Finding a UG that really works would probably score as the most impressive scientific achievement since Newton produced an equation that explained the motions of the solar system , so it should not be abandoned lightly .
But E&L make the project look increasingly frayed .
Most surprising to me was the tepid response of two of the biggest guns in the generative army .
Steven Pinker and Ray Jackendoff ( P&J ) responded with a comment titled , “ The reality of a universal language faculty . ”
They specify their UG hypothesis :
the human brain is equipped with circuitry , partly specific to language , that makes language acquisition possible and that constrains human languages to a characteristic design . [ 465 ]
The evidence they offer is entertainingly negative .
For example , they imagine a language called Abba :
Abba specifies grammatical relations not in terms of agent , patient , theme , location , goal , and so on , but in terms of evolutionarily significant relationships : predator - prey , eater - food , enemy - ally , permissible - impermissible sexual partners , and so on .
All other semantic relations are metaphorical extensions of these . [ 465 ]
But in reality there is no such language .
Why not ?
Why does it even seem absurd ?
Why do languages , for all their diversity , limit themselves to only some relationships while others are unlearnable ?
P&J say the absence supports their hypothesis that languages are limited to a characteristic design , but they do not show that the limit comes from language - specific circuitry .
Their example does not contradict the E&L hypothesis that the commonalities of language come from general cognitive powers .
P&J put the commonality in high - level syntactic terms — agent , patient , theme , location , goal — but these things are concrete and perceivable , so they do not seem to require syntactic thought .
On the other hand , evolutionarily significant relationships are abstractions that are not perceived at a glance the way spatial relationships are .
After reading P&J I have a strong sense that the searchers for UG will have a hard time finding a negative example that limits language in some way that perception is not limited ..
Michael Tomasello ’s gleefully titled response to E&L , “ Universal grammar is dead , ” goes for the jugular :
I am told that a number of supporters of universal grammar will be writing commentaries on this article .
Though I have not seen them , here is what is certain .
You will not be seeing arguments of the following type : I have systematically looked at a well - chosen sample of the world ’s languages , and I have discerned the following universals … [ 470 ]
Yet he does acknowledge that there are a number of universalities among diverse language : e.g. , reference to “ agents of action , ” “ patients of action , ” “ possessors , ” and “ locations . ”
Tomasello asks why not just call this universal grammar but he answers that this kind of thinking is much older than language :
… historically , universal grammar referred to specific linguistic content , not general cognitive principles , and so it would be a misuse of the term .
It is not the idea of universals of language that is dead , but rather , it is the idea that there is a biological adaptation with specific linguistic content that is dead . [ 471 ]
That ’s the dispute .
Are there universals with “ linguistic content ” or , as P& J put it “ circuitry … limited to language ? ”
If yes , then an account of linguistic origins , must include an explanation of where that circuitry came from .
If no , then we have to understand how we got to be so smart and how we discovered how to translate our knowledge into language .
At the protolanguage conference in Torun , Poland last September it seemed clear that the momentum is heavily behind the thesis that we discovered how to translate our thinking into basic language and then cultural evolution accounts for the rest .
I ’m not sure that the origin of language was that straightforward , but it has become obvious the shaky position of UG is insufficiently recognized by many non-linguists when they try to contribute to the discussion of the evolution of language .
The misconception that the differences between languages are merely superficial , and that they can be resolved by postulating a more abstract formal level at which individual language differences disappear … pervades a great deal of work done in … theories of language evolution … and just about every branch of the cognitive sciences . …
A great deal of theoretical work within the cognitive sciences thus risks being vitiated , at least if it purports to be investigating a fixed human language processing capacity , rather than just the particular form this takes in some well - known languages like English and Japanese . [ 429-30 ]
I have read many papers about language origins in which I see the unquestioned assumption that UG is real , and I often wonder if their authors know just how dubious a thread they are grasping .

[ Here 's the latest postmortem extract from our colleagues at Game Developer magazine , and it's an exclusive from the most excellent and startlingly freeform Scribblenauts from the 5th Cell folks - excellent ! ]
The latest , November 2009 issue of GSW sister publication Game Developer magazine has just recently debuted , and includes a postmortem of 5th Cell 's Scribblenauts , written by studio co-founder Joseph Tringali .
Scribblenauts , a unique word - driven puzzle platformer , was the third original Nintendo DS property from Bellevue - based 5th Cell .
Its widely - discussed main hook is the ability for players to enter nearly any conceivable non-proper noun into its text parser , at which point the game will spawn that item into the world .
Initial Lack of Vision
The complaint most frequently leveraged against Scribblenauts revolved around its often - finicky touch screen controls , and 5th Cell acknowledges that the scheme was not given the attention it may have needed :
" The sensitivity of the stylus controls is easily the biggest issue in Scribblenauts , a fact that has been reinforced by reviewers and users .
We knew this was going to take a big hit from reviewers , but we could only spend a limited amount of work on it .
We discussed a secondary D - pad control option midway through development only to come to the conclusion it would take a single person 3 – 4 weeks to integrate it .
On our self - funded schedule , that route was not an option . "
" The root cause of this issue was limited time , and our decision to focus more on delivering what we had promised with the ' Write anything .
Solve everything . '
The slogan was the right one in the end , but it hurt the second most important part of the game , the controls .
" We still feel stylus control was the correct decision for Scribblenauts .
The DS is a casual platform by design and allowing non-gamers the ease of use of a pencil - like system for a game targeted at everyone over a D - pad only scheme was overall the best choice .
But in retrospect ; our implementation of those controls was only at 50 percent of where it needed to be .
" It would have been better to cut a secondary feature early on , such as the Wi-Fi connection , to allow us the time to fully realize stylus controls .
However by the time we realized controls would take weeks to get right from play testing , it was too late to cut features . "
Localization
Most games have to deal with localization , but few games rely so exclusively on text not just for narrative concerns but for fundamental gameplay .
As one might expect , that aspect of Scribblenauts proved difficult at times :
" Our products have always released worldwide , so we planned for localization in Scribblenauts from the start .
We built in localization support for the dictionary in Objectnaut , and planned to handle in - game localization as we had in our previous titles .
Unfortunately , Scribblenauts ended up with far more text then we anticipated , and because of the level finalization coming late , our hint text that displayed at the beginning of each level was n’t localizable until the last minute .
" Our localization system for previous games had relied on a custom tool which pulled text from . txt strings and exported to Microsoft Excel , which could then be sent to the localizers .
What was sent back was imported using the same tool and showed up in game .
The tool itself was very useful , but optimized for previous titles that only had game text .
With Scribblenauts , we had game text plus a huge dictionary , and they both utilized different systems .
" We delivered Scribblenauts in English , French , Spanish , Brazilian Portuguese , German , Italian , Dutch , U.K. - English , Danish , Finnish , Swedish and Norwegian .
We had unique dictionaries for every language , and these word lists were constantly being updated .
Version control became a nightmare as we tracked dozens of files for both dictionary files and word lists .
" The system , although severely stressed , made it through , and we shipped all languages .
If I could revisit pre-production , we should have either invested in building or licensing a single web tool to manage all the game text . "
Level Design From Project Start
Structurally , Scribblenauts is a direct series of levels , in the most straightforward way .
That , along with the open - ended nature of the gameplay , meant it was crucial to get going with level design as early as possible :
" We devoted a good chunk of time to designing levels on paper early on in the project .
Because Scribblenauts is a game where the designers could use anything they could think of in a level , it was really important to break away from habits in traditional level design and really take advantage of our dictionary .
" While initially our level designs were simple and familiar , the more time we spent designing on paper , the more interesting and outlandish our designs became .
" The amount of time we spent brainstorming , iterating , researching , and challenging each others ’ ideas meant we had an increasingly varied landscape to pull from , and from there we chose which levels would go into the final game — to the tune of more than seven - hundred level designs , sampling as much of our dictionary as possible to give players a sense of its scope . "
Additional Info
The full postmortem for Scribblenauts explores more of " What Went Right " and " What Went Wrong " during the course of the game 's development , and is now available in the November 2009 issue of Game Developer magazine .
The issue also includes a roundup of more than 50 of the year 's most interesting industry figures , an analysis of cloud computing , an interview with Sega veteran Naoto Ohshima ( Sonic the Hedgehog , Nights into Dreams ) , and our regular monthly columns on design , art , music , programming , and humor .
Worldwide paper - based subscriptions to Game Developer magazine are currently available at the official magazine website , and the Game Developer Digital version of the issue is also now available , with the site offering six months ' and a year 's subscriptions , alongside access to back issues and PDF downloads of all issues , all for a reduced price .
There is now also an opportunity to buy the digital version of this edition as a single issue .
Mormon Apostle Dallin
Oaks chose a friendly audience deep within the Book - of - Mormon - belt for his now controversial October 13 speech in defense of the Mormons ’ ongoing fight against same - sex civil marriage .
Speaking to students at Brigham Young University - Idaho , Oaks decried the continuing erosion of religious freedom and the declining influence of religion in the public sphere , before mounting a strongly - worded defense of “ the ancient order ” of marriage against the “ alleged ‘ civil right ’ of same - gender couples to enjoy the privileges of marriage . ”
Elder Oaks recalled expressions of outrage directed at Mormons and acts of vandalism against Mormon temples and wardhouses committed after the November 2008 passage of Proposition 8 outlawing same - sex marriage in California .
( Mormons , who make up 2 % of California ’s population , contributed more than 50 % of the individual donations to the Proposition 8 campaign and a sizeable majority of its on - the - ground efforts . )
The post -Proposition 8 backlash was , he stated , comparable to Civil Rights Movement - era “ voter intimidation of blacks in the South . ”
Oaks , a former University of Chicago law professor who clerked for United States Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren in 1957 and 1958 in the aftermath of the Warren court ’s landmark Brown vs. Board of Education ( 1954 ) desegregation decision , knew that his black - Mormon comparison would draw public attention .
In fact , when he previewed his speech for an AP reporter on October 12 , he speculated that it might “ be offensive to some . ”
Sure enough , commentators from within ( and without ) the world of Mormonism have questioned the soundness of Oaks ’ analogy , asking whether Mormons in their effort to eliminate same - sex marriage are more justly characterized as proponents of religious freedom or opponents of gay human rights .
In fact , four Mormon gay rights groups issued a joint statement on October 16 urging the Apostle to consider how the Mormon anti-gay marriage effort might paradoxically compromise religious freedom for members of faiths that recognize the sanctity of committed same - sex relationships .
But most of Oaks ’ respondents politely sidestepped an even deeper paradox troubling his black - Mormon analogy : the fact that Mormons have our own long and peculiar history of discrimination against African Americans .
MSNBC commentator Keith Olbermann alluded to this history when he gave Oaks his daily “ worst person in the world ” award on October 14 .
Comparing the Proposition 8 Mormon backlash and the harassment of black voters was especially inappropriate , Olbermann argued , because Mormons had been “ on the wrong side of integration . ”
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints prohibited individuals of African descent from joining the Church ’s lay priesthood ( open to all devout Mormon men over the age of twelve ) , serving as missionaries , or participating in Mormon temple ordinances from 1849 until 1978 , a fact that many Mormons today find difficult to talk about or explain .
In the earliest years of Mormon history , during the 1830s and 1840s , six or seven African - American men including Elijah Abel ( 1808 –1885 ) and Walker Lewis ( 1798 –1856 ) were ordained to the Church ’s priesthood .
But under the leadership of Mormon Church president Brigham Young , the ordination of African - American men ceased , African - American men and women were prohibited from temple worship , and intermarriage was officially discouraged .
Some historians believe that Young ’s about - face on the status of African Americans may have been motivated by embarrassment stemming from an 1847 scandal involving an excommunicated African - American Mormon named William McCary , or by political pressures surrounding the extension of slavery to Utah territory .
Whatever the actual motivation for the priesthood ban , Mormons soon articulated a number of working theological narratives to legitimate anti-African American discrimination , drawing liberally from European and European - American folk theologies that identified Africans and African Americans as the descendents of Cain or Ham .
According to some Mormons , the priesthood ban was an element of the curse placed upon Cain for killing his brother Abel ( Genesis 4 ) , or the curse levied on Ham ’s son Canaan to punish Ham ’s humiliation of his father , Noah ( Genesis 9:20 - 27 ) .
The Pearl of Great Price , a Mormon book of scripture , described the people of Canaan as being cursed with “ blackness ” ( Moses 7:5 - 8 ) and indicated that descendents of Ham and his wife Egyptus were “ cursed … as pertaining to the Priesthood ” ( Abraham 1:21 - 26 ) .
In 1849 , Brigham Young declared that “ the Lord had cursed Cain ’s seed with blackness and prohibited them the Priesthood , ” a position he reaffirmed in a January 16 , 1852 statement to the Utah territorial legislature :
Any man having one drop of the seed of [ Cain ] … in him cannot hold the priesthood and if no other Prophet ever spake it before I will say it now in the name of Jesus Christ I know it is true and others know it .
Another rationale for Mormon discrimination against African Americans was articulated in 1845 by Mormon Apostle Orson Hyde , who speculated that the cursed condition of African Americans was a consequence of their actions during their premortal existence .
Throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , these doctrines gained traction while memories of early African - American priesthood holders like Elijah Abel faded ; Church leaders continued to prohibit temple ordinances and priesthood ordination for Church members with as little as “ 1/32 ” African - American ancestry .
In 1949 , the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints issued a statement declaring that the black priesthood ban was a “ direct commandment from the Lord , on which is founded the doctrine of the Church from the days of its organization . ”
The rise of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s actually spurred some Mormon leaders to renew their support for discrimination .
In a 1954 speech at Brigham Young University , Apostle Mark E. Peterson denounced interracial marriage on theological grounds , arguing that “ if there is one drop of Negro blood in my children … they receive the curse [ of Canaan ] ” ; in 1958 Bruce R. McConkie wrote in Mormon Doctrine that African Americans had been “ less valiant in the pre-existence , ” and thus “ sent to earth through the lineage of Cain . ”
Speaking from the pulpit at a semi-annual Church Conference in 1965 , Apostle Ezra Taft Benson ( a former Secretary of Agriculture under Eisenhower ) charged that the Civil Rights Movement was a Communist plot to destroy America .
Other Mormon leaders were more moderately disposed towards African American equality .
Historians credit Apostle Hugh B. Brown and Church President David O. McKay with efforts to open the question of ending the priesthood ban , even though both men maintained personal misgivings about the Civil Rights Movement .
In 1969 , the First Presidency of the Church issued an official statement expressing support for full civil equality under the law for all citizens regardless of race while defending the black priesthood ban as a prerogative of religious freedom .
On June 8 , 1978 , the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus - Christ of Latter - day Saints announced that “ the long - promised day has come when every faithful , worthy man in the Church may receive the holy priesthood , ” effectively ending the prohibition on full African American participation .
The announcement was accepted as revelation by an affirmation of the Church membership at the October Church General Conference and subsequently canonized as scripture .
In the years since the repeal of the priesthood ban , a number of official steps have been taken to correct prejudice within the Church .
The Church published a new edition of the Book of Mormon in 1981 , replacing a promise that the righteous would become “ white ” with a promise that they would be made “ pure ” ( 2 Nephi 30:6 ) , but leaving intact a handful of other Book of Mormon scriptures correlating dark skin with spiritual accursedness .
In 1990 , Helvecio Martins , an Afro-Brazilian Mormon , became the first man of African descent to be ordained as one of the Church ’s General Authorities .
African - American Mormons and their allies have also undertaken a number of unofficial efforts to raise consciousness about Black Mormon experience and concerns , like the well - received 2007 documentary Nobody Knows : The Untold Story of Black Mormons .
( Experts estimate there are now about 1 million Mormons of African descent worldwide . )
But without an official , explicit clarification of earlier teachings on race , many older Mormons continue to quietly maintain and circulate old beliefs connecting blackness and the priesthood ban to the Cain - Ham genealogy or to lack of spiritual valiance in pre-earthly life .
Younger Mormons born after the end of the priesthood ban , and raised in what one prominent black Mormon has described as Mormonism ’s “ deafening silence ” on race , have little knowledge of the Church ’s history of discrimination and few resources for coming to terms with it .
Indeed , Mormons may now have a greater sense of their own historical persecution as a religious minority than they do a sense of responsibility for the Mormon Church ’s discriminatory history .
Whereas Mormonism ’s African - American problem is rarely discussed within mainstream orthodox Mormon circles , stories about nineteenth - century anti-Mormon mob violence , the state of Missouri ’s 1838 Mormon “ extermination order , ” the assassination of Joseph Smith Jr. , and the subsequent exodus to Utah are frequently recounted .
Last November ’s protests directed at Mormon temples and wardhouses after the election only confirmed and intensified Mormons ’ deeply - held sense of marginalization and persecution .
Elder Oaks ’ October 13 analogy between African Americans and Mormons mobilized this sense of persecution and galvanized Mormon same - sex marriage opponents , just as Maine ’s Proposition 1 campaign to ban same - sex marriage enters its home stretch and last - minute fundraising appeals from the National Organization for Marriage find their way into Mormon same - sex marriage activists ’ inboxes .
The majority said the link was not proven , that green propaganda was to blame or the world was not heating up at all .
Last week , a private exchange of emails among climate scientists stoked a firestorm of scepticism after it was hacked and posted on the web .
The memos expressed frustration at the scientists ' inability to explain what they described as a temporary slowdown in warming , and discussed ways to counter the campaigns of climate naysayers .
Experts see several explanations for the eagerness with which so many dismiss climate change as overblown or a hoax .
" There is the individual reluctance to give up our comfortable lifestyles - to travel less , consume less , " said Anthony Grayling , a philosophy professor at the University of London and a bestselling author in Britain .
While deeply anchored in the West , this resistance also extends to emerging economies such as China , India and Brazil where a burgeoning middle class is only today tasting the fruits of a lifestyle they have waited so long and worked so hard to obtain .
For Tim Kasser , a professor of psychology at Knox University in Galesburg , Illinois , the reality of climate change impinges on core aspects of our identity .
" We are told a thousand times a day , notably through advertising , that the way to a happy , successful and meaningful life is through consumption , " he said .
" But now scientists and environmentalists come along and say part of the problem is that we are consuming too much or in the wrong way . "
Yet there may also be a darker explanation .
It is the human instinct to shut out or modify a terrifying truth : that the world as we know it is heading for a smash .
" It 's a paradox : when it comes to disasters , people do not allow themselves to believe what they know , " explained Jean - Pierre Dupuy , a professor of social philosophy at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris .
" Because everybody is in denial - or would like to be in denial - and would prefer to not shoulder too much of the responsibility for dealing with the problem , you have a kind of disconnect here , " Grayling said .
Even scientists reluctantly pushed by their growing sense of alarm into launching public appeals for action have trouble coping .
When Clive Hamilton , a professor of public ethics at Australian National University , attended a September climate conference at Oxford tasked with imagining a world warmed by 4 degrees Celsius , he was struck by how researchers spoke among themselves .
" It was very revealing .
As they relaxed somewhat , they began to speak about their fears , about losing sleep , not wanting to think about the implications of what they do , " he recalled .
Under such circumstances , people are resourceful in finding ways to reassure themselves or turn their backs on the threat posed by climate change .
Some applaud their own environmental virtue : " Changing to compact fluorescent bulbs makes people feel good - ' I 've done my bit for today , ' " said Kasser , describing a common attitude in the United States .
" Blaming China and India is another great psychological defence mechanism . "
A more sophisticated variant is to conclude , with a sigh of resignation .
that individual action is n't enough .
" Even if all of us were at our most maximally green , it probably would n't make much more than about a 0.5 per cent difference , " said Grayling in characterising this mentality .
At some point , however , reality may bite .
Hamilton , who is running for Parliament in Australia , said more and more people he meets are having what he calls an " Oh shit ! " moment .
" It 's that moment when you really get it , when you understand not just intellectually but emotionally that climate change is really happening .
I think we will see a rush of that over the next couple of years , " he said .
It may take one or more terrible shocks - national bankruptcies , a major environmental disaster in a vulnerable country like Bangladesh - for that to happen , said Grayling .

Once it does , " it will be impossible to look back over your shoulder and think , ' it 's not true , ' or ' there will be a scientific fix , it will all go away ' . "

Interview reveals Blizzard “ will definitely work on a console game at some point . ”
December 21 , 2009 –
In an interview late last week with Gamasutra , Blizzard ’s Samwise Didier and J. Allen Brack discussed the evolution of the Warcraft series on its fifteenth anniversary , and suggested that , many years removed from their Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis titles , Blizzard would be returning to consoles again .
Blizzard has made a name for itself in the video game industry by creating some of the most noteworthy series of all time .
Spawning Diablo , Starcraft and Warcraft , Blizzard ’s resume features many of the best - known games of a generation , as well as some of the most critically acclaimed titles .
Less known , however , is Blizzard ’s console background in which they produced The Lost Vikings and Rock ‘n Roll Racing .
Speaking of Blizzard ’s lineup of PC games and as to whether they would be producing for the consoles , J. Allen Brack said , “ there ’s a perception , I think , that Blizzard is anti-console , and that ’s absolutely not the case .
We just want to make the right game for the right platform …
But we ’re a company of gamers .
I have two consoles at home .
Sam has consoles .
We ’re a culture of gamers .
We will definitely work on a console game at some point .
I have no doubt about that .
It ’s just [ a matter of ] what game .
What makes the most sense ? ”
So what game makes the most sense for Blizzard to develop for consoles ?
We ’ll just have to wait , though , jokingly , J. Allen Brack suggested Blizzard was developing World of Lost Vikings , which would certainly be a huge hit .

Model ' caught with £ 627,000 worth of cocaine in her Mercedes '
A model caught with £ 627,250 worth of cocaine hidden in her Mercedes was orchestrating a big money drugs deal , a court has heard .
Kelly Askew was driving the car when undercover police pulled her over and found two blocks of cocaine , weighing almost 2kg .
The 30 - year - old blamed her partner , passenger John Clayton , and claimed he told her not to be ' nosy ' about the purpose of their journey .
Model criminal : Unemployed sleepwear model Kelly Askew has been jailed
Greater Manchester police stopped the car on the A666 , in Bolton , at around 7.30 pm on June 11 and found the drugs in a green plastic bag in the passenger footwell .
She told officers she knew nothing about the package and in later police interviews claimed she often drove Clayton from place to place because he was banned from driving .
She claimed Clayton had told her not to be ' nosy ' when she asked about the purpose of the trip to Yorkshire .
Police had watched as Askew , who is currently unemployed , parked up into a country lane near Bradford , where a man in his 20s , dressed in a shell suit , walked to the car and started talking to her partner .
Geoff Whelan , prosecuting , told Bolton Court that Askew , then drove off to head towards the M62 , seemingly heading back to Liverpool .
When the car was pulled over , Clayton got out and tried to walk away but was stopped by officers , who then told Askew to stay in the car .
Mr Whelan said Askew was receiving income support of £ 260 a fortnight , housing benefit , child benefit and tax credits , and Clayton was also on state benefits .
He added on ' rare occasions ' , Askew did ' a bit of modelling ' , adding the Mercedes C220 cost £ 12,000 .
Mr Whelan said : ' That is a pretty reasonable car for someone in her position , with young children and on state benefits . '
The court also heard a black and pink Nokia mobile phone seized from the car linked Askew to the allegations of drug dealing with Clayton , who has pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply class A drugs .
Mr Whelan said the crown did not believe she was a ' gullible taxi driver ' .
He said : ' Any claims she has of ignorance are simply self - serving lies in order to distance herself from the evidence of her involvement . '
Mother - of - two Askew has previously appeared in newspaper fashion shoots , modelling sleepwear in a department store .
She has also modelled wedding dresses , and in 2002 , successfully auditioned to be part of a new Liverpool - based girl band .
Askew is charged with possession of class A drugs with intent to supply .
She has pleaded not guilty .
The trial continues .
The CBC Radio show C’est la vie , an English - language show about “ life in French - speaking Canada , ” recently interviewed Natasha Ivisic , a woman from the Montreal area who has produced a documentary called Je porte le voile , or “ I wear the veil . ”
The podcast of the show can be found here ( look for the November 29 , 2009 episode ) , and this particular episode was described on the show ’s website as follows :
Natasha was born and raised a Catholic in Montreal .
But when she met her future husband , she converted to Islam .
Natasha was proud to wear the veil , and testified wearing it at the Bouchard - Taylor hearings on reasonable accommodation .
Now , as her daughter contemplates wearing the veil , Natasha has made a documentary .
Hear her story on C’est la vie .
Interviewer Bernard St - Laurent spoke to both Ivisic and to Yanick Létourneau , the co-director of the documentary .
St - Laurent introduces Ivisic as someone who wore hijab for thirteen years , and “ was proud to wear it . ”
Ivisic was born in Quebec , to parents from originally from Bosnia and Croatia , and was raised Catholic .
She became Muslim in the early 1990s .
As Ivisic explained in the interview , she began wearing hijab around fourteen years ago , after the birth of her second child , a daughter , because she believed that the headscarf was required , and wanted to set a good example for her daughter , with the hope that she would see her daughter happy with it and would choose to wear it herself .
She describes the first time wearing it as difficult , but positive , that she was proud to be doing it for God and to display her Muslim faith .
Many years later , Ivisic decided to make her documentary because her daughter was at an age where she was beginning to think about wearing the headscarf .
In making the documentary , Ivisic wanted to speak to a variety of Muslim women about why they do – or do n’t – wear it .
She also wanted to dispel myths about the headscarf and about the women who wear it .
If you ’re interested , a trailer for the film is available at this link .
The trailer begins with Ivisic ’s daughter asking her mother why she wears the veil , and later shows a conversation with two Muslim women , one who wears it and one who does n’t ; the one who wears it argues that it is a clear religious obligation , and that people should n’t just pick and choose their religion .
Ivisic ’s mom is shown , questioning why her daughter should have to stand out and made to appear different .
The end of the trailer shows the family at the dinner table , with Ivisic ’s husband emphasizing that girls ca n’t be forced to wear the scarf ; Ivisic agrees , but also argues that her daughter will have to make a choice at some point .
Interestingly , the trailer does n’t really acknowledge a significant result of the documentary process : Ivisic actually ended up removing her headscarf .
As she explains in the interview , the film process led her to try to answer some of her own questions , and to explore where she fits within the many experiences and understandings of Islam .
She says that she felt that she had come to a point where many of her religious practices were done to please others , and that she lost the reason that she was wearing it in the first place .
Her decision to remove the headscarf was articulated as part of a process of starting over , in order to rebuild her relationship with God .
The interview included an audio clip taken from the film of Isivic ’s conversation with her daughter after telling her that she was removing her scarf ; her daughter was clearly surprised by her decision , and expressed worry about not having a role model for her own if or when she decides to wear it .
Ivisic explains that she and her daughter now have an even closer relationship than before , and that her daughter , now age fourteen , is still taking her time to decide on whether she will wear hijab or not .
I have n’t seen the documentary itself ( although I ’m going to try to get a copy so that I can review it too ) , but I thought this was a pretty good interview .
I appreciated that it was a very honest discussion , and not some kind of attention - grabbing testimonial about having escaped the tyranny of the veil ; in fact , Ivisic expresses hope that people wo n’t see the movie ’s conclusion as a sign of “ oh , she ’s free now , ” and that instead she is happy to see that many people have reacted to the film with “ a positive view of Islam . ”
She also leaves the possibility open that she may wear hijab again , stating that , after having taken off the veil :
There is a sense of freedom , a sense that this time I ’m not trying to impress others , but I ’m trying to more live Islam from the inside , and slowly , hopefully show it from the outside .
I ’m not saying no to the veil – you never know what ’s going to happen .
And I think that ’s what I learned , that you can question , you can change your mind , you can search , you can find ways , and then decide , well , okay , I ’ll try the other way , and still be Muslim …
I ’m still questioning , and my journey ’s not finished , so I think that ’s what the message is .
Your journey ’s never finished .
Regardless of how we feel about her specific decisions , I think that image of being Muslim as a journey is a really important point .
It ’s easy for “ Muslim woman ” or “ hijab - wearing woman ” to come across as static identities , as if once you ’ve manifested those identities in a particular way , there ’s no changing it .
That may be the ideal , for some people , but for many , it is not the reality .
And , even for those who do decide to wear hijab and do n’t take it off , I think Ivisic ’s comments reflect the the ongoing need to be in touch with one ’s intentions , since any religious act can lose meaning and become habit if we let it ; it ’s not like the journey ends once we decide to dress ( or otherwise practise Islam ) in certain ways .
The discussion in the interview was honest and thought - provoking , and I ’d be interested in seeing how these topics were taken up in the film itself .
CLIMATE CHANGE SUMMIT : A is for ARCANE – the arcane world of negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) , adopted by acclamation at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro .
It spawned conferences of the parties ( COPs ) , held annually so that the issue would never slide off the international agenda .
Copenhagen is “ COP 15 ” , it will go on for two full weeks and is expected to attract up to 17,000 participants from 192 countries .
The location of this travelling circus – as some might see it – changes from year to year , including such exotic places as Bali and Marrakech , and not so exotic ones like Montreal and Poznan .
But everywhere it goes , the drill remains the same – a seemingly endless round of talks that ebb and flow , culminating in a “ high - level segment ” for the final three days , when environment ministers and even heads of state or government join the jamboree .
Anyone arriving for the first time would be totally bewildered .
All the hard bargaining takes place in private , at meetings of ad hoc groups or smaller contact groups dealing with different issues .
The process is mysterious , secretive and so obscure in some areas that only a handful of experts know what ’s really going on .
B is for the BALI ACTION PLAN , which set out the “ road map ” to get us to Copenhagen .
Adopted amid high drama at COP 13 on the Indonesian holiday island of Bali in December 2007 , it called for two years of negotiations “ to reach an agreed outcome and adopt a decision at its 15th session ” .
The resolution referred to the scientific evidence for global warming as “ unequivocal ” and said that delay in reducing greenhouse gas emissions “ increases the risk of more severe climate change impacts ” .
C is for CHINA .
Previously known for repeating the refrain that developed countries that got rich from burning fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution owed it to the rest of the world to cut their emissions , China was recently hailed by UNFCCC executive secretary Yvo de Boer ( see below ) as a “ world leader ” in combating climate change .
This remarkable transformation happened after the penny dropped among the Chinese leadership that their own country was being hit by global warming – aggravated in part by the environmentally unsustainable way in which it was developing with a new coal - fired power station being commissioned every other month .
By last year , China was fourth in the world in terms of installed windpower capacity .
It has also set a target of generating 30,000 megawatts of electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020 .
And because the country is run by a totalitarian regime , the likelihood is that this ambitious target will be achieved .
D is for DENIERS , those who deny that climate change is happening .
They ’ve become increasingly vocal , seizing on every opportunity to debunk the scientific consensus – such as the e-mails hacked from the University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit ’s e-mails .
Botanist David Bellamy , who used to believe that climate change was the biggest threat facing humanity , now claims that it ’s “ a completely natural thing ” related to sun spots .
Or Lord ( Nigel ) Lawson , former British chancellor of the exchequer , who insists that it is not such a threat and efforts to stop it are both wrong - headed and dangerous .
Or right - wing columnist Christopher Booker , who claims that “ not a single item on the list of apocalyptic predictions we have been fed for so long ” had turned out to be true .
Climate change denial is at its most hysterical in the US , where many on the right see the UNFCCC as a conspiracy by leftists and foreigners to impose a “ world government ” on freethinking Americans .
This is all grist - to - the - mill for powerful vested interests in the oil and coal industries , who held sway in the Bush White House , where independent reports on climate change were “ doctored ” to minimise its dangers .
In 2007 , it was revealed that the American Enterprise Institute – which has received funding from Exxon - Mobil – had offered sceptics in the scientific community a fee of $ 10,000 each to debunk the Fourth Assessment Report of the UN ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate ( IPCC ) .
E is for the EUROPEAN UNION , which has long claimed a leadership role in the climate talks .
In December of last year , a full year ahead of Copenhagen , the EU agreed to cut its overall emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 – and offered to boost this to 30 per cent if other developed countries were prepared to follow its example .
It has also pioneered the development of carbon markets .
There is no doubt , however , that the EU ’s stance has been weakened since enlargement to 27 member states ; many of the newer ones fear that an unfair burden could be placed on them to meet these targets and provide aid for developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change .
At the Barcelona talks last month , EU sources said it could take another 12 months to reach agreement on what might replace the Kyoto protocol on climate change ( see below ) .
F is for the FOURTH ASSESSMENT REPORT OF THE IPCC , issued in 2007 .
Not only did this report – drafted by some 3,000 scientists , meteorologists and other experts all over the world – state that the evidence for global warming was “ unequivocal ” , but it also said emissions from developed countries would have to be cut by 25 - 40 per cent by 2020 if there was to be any chance of limiting the rise in average surface temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius .
The IPCC projected an increase of 1 to 3.5 degrees Celsius by 2100 – something that has never happened during the past 10,000 years .
Its best estimate of sea level rise was 50cm over the same period , although it could be as high as 1 metre or as low as 15 cm .
The scientists also warned that once the process was set into motion , it could not be slowed down in less than a few millennia .
Since the IPCC ’s latest assessment was published , the evidence has hardened .
Over the last decade , global average temperatures have been increasing at a slower rate , although eight of the 10 warmest years on record occurred in the period since 2000 .
More alarmingly , the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are melting at a faster rate than was estimated in 2007 , and both the surface area and thickness of Arctic summer sea ice are decreasing .
G is for G77 , the group that represents 132 developing countries at the UN .
A disparate collection , they include some of the poorest nations on Earth as well as vulnerable small island states , wealthy oil - exporting counties and others with major economies , such as India and Brazil .
Currently chaired by Sudan ’s ambassador , Stanislaus Lumumba , it is a force to be reckoned with in the negotiations .
In Barcelona last month , he made in clear that the G77 wants a fair and legally - binding agreement to emerge from Copenhagen and does not want to see the Kyoto protocol killed off .
Suggestions that the summit might only produce a “ political agreement ” were dismissed out of hand by Lumumba .
“ Tell me of any politician who delivered on his political manifesto .
Is it Gordon Brown ?
Is it Kevin Rudd ? ”
Within the G77 is the 53 - strong African group . .
H is for “ HOT AIR ” , the surplus emissions credits held by Russia and other eastern European countries that could flood carbon markets , if they are allowed into the system .
Known in the trade as AAUs ( assigned amount units ) , these credits – amounting to millions of tonnes of CO2 – were built up as a result of the collapse of Soviet - style industry can be bought by other countries seeking to offset their own emissions .
Russia , which plays an almost invisible role in the climate negotiations , will want to hold on to this potentially lucrative revenue stream .
I is for the small , low - lying ISLAND NATIONSvulnerable to sea - level rise , such as Tuvalu and the Maldives .
Twenty years ago , 403 of them formed a group called AOSIS ( Alliance of Small Island States ) to press for urgent action on climate change .
Ably chaired by Grenada ambassador Dessima Williams , they complain that developed countries lack the political will to tackle it .
At Copenhagen , AOSIS will be demanding that they sign up to new targets under the Kyoto protocol or a new treaty that would “ bind all countries ” .
J is for JETand other “ bunker ” fuels , which escaped inclusion in Kyoto , even though it is estimated that emissions from aviation and shipping account for over 1 billion tonnes of CO2 per annum – and growing .
Known as bunker fuels because they ca n’t be assigned to individual countries , they are now likely to be drawn into the net , with a deadline set for both the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the International Maritime Organisation to come up with proposals on how they should be treated in future .
K is for the KYOTO PROTOCOL , the only legally - binding international treaty on climate change .
Adopted in 1997 at COP 3 in Kyoto , it set modest targets for 37 developed countries – known as Annex 1 parties – to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 5 per cent overall relative to 1990 levels in the period 2008 - 2012 .
That “ first commitment period ” seemed quite faraway then , but we ’re in it now .
It also took a long time to work out the details , and it was n’t until 2005 that the protocol finally came into force when Russia ratified it .
Despite being spurned by the US in 2001 , the protocol has been quite effective in reducing emissions , particularly in Europe – although this is due in part to the current economic recession .
What ’s at issue now is whether it should be renewed by a “ second commitment period ” ( ie after 2012 ) or replaced by a new treaty under the UNFCCC .
L is for LULUCF ( land use , land use change and forestry ) .
This little understood provision in the Kyoto protocol allows developed countries to meet their emission reduction commitments by engaging in “ LULUCF activities ” – principally afforestation .
It also permits the management of forests , revegetation and even grazing land to be included in the accounting exercise , based on a recognition of their value as “ carbon sinks ” .
This is an area that only experts can fathom .
M is for MRV , the measurement , reporting and verification of what countries promise to do under Kyoto or any new treaty .
One of the key paragraphs of the Bali Action Plan – the one to which the US objected until the last minute – called for “ measurable , reportable and verifiable nationally appropriate mitigation commitments or actions , including quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives , by all developed country parties , while ensuring the comparability of efforts among them , taking into account differences in their national circumstances ” .
N is for NAMAs , an acronym for “ nationally appropriate mitigation actions ” by developing countries .
It was included in another key paragraph of the Bali Action Plan , calling on them to take such measures “ in the context of sustainable development , supported and enabled by technology , financing and capacity - building , in a measurable , reportable and verifiable manner ” .
In other words , and crucially , NAMAs do not require developing countries to adopt “ quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives ” ; the actions they take are voluntary , rather than mandatory .
And , of course , it would fall to developed countries to provide whatever technology , financing and capacity - building they may need .
O is for OVERSEAS AIDto enable developing countries both to adapt to the impacts of climate change and to pursue more environmentally sustainable economic growth paths .
It raises the thorny issue of who should pay – and how much .
But even EU environment commissioner Stavros Dimas has said repeatedly that without money on the table , no agreement can be reached .
“ No money – no deal ” has been his catch phrase .
The EU has estimated that developed countries would contribute a total of € 22-€50 billion a year , of which it would provide € 2 billion to € 15 billion .
But Oxfam International complained that even the higher figure of € 50 billion per year was “ less than half of what developing countries need to adapt to harmful climate change and pursue low - carbon futures ” , and it called on the EU to pledge at least € 35 billion annually to a € 110 billion “ global climate fund ” .
P is for POPULATION GROWTH .
Although the world ’s population is heading inexorably towards seven billion and the clear link between this increasing trend and the rise in greenhouse gas emissions , this issue is ignored in the climate talks – mainly because it ’s too controversial .
As Sustainable Population Australia notes in its submission for COP 15 , population growth and rising emissions have “ moved in virtual lock step ” since 1970 .
“ UN population projections indicate a 50 per cent increase in global population [ by 2050 ] .
Thus , even if average global per capita emissions were cut by 30 per cent , total emissions would remain unchanged ” , it says .
But the sheer numbers of human beings exceed the Earth ’s “ carrying capacity ” will continue to be ignored as an issue by climate negotiators on all sides .
Q is for “ GENERATION Q ” , as New York Timescolumnist Thomas Friedman has dubbed it .
He meant “ Quiet Americans in the best sense of that term , quietly pursuing their idealism , at home and abroad ” , arguing that “ America needs a jolt of the idealism , activism and outrage ( it must be in there ) of Generation Q .
That ’s what twenty - somethings are for – to light a fire under the country . ”
There are a lot of idealistic young people , not just in the US , who are lighting fires under their countries these days , and also under the climate talks .
They ’re best exemplified by the TckTckTck campaign and 350.org , which is seeking commitments from world leaders to cut CO2 emissions to a “ safe level ” of 350 parts per million ( it ’s about 385 ppm today ) .
Founded by Bill McKibben , it staged over 5,200 demonstrations in 181 countries in support of this target during a “ day of action ” on October 24th and it is planning a series of candlelight vigils at “ iconic and strategic locations ” around the world on Saturday , December 12th .
R is for RAINFORESTS and REDD ( reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation ) .
The REDD programme is intended to help a large number of developing countries protect their remaining rainforests and reduce the estimated 18 to 20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions attributed to deforestation , forest degradation and peatland destruction .
Prospects for a credible deal on this front are still unclear , however .
The latest negotiating text released in Barcelona last month , contains no provisions to monitor how developing countries would spend the funding under REDD , nor any explicit language that would ensure protection of intact natural forests .
REDD is being championed by Kevin Conrad , Papua New Guinea ’s climate change envoy and director of the Coalition of Rainforest Countries , who made a name for himself at the final session of the Bali climate conference when he attacked the US , saying that if it was not willing to lead , it should “ leave it to the rest of us [ and ] get out of the way ” .
This was the straw that broke the camel ’s back , leading the US delegation to relent and “ join the consensus ” .
S is for SAUDI ARABIA , which regards an ambitious agreement in Copenhagen as a threat to its lucrative oil trade – unless it receives compensation for loss of revenue from any adaptation fund .
But oil production is peaking anyway , if it has n’t already , so it is obvious that the desert kingdom will lose out in the end .
In the past , the Saudi delegation at climate conferences worked in close collaboration with the likes of Don Pearlman , a silver - haired Washington lawyer who sought to obstruct , or at least delay , progress ; a chain - smoker , he died from lung cancer in 2005 .
In his heyday , Pearlman was dubbed “ King of the Carbon Club ” .
Members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries – Algeria , Indonesia , Iran , Kuwait , Libya , Nigeria , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , United Arab Emirates and Venezuela – meet regularly during the talks to co-ordinate their positions .
T is for TARGETS TO CUT CO2 EMISSIONS– both mid-term and long - term .
Last July , the G8 group of big economies pledged to reduce their emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 , saying the rise in average global surface temperatures “ ought not ” to exceed 2 degrees Celsius .
But the G8 leaders failed to specify any target for 2020 .
It is , of course , much easier for politicians to commit themselves to long - term targets ; they are not going to be around when the reckoning comes .
Commitment to mid-term targets , to be achieved in just 10 years , is a much more difficult proposition .
Which makes it really remarkable that Norway has set a target to cut its emissions by a whopping 40 per cent by 2020 ; that shows real political will .
U is for the UNITED STATES , which has traditionally played a ‘ bad guy ’ role in the climate negotiations .
But the familiar faces of Harlan Watson , an oil man to his fingertips , and Paula Dobriansky , who could easily pass herself off as one of Tom Wolfe ’s “ perfectly emaciated ” New York socialites , have now been replaced .
Barack Obama ’s delegation is headed by Todd Stern , a veteran of the Clinton White House who represented the US at the Kyoto summit , and Jonathan Pershing , who was previously director of the World Resources Institute ’s climate programme .
The intense Dr Pershing ( he holds a PhD in geology and geophysics ) has been handling most of the negotiations over the past year , and he can rattle off figures like a walking abacus .
He has made it clear repeatedly that the US favours a new treaty under which both developed and major developing countries ( China and India , for example ) would pledge to reduce their emissions over time , reporting progress in a transparent way , but without any penalties to ensure compliance .
Just 10 days ago , the US pledged a cut of 17 per cent by 2020 , relative to 2005 levels .
However , this translates into a reduction of only 5 or 6 per cent ( at best ) , if 1990 is taken as the base year .
Thus , it falls far short of the unilateral cut of 20 per cent pledged by the EU .
President Obama ’s late decision to attend the final day of the summit when other world leaders will be there offers some hope that some deal will be brokered on emissions cuts .
V is for VULNERABLE REGIONS– particularly Africa , Bangladesh and south east Asia .
Sub -Saharan Africa , one of the poorest regions of the world , is already affected by the impact of climate change ; indeed , some claim that this is the root cause of conflicts in the region .
Prolonged drought and flash flooding are threatening the livelihoods of farmers as well as causing malnutrition and famine .
It is deeply ironic , of course , that the first victims of global warming are among the poorest people on Earth , including many living on a dollar a day .
W is for the WORLD WILDLIFE FUNDand all the other environmental NGOs ( non-governmental organisations ) which have doggedly monitored , participated in and protested at the climate talks over the years .
Without the close involvement of green NGOs ( known as “ Gringos ” ) such as the Climate Action Network , Friends of the Earth , Greenpeace International and others , there would be much less pressure on the negotiators to reach an agreement .
But NGOs are not always on the side of the angels .
Some of the business NGOs ( known as “ Bingos ” ) , notably the US Chamber of Commerce , are lobbying in the opposite direction against an agreement to reduce emissions .
X is for CLIMATE “ X ” - CHANGE , or carbon trading , one of Kyoto ’s “ flexible mechanisms ” for compliance with CO2 reduction targets .
Although slow to take off , it has now become well - established – especially in the EU ’s Emissions Trading Scheme ( ETS ) , which came into operation on January 1st , 2005 .
A similar “ cap - and - trade ” system may be introduced in the US , after senators finally deal with the Kerry - Boxer Bill on energy security and climate change “ sometime in the spring ” .
It has the support of many leading American corporations , including DuPont and General Electric .
The idea is that by putting a price on carbon , energy - intensive companies will have an incentive to cut emissions by adopting cleaner technologies .
Carbon trading could also generate funds to aid developing countries .
Y is for YVO DE BOER , the Dutch diplomat who has been serving as executive secretary of the UNFCCC since 2006 .
A man who always pauses before answering questions and rarely loses his cool , he has let the mask drop just once – when he broke down on at the final plenary session in Bali , after being accused of rigging the negotiations ; this led to him being dubbed as the “ crying Dutchman ” .
He has described himself and his team both as “ the butlers of the process ” – expert , but unobtrusive – and also as “ the conscience of the process ” , constantly stressing the need to reach agreement .
Z is for ZERO or ZILCH– what might be achieved at Copenhagen .
There is now general acceptance that no treaty will be miraculously produced at COP 15 and that it could take another 12 months to conclude , most probably at COP 16 in Mexico next December .
Yet the momentum created by a worldwide “ seal the deal ” campaign has forced countries to confront the issue and put numbers on the table .
The most probable outcome , however , is a “ political agreement ” on the need to take action and to finalise negotiations by the end of 2010 .

Plug In America , is a nonprofit group leading the clean - vehicle movement , it has issued the following list of common misconceptions or myths  about all - electric and plug - in hybrid electric cars .
Most Media ( excluding The Auto Channel of course ) and others continue to misunderstand and miss - characterize this new technology .
Thousands of these clean vehicles many of them zero-emission are expected to start coming to auto dealerships in late 2010 .
See Plug In Americas Tracker for a comprehensive list of such vehicles on the road today and expected for delivery in 2010 and beyond .
Electric Vehicle Acronyms and Definitions :

See Plug In America ’s Tracker for a comprehensive list of BEVs and PHEVs on the road today and expected for delivery in 2010 and beyond .
1. MYTH : EVs do n't have enough range .
You 'll be stranded when you run out of electricity
FACT : Americans drive an average of 40 miles per day , according to the U.S. Dept. of Transportation .
Most new BEVs have a range of at least double that and can be charged at any ordinary electrical outlet ( 120V ) or publicly accessible station with a faster charge .
The latter , already in use , will proliferate as the plug - in infrastructure is built out .
At present , all it takes is planning for EV owners , who can travel up to 120 miles on a single charge , to use their cars on heavy travel days .
Alternatively , a PHEV goes at least 300 miles on a combination of electricity and gasoline .
2. Myth : EVs are good for short city trips only
FACT : Consumers have owned and driven EVs for seven years or more and regularly use them for trips of up to 120 miles .
3. MYTH : EVs just replace the tailpipe with a smokestack
FACT : Even today , with 52 % of U.S. electricity generated by coal - fired power plants , plug - in cars reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and most other pollutants compared with conventional gas or hybrid vehicles .
Plug -ins can run on renewable electricity from sources such as the sun or wind .
PHEVs will reduce greenhouse gases and other emissions , even if the source of electricity is mostly coal , a 2007 study by the Electric Power Research Institute ( EPRI ) and NRDC showed .
Read the summary of some 30 studies , analyses and presentations on this topic .
4. MYTH :
The charging infrastructure must be built before people will adopt EVs
FACT : Most charging will be done at home , so a public charging infrastructure is n’t a prerequisite .
Still , a robust infrastructure will help , especially for apartment dwellers and those regularly driving long distances .
But at least seven companies are competing to dominate the public - charging - station market and a trade group representing the nation 's electric utilities has pledged to “ aggressively ” create the infrastructure to support “ full - scale commercialization and deployment ” of plug-ins .
5. MYTH :
The grid will crash if millions of plug-ins charge at once
FACT : Off - peak electricity production and transmission capacity could fuel the daily commutes of 73 % percent of all cars , light trucks , SUVs and vans on the road today if they were PHEVs , a 2007 study by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory found .
Also , utilities are upgrading some local distribution systems to accommodate plug-ins , just as they do when residents add more air conditioners and TVs .
Plug-ins , which can be seen as energy storage devices on wheels , can actually benefit the grid , making green energies like solar and wind power even more viable .
6. MYTH : Battery chemicals are bad for the environment and can't be recycled
FACT : Ninety - nine percent of batteries in conventional cars are recycled , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
The metals in newer batteries are more valuable and recycling programs are already being developed for them .
Utilities plan to use batteries for energy storage once they are no longer viable in a vehicle .
7. MYTH : EVs take too long to charge
FACT : The most convenient place and time to charge is at home while you sleep .
Even using the slowest 120 - volt outlet , the car can be left to charge overnight , producing about 40 miles of range .
Most new BEVs and PHEVs will charge from 240 - volt outlets providing double or triple the charge in the same amount of time .
Charging stations that reduce charging time even more are beginning to appear .
8. MYTH : Plug-ins are too expensive for market penetration
FACT : New technologies are typically costly .
Remember when cell phones and DVDs were introduced ?
Also , the government stimulus package includes a $ 2,500 to $ 7,500 tax credit for EVs and PHEVs .
Some states are considering additional incentives ( $ 5,000 in California and Texas ) .
And , the purchase and lifetime operating cost of an EV is on par with or less than its gas - powered equivalent because EVs require almost no maintenance or repair : no oil or filter changes , no tune ups , no smog checks .
9 . MYTH : Batteries will cost $ 15,000 to replace after only a few years
FACT : The battery is the priciest part of a plug - in , but costs will drop as production increases and the auto industry is expected to be purchasing up to $ 25 billion in advanced batteries annually by 2015 .
Some car makers plan to lease their batteries , so replacement wo n’t be an issue .
The Chevy Volt PHEV will have a 10 - year battery warranty that would cover battery replacement .
10 . MYTH :
There is n't enough lithium in the world to make all the new batteries
FACT : Even in a worst - case scenario of zero battery recycling , aggressive EV sales , no new mining methods or sites , existing lithium stores will be sufficient for projected EV production for the next 75 years .
See an analysis at PlugInAmerica.org .
Also , lithium comes from many countries ( 24 % is found in the United States ) , so we wo n’t be dependent on any one global region .
11 . MYTH : Lithium batteries are dangerous and can explode
FACT : Among the many kinds of lithium - ion batteries , lithium - cobalt batteries found in consumer electronics can pose a fire risk in certain circumstances .
These risks can be mitigated by the use of advanced - battery management systems and careful design that prevents “ thermal runaway . ”
Most plug - in vehicle makers are working with other battery types ( such as lithium - iron - phosphate and lithium - manganese ) which have inherent safety advantages and provide more years of service .
12 . MYTH : Most of us will still be driving gas cars through 2050
FACT : Several irrefutable factors are driving the shift from gasoline to plug - in vehicles : ever - toughening federal fuel economy standards and state caps on greenhouse gas emissions ; projected price hikes for petroleum products as demand increases and supply flattens or drops ; broad agreement over the need for America to reduce its reliance on petroleum for economic and national security reasons ; and climate change , which is occurring faster than previously thought , according to the journal Science and others .
This exciting development from Firedoglake :
As Ben Bernanke ’s confirmation hearing begins in the Senate Banking Committee , a source tells FDL News that one Senate staffer and an outside source confirmed to him that at least one Republican on the committee will also place a hold on the Federal Reserve chairman , throwing the process into potential turmoil and giving Chris Dodd a difficult series of choices to make .
Dodd , who just announced his intention to vote for Bernanke ’s confirmation in the Banking Committee and on the floor of the Senate , would be in charge of the decision to honor or ignore that hold .
The fact that Dodd tried to place a hold on the FISA Amendments
Act in 2007 - 08 , and was generally ignored by Harry Reid , just adds a layer of irony to the process .
The source , speaking on condition of anonymity because of his work behind the scenes on the Bernanke confirmation , told me that two separate sources assured him that the Republican hold would be made public after today ’s hearing .
One staffer said that two Republicans would place the hold , while the other said it would just be one .
The source said that the trans - partisan nature of opposition to Bernanke , with a conservative Republican and a socialist independent uniting to block the appointment , shows the intensity of the feelings on the issue .
“ It ’s great to see everyone come together – Democrats , Republicans , progressives and libertarians , against this Federal Reserve , which is not federal , and not a reserve , just a group printing money and giving it to their buddies , ” the source said .
While most people think that the multiple holds would delay the process , it ’s unclear whether or not it would succeed .
Dodd would probably have the discretion to roll over the hold in committee , though he may be reluctant to do so , experts in Senate procedure said .
Harry Reid could also seek cloture on the motion to proceed on Bernanke ’s nomination on the floor , which would require 60 votes .
At the very least , this delay and the publicity surrounding bipartisan opposition to Bernanke would bring attention to the issue of the Federal Reserve and the desire for transparency , like the movement to audit the Fed .
That provision has already passed in the large financial reform bill in the House Financial Services Committee , and Barney Frank said yesterday that he did n’t expect any changes to the bill as it passed the House , citing the public anger over the issue of transparency .
There is language on Fed audits in the draft financial reform bill written by Sen .
Dodd , which also strips the Fed of some of its power , but it is not the same as Bernie Sanders ’ audit the Fed bill , which has as many as 30 cosponsors .
The source , who has been working on the Federal Reserve issue for five years , marveled at how the issue has gained so much new attention during the financial crisis .
“ Up until last year , nobody knew what the Fed was .
Ron Paul got 5 co-sponsors on his audit bill when he first introduced it , and now we have 300 . ”
Sen .
Dodd ’s office has not yet responded with a comment .
There 's no question about it , we all enjoy a good taboo .
We live for the thrill of breaking rules and experience a sudden rush of excitement whenever we come close to such illicit activities , because we know that we should n't be doing it .
Let 's face it , bad is good .
We eat junk food because we know it 's bad for us and we get pleasure from this , it 's enjoyable .
But on the scale of crimes as perceived by The Law , consuming junk food is hardly a great offense ; it hardly even offends the senses .
Now , if you were to consume something that was actually illegal or at least extremely controversial , imagine the proverbial rush from that .
This is a list of meals and delicacies that push the envelope , with some of the latter dishes going on to open up said envelope , read what 's inside , set fire to it and then snort the ashes .
These are the culinary equivalent of murder , of robbing a bank , of snatching an old lady 's purse .
They are at best controversial and at worst , downright illegal .
But all are delicious .
Probably .
Horse Meat
A tasty meat - based treat , horse meat is n't a euphemism for anything ; it 's just the meat from a horse .
You know , those things that pull carts and carry spoilt girls around on their backs ?
It turns out that various places ( and perhaps more than you 'd think ) around the world have a keen interest in horse meat , producing vast quantities of the stuff for human consumption .
In a report produced in 2005 , it was found that the eight leading horsemeat - producing countries produced over 700,000 tons and China leading the way by a long margin , producing over 200,000 of those 700,000 tons .
Horse meat may not be a major meat outside of Central Asia , but that still does n't stop the fact that people eat horses from all over the world , including some parts of Europe and South America .
It is typically seen as a taboo meat primarily because of the role horses have played in many cultures , namely that of worker , pet and companion , as it apparently seems strange to eat one 's companions .
Turtles
Everyone loves turtles , those cute , green , sometimes ninja , sometimes hero things that playfully waddle around , bumping into things and occasionally being placed on their backs to watch them struggle .
Well , it turns out that people like eating them as well , for they are delicious .
There a number of ways in which to prepare a turtle for consumption , the most civilized of which might just be turtle soup .
This involves using " parts " of the turtle ( i.e. meat , skin and other bits from inside the turtle ) being cooked into a soup - based stew that is - especially in China and parts of Asia - considered a delicacy .
If a soup is n't your thing , then you can make use of my personal favorite method of turtle preparation : killing them , then ripping out all of their guts , replacing them with hot stones which then proceed to cook the dead creature from the inside out , thus preparing some delightful cooked turtle meat for all to partake of .
Turtle eating is n't just limited to Asia or similar , as turtle soup is a popular dish in the US as well , although rather than using endangered species of turtle , it 's more common to use the - * ahem * - Common Snapping Turtle ( Chelydra serpentine ) as the main ingredient .
Snake Blood Wine
Just as it sounds , snake blood wine is wine , but with added snake blood .
Another , less common variety is snake blood straight up , with no additions or extras , just cut the head from a snake and point its spurting lifeblood in the direction of a shot glass .
Snake wine is another of those peculiar beverages that can be found prominently in Southeast Asia and Traditional Chinese medicine even believes that the wine has restorative and invigorative properties .
There are a couple of varieties of snake blood wine , which include steeped and mixed versions .
The steeped version involves dropping a large snake into a jar of rice wine ; usually along with a bunch of smaller snakes and assorted herbs which is then left to steep for several months as the wine absorbs the " goodness " from the snakes .
Om nom nom .
The mixed variety involved the " mixing " of various body fluids from the snake ( such as blood and / or bile , glorious bile ) by slicing the snake along its stomach ( or the aforementioned cutting of the head ) and then draining it into a jug or jar containing rice wine .
It 's the drink that wiggles !
At least , for a bit .
Foie Gras
Foie gras ( meaning " fat liver " in French ) , or goose / duck liver is famous for the controversy it has caused due to the practice of gavage , or force - feeding , which involves sticking a long tube down the throat of a goose or duck and unleashing an unstoppable torrent of feed into the animal , making it Xbox huge .
The purpose of this is to enlarge the liver , making it fatty and especially delicious .
The end result of this cruel method is foie gras ; a culinary delight served the world over .
The controversy behind foie gras production has led to many an attempt to outright ban the product .
Some US states have already outlawed foie gras , with many others expected to follow suit .
European law has it so that foie gras can no longer be produced in countries in which it is not a long - established tradition ( i.e. anywhere outside France , which accounts for 78.5 % of the world 's foie gras production ) .
However , it can still be sold and consumed in many countries , so has done little to stem the tide of foie gras flowing into restaurants everywhere .
Fugu
Another relatively famous dish , this time from Japan , fugu is the Japanese word for puffer fish and also a dish consisting of the fish , which in turn is highly poisonous and can kill a person almost instantly .
Chefs are specially trained to prepare the fugu with the utmost dedication and care so as to perform their task correctly , lest they make a grievous error in preparation which could lead to a potential death .
In other words , if the chef screws up , you will die .
Because of this element of danger that is associated with the fugu dish , as well as the skill of the chef needed to prepare it , fugu can be an extremely expensive meal in itself ( and might even cost you your life ) , with top fugu meals fetching hundreds of dollars at some of the better restaurants .
The fish itself is purported to be incredibly tasty , with the flavor enhanced by the chance of death that it brings and allegedly , the more poisonous the type of fish used , the tastier it is .
Death has never tasted so good .
Except in everything on this list .
Drunken Shrimp
Unethical purely for the fact that this meal involves eating live animals .
Yes , everything ( being the shrimp ) on your plate will still be alive and squirming as it enters your mouth .
Drunken shrimp is in no way referring to the Western practice of marinating shrimp in alcohol prior to cooking , but rather the method by which still - living shrimp are stunned in strong liquor before being eaten , thus they are " drunken shrimp " .
The shrimp are simply placed into a bowl that contains the liquor - normally baijiu - to render them " drunken " ( or just plain drowned ) and therefore easier to eat , as they are less snappy and prone to moving around .
Here 's a video of a man eating drunken shrimp and breaking his glasses , for the sake of posterity .
Live Frog Heart
This is a video of a man eating the still - beating heart of a frog .
The clip was taken from the first episode of Andrew Zimmern 's Bizarre Foods TV show , in which he 's eating frog sashimi , with sashimi being a Japanese delicacy consisting of fresh , raw seafood .
Very fresh , in fact .
Ikizukuri
Speaking of food that 's served alive , the Japanese have a name for this practice : Ikizukuri .
This is the process via which sashimi is prepared from a living animal .
The chef will take the fish to be served out from its fish tank and then filet and gut it in such a manner so as to prepare sashimi from it , but without killing the fish itself .
The fish - still alive ( albeit briefly , I 'd imagine ) - is then usually served on a plate as decoration to the sashimi made from its own flesh .
The shock must be somewhat extreme for the poor fish .
Ikizukuri is n't just limited to the flesh of fish ; shrimp , octopus and squid can also be on the ikizukuri - related menu .
Generally , octopus and squid are wrapped whole and alive around a pair of chopsticks and then eaten in one go .
Naturally , ikizukuri is a rather controversial method of food preparation , both inside Japan and in other countries .
However , some Japanese - like some French when it comes to foie gras - will argue that it's part of the cultural heritage of the country and thus should be accepted as such .
Ortolan
Also known as an Ortolan Bunting , this is essentially a tiny bird native to Europe and some of western Asia , but is also considered a rare delicacy in France , where the French have consumed it with such gusto that the ortolan is now in decline in most parts .
Hunting of the ortolan exceeds 50,000 of the birds a year , which just so happens to be ten times the ortolan population of the Netherlands , Germany and Belgium ) .
For these reasons , eating an ortolan is illegal .
They must be delicious .
Made famous by the fact that former French president François Mitterrand consumed one in his decadent last meal and that Jeremy Clarkson ate one on TV , it is said that eating an ortolan is a rather unique experience .
The bird is captured alive , blinded and / or kept in a darkened cage to disrupt their feeding habits , then force - fed oats and millet to make it swell up to ridiculous proportions .
After this measure of cruelty , the bird is then drowned in brandy and subsequently roasted .
Then comes the eating .
The consumption of an ortolan is nearly ritualistic in nature , as the diner is required to place a napkin over their faces ( so as to keep in the luxurious aroma of the cooked bird , but probably also to hide their crime from God ) .
They would then place the entire bird inside their mouth , with only the beak or part of the head ( unless the head has been removed prior to serving ) protruding , which is then removed with a bite .
With headless bird in mouth , the diner now chews the tiny corpse for minutes on end , all the while savoring the multitude of flavors that wash over the tongue .
Delightful .
Casu Marzu
A true nightmare amongst foodstuffs and a veritable blasphemy against cheese - kind the world over , Casu Marzu is one of those utterly disgusting abominations that is considered a " delicacy " by the local populace , local this time meaning Sardinia , Italy .
You know that when the locals start colloquially calling something " maggot cheese " , something is n't quite right .
Even the name of the cheese - Casu Marzu - literally translates as " rotten cheese " in Sardinian .
This cheese is Bad Times made real , as if some entity comprised of Despair , Anguish and Malice has learned to transcend the Dark Beyond and manifest itself in our plane of reality , but in the form of a cheese .
The arcane ritual needed to summon this heinous devil - cheese requires the crazy cheese - alchemists of Sardinia to sacrifice an innocent Pecorino cheese by forcing it to go past a sanitary level of standard cheese fermentation into what you and I would most likely call decomposition ( that 's right , ROTTING , as in DEAD ) and this is aided by the introduction of insects , more specifically , the cheese fly ( Piophila casei ) .
With a resolve of steel ( for nothing will sway them from their evil craft ) and a wry grin of what must be insanity , these Sardinian cheese - makers willingly introduce the larvae of this cheese fly into their deliberately festering Pecorino cheese .
Either that or a female will lay eggs ( anything around 500 of the things at a time ) into the cheese and upon hatching , a nightmarish swarm of larvae will begin to digest the cheese .
During this phase of the Casu Marzu - making process , the cheese weeps for the life it could have led as a potential Pecorino , as the cheese is prone to leaking .
More specifically , a liquid can leak from the cheese , which is known by its cruel Sardinian taskmasters as lagrima , or " tears " .
The acid from the digestive system of the larvae ( read : maggots ) breaks down the fats in the cheese , making it incredibly soft and no doubt resembling the insides of a ripe cadaver .
Eventually , the wizened madmen constructing this disgrace against God will be able to tell when the cheese has achieved ... Completion , where it 's most likely fulminating with crawling maggots .
The cheese is considered " past its best " when the maggots have died , as this indicated that the cheese has become too toxic even for their - very acquired - tastes .
Thusly , their hideous creation is only consumed when filled with maggots still a - writhin ' .
But the show is not over yet folks , for there is still one obstacle left to traverse before you can commune with the Satan of Cheeses and that , dear friends , is the eating of the cheese .
These maggots can launch themselves up to 6 inches if disturbed , generally requiring the would - be diner ( no doubt an acolyte in this secret order ) to shield their visage from the ghastly sight of the cheese with their hand ( and to also protect their eyes ) .
The hilarious thing is that this cheese is illegal due to health and safety concerns .
It 's also illegal in the one place they can gather enough madmen to consume such a thing ( Sardinia ) and if the thought of a rotting lump of ex-cheese filled with thousands of tiny necrophages was n't enough to sway them from eating it , then the potential for maggots to survive stomach acid and then subsequently bore through internal organs , causing enteric myaisis , amongst other things .
But hey , I 'm sure some people love eating this .
Bonus : Mellified Man
Included as a bonus primarily because the practice of making a mellified man is ridiculous in and of itself .
The idea of the mellified man was popularized by Mary Roach in her 2003 book Stiff : The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers , in which she posited the legend of the mellified man .
What would happen is that an elderly person in their late 70s or 80s , whose death was likely in the not - too - distant future , would donate their bodies to science in order to provide a special healing confection known as " mellified man " .
The donor would consume only honey to the exclusion of all other food and drink , even bathing themselves in it .
Over time , the donor would excrete honey from every orifice , even sweating it , as they were slowly mellified .
Upon their inevitable death , they would be encased in a coffin filled to the brim with honey .
The coffin was then dated and sealed for 100 years , after which it was opened and the occupant of the coffin had turned into some sort of disgusting confection which was rumored to have incredible healing properties .
This gloop was applied topically to areas in need of treatment and even consumed in some cases .
Candied corpse , anyone ?
The likelihood of this being true is up for debate , as records of this practice date back many hundreds of years , but it sure makes for an interesting story , do n't you think ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The White House has delayed a report to draw up options for simplifying the tax code and reforming the corporate tax system , citing a need for more time to review comments .
The tax panel of the President ’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board ( PERAB ) had been set to release an “ almanac ” of ideas for tax reform on December 4 .
But the board ’s chairman Paul Volcker , former chairman of the Federal Reserve , said the panel needs more time to review the public comments .
“ I want us to review as many suggestions as possible and to have sufficient time to fully consider the hundreds of suggestions that have come in already , ” Volcker said in a statement posted on the White House blog on Friday .
The panel has received more than 500 comments thus far .
Groups such as the Business Roundtable have argued for a lower corporate tax rate and changing international tax rules so that worldwide income is not taxed .
Members of the task force include Laura Tyson , former economic adviser to President Bill Clinton ; Martin Feldstein , former advisor to President Ronald Reagan ; Roger Ferguson , former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board ; and William Donaldson , former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
When first announced , White House budget director Peter Orszag said the board would look at streamlining U.S. tax credits and being more aggressive in bringing in some $ 300 billion that goes uncollected each year .
In recent months , however , White House economic adviser Austan Goolsbee has said repeatedly that the panel will not make recommendations , but instead draw up an almanac of possibilities .
The panel ’s reform policies cannot raise taxes for families making less than $ 250,000 , a promise President Barack Obama made during his campaign .
This is the last m-word post for a while , I promise .
In Lack of Ceremony and the Marketing Gap , I talked about how Perl 5's deliberate refusal to force people to arrange their problems in any particular style helps good programmers write programs effectively and lazy programmers write poorly - structured code .
One Perl perception problem is that there are a lot more lazy programmers than disciplined programmers .
In Whipuptitude and the Marketing Gap , I discussed Perl 's suitability as a glue language for projects great and small and how the same ability to arrange effective large programs quickly lets people write awful small programs quickly ... and there are a lot more small programs available for people to see than large programs .
The third aspect of Perl which I believe contributes to the perception that Perl is difficult to manage is its DWIMminess -- its tendency to work very hard to intuit what the programmer meant to do and do it .
Often this DWIMminess goes unnoticed ; it 's when Perl does the wrong thing that people realize that Perl 's heuristics do not match their expectations .
Consider the polymorphic print statement in almost any language that 's not C. Give it an integer and it prints an integer .
Give it a string and it prints a string .
Give it a floating - point value and it prints a floating - point value .
Give it a reference object and -- well , DWIM suggests that it invoke some sort of .repr method on that object and produce some intelligible form of output .
Whatever the case , you expect print to produce some meaningful output for every type of parameter you might possibly pass .
The same goes for simple arithmetic operators .
Imagine the hassle of requiring different infix operators for adding an integer to a float versus a float to an integer versus two floats versus two integers .
There are , admittedly , still complications regarding the result of such operations , but the potential combinations there make the problem worse .
It 's much simpler for the compiler writer to lie a little bit and make these operators polymorphic even if the rest of the language does not allow such behavior .
Perl takes DWIM further .
Because Perl 's type system cares more about context and container type than value type , it does provide separate operators to indicate the type of operation the programmer intended .
In a sense , values are n't typed ; operations are typed .
( You can argue that this is the same behavior as forcing casting or conversions , with less boilerplate and ceremony .
The real questions are how much caching you need to do to improve performance and how much type safety your type system can provide .
C loses on both counts . )
In other words , it 's no surprise when you want to compare two strings with the eq operator .
It 's little surprise when comparing two numbers with the eq operator works in many cases , but it 's a big surprise when comparing two strings with the == operator does n't work the way you expect .
The question is whether your expectations come from other languages which provide some DWIM ( even if the implementation is inconsistent with the rest of the language ) or from understanding how Perl works .
If you understand how operators and other grammatic components of Perl enforce context of number and type , you can take advantage of DWIM .
It 's obvious why 0 but true is true in a boolean but zero in a numeric context .
If you do n't understand operators and context but you 're fortunate enough to enable strict and warnings or run Perl : : Critic , you 'll have the opportunity to learn what 's happening when one of those tools identifies a situation where you might have done the wrong thing .
Sadly , far too much code exists without the benefits of either conceptual understanding of Perl 's typing and contexts or the assistance of good tools which point out likely mistakes and recommend corrections .
For whatever reason , the Perl community has n't done well enough explaining Perl 's underlying concepts .
People can still solve their problems with a minimum of ceremony and boilerplate by joining together multiple , interesting small pieces -- but until they understand Perl 's philosophy and its strengths , they condemn themselves to writing verbose , clunky code that works against Perl 's natural DWIMmery .
It 's a good problem to have that novices to Perl and to programming can accomplish productive things without having to become Perl experts .
Yet we also need to find ways to encourage them to greater understanding before they find themselves maintaining ( or sharing or documenting or cursing ) a big pile of spaghetti code .
No language can prevent that in and of itself .
That leaves the community to fix technical concerns and these Perl marketing problems .
How do we do it ?
" I 've been actively exploring several options for some time now .
Starcraft 2 might not necessarily have what DotA needs to become a better game .
Moving to any new engine presents various challenges that need to be considered . "
" My goal and top priority in the future is to solve the surrounding issues that affect the DotA experience in order to allow it to reach new heights .
Addressing these issues will enable us to further enjoy aspects of DotA such as the gameplay , mechanics , and in - game feel that currently work well and ought to be maintained .
As I 've said many times in the past and especially after today 's developments , I am very excited about DotA 's future ! "
" With regards to the 6.64 patch , the focus will be primarily on more balance improvements .
It is moving along very smoothly and I expect to have it ready soon .
Once those refinements are done , I 'll be working on some fun new content such as heroes or remakes for the 6.65 version .
If there are specific things , big or small , you want me to consider for patches that follow , let me know . "
DotA developer IceFrog has announced via his blog that he will be leading a team at Valve and as a result be in a position resource - wise to do more for the DotA community .
IceFrog has had the reigns of DotA since 2005 when Steven " Guinsoo " Feark left to work at Riot Games on the LoL ( League of Legends : Clash of Fates ) game which is in closed beta and will see a release around October 27th this year supposedly .
DotA is also seeing real competition on the horizon in the form of HoN ( Heroes of Newerth ) which is being developed by S2games and Demigod .
With so many games threatening to fragment the community the future of this genre has been a topic of recent discussion as seen in a piece over on gameriot .
Questions over whether or not StarCraft II could be a possible future home for DotA were answered by IceFrog in a Q& A he did : Speaking about the move to Valve in his blog IceFrog added :
He also addressed the upcoming 6.64 patch :
Fans will no doubt be speculating on what he means by having the resources to improve things and whether or not this means some kind of Valve - created DotA varient to compete with the likes of HoN and LoL.

A small , private company launched New Zealand ’s first rocket into space to cheers from about 50 people gathered on a small island off the country ’s coast .
As the noise of the blastoff sent sheep running , the 18 - foot rocket raced into the sky , reaching beyond the Kármán line , 100 kilometers ( 62 miles ) above the Earth ’s surface , which is traditionally considered the dividing altitude between the upper atmosphere and real space .
The Atea - 1 , named after the Maori word for space , was built by Rocket Lab .
It ’s the first privately built rocket launched from the Southern Hemisphere to reach space .
“ It ’s not trivial sending something into space , ” Mark Rocket , Rocket Lab director and former internet entrepreneur , told local media .
“ This is a huge technological leap for New Zealand . ”
After the sub-orbital vehicle entered space , it turned back toward Earth and splashed down .
The Rocket Lab team is currently trying to locate the rocket , which was expected to fall into the Pacific Ocean about 30 miles northeast of Great Mercury Island , a privately owned resort and the rocket ’s takeoff point .
If you happen to be in the area and see the payload , do n’t go scooping it up , Rocket Lab warned through its Twitter feed .
“ IMPORTANT : Marine traffic in the Coromandel , do not recover payload , it contains delicate scientific instruments & is potentially hazardous , ” the Lab wrote .
“ If found please mark the payload location , and relay the GPS coordinates to Rocket Lab ASAP . ”
The Atea - 1 is unusually light and small .
Including propellant , the 18 - foot rocket weighs less than 150 pounds .
It ’s built largely from carbon - fiber composites and its 30 - pound engine generates thrust equivalent to 3,200 horsepower .
The Atea can take payloads of up to about four and a half pounds .
By comparison , an Atlas V rocket weighs 1.2 million pounds and can carry payloads of 65,000 pounds to low - earth orbit .

Evangelical Christians are rating retailers naughty or nice .
It ’s “ Merry Christmas , ” not “ Happy Holidays , ” that opens hearts and wallets , according to Christian media giant Focus on the Family , which is in the third year of its own “ Stand for Christmas ” campaign .
Focus says the reason for the season — the birth of Jesus — should be reflected in store displays and found on the lips of sales clerks .
Yet retailers and many shoppers say attempts to include everyone and offend no one might be more in keeping with the spirit — if not the letter — of Christmas .
The Colorado Springs - based organization can’t test the pitch of all retailers everywhere , so this year it asked shoppers across the country to weigh in on the way they perceive retailers ’ treatment of Christmas .
The 2009 StandforChristmas.com site , launched Nov. 23 , had 125,000 hits by mid-December .
Focus said it is hosting the ratings site because the ministry had noticed in recent years a misguided attempt by retailers to be more inclusive by dropping references to “ Christmas ” from stores , catalogs and online shopping sites , Focus cultural analyst Carrie Gordon Earll said .
“ The vast majority of people who are buying gifts in December are buying Christmas gifts , ” Earll said .
“ We ’re not asking retailers to stop saying ‘ Happy Hanukkah . ’
We ’re just saying , do n’t exclude Christmas .
It ’s part of the American fiber . ”
In a message to Focus followers Friday afternoon , Earll offered a more aggressive take on the issue : “ This is an opportunity for people who love Jesus Christ , who want to celebrate his birth , to have a voice in the culture . ”
By the time there were seven shopping days left , consumers reporting to Focus had rated outdoor outfitters Bass Pro Shops and Cabela ’s the most “ Christmas friendly , ” with 98 percent and 95 percent positive ratings , respectively .
Other “ Christmas friendly ” retailers were Land ’s End , L.L. Bean , Dillard ’s , Nordstrom , Kmart , Wal - Mart , Target and Sears .
“ A multicultural country ”
However , Mike Gatti , executive director of the National Retail Federation , said he observed that retailers already were making an effort this year not to meld all the holidays into one .
“ Retailers are saying , ‘ Gee , maybe we do n’t need to homogenize the holidays , ’ ” Gatti said .
“ When it ’s appropriate , retailers are trying to recognize the different traditions .
“ Everybody realizes we ’re a multicultural country .
What everybody is trying to do is be respectful of everybody ’s religion , ” he said .
Gatti said he was n’t familiar with the Focus campaign but welcomed consumer reaction from any quarter .
A 2009 survey by the Retail Advertising and Marketing Association , conducted by BIGresearch , found that shoppers ’ favorite holiday TV commercials were from Wal - Mart and Target .
They also rated well with the evangelicals .
Target tugs at the tender — and hilarious — moments of holiday giving , with “ chestnuts roasting on an open fire ” as its tag line .
Wal - Mart ’s Christmas campaign includes images of a son wishing for snow for his father deployed to Iraq .
Focus participants rated as “ offensive ” clothiers such as the Gap ( 82 percent ) , Banana Republic ( 75 percent ) and Old Navy ( 59 percent ) .
However , the retailer survey , which polled 9,929 consumers Dec. 1 - 9 , with a margin of error of plus or minus 1 percentage point , found that Gap and Old Navy television holiday ads scored high with the general shopping population , which ranked them as their fourth - and sixth - favorite commercials , respectively .
The three related companies issued a joint statement defending their seasonal marketing as appropriate for a global retailer respectful of all traditions :
“ Contrary to previous reports , . . . our seasonal marketing uses the word Christmas , but we do not use it exclusively . ”
Several Gap commercials say : “ Go Christmas .
Go Hanukkah .
Go Kwanzaa . ”
Old Navy ’s mannequin crew exchanges gift ideas in that store ’s campaign .
And electronics giant Best Buy , rated “ offensive ” by 78 percent of Christian shoppers participating on the Focus site , had the country ’s third - favorite ad , according to the retailers survey .
Best Buy ’s ads feature a choir of store employees caroling sales pitches to their customers .
Rated as mostly “ Christmas negligent ” by Focus participants were stores such as housewares purveyor Crate and Barrel and Toys ‘ R’ Us .
Reasons cited for a retailer seeming “ offensive ” included use of “ Happy Holidays ” without mention of Christmas .
The evidence offered for “ Christmas friendly ” included things such as Wal - Mart ’s sign for “ Christmas Trees ” rather than holiday trees , as well as the playing of Christmas music .
Focus ’ idea is not to boycott retailers but to build good relationships with them , Earll said .
Christmas sales can make or break retailers .
With three out of every four Americans identifying themselves as Christians , ignoring Christmas as a religious holiday makes no sense , Earll said .
Even the U.S. House of Representatives acknowledges Christmas not as a winter festival but for its “ international religious and historical significance , ” she said .
At a Target in northwest Denver last week , most shoppers were less ideologically inclined .
“ I ’m a Christian , but I ’m not the kind of Christian who needs to push it on others , ” said Doreen Kastner .
“ My beliefs are my own . ”
Another shopper , Michelle Cree , said that she thinks “ it ’s just nicer and more Christian ” to make greetings and decorations as inclusive as possible .
However , Jason Dunn said it bothers him that the word “ Christmas ” is usually nowhere in sight .
“ If you strip Christ from Christmas , what have you got , really ? ” he asked .
“ I say ‘ Merry Christmas , ’ and I like to be greeted that way , ” said Jane Bedin , “ but the retailers do n’t really have a choice but to play it safe .
They need to appeal to a wider part of the population than I need to .
It does n’t bother me . ”
Shopping motivations vary
In a more scientific Focus on the Family survey of 1,000 Americans , conducted by Wilson Research Strategies in March , 60 percent of Americans favored the use of “ Merry Christmas ” over “ Happy Holidays . ”
And 44 percent said they would more likely purchase from a retailer that uses “ Merry Christmas ” in advertising .
Promoting the holiday by name is just good business , Focus says .
However , the retailers ’ survey found that about 17 percent were highly motivated to shop at retailers whose ads they liked .
Still , almost 33 percent said an appealing ad had no impact on shopping habits .
“ When it comes to specific holiday advertisements , ” the retailer survey said , “ coupons are king , with almost 45 percent saying the opportunity to save a few bucks is what most influences them to shop at a particular store . ”

Legislation in Congress to audit and remove some power from the Federal Reserve would threaten the central bank 's independence , Chairman Ben Bernanke said this weekend .
Bernanke , the chairman of the Fed , said that proposals from Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) and Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) contained in separate bills would harm U.S. efforts to stabilize the economy .
" I am concerned ... that a number of the legislative proposals being circulated would significantly reduce the capacity of the Federal Reserve to perform its core functions , " Bernanke wrote in an op - ed for the Washington Post to be published Sunday .

Bernanke referenced Paul 's effort to audit the Fed ( which Bernanke said would threaten the Fed 's traditional political independence ) , as well as Dodd 's financial overhaul bill , which would take a great deal of banking oversight authority out of the central bank 's powers .
" These measures are very much out of step with the global consensus on the appropriate role of central banks , and they would seriously impair the prospects for economic and financial stability in the United States , " Bernanke said .
" The Fed played a major part in arresting the crisis , and we should be seeking to preserve , not degrade , the institution 's ability to foster financial stability and to promote economic recovery without inflation .
"
The chairman chalked up the legislative moves against the Fed to populist anger at the bailouts undertaken by the U.S. in the past year .
Indeed , Paul 's legislation in the House attracted 313 cosponsors in the midst of other congressional shots at the Fed in recent months .
" Independent does not mean unaccountable .
In its making of monetary policy , the Fed is highly transparent , providing detailed minutes of policy meetings and regular testimony before Congress , among other information , " Bernanke wrote .
" Now more than ever , America needs a strong , nonpolitical and independent central bank with the tools to promote financial stability and to help steer our economy to recovery without inflation . "
Ever since I was a little boy I was always fascinated and inspired with Castles .
All over the world there are these beautiful creations just lining our world .
Some of them are more believable than others , but all are truly amazing works of art .
I want to inspire you this week with some of the most beautiful Castle photos I could find .
Use these images to inspire your next creation , whether it be a web , print , or motion video project .
Whatever your need be , let these inspirations guide you !
Leave some comments on which ones are your favorite !
Nerdy Confession
When I was a child I was extremely obsessed with the LEGO ®
Castle sets and pretty much all of the medieval style collections .
So I made my parents buy me as many as I could over the course of several years , and pretty much had the entire thing built out and filling up my room as a child .
I ca n’t wait till my boys are old enough to play with them , so I can play with them again too 🙂 haha .
Hope you enjoyed these and maybe even learned some history behind some !
今年の文化祭で書いた記事です。

C言語といえば、いやなイメージ、過去の遺産といった感じがあるかもしれません。
C言語のネガティブな側面というと、やはりポインタやメモリ管理などが難しい、ということが思いつくかもしれません。
しかし 、C言語のポインタは表記に騙されやすいだけで、仕組み自体は全く難しくありません。
文法も、どこぞ のPerlやC++と比べたら屁でもない単純さです。
実のところ、仕様が煩雑で難しいのは、Cプリプロセッサなのであります。
普段からあまり複雑な使いかたをしないから気づかないかもしれませんが、Cプリプロセッサの置換処理は、欺瞞と裏切りに満ちた世界なのです。
これが進化するとテンプレートなどといったもっと面白いものになるのですが、今回はCプリプロセッサで計算をしちゃったりするところまで試しにやってみましょう。
( なお、GCCにより実験的に調べた記事なので、他のCコンパイラでは挙動が違う可能性があります。)
Cプリプロセッサの起動方法 Cプログラムをコンパイルすれば、Cプリプロセッサはその処理の途中で起動しますが、今回はCプリプロセッサの出力を直接見るので、Cコンパイラは起動しません。
GCCでは、以下のようにするとプリプロセッサのみを起動できます。 % gcc - E test .c # 1 " test2.c " # 1 " < built-in > " # 1 " < command - line > " # 1 " test2.c " ( #で始まる出力は、コンパイルエラー等の発生箇所を正しく元ファイルと対応づけるためのマークなので無視してください。)
基本 Cプリプロセッサは大きくいって次のような処理を行います。 行の結合
コメントの除 去
条件分岐
ソースの結 合
単語の置換 行の結合 バックスラッシュ*1の後に改行文字が続くと、それは最初に除去されます。
なので次のようなソース はOKです。 # de\ fi\ ne /\ * comment *\ / EOF (- 1 ) コメントの除去 コメントを除去します。 条件分岐 以下のソースのように、環境要因などによってソースの断片を挿入したりしなかったりします。 #ifdef __cplusplus extern " C " { #endif ソースの結合 いわゆ るinclude です。あまり知られてませんが、include_nextというものもあるらしいです。 単語の置換 下記のソースでEOFが-1と見做されるのは、プリプロセッサがEOFを(-1)に置き換えているからです。
# define EOF (- 1 ) EOF 上記のような処理をされたコードはそのままCコンパイラに渡され、構文解析を行います。
Cプリプロセッサでプログラムを書く方法( 1 ) 以下のようなコードは、無限再帰となり、終了しません。(正確にはスタックオーバーフローで異常終了します) # include " test.c " これと、#ifによる条件分岐を上手に使えば、様々な計算が行えそうです。#ifにはCと似た文法で計算を行う方法があるので、これを使えば手続き的に計算を行えそうです。しかしこれは無謀です。
なぜならば、計算結果を代入する手段が無いからです。代入といえば、#defineが使えそうと思うでしょう。しかし#defineは定義を変更することはできても、既存の定義からの計算結果を保存することはできません。以下の例を見てください。
# define X 2 #define Y ( X+ 5 ) Y #undef X #define X 3 Y このように 、define 内の記号はその場では置換されないので、計算結果を保存することはできません。そのため、手続き的にプログラムを書くのは無謀です。
Cプリプロセッサでプログラムを書く方 法 ( 2 ) それでは、どのように書けばいいのでしょうか。 答えは、 「 項の置き換え、すなわ ちdefineのみを使って、関数型言語のようにプログラムを書く」です。
ここでは、この非常に強力かつ欺瞞に満ちた項の置き換え機能を中心に据えてプログラムを書きます。
defineの基本 defineによる定義方法 は2 種類あります。 #define A_VALUE ( 5 + 6 ) # define A_FUNC ( x , y ) ( x+y ) A_VALUE A_FUNC ( 3 , 4 ) つまり、単語単体で置換されて、あたかも変数であるかのように振る舞うものと、括弧つきで置換されて、あたかも関数であるかのように振る舞うものがあります。 再帰 この置き換えは一度だけ行われるわけではありません。先のソースのように
# define X 2 #define Y ( X+ 5 ) Y という風に、多段的に展開されます。 では、次のコードはどうでしょうか。 # define X Y #define Y X X 無限ループになりそうに見えますね 。
しかし実際は、Xと出力されて終了してしまいます。 これは、ANSI Cの規格で、Xの展開の中でXが出てきたので、それ以上展開するのを止める、という仕様になっているためです。
これのせいで普通に再帰が書けず、非常に苦労します。
ただし、以下のような書き方では正常に動作します。 # define test( x ) a x test ( test ( x ) ) これは、先に内側の関数が 「 a x」に展開されるためです。この評価順序がまた話をややこしくします。
文字列化 文字列化という機能があります。 # define str_2 ( x ) #x str_2 ( google ) これは、例えば次のように活用できます。 # define pf( fmt , val ) fprintf ( stderr , #val " = " fmt " ;
" , val ) ; pf ( " %d " , i ) ; fprintf ( stderr , " i " " = " " %d " " ;
" , i ) ; ただし、良い子のみんなはデバッガを使いましょう。
また、これを利用して、以下のコードで自分自身を出力することができます(このようなコードをQuineと言います。 ) # define t( u ) v=#u;u t( main ( ) { printf ( " #define t(u) v=#u;u
t( %s ) " , v ) ; } ) どのようにして自分自身が出力されるか考えてみると面白いかもしれません。
トークンの結合 文字列化より知られていませんが、文字列化と並んで、トークンの結合という機能があります。 # define deftype(t ) const char * typename_ ##t = #t ; deftype ( int ) ; deftype ( char ) ; ここでは、トークン「 typename」と引数tの中身を結合して、「typename_int」という別のものを作ってしまっています。
次のようなことも可能です。 # define cat ( a , b) a# #b cat (+ , = ) cat ( 0x , 190 ) cat ( value_ , 100 ) cat ( 20 , 0 777 ) ここらへんから気味が悪くなってきますね。
文字列化とトークン結合の罠 次のような文字列化には注意が必要です。 # define str_2(x ) #x #define EOF (- 1 ) str_2 ( EOF ) このように、文字列化は引数を展開しません。(トークン結合も同様)
これを回避するため、以下のように中間となるマクロを挟みます。 # define str_2(x ) #x # define str(x ) str_2( x ) # define EOF (- 1 ) str( EOF )
条件分岐 ではプログラムの始めとして、条件分岐を書いてみましょう。 # define D_if( b ) D_if_2 ( b ) # define D_if_2( b ) D_if_ # #b # define D_if_0 ( x , y ) y # define D_if_1 ( x , y ) x D_if ( 1 ) ( a , b) D_if( 0 ) ( a , b ) これで条件分岐ができます。 これはどのような仕組みかといいますと D_if ( 1 ) ( a , b) D_if_2 ( 1 ) ( a , b) D_if_1 ( a , b) a というように、与えられた値が0か1かで、別々の関数を返すような仕組みになっています。
条件分岐ができたので、ブール演算子は簡単に定義できますね。次はandの例です。
# define D_Band( a , b) D_if(a ) ( b , 0 )
リスト 単一の値はこれで定義できましたが、値の集合、つまり配列のようなものが定義できてませんね。 ここで は
「 リスト」を定義してみましょう。 Cプリプロセッサでリスト構造を作る方法は、僕は次の2つを思いつきました。 ( a , ( b , ( c , ) ) ) または ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) リストであるのに必要なのは次の条件です。
リストが空か判定できる。( nil判定)
リストが空でない場合、リストの先頭を取りだせる。(headまたはcar )
リストが空でない場合、リストの先頭以外のリストを取りだせる。(tailまたはcdr)
値をリストの先頭に追加して新しいリストを作れる。(cons )
今回は、用途が限定されたリストなので、次のような構造にしました。
1 0 0 1 0 1 簡単でいいですね。 このリストを取り出すために、次のマクロが必要です。 # define D_addcomma_0 0 , # define D_addcomma_1 1 , 他のトークンをリストで扱う場合は、必ずこれを定義しなければいけません。後で十進法の桁を扱うので、2から9までは登録しておきました。
このリストを操作する基本の関数は以下です。 # define D_head ( list ) D_head_2 ( D_cat( D_addcomma_, list ) ) # define D_head_2( x ) D_head_3 ( x ) # define D_head_3 ( a , b) a # define D_tail ( list ) D_tail_2 ( D_cat( D_addcomma_, list ) ) # define D_tail_2( x ) D_tail_3 (x ) # define D_tail_3 ( a , b) b #define D_____EOL , 0 #define D_____SOL_D_____EOL
, 1 #define D_nil_p( list ) D_nil_p_2 ( list D_____EOL ) # define D_nil_p_2( list ) D_nil_p_3(D_____SOL_##list ) # define D_nil_p_3(x ) D_nil_p_4(x ) # define D_nil_p_4 ( a , b) b headとtail は 、D_addcomma_というトークンと与えられたリストを結合することで、最初の項目とそれ以外をコンマで分離します。
それを引数として渡せばコンマの前後の値を別々に取り出せます。
D_head_2 , D_tail_2というマクロをクッションしていますが、これがないとコンマを引数区切りとして見做せません。 nil判定は、D_____SOL_とD_____EOLをlistを挟んで結合します。もし値がnilであれば、D_____SOL_D_____EOLができ、そうでなければD_____EOLになります。
これをコンマで分離して同様に取り出せばnilかどうかが分かるという仕組みです。
リストの結合は、単にトークンを並べればいいだけですね。いいですね。
また補助マクロとして以下を定義します。これは値がnilの場合に別のリストで代替するものです。 # define D_Lor(list1,list2 ) D_if ( D_nil_p( list1 ) ) ( list2,list1 ) # define D_tail_or ( list1,list2 ) D_tail ( D_Lor( list1,list2 ) ) # define D_head_or ( list1, list2 ) D_head ( D_Lor( list1,list2 ) )
ループ ループは非常に厄介です。なんといっても、再帰が厳密に禁止されているので、うまいこと回避しなければいけません。
そこで以下のようにしました。 # define D_whileZ0 ( p , f, x ) D_if ( p x ) ( f x , x ) # define D_while Z1 ( p , f, x ) D_if ( p x ) ( D_whileZ0 ( p , f , D_while Z0 ( p , f, x ) ) , x ) # define D_while Z2 ( p , f, x ) D_if ( p x ) ( D_while Z1 ( p , f , D_while Z 1 ( p , f, x ) ) , x ) これは、p x が1 の あいだ、xにf xを代入して、最終的な結果を返します。
D_whileZ0 は、「p xが1 ならf x , そうでなければxを返す」となりますね。これは「上限1回のwhile」と言えます。
D_while Z1 は、「p x が1 ならp xが成立する間xにf xを代入して、もう一回それをする。さもなければxを返す」なので、これは「上限2回のwhile」と言えます。
数を大きくしていくと上限回数は指数的に増えるので、D_whileZ32では約40億回まで繰り返すことができます。またこれはループが短く終わったときも比較的短時間で終了するようで、効率が良いです。 なお、p(x ) ではなくp xとなっているのは、x=(a, b, c)のようにして多値を簡単に扱うためです。
このwhileで気をつけなくてはいけないのは、pやfの内部で同じwhileを呼ぶと再帰になって停止してしまうので、同じ内容のwhileを大量に用意して使いわけないといけないということです。さすがにこの辺りは面倒だったので、Rubyでループを回してwhileAからwhileZまで自動生成しました。
ループを使ったプログラムの最初の例として、リストの順番を逆にするプログラムを作ってみましょう。 # define D_reverse_p( list1,list2 ) D_Bnot ( D_nil_p( list1 ) ) # define D_reverse_f( list1, list2 ) ( D_tail ( list1 ) , D_head ( list1 ) list2 ) # define D_reverse ( list ) D_tuple2_2 ( D_whileZ( D_reverse_p , D_reverse_f , ( list , ) ) ) listを受けとってループを回し、list1の先頭から値を取ってlist2の先頭に付け加えていきます。list1がnilになったらlist2を返します。
数値 今回は非負整数のみを扱ってみます。 数値は0,1の値のリスト、つまり可変長の2進数で表現することにします。
先頭のほうが小さい桁とします。つまり「0 0 1 1」は、12を意味します。このようにすると、桁が足りないとき、0を簡単に補うことができますし、計算順序に合致しています。
今回は加算と比較だけ定義してみましょう。
数値の加算 # define D_Nplus_p ( a , b , c , r ) D_Bor ( c , D_Bnot ( D_Band ( D_nil_p ( a ) , D_nil_p ( b ) ) ) ) # define D_Nplus_f ( a , b , c , r ) D_Nplus_f_2 ( D_head_or(a , 0 ) , D_head_or( b , 0 ) , c, r , D_tail_or(a , 0 ) , D_tail_or ( b , 0 ) ) # define D_Nplus_f_2 ( ha , hb , c , r , ta , tb ) ( ta , tb , D_Nplus_cn ( ha , hb , c ) , r D_Nplus_dig ( ha , hb , c ) ) # define D_Nplus ( a , b ) D_tuple4_4 ( D_whileZ( D_Nplus_p , D_Nplus_f , ( a , b , 0 , ) ) ) # define D_Nplus_dig ( a , b, c ) D_Bxor ( D_Bxor ( a , b ) , c ) # define D_Nplus_cn ( a , b, c ) D_if ( D_Bxor ( a , b ) ) ( c , a ) 貼っても正直わかりづらいと思いますが、概要だけ説明します。
aとbが加算したい数、cが桁の繰り上がりです。aとbから一番下の桁を取り出してそれと桁の繰り上がりの3つの数の和を求めます(D_Nplus_digとD_Nplus_cn)
これを繰り返して新しい数を構成し、もう足すものが無くなったら終了です。
数値の比較 # define D_Nlt_p_p( a , b, r ) D_Bnot ( D_Band ( D_nil_p (a ) , D_nil_p ( b ) ) ) # define D_Nlt_p_f( a , b, r ) ( D_tail_or ( a , 0 ) , D_tail_or ( b , 0 ) , D_Nlt_p_dig ( D_head_or( a , 0 ) , D_head_or ( b , 0 ) ) ( r ) ) # define D_Nlt_p_dig( a , b) D_Nlt_p_dig_2 ( a , b ) # define D_Nlt_p_dig_2(a , b) D_Nlt_p_dig##a##b # define D_Nlt_p_dig00 (r ) r # define D_Nlt_p_dig11 (r ) r # define D_Nlt_p_dig01(r ) 1 # define D_Nlt_p_dig10 (r ) 0 # define D_Nlt_p( a , b) D_tuple3_3 ( D_whileZ( D_Nlt_p_p , D_Nlt_p_f , ( a , b , 0 ) ) ) # define D_Nlteq_p( a , b) D_tuple3_3 ( D_whileZ( D_Nlt_p_p , D_Nlt_p_f , ( a , b , 1 ) ) ) # define D_Neq_p( a , b) D_Band ( D_Nlteq_p(a , b ) , D_Nlteq_p ( b, a ) ) aとbの大きさを比較します。下の桁から順番に捜査します。
現時点での大小をrに記憶しておきます。ある桁の大小によってrを書き換えます(D_Nlt_p_dig)。具体的には、その桁でa=bならrは変更なし、その桁でaとbが異なるならその桁の大小をrとします。
これを繰り返していき、最終的に処理する桁が無くなった時点のrが答えになります。
十進化 今までで求めてきた数値を十進数表記に変換します。 # define D_ND_Dbl_p( a , r , c ) D_Bor ( c , D_Bnot ( D_nil_p ( a ) ) ) # define D_ND_Dbl_f( a, r, c ) ( D_tail_or( a , 0 ) , r D_N_toD_s ( D_head_or ( a , 0 ) , c ) ) # define D_ND_Dbl( a , c ) D_tuple3_2 ( D_whileZ( D_ND_Dbl_p , D_ND_Dbl_f , ( a , , c ) ) ) #define D_N_toD_s( a , c ) D_N_toD_s_( a , c ) # define D_N_toD_s_(a, c ) D_N_toD_s##a##c #define D_N_toD_s00 0 , 0 #define D_N_toD_s01 1 , 0 #define D_N_toD_s10 2 , 0 ( 中略 ) #define D_N_toD_s81 7 , 1 #define D_N_toD_s90 8 , 1 #define D_N_toD_s91 9 , 1 # define D_N_toDlst_p( a, r ) D_Bnot ( D_nil_p(a ) ) # define D_N_toDlst_f( a, r ) ( D_tail ( a ) , D_ND_Dbl( r , D_head ( a ) ) ) # define D_N_toDlst(a ) D_Lor( D_tuple2_2( D_whileY( D_N_toDlst_p , D_N_toDlst_f , ( D_reverse ( a ) , ) ) ) , 0 ) # define D_N_toDstr_p( a, r ) D_Bnot ( D_nil_p(a ) ) # define D_N_toDstr_f( a, r ) ( D_tail ( a ) , D_cat ( r , D_head ( a ) ) ) # define D_N_toDstr(a ) D_tuple2_2( D_whileZ( D_N_toDstr_p , D_N_toDstr_f , ( D_reverse ( D_N_toDlst ( a ) ) , ) ) ) まず、十進数に対し て
「 2倍もしくは2倍+1を求める」という計算を定義(D_ND_Dbl)します。
2倍を求める過程で桁の繰り上がりを使うので、これを再利用すれば2倍+1も求まります。
二進数を上位の桁から順番に処理し、桁によって2倍もしくは2倍して1を加算します。
つま り2進法の「 1010 」だと、 「 ( ( ( ( 0 * 2+1 ) * 2) *2+1)*2) 」という計算を十進法で行います。
このようにして十進法の数値に直した( D_N_toDlst)ものに対して、トークンの結合を行います(D_N_toDstr)。これが十進表記になります。
フィボナッチ 最後にフィボナッチの計算を行ってみましょう。 # define D_fib_p ( a , b , c , i ) D_Nlt_p ( i , c ) # define D_fib_f ( a , b , c , i ) ( b, D_Nplus ( a , b ) , c, D_Nplus( i , D_N1 ) ) # define D_fib( c ) D_tuple4_2 ( D_whileY ( D_fib_p , D_fib_f , ( D_N0 , 1 , c, D_N0 ) ) ) 必要な計算は全て定義したのでだいぶ簡単になりましたね。
iは現在のループ回数です。aはフィボナッチ数列の(i-1)番目、bはフィボナッチ数列のi番目です。(a,b)のペアから(b,a+b)を求めていきます。
ループカウンタのiが指定した回数c以上になったら終了し、bを返します。

One person was killed and five injured when a U.S. Coast Guard patrol boat collided with a recreational vessel at a boat festival in San Diego , California , officials said .
San Diego Fire - Rescue
Department officials received a call that a 33 - foot patrol boat was involved in an accident about 6 p.m. PT ( 9 p.m. ET ) , said Lt. Josh Nelson of the Coast Guard .
" A total of 13 people were on board on both vessels , and all people are accounted for , " said Maurice Luque , a spokesman for the Fire - Rescue Department .
It was unclear whether the recreational vessel was part of the parade .
Investigators are double - checking to make sure everyone is accounted for , the Coast Guard said .
At least one of those injured was a child , according to Nelson .
People decorate their vessels with Christmas lights and parade up and down the bay as part of the annual San Diego Bay Parade of Lights .
" The Coast Guard vessels are normally there to ensure safety for the event , " Luque said .

McDonald 's Quarter Pounder has been a heavy hit for McDonalds Japan so the company is going all out to expand the appeal of this very American burger .
The new year will see not one , not two , but FOUR new quarter - pound burgers being rolled out one by one , and each one has a unique " Big American Taste " .
Texas Burger
The Big America campaign leads off with the Texas Burger on January 15 , 2010 .
This manly meal features old - fashioned grainy mustard - relish , tangy barbecue sauce , strips of bacon and crispy fried onions .
Alone among the quartet , the Texas Burger has a middle Big Mac - style bun to separate the beef burger on the bottom and the bacon & onions on top .
Yee - haw !!
Burger New York
Next up is the Burger New York due to debut in early February 2010 .
Meant to evoke the atmosphere of a midtown Manhattan streetcorner cafe , the Burger New York is topped with Monterrey Jack cheese , rich tasty bacon , sliced tomato , lettuce and a grainy mustard sauce .
That 's one Big Apple bite !
California Burger
Near the end of February , McDonalds Japan will begin offering up the California Burger .
Sandwiched between two halves of an artisan bun are a quarter - pound beef patty , spicy cheese , bacon strips , tomato slices and lettuce topped with a special sauce made with red wine produced in California .
No avocado but still majorly gnarly , dude !
Hawaiian Burger
Last but not least , McDonalds ' menus will feature the Hawaiian Burger - perhaps the oddest of the bunch , and not just because it does NOT include a pineapple ring or a slab of Spam .
Drawing visual and taste cues from the traditional Hawaiian " loco moco " ( typically white rice topped with a hamburger patty , a fried egg and brown gravy ) , the Hawaiian Burger features special gravy , an Egg McMuffin - style fried egg and bacon strips on a bed of chopped lettuce and an American cheese slice .
Surf 's up !
Some might say these so - called specialty burgers really are n't so special and they'd have a point : they really are n't all that unique , even from each other .
As well , all four Big America burgers share a common ingredient ( besides the beef patty ) : bacon .
Maybe Japan knows more about what makes a Big American Taste then they 're given credit for !

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A British court issued an arrest warrant for former Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni on war crimes charges but withdrew it on finding she had canceled a planned trip to Britain , the Guardian newspaper reported .

Westminster magistrates court issued the warrant at the request of lawyers acting for Palestinian victims of fighting in Gaza earlier this year , the paper said in an article published online on Monday .
The warrant was later dropped after it was realized that Livni -- who had been due to address a meeting in London last weekend -- was not in Britain .
Human rights groups and U.N. investigators accuse Israel of war crimes in the Gaza Strip during a 22 - day offensive against Hamas - led Islamist militants in which Palestinians say more than 900 civilians died -- a figure Israel disputes .
Livni , who is head of the opposition Kadima Party , played a key role in launching the offensive .
The Foreign Office told Reuters it was “ looking urgently at the implications of this case . ”
“ The UK is determined to do all it can to promote peace in the Middle East and to be a strategic partner of Israel , ” a spokeswoman said .
“ To do this , Israel ’s leaders need to be able to come to the UK for talks with the British government . ”
The justice ministry said it would not comment on individual cases and the interior ministry also declined to comment .
In September pro-Palestinian groups failed to persuade a London court to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak , whom they also accuse of war crimes .
The court said Barak , who attended the ruling Labour party ’s annual conference and met Prime Minister Gordon Brown , had diplomatic immunity .
Do you eat the parsely , or do you not eat the parsely ?
I do n't know what to do and it 's ruining what would otherwise be a perfect experience .

( CNN ) -- Forget almost everything you ever thought you knew about the moon .
NASA 's latest missions indicate the moon is much more than a dead , unchanging satellite orbiting Earth .
It 's a dynamic environment , with changes occurring by the day and week , not over millions of years .
The space agency says the missions are rewriting lunar science text books and revolutionizing what scientists know about Earth 's closest neighbor .
An announcement in November probably rivaled Neil Armstrong 's first steps on the surface more than 40 years earlier :
There 's water on the moon .
The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite , or L - CROSS , and its companion spacecraft crashed into a crater at the moon 's south pole in October and discovered water in a very dark and very cold place .
L-CROSS researchers said about 25 gallons of water were detected in the crater , which measured about 60 feet wide by a few feet deep .
Michael Wargo , NASA'S chief lunar scientist on the L - CROSS mission , said the probes detected more than water in the crater , but researchers are still trying to understand what the other stuff is .
" We 're opening new chapters .
And in fact , because some of this information is so new and it's so different from the way we use to think about the moon , there are chapters that are blank right now , " he said .
You know that they 're going to written , but we do n't even know the questions yet that are going to be engendered from this new information . "
Wargo describes the lunar data as a treasure trove .
The moon " is like the dusty attic of the solar system , in that things get collected there and they give you insight , not just into the moon , but the evolution of the solar system . "
Earthbound explorations , such as Lewis and Clark 's historic journey to the Pacific Ocean in the early 19th century , carry critically necessary items , but they have no need to haul wood or water .
That 's not so for manned space flight .
Those missions will have to carry all the supplies necessary for survival unless they can manufacture some of them either in flight or on a planet 's surface .
The presence of water and other compounds on the moon means there are potential resources that could sustain future exploration of the moon and beyond .
NASA is also mapping the moon 's surface in unprecedented detail , eventually creating the first moon atlas .
The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , which launched last summer , is the robotic scout that is providing the data .
LRO is on a mission that could last several years -- orbiting the moon and gathering crucial data that will help astronauts prepare for another visit .
Wargo said LRO is carrying high - resolution cameras , which have now mapped about 50 areas on the moon , including the Apollo mission landing sites .
" We have cameras on board that have been able to image where the Apollo spacecraft landed , and you can literally see where they put down their scientific packages , where the astronauts walked on the moon , " according to Wargo .
The LRO discovered it 's extremely cold in the permanently shadowed polar craters , where temperatures dip more than 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit , or 249 degrees below zero Celsius .
That 's not far from absolute zero , defined by international agreement as 273.15 degrees below zero Celsius and a temperature that cannot be physically reached .
These are the coldest temperatures ever recorded in the solar system .
The LRO is also measuring space radiation on the moon .
Astronauts will need protection from this radiation during expeditions to the moon and other destinations .
All this information is critical if humans are to make it back to the moon by 2020 , the the target date set by the Bush administration in 2004 .
But it 's more than that .
Wargo sum it up this way :
" We used to think of the moon as this really dead and unchanging place , that the moon was a dead planet .
...
There are changes that occur there not over the course of thousands or millions or even billions of years , but are changing over the course of days and weeks and months .
That 's something people just had n't thought of until just weeks and months ago .
...
This is n't your grandfather 's moon anymore . "

James Cameron 's sci-fi blockbuster Avatar is opening this weekend with much fanfare .
As has been widely reported , Cameron enlisted a linguist , Paul Frommer of USC's Marshall School of Business , to create the Na’vi language , spoken by the inhabitants of the alien world Pandora .
We first heard about the development of Na’vi nearly three years ago , when Cameron was hyping the as - yet - unnamed language of Pandora as one that would " out - Klingon Klingon . "
( See my post , " Advances in cinematic xenolinguistics , " Jan. 29 , 2007 . )
When I decided to write about Na’vi and other alien tongues of the silver screen for the New York Times Magazine On Language column , I finally got to learn the real story of the language 's construction from Paul Frommer himself ( " Skxawng ! , " NYT , Dec. 6 , 2009 ) .
Paul generously shared a great deal of material describing Na’vi 's phonetics , phonology , morphology , and syntax , hardly any of which found a place in my On Language column .
But since there is already tremendous interest in the language , and some less - than - accurate information about it is currently floating around online , I asked Paul if he could write up a formal description of Na’vi as a Language Log guest post .
He was n't able to reveal everything about the language , but what he has sketched out should whet the appetite of even the most diehard xenolinguistics buffs .
[ Guest post by Paul Frommer ]
Given the interest that ’s already been shown in Na’vi , I ’m grateful to Ben Zimmer for the opportunity to post a few highlights of the language to Language Log .
As will be apparent , the information below is not intended to be anything like a complete description ; the Phonetics and Phonology section is the most complete , but the Morphology and Syntax sections are mere sketches .
Given my contractual obligations , a more thorough treatment awaits another venue .
But I hope this sketch will answer a few questions and perhaps serve to counterbalance some of the erroneous information that has made its way to the Internet .
Needless to say , comments are welcome .
Phonetics and Phonology
Na ’vi has 20 consonants , 7 vowels , 4 diphthongs , and 2 syllabic “ pseudovowels , ” rr and ll .
1. Consonants
The consonants are ( in the “ official ” Na’vi transcription ) :
Ejectives : px tx kx Voiceless Stops : p t k ’ Affricate : ts Voiceless fricatives : f s h Voiced fricatives : v z Nasals : m n ng Liquids : r , l Glides : w y
Note the following :
The red consonants can occur as the first element of a syllable - initial consonant cluster .
consonants can occur as the first element of a syllable - initial consonant cluster .
The blue consonants can occur in syllable - final position .
Note also :
px , tx , kx , ts , and ng are digraphs representing the three ejectives , the affricate , and the velar nasal respectively .
In the “ scientific ” transcription , ts is replaced by c and ng by g .
For commercial purposes , however — and also for ease of reading by the actors — the “ official ” transcription is preferred .
The letters b , d , j , and q never appear in Na’vi .
2. Vowels , Diphthongs , and “ Pseudovowels ”
Vowels
Na ’vi has a 7 - vowel system :
i , ì u e o ä a
Transcription and phonetics :
i [ i ] ì [ I ] e [ ε ]
Note : always lax ä [ æ ] u [ u ] or [ U ] o [ o ] a [ a ]
Diphthongs
Na ’vi has 4 diphthongs : aw [ aw ] , ew [ εw ] , ay [ aj ] , ey [ εj ] .
3. Syllable structure and phonotactic constraints
Every syllable has a single vowel or diphthong at its center .
Each vowel or diphthong in a word corresponds to a separate syllable .
A single vowel or diphthong may be a syllable by itself .
Within syllables , Na’vi vowels and diphthongs can be preceded by either one or two consonants .
They can also be followed by one consonant .
That is , the syllable structure is ( C ) ( C ) V( C ) , where V represents a vowel or a diphthong .
Restrictions on which consonants can occur in which positions are given below .
Initial consonants .
Any consonant can occur at the beginning of a syllable .
Consonant clusters .
Clusters of two consonants can occur , but only in syllable - initial position and only in the following combinations :
f , s , ts + {p , t , k , px , tx , kx , m , n , ng , r , l , w , y}
There are thus 39 possible initial C - clusters , all of which are attested in the lexicon .
Final consonants .
Only certain consonants occur in syllable - final position .
These are :
Ejectives : px tx kx Stops : p t k ’ Nasals : m n ng Liquids : r , l
Pseudovowels .
In CV syllables , the liquids l and r can replace the vowel .
When they are syllabic they are lengthened ( the r is very strongly trilled , the l always front and “ light ” ) and written ll and rr respectively .
Note : Sequences of stop + liquid , though they cannot occur initially , may be found medially .
In such cases , however , a syllable boundary intervenes .
Example : ikran ‘ banshee ’ divides as ik - ran , not * i- kran .
4. Vowel clusters
Na ’vi allows unlimited sequences of vowels in a word .
If no glottal stop intervenes , the vowels in such clusters glide smoothly from one to another .
Each such vowel represents a separate syllable .
Examples : tsaleioae ( 6 syllables ) , meoauniaea ( 8 syllables )
5. Phonetic detail and phonology
Voiceless stops are unaspirated .
In final position they are unreleased .
Na ’vi r is a flap , as in Spanish pero or Indonesian surat .
Word stress in Na’vi is unpredictable and distinctive .
Stress must thus be specified for each word .
( In learning materials only , the stressed syllable in a word is underlined . )
E.g. tute ‘ person ’ , tute ‘ female person ’
Lenition .
Following certain adpositions and prefixes , initial consonants mutate as follows :
px , tx , kx ⇒ p , t , k
p , t/ts , k ⇒ f , s , h
Glottal stop :
’ ⇒ Ø
8 C ’s participate in rule : px , tx , kx , ’ , p , t , ts , k
12 C’s do not : f , s , h , v , z , m , n , ng , r , l , w , y
Word Classes and Morphology
1. Nouns
Nouns are inflected for case and number but only rarely for gender .
Number
Number ( singular , dual , trial , plural ) is indicated by prefixes , each of which triggers lenition :
Short plurals :
When the plural marker ay - is prefixed to a word beginning with a lenitable consonant , it may be dropped after lenition has occurred .
Example :
The plural of tokx ‘ body ’ is ay + tokx .
Thus we have :
* aytokx → aysokx ‘ bodies ’
But now the plural is marked redundantly , first by the prefix itself and second by lenition of the initial consonant of the singular .
So the ay - may be optionally dropped , yielding tokx ‘ body ’ vs. sokx ‘ bodies ’ .
Case
Nouns and pronouns take six cases ( counting Topical as a case ) : Subjective , Agentive , Patientive , Genitive , Dative , Topical .
The case system is tripartite — i.e. , it distinguishes between intransitive subjects ( S ) , transitive subjects ( A ) , and objects ( P ) .
Case morphemes are suffixes , generally with several allomorphs .
Changes to the noun base sometimes occur with the Genitive .
The Topical form of a noun or pronoun establishes a loose semantic connection to the clause and has a wide range of uses .
It may be translated along the lines of “ with regard to , ” “ as for , ” “ turning to , ” “ concerning , ” etc. , but it can also appear where a genitive or dative might be expected .
Example :
Oeri ta peyä fahew akewong ontu teya längu .
I - TOP from his smell alien nose full is - NEG - ATTITUDE
‘ My nose is full of his alien smell . ’
2. Pronouns
Like nouns , pronouns exist in singular , dual , trial , and plural forms .
In the first person dual , trial , and plural , a distinction is made between inclusive and exclusive forms .
3. Verbs
Verbs are inflected for tense , aspect , mood / dependency , and speaker attitude , but not for person or number .
Verb inflections are effected exclusively through infixes , which are of two types — first position and second position .
With monosyllabic verb roots , first - position infixes simply come before second - position ones .
With multisyllabic roots , however , first - position infixes occur in the penultimate syllable and second - position ones in the final syllable .
First - position infixes indicate tense , aspect , or mood ; there are also participial and reflexive infixes in this position , the latter being in “ pre-first ” position so it can co-occur with other first - position infixes .
Second - position infixes indicate speaker attitude — positive orientation , negative orientation , or uncertainty / indirect knowledge .
Many of these infixes are optional on the sentence level .
( In discourse , however , overt indication of tense or aspect may be required . )
Aspect is perfective or imperfective .
Tense has five points on the time line : present , past proximate , past general , future proximate , future general .
Verbs can be inflected for tense alone , aspect alone , or a combination of tense and aspect .
Selected examples :
Root : taron ‘ hunt ’
Note : English translations are only approximate and represent one of several possibilities .
Tense only : taron ‘ hunt ’ tìmaron ‘ just now hunted ’ tayaron ‘ will hunt ’
Aspect only : teraron ‘ be hunting ’ tolaron ‘ have hunted ’
Both tense and aspect : tìrmaron ‘ was just now hunting ’
Many more such forms exist .
Including second - position infixes :
tìrmareion ‘ was just now hunting ( and the speaker feels positive about it ) ’
tayarängon ‘ will hunt ( and the speaker feels negative about it ) ’
In the last two examples , the root is indicated in red .
Such forms raise an interesting question :
To what extent can a root be obscured by inflections and still be recognizable ?
When Na’vi listeners hear tìrmareion , for example , do they immediately recognize it as a form of the verb taron ?
By the same token , are speakers able to produce such forms spontaneously ?
I ’d like to think the answer to both questions is yes , but the matter requires further study ; we need more samples of discourse from Pandora !
4. Adjectives
Adjectives are invariant and undeclined .
A derivational prefix forms adjectives out of other parts of speech .
5. Adpositions
These can either precede or follow their heads with no semantic distinction ; in the latter case , they ’re bound to the noun or pronoun .
E.g. , ‘ with you ’ = hu nga or ngahu .
Certain adpositions , when in pre-nominal position , trigger lenition .
There ’s no predicting which do and which do n’t — they simply have to be learned .
( Adpositions are marked in the lexicon as either ADP + or ADP -. )
Because of the “ short plural ” phenomenon , ADP + adpositions can yield ambiguous structures .
Example : mì ‘ in ’ is ADP + ; does mì sokx mean ‘ in the body ’ or ‘ in the bodies ’ ?
The language has developed ways of dealing with these potential ambiguities .
Syntax
The most notable aspect of Na’vi syntax is the freedom of word order .
The case system allows all 6 sequences of S , O , and V .
Additionally , adjectives , genitives , and relative clauses can either precede or follow their heads .
Nouns and adjectives are tied together by the morpheme a , which comes between them and is attached as a bound morpheme to the adjective .
For example , ‘ long river ’ is either ngima kilvan or kilvan angim .
There ’s obviously a lot more to say about syntax — for example , how the language handles subordination and complementation .
That will be for another time .

About a month ago , foo left a comment asking a fairly straightforward question :
Are terminal applications becoming less prevalent , as Web - based services and cheap , powerful PCs become more common ?
The answer I gave then was just off the cuff , but in the month since foo asked it , the question has been rolling around in my head .
And then today , Xyzzy left a note mentioning that the home page for fttps has gone offline — taking with it the source code for that application and others — only a year after Blice originally posted there .
There ’s no real correlation between the two events , but for someone like me who prefers life at the CLI , it does seem worrisome .
In the time since foo ’s original comment , I began making a list — three lists actually , one for console projects which were still very active , one for projects that had obviously sputtered and died , and one where the programs had achieved code Nirvana .
That last one is my way of saying what I originally suggested in my reply to foo — that perhaps in some cases , there just were n’t any more features to add and were n’t any more bugs to chase .
For example — and all of these are footnoted with the phrase “ to the best of my knowledge ” — rtorrent is still under heavy development , and that ’s probably the strongest example to the contrary .
At the time of this writing , there had been an update to the trunk source code within 25 hours — in other words , on or very near Christmas Day .
Most people I know who are even remotely influenced by Western culture are sitting at home , stuffing their faces with leftovers in the hours that follow Christmas Day .
So for a program — a console program , no less — to be getting updates that recently and in that particular bracket of time suggests to me avid pursuit .
Midnight Commander is another example ;
The prerelease version I put together was stamped “ stable ” less than 48 hours ago — again , on or around Christmas Day .
There are others , and I could cite any heavily used console application as an example to the contrary — vim .
irssi .
Even centerim is quite active , with the 4.22.9 update less than two weeks ago .
But for every one that I mention I have to acknowledge that there are some that have no pulse .
I mentioned beeswax a while back ; there ’s a program with potential that does n’t seem to be moving forward .
cplay is a classic example of a popular but evaporated application ; that one is so dead even the home page has disintegrated .
Raggle gets mentioned as a newsreader a lot , but apparently stalled in 2005 .
Again , there are plenty of examples .
And those perfect programs , the ones that do n’t need updating ?
My list gets a little fuzzy in there . 🙄
It is true though , that a lot of the software I use on a daily basis is 3 or 4 years old , and sometimes it ’s hard to tell a hiccup from a year - long break .
hnb , which I ’m looking at right now , is a release from March 2003 — and I will admit wholeheartedly that that ’s old .
I wo n’t argue with you if you accuse me of using outdated software because that , friends and neighbors , is a dusty old program .
Is there an update coming ?
Who knows .
But that does n’t make it any less useful or stable .
It only becomes an issue when it stops compiling or running , because the software that supports it is developing out of pace .
So I can only assume that one day , perhaps in the not - so - distant future , I ’ll get segmentation faults from hnb when I try to start it , sort of like I do from elmo .
But again — and this is the third qualification in a row now — any project , console or graphical , always runs the chance of finding a new direction or new leadership .
And that ’s the best thing anyone can hope for , for any “ dusty old program . ”
Elmo got lucky a month ago and found someone willing to adopt it , and perhaps even something like cplay will too , if Daniel finds the time and desire to flesh it out further .
The phenomenon is n’t confined to console applications either ; I ’ve been begging and pleading with the Internet for years for some talented coder to pick up the corpse of ObMenu and keep it up to date with the changes in Openbox .
It has n’t happened yet and the home page is the same one I ’ve been looking at since late 2005 , but that does n’t rule out the possibility .
iDesk is another that could probably benefit from a little encouragement , since it ’s been the same codewise as it was when I first found it in Ubuntu in November 2005 .
I ’m not a coder , so in that sense , it ’s completely pointless and even a tiny bit rude for me to suggest that certain programs need attention .
I ’m not in a position to fix anything , so my opinion amounts to nil .
But I do know , and believe in , this :
Open source software has many beautiful and amazing advantages over the closed - source model .
And only one of those benefits is the idea — no , the proven principle that , 10 or 20 or even 50 years down the road , someone might pick up some crusty old tarball off a backup server somewhere in a forgotten university somewhere on the planet , take a look at the source code and add a new spark of life to an otherwise lusterless , forgotten application .
Old programs do n’t die , they just patiently await reincarnation . 😉
One of the raps on iPods is that users tend to close themselves off from other people and retreat into their own private world .
But with stroke and dementia patients , iPods and other MP3 players are having just the opposite effect .
Listening to rap and reggae on a borrowed iPod every day has helped Everett Dixon , a 28 - year - old stroke victim at Beth Abraham Health Services in Bronx , N.Y. , learn to walk and use his hands again .
Trevor Gibbons , 52 , who fell out of a fourth - floor construction site and suffered a crushed larynx , has become so entranced with music that he 's written 400 songs and cut four CDs .
Ann Povodator , an 85 - year - old Alzheimer 's patient in Boynton Beach , Fla. , listens to her beloved opera and Yiddish songs every day on an iPod with her home health aide or her daughter when she comes to visit .
" We listen for at least a half - hour , and we talk afterwards , " says her daughter , Marilyn Povodator .
" It seems to touch something deep within her . "
That part about Palin 's love of meat products , perhaps unsurprisingly , is raising the hackles of some animal - loving vegetarians and vegans , according to our colleague Johanna Neuman of The Times ' politics blog , Top of the Ticket .
Especially offensive to the animal - byproduct - free set ?
Palin's comment that " If any vegans came over for dinner , I could whip them up a salad , then explain my philosophy on being a carnivore :
If God had not intended for us to eat animals , how come He made them out of meat ? "
( Humorous news - aggregation site Fark.com 's snarky rejoinder : " In other news , Sarah Palin endorses cannibalism . " )
But very few of those copies , we suspect , will be purchased by vegetarians or vegans .
In his review , our colleague Tim Rutten explains that a large portion of " Going Rogue " covers Palin 's life before she emerged as a well - known public figure , " so there 's a lot of winter , guns , fish guts , long hours at the nets under the midnight sun and a great deal about Palin 's fondness for meat ....
There 's even a photo of her father teaching her to skin a harbor seal , an activity the caption informs is now forbidden for all but native peoples under the Marine Mammal Protection Act .
Ah , for the good old days . "
Sarah Palin's highly anticipated book , " Going Rogue , " is not likely to win any literary awards , but it 's very likely to sell a gazillion copies .
( It 's currently Amazon 's No. 1 bestselling book , besting even the likes of Stephen King and Dan Brown . )
In " Going Rogue , " Palin goes on to describe her favorite types of meat -- bacon burgers , pork chops , " the seared fatty edges of a medium - well - done steak " -- before concluding that " I especially love moose and caribou .
I always remind people from outside our state that there 's plenty of room for all Alaska 's animals -- right next to the mashed potatoes . "
( Interestingly , former George W. Bush speechwriter Matthew Scully , who opposes hunting so ardently that he titled his 2003 book " Dominion : The Power of Man , the Suffering of Animals , and the Call to Mercy , " penned Palin 's stump speech at the 2008 Republican National Convention .
In " Dominion , " Scully wrote of hunting that " the worst of it is not the cruelty but the arrogance , the sheer hubris of those who bring only violence and fear into the animal world , as if it needed any more of either . "
The strange - bedfellows aspect of his relationship with Palin was not lost on the Austin American Statesman . )
According to Top of the Ticket , Cleveland - based writer Daelyn Fourtney , who wrote on Examiner.com that it 's " a sad statement on our society when we applaud those who refer to animals as the centerpiece of their dinner plate , " has already felt the backlash from conservatives who assume she 's a " militant " liberal .
( " God loves meat and I love Palin , " one commenter wrote .
" I 'm waiting for her run for the presidency .
A true American patriot defending the COnstitution .
Stop vitimizing [ sic ] her . " )
In reality , Fourtney told the Ticket , she 's a vegetarian who keeps her politics separate from her food choices .
" Assuming that one is left or right based on what they choose to eat is a dangerous road to travel , " she said .
Of course , no public discourse about veganism is complete without a comment from PETA co-founder and President Ingrid Newkirk .
In an open letter to Palin , Newkirk was quick to discount the former governor 's comments about meat as both glib and outdated .
" Ms. Palin reportedly finds evolution a bit hard to swallow , " Newkirk concluded .
" Judging from her book , that applies to the evolution of ideas and attitudes as well . "
Snap !

This is the funniest gift ever .

The newly announced Go language set the Internet abuzz this week .
I ’m not going to write extensively about it , partly because I have n’t had much time to examine it in detail , and partly because other people have already written a lot about it .
It is interesting to note that CHP and Go share a common heritage in Hoare and Roscoe ’s CSP ( Communicating Sequential Processes ) .
I will be mentioning CSP in a couple of posts next week ; CSP is a process calculus used to describe message - passing concurrent systems .
CSP inspired occam , which in turn became occam - pi ( using ideas from the pi-calculus ) , which is still under active development .
occam and occam - pi also inspired various libraries for CSP - style concurrency , such as JCSP , C++CSP , PyCSP , and many more including CHP .
But CSP also inspired Newsqueak , and Rob Pike went on from that to work on Limbo and now Go which retain the CSP influence .
It ’s certainly nice to see other people looking at message - passing concurrency .
I did get time to glance at Go ’s tutorial , and saw that they have an example for generating prime numbers using a process pipeline which uses the exact same design as my CHP primes example .
So you can compare the CHP version to the Go version if you wish .
( I took the design from the JCSP version ; I wonder if the Go developers did too . )

What I find ironic about this is that many of the actual arguments that are being tossed back and forth about global warming are based on clichés .
For example , every time there is a cold snap , some idiot argues that it proves that the climate is n’t warming .
Let us be clear here .
There is nothing benign about Israel spying on the United States .
When Jonathan Pollard stole our nuclear secrets ( which your taxes paid to develop ) and sent them to Israel , Israel did not hesitate to trade those secrets to the USSR in exchange for increased emigration quotas .
The implication of these facts is that the billions of our tax dollars sent to Israel ( while women and children sleep in America 's alleys and eat out of trash bins ) have bought and paid for a monstrous phone tracking and phone tapping system that can eavesdrop on almost any phone call in America .
Even the White House phones were open to such tapping by listening in on the other end outside the White House itself .
This actually happened .
The Ken Starr report on Whitewater describes how Bill Clinton informed Monica Lewinsky that their phone sex conversations had been recorded .
At the same time , Clinton ordered the FBI to cease the hunt for an Israeli mole known to be operating inside the White House itself !
So here we have a foreign nation able to listen in on most phones at will , using taps that cannot be found because they are built into the phone system itself , and willing to use the information gleaned from those calls to blackmail Americans into any desired course of action .
This may well be what Ariel Sharon meant when he stated that the Jewish people control America .
That the information gleaned from these phone taps is being used to coerce the behavior of key individuals in the US Government and media is illustrated by the manner in which the government and the media have handled this scandal of the largest spy ring ever uncovered inside the United States , and of phone taps on all of our phones .
They are downplaying it .
Actually , burying it is a better word .
Fox News , alone of all the media , actually ran the story as a four part broadcast , and put the story up on its web site .
Then , without explanation , Fox News erased the story from their web site and have never mentioned it again .
CNN followed by " Orwellizing " their report of the two hour advance warning of the WTC attacks sent to Odigo employees .
But far more telling is the admission made by a US Official in part one of the Fox News report that hard evidence existed linking the events of 9/11 not to Arab Muslims , but to some of the more than 200 Israeli spies arrested both before and after 9/11 , but that this evidence had been CLASSIFIED .
TMZ.com is reporting that the great folks at ashleymadison.com are offering $ 5 million to Tiger Woods to become the new advertising face of the adultery web site .
And on the other end of the spectrum , Vivid Entertainment is offering $ 1 million to any woman who slept with Tiger and is up for getting freaky in front of a camera .
Oh , this is officially out of control .
And there is a new chick – Kalika Moquin – photos after the jump .
Have images of one of Tiger ’s conquests ?
Send ’em in .

Do you ever wonder why the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) might be more memorable than other technological schools ?
To become memorable , a school must reach out to people in ways that seem beneficial .
Alumni organizations can help spread the word about their alma mater .
Great sports teams and debate teams also can help boost a school ’s standing .
But , another fork to take in the marketing path is through the Internet , as MIT and other schools have done in sharing courses online and without charge .
MIT and other schools are up front about these open source offerings – no one can earn credits from taking the courses , nor can they use the courses to claim a degree .
But , when MIT and other colleges opened their virtual gates to allow the average person to get a glimpse behind their ivory towers , these colleges became well known for their altruism and transparency .
Open Courseware has become a marketing tool , as it helps schools that use this option to become mroe well known in a local and global community .
That said , the following list represents a handful of hundreds of open courseware initiatives that now exist .
The following fifty collections are from English - speaking universities and colleges , located across the U.S. to England , Canada and Australia .
Additionally , the list points to open courseware projects such as directories and primary source projects offered by various universities and colleges .
The list is divided into categories and each link is listed in alphabetical order within those categories .
This method shows our readers that we do not favor one collection over another .

Denying Reality , or the Heavy Cost of Political Correctness
By Ibn Warraq
In the wake of the murder of 13 and the wounding of 38 soldiers at Fort Hood on November 5 , media analysts , politicians , and other sundry experts scrambled to present the accused perpetrator of the acts , Major Nidal Malik Hasan , 39 , as a victim .
In so doing they served , knowingly or otherwise , as apologists for radical Islam .
From CNN to the
New York Times ,
NPR to the
Washington Post ,
the killings were presented as a result of racism .
They were attributed to fear of deployment in Afghanistan and harassment from other soldiers .
Cited were Major Hasan ’s supposed maladjustment to his life and his sense of not belonging , pre-traumatic stress disorder , and various personal and mental problems .
All these explanations are variations on what I have called “ the Root Cause Fallacy , ” which has been committed time and again since the terrorist acts of September 11 , 2001 .
The Root Cause Fallacy was designed to deflect attention away from Islam , in effect to exonerate Islam , which , we are told , is never to blame for acts of violence .
On this view we must not hold a great world religion of peace responsible when individuals of that faith resort to force .
We must dig deeper : the real cause is poverty , U.S. foreign policy , the Arab - Israeli conflict , Western colonialism and exploitation , marital problems of individuals , and so on .
The present “ psychological ” interpretations in the case of Major Hasan are just the latest example of the Root Cause Fallacy at work .
The Australian
tells us that the mindset of Major Hasan remains a “ mystery , ” yet his Jihadist intentions are there on the surface for everyone not paralyzed by political correctness to see .
According to CNN ( Nov. 7 ) , on the morning of the shootings Hasan gave copies of the Koran to his neighbors .
According to the Associated Press ( Nov. 6 ) , soldiers reported that Hasan shouted out “
Allahu Akbar
” [ God is Great ] – the war cry of all Jihadis – before firing off over a hundred rounds with two pistols in a center where some 300
unarmed
soldiers had lined up for vaccines and eye tests .
NPR informs us that Hasan was put on probation early in his postgraduate work at the Uniformed Service University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda , Md. , for proselytizing about his Muslim faith with patients and colleagues .
The Associated Press ( Nov. 11 ) adds that classmates who studied with Hasan from in that postgraduate program reported Hasan making a presentation during their studies " that justified suicide bombing " and spewed " anti-American propaganda , " denouncing the war on terror as " a war against Islam . "
Classmate Val Finnell and another student complained about Hasan , shocked that someone with " this type of vile ideology " would be allowed to wear an officer ’s uniform .
But , importantly , no one filed a formal complaint about Hasan ’s views and comments for fear of appearing discriminatory — in other words , out of political correctness .
According to
The Telegraph
( Nov. 6 ) , Army colleagues reported that Major Hasan had condemned U.S. foreign policy , that he clearly declared that Muslims had the right to rise up and attack Americans , that he expressed happiness when a U.S. soldier was killed in an attack on a military recruitment center in Arkansas in June , and that he said people should strap bombs on themselves and go to Times Square .
It has been widely reported that Major Hasan attended the Dar al - Hijrah mosque in Virginia Falls during the time that Anwar al - Awlaki , a Yemen - based al - Qaeda preacher with extensive terrorist connections , was its main preacher .
Awlaki even praised Major Hasan as a hero on November 9 , four days after the Fort Hood attacks .
The
Times
of London revealed ( Nov. 10 ) that Major Hasan had been in direct correspondence with Awlaki , in connection with which Hasan had already been under investigation by the F.B.I .
Almost every news source has reported that Major Hasan was also under investigation by federal law enforcement officials for his postings to an internet site speaking favorably of suicide bombing .
Fortunately , not all in the media were hamstrung by political correctness .
Here is Ralph Peters in the
New York Post
( Nov. 6 ) : “ On Thursday afternoon , a radicalized Muslim U.S. Army officer shouting ‘ Allahu Akbar ! ’ committed the worst act of terror on American soil since 9/11 .
And no one wants to call it an act of terror or associate it with Islam .
What cowards we are .
Political correctness killed those patriotic Americans at Ft. Hood as surely as the Islamist gunman did .
And the media treat it like a case of non-denominational shoplifting .
This was a terrorist act
.
When an extremist plans and executes a murderous plot against our unarmed soldiers to protest our efforts to counter Islamist fanatics , it ’s an act of terror .
Period . ”
There was a laudable concern among Americans about a possible “ backlash ” against all American Muslims .
What backlash ?
Even following the September 11 attacks with their 2,976 victims , Americans behaved with exemplary restraint .
They behaved in a civilized manner in the face of barbarism .
It is time to abandon apologetics , and political correctness .
Not all Muslims are terrorists .
Not all Muslims are implicated in the horrendous events of September 11 , 2001 — or of November 5 , 2009 .
However , to pretend that Islam has
nothing
to do with 9/11 or the Fort Hood massacre is willfully to ignore the obvious .
To leave Islam out of the equation means to forever misinterpret events .
Without Islam , the long - term strategy and individual acts of violence by Osama bin Laden and his followers make little sense .
Without Islam , the West will go on being incapable of understanding our terrorist enemies , and hence will be incapable to deal with them .
Without Islam , neither is it possible to comprehend the barbarism of the Taliban , the position of women and non-Muslims in Islamic countries , or — now– the murders attributed to Major Hasan .
We are confronted , after all , with Islamic terrorists ; and we must take the
Islamic
component seriously .
Westerners in general and Americans in particular no longer seem able to grasp the passionate
religious
convictions of Islamic terrorists .
It is this passionate conviction , directed against the West and against non-Muslims in general , that drives them .
They are truly , and literally , God-intoxicated fanatics .
If we refuse to understand that , we cannot understand them .
Jihad is “ a religious war with those who are unbelievers in the mission of Muhammad .
It is an incumbent religious duty , established in the Koran and in the Traditions as a divine institution , and enjoined specially for the purpose of advancing Islam and repelling evil from Muslims . ”
That is how it is described in no lesser source than the
Dictionary of Islam
, so we should not pretend surprise if Islamic terrorists see their mission in such terms .
In the wake of the Fort Hood Massacre , America ’s armed forces , the F.B.I. , C.I.A. , Department of Homeland Security and other counter - terrorist bodies face some difficult decisions about Muslims employed in their services .
After all , the view Major Hasan expressed – that Muslims in the U.S. Armed Forces should not serve in Iraq or Afghanistan , or anyplace where they might have to kill fellow Muslims – is precisely in keeping with
fatwas
issued by such Muslim leaders as Ali Gum’a , the mufti of Egypt , which forbade Muslim soldiers to take part in the so - called War on Terror .
When Muslim soldiers or agents or operatives feel that their primary allegiance is to Islam and not the United States , can we safely allow their service to continue ?
It is an agonizing question , but one we must confront ; however , we cannot properly confront this question while we struggle to pretend that Islam itself is not part of the dispute .

Mr. Burgess gets housekeeping assistance under a state program that helps older people stay in their homes and out of nursing care .
But if he could not socialize in town , he said , he would be lost .
“ I might be on roller skates , ” said Mr. Burgess , still cowboy - thin in cinched - up Levis , his booming outdoor voice filling his home on a recent snowy afternoon .
He glanced around the tiny , cluttered living room  the coal stove , the broken television , the walls lined with pictures of his wife , Laura , who died just over a year ago after more than 60 years of marriage .
“ I wish it was different , but it is n’t , ” he said .
“ So you endure it . ”

MACHADO , Brazil ( Reuters ) -
Some of the coffee world ’s most discerning palettes came together in the heart of Brazil ’s coffee belt on Friday to judge which brews in the world ’s top grower are best for an expanding specialty market .
After hours of painstaking swilling , spitting and note making this week , judges at the Brazilian round of the international Cup of Excellence competition whittled the field down to 11 finalists from 56 entries .
The judges said quality of the Brazilian coffee had improved this year despite a wet harvest period that spoiled large quantities of produce in the world ’s top grower .
“ I honestly think the quality is much better this year .
A lot of people told me quality would be lower because of the rains but the top - tier coffees are presenting much better characteristics than in other years , ” said chief judge Erwin Mierisch .
Cup of Excellence , sponsored in Brazil by the export promotion agency Apex , holds annual competitions to seek South and Central America ’s best produce .
It aims to expand the market for high quality coffee to give growers the incentive to produce better beans .
Begun a decade ago to counter the perception that Brazil had little to offer beyond its large supply of bulk coffee , it has spread to other producers in the region .
East African nation Rwanda now also takes part .
Judges paced up and down with silver spoons , sampling the line of coffees , each of which had been roasted for the same time and at the same temperature and ground in a machine cleaned repeatedly to avoid contamination .
Their faces gave nothing away as they made notes in silence before moving on to the next sample .

“ I immediately spotted one which was outstanding .
I gave it a 97 score , ” out of a possible 100 , said Vytautas Kratulis , director of Sviezia Kava , a roaster in Lithuania after the cupping process ended .
He also preferred this year ’s coffees over last year ’s .
Still , he said he expected quality coffee would be in shorter supply in his country this year and at higher costs .
The global economic crisis has hit Baltic states particularly hard , making Lithuanian coffee drinkers in reluctant to pay premium prices .
LABEL GAINING RECOGNITION
Judges drifted out of the sampling room , mouths tired after forcefully drawing coffees dozens of times from the spoon with loud rasps , and congregated to discuss the qualities of each entry .
Numbers 8 and 11 emerged as two potential winners .
Judges compared their flavors to fruits like pineapple or red berries while others were more often likened to chocolate or savory flavors like butter .
Judges laughed as one peer described a coffee as having a “ taco ” taste and another ’s acidity as “ polite , not aggressive ” .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Coffee number 8 emerged a fraction of a point ahead of 11 at the award ceremony on Friday night .
The grower , Candido Rosa , was from Bahia in the northeast , a hotter , drier state than where most of the moisture - loving trees grow in Brazil .
He was presented with a plaque made with coffee beans .
Japanese coffee roaster Yuko Itoi , who has traveled to other rounds of the contest in Nicaragua , Colombia , Bolivia and Guatemala as well as Brazil this year , said the Cup of Excellence label was increasingly recognized back at home .
“ Little by little we can now see Cup of Excellence coffee in famous department stores and coffee stores , ” she said .
Japan is often one of the main buyers in the online auctioning of the winning and runner up coffees in the Brazilian round which will take place on January 19 .
Itoi said Japanese consumers had a soft spot for Brazilian coffee , even though not an elite origin like Colombia or Guatemala , because their countrymen had helped make Brazil into the world ’s biggest producer .
“ For Japan , Brazil coffee has a very special position because we immigrated 100 years ago ” to farm it in Brazil , she said .

The Room type Movie
At a midnight screening in a Los Angeles multiplex , the atmosphere hovers somewhere between rambunctious and mildly terrifying .
Whenever a framed photograph of a spoon appears on screen , which it frequently does , audience members throw fistfuls of plastic cutlery .
They also perform skits , at one point gathering at the bottom right of the screen and shouting , ” Down here , Tommy ! ” anticipating the moment when the face of the lead actor , Tommy Wiseau , looks in their direction .
And they comment loudly on blurrily shot scenes ( ” Focus ! ” ) or inadequately introduced characters ( ” Who the f— are you ? ” ) .
Late - night showings of cult films such as The Rocky Horror Picture Show and The Big Lebowski are known for their rowdy and strange behavior too .
But people who go to see Rocky Horror and Lebowski think those films are good .
Tonight ’s movie , an obscure , five - year - old drama called The Room , holds a different place in the hearts of those present at West Hollywood ’s Laemmle Sunset 5 .
” It ’s absolutely terrible , ” says Chris Bonk , a talent - agency assistant who has seen the film more than 15 times .
” The script is not the best .
The acting is certainly not the best .
The music is horrible . ”
The Room is a San Francisco - set love triangle involving a banker named Johnny , his friend Mark , and Johnny ’s fiancée Lisa , who is sleeping with both men .
The film does seem to be beset with problems .
Various subplots are inadequately resolved or simply disappear altogether , including the throwaway revelation that Lisa ’s mother is suffering from cancer .
The film ’s many rooftop shots feature an unrealistic San Francisco backdrop , thanks to some less - than - impressive greenscreen work .
There are lengthy , unerotic sex scenes , the last of which prompts a section of the audience to depart the auditorium temporarily in mock protest .
Finally , in one sequence , a sharp bone seems about to erupt from Lisa ’s neck for no reason at all .
The film ’s so - bad - it ’s - freakin ’ - awesome vibe has attracted a devout army of aficionados whose membership includes the cream of Hollywood ’s comedy community .
Role Models star Paul Rudd and Arrested Development ‘s David Cross are both fans , as is Jonah Hill , who uses a still from the movie as his MySpace photograph .
Heroes star Kristen Bell hosts
Room - viewing parties at her house and last year attended the film ’s monthly Laemmle screening with Rudd , Hill , and Shaun of the Dead director Edgar Wright .
” There is a magic about that film that is indescribable , ” she says .
The Room has even infiltrated the halls of cinematic academia .
” It is one of the most important films of the past decade , ” says Ross Morin , an assistant professor of film studies at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota .
” It exposes the fabricated nature of Hollywood .
The Room is the Citizen Kane of bad movies . ”
If The Room is the Citizen Kane of bad movies , that makes Tommy Wiseau the Orson Welles of crap .
Wiseau — who speaks with a thick , Schwarzeneggerian accent — directed , wrote , and produced the film .
The muscled auteur also plays the cuckolded Johnny , and , when not exposing his ivory rump in the film ’s sex scenes , gives a performance that ’s both heartfelt and berserk .
In one scene , a vein - poppingly distraught Wiseau howls the line , ” You are tearing me apart , Lisa ! ”
The moment — a favorite of Room fans — is reminiscent of both James Dean ’s ” You ’re tearing me apart ! ” howl in Rebel Without A Cause and Marlon Brando screaming ” Stella ! ” in A Streetcar Named Desire .
At least it would be , if those actors had chosen to play their parts as deranged Austrians .
The Los Angeles - based Wiseau is an admirer of Streetcar playwright Tennessee Williams and ( indeed ) Orson Welles .
” You can relate to it , ” he says of their work , over lunch in L.A. the day after the Laemmle screening .
” You see all this emotion .
That ’s why we are on the same page . ”
Wiseau is also a big fan of Dean and Brando , but he insists that any discussion of specific films that may have influenced him be off the record .
While the actor - director is friendly and infectiously upbeat about his work , he is also incredibly secretive .
Wiseau shies away from questions about his background and his age , though he appears to be in his early 50s .
” We tried for a long time to figure out where he ’s from , ” says actress Juliette Danielle , who plays Lisa in The Room .
” We never got an answer . ”
After some prodding , Wiseau does let slip a few personal details .
” I used to live in France , a long time ago , ” he says .
” Then I moved to New Orleans — I have family there .
Then I moved to Bay Area .
I work for hospital , I work for the city .
But I always wanted to be an actor . ”
Wiseau got his directorial feet wet with a short film , Robbery Does n’t Pay , and then , in 2002 , shot The Room in L.A. and San Francisco .
The filmmaker has always refused to discuss where he got the movie ’s $ 6 million budget , but he now hints that at least some of the money came from a clothing import business .
” I tell you a little bit , but that ’s it , ” he says .
” We import from Korea the leather jackets that we design here in America .
If you work , you have to save money , right ?
I did n’t get money from the sky .
I was preparing , let ’s put it this way . ”
The shoot was marred by the constant departures of cast and crew members .
” It was just mayhem , ” recalls Dan Janjigian , who plays a drug dealer in one of the film ’s peculiar plot cul - de - sacs .
” You could come in and it would be a completely different cast and crew .
It was crazy . ”
Wiseau himself initially denies that he had problems with his behind - the - camera team — ” I was very happy with everyone ” — but then admits that he did come into conflict with individuals who tried to tamper with his work .
” Some of the crew members , it ’s correct , we changed three times basically , ” he recalls .
” Because they tried , for example , to change the script .
They say , ‘ This is the way to do , etcetera , etcetera . ’
I say , ‘ No ! ” ’
However , according to one cast member who requested anonymity , the script was indeed altered during the shoot : ” It was actually a lot longer .
There was stuff that was just unsayable .
I know it ’s hard to imagine there was stuff that was worse .
But there was . ”
Wiseau insists he always intended The Room to be partly comedic , and that the movie ’s perceived faults — including the out - of - focus scenes — are deliberate .
” Let ’s assume we did everything perfect way , ” he hypothesizes .
” You will be asking this question ?
No , no . ”
However , another anonymous cast member has no doubt that Wiseau is merely making the best of an extremely bad job : ” I do n’t have anything to say about Tommy as a person .
He is a nice guy .
But he is full of s — .
He was trying to put together a drama .
It was basically his stage to show off his acting ability . ”
The Room opened at a handful of cinemas in L.A. on June 27 , 2003 .
The director , who self - distributed the movie , offered a free soundtrack CD for ticket buyers , and promoted the film with a TV and print campaign that compared The Room to the work of Tennessee Williams .
Wiseau rented a billboard on Highland Avenue , which featured a close - up of his glowering visage , and submitted the film to the Academy Awards , without success .
Cast member Robyn Paris recalls the film ’s premiere screening as ” a big deal .
Tommy rode in a limousine .
There was a spotlight set up .
It was pretty packed .
Everyone in the theater was crying with laughter . ”
Not everyone found the film so amusing , however .
Variety critic Scott Foundas noted that it ” may be something of a first : a movie that prompts most of its viewers to ask for their money back — before even 30 minutes have passed . ”
Foundas also called Wiseau ” a narcissist nonpareil whose movie makes Vincent Gallo ’s The Brown Bunny seem the apotheosis of cinematic self - restraint . ”
Tommy Wiseau insists that he ” really does n’t know ” how the film fared at the box office on its initial release .
However , one industry source states that the combined gross from the two - week run at two theaters — the Laemmle Fallbrook and Fairfax — was just $ 1,900 .
Michael Rousselet , a young screenwriter who seems to be Patient Zero of the film ’s cult , says he first caught the movie at an ” absolutely empty ” theater .
” It was like our own private Mystery Science Theater , ” he says .
” I was calling friends during the end and saying , ‘ You have to come to this movie . ’
We saw it four times in three days , and on the last day I had over 100 people there . ”
Soon , screenings of The Room were thick with both laughter and cutlery .
” The spoon thing probably started during the fourth screening with my friends , ” says Rousselet .
” I was like , Why is there a spoon in the picture frame ?
Every time it came up , I ’d scream ‘ Spoon ! ’
So we brought spoons . ”
Wiseau says that he received ” almost a hundred ” e-mails thanking him for the film .
” That ’s when I say , ‘ Let ’s just show The Room once a month , midnight screening , ” ’ he explains .
Wiseau regularly attended these events and answered questions .
Sometimes he recited Shakespearean sonnets .
Wiseau released The Room on DVD in December 2005 , and produced another , promotional , DVD that featured fans of the film at screenings praising the Room experience .
And he continued to pay for the billboard , which , as the years passed , became a local landmark until Wiseau finally gave it up in the fall of 2008 .
” People started coming up to me randomly in L.A. and saying , ‘ Were you in The Room ? ” ’ says Paris .
She was n’t the only cast member to achieve a degree of fame thanks to the film .
When Greg Sestero , who plays Mark , attended a screening a year after the movie ’s release , he says he was ” mobbed ” by fans .
Juliette Danielle attended the second - anniversary screening and encountered fans dressed as her character .
One even wore a prosthetic neck piece in homage to that scene in which it appears Lisa is about to endure a freakish compound fracture .
By the time the film ’s third anniversary rolled around , in 2006 , word of The Room had spread through the comedy scene .
” I was at Paul Rudd ’s house a couple of years ago , and he said , ‘ You have to watch this , ” ’ recalls Rudd ’s frequent collaborator and Role Models director David Wain .
” Within two minutes , I ’m like , ‘ Okay , this is my favorite thing I ’ve ever seen . ’
I ’ve watched it over and over and over .
We ’ve had a lot of fun thinking which character we ’re going to play when we do our shot - for - shot remake . ”
Rudd also showed the film to Veronica Mars creator Rob Thomas , who in turn recommended it to the show ’s star , Kristen Bell .
” I watched it in my trailer with my mouth agape the entire time , ” she recalls .
” I knew I would never be the same .
We tried to reference it on Veronica Mars as much as possible . ”
In one example , during a May 2007 episode of the show , a character mentions ” the new Rocky Horror , ” where ” people throw plastic spoons at the screen . ”
David Cross became intrigued by The Room while filming the 2004 - 05 season of Arrested Development .
” Will Arnett and I would always see the billboard and be like , ‘ What the f— is that thing ? ” ’ he says .
” Will Googled it , and then we would often watch the trailer . ”
Soon , the pair were cracking each other up by repeating Wiseau ’s signature line : ” You are tearing me apart , Lisa ! ”
Then , at the 2005 Screen Actors Guild awards , Cross noticed a familiar figure .
” I was like , Holy s — , Tommy Wiseau ’s here ! ” he says .
” I was kind of drunk , and kept following him .
I was literally finding every excuse to be next to him wherever he was in the building .
He was getting weirded out by me . ”
Eventually Cross made the pilgrimage to see The Room itself .
” The idea of a participatory thing does n’t sound like fun to me , ” he says , ” but I really , really enjoyed it .
It ’s not like there ’s one or two or three things that are bad about it .
There are several hundred .
I do n’t think Will ever saw it , ” Cross laughs .
” What a f—ing a–hole he is ! ”
Cross recommended the film to Eric Wareheim and Tim Heidecker , stars of the Cartoon Network ’s bizarre late - night sketch extravaganza Tim and Eric Awesome Show , Great Job ! , who became similarly obsessed .
And Rudd , Bell , and Hill practically transformed the set of last April ’s comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall into a Room convention .
( ” Paul and Jonah and I were talking off set and Jonah kept snickering , ” says Bell .
” And I ’m like , Am I being pranked ?
Finally , I look down , and Paul is wearing a silk - screen picture of Tommy Wiseau on his T - shirt . ” )
Meanwhile , Rudd and Wain conspired to slip Room references into Role Models .
” There were all sorts of ideas , ” says Wain .
” Like someone in the background going , ‘ You are tearing me apart , Lisa ! ’
But Role Models was such a crazy process — we were kind of writing it as we were shooting — I do n’t know if any of them ended up in the movie . ”
It seems like the comedy community is now divided into two camps : those who have fallen in love with The Room , and those who are about to .
” It ’s ridiculous that I have n’t seen this , ” says Adam McKay , Will Ferrell ’s longtime writing partner , and the director of Anchorman .
” I ’ve been told by a dozen people that I have to go .
I ’ve got to find the next showing . ”
Wiseau ’s film has even become a verb .
” When we do a take , and it seems bad , a comment about The Room is often made , ” says Joe Lo Truglio , who played the jolly knight in Role Models , and is yet another fan of The Room .
” ’ Dude , your heart was in the right place , but the acting was n’t .
You Roomed it ! ” ’
Wiseau followed up The Room with 2004 ’s Homeless in America , a loose but rather moving documentary about the plight of Los Angeles street dwellers .
” I wanted to show people that this exists , ” he says , with such sincerity that you want to hug him .
” Because I myself did not know .
My God ! ”
Wiseau is currently ” very , very busy ” working on a number of future projects , including a sitcom called The Neighbors , the pilot for which he has already shot .
And his fame among comedians has started to pay dividends .
Wiseau recently filmed a sketch for the next season of Tim and Eric Awesome Show , Great Job !
” He kind of took over the set , ” recalls star Wareheim .
” He would yell , ‘ Rolling !
Sound !
Speed ! Action !’
You could tell he had this feeling that he was a master of cinema . ”
Meanwhile , the cult of The Room grows .
Increasingly , the Laemmle Sunset 5 shows the movie on two screens , due to demand .
Fans have begun to re-create scenes and post them on YouTube .
Wiseau is mulling the possibility of turning the film into a Broadway musical and would like to dub it in French and Spanish for a possible European theatrical release .
He also , ambitiously , wants to screen The Room at the Staples Center , which has a seating capacity of 20,000 .
” We live in America .
So everything is possible ! ” he says .
Wiseau is mum about whether he will see any profit from the film , though it seems doubtful .
According to one billboard industry expert , the signage on Highland probably cost in the region of $ 5,000 a month , comfortably more than the gross box office of the midnight screenings .
And one source close to the production admits that the movie ” has n’t cleared expenses . ”
Wiseau himself attests that he is ” an artist .
I really do n’t like to talk about money . ”
His secrecy has been key to the film ’s success .
( As Wain puts it , ” Part of the fun is guessing : Who is this guy ?
Where is he from ?
Why did he shoot on a greenscreen instead of going up on a roof ? ” )
His Ed Wood - like innocence and enthusiasm for moviemaking has helped as well : Rudd declined to talk about The Room for this article because he did n’t want to ” mock somebody else ’s stuff . ”
And Lo Truglio later got back in touch , concerned that he had been too harsh about Wiseau .
” It is a guilty pleasure in every sense of the word , ” he says of the movie .
Ultimately , it really does n’t matter whether the comedy in the film is intentional or accidental .
Wiseau always planned for The Room to provoke a reaction and entertain , and it has certainly done both those things .
And how many other independent filmmakers can claim to have entranced — and even influenced — such a roll call of comedic luminaries ?
” Anything that I ’ve seen that many times seeps into my subconscious , ” says David Wain .
” In the same way that Steve Martin or Woody Allen movies became part of my vocabulary , that ’s what happened with The Room .
I ’m laughing just thinking about it ! ”
The fact is that Wiseau has succeeded where so many big - screen hopefuls have failed .
He has made his mark .
True , it may not be quite the one he intended .
But he has proved , without a doubt , that there is a place — that there is room — in Hollywood for Tommy Wiseau .

Why Stocks Rise When the Dollar Falls
Stocks rose yesterday — a lot .
With a 2 % jump , the Dow reached 10,226 , its highest level of 2009 .
The S&P 500 fared even better .
As we briefly mentioned Monday , it was n’t earnings or economic data that sent stocks to new highs .
Instead traders got the nod from the G - 20 , whose members hinted that they will likely keep ultra- low global interest rates for the foreseeable future .
“ Rather than a rebound in jobs and household income , ” writes Dan Amoss , “ the stock market seems to be pinning its hopes on limitless free money from the Federal Reserve .
But with an undercapitalized banking system , most of this zero - interest - rate money is not working its way out into the economy .
“ Instead , this zero - interest rate policy is prompting rational investors — including foreign creditors who hold trillions in U.S. Treasuries and agency bonds — to accelerate their moves into inflation hedges like gold and commodities .
The Fed may think it has ultimate control over its monetary policy , but those who already hold dollar - denominated assets play an important role .
And many of them , after putting up with lots of abuse , and the promise of zero rates of interest on their savings , are voting with their feet . ”
Thus , perversely , the “ American rebound ” stock trade is more and more dependent on a steadily weakening dollar .
As stocks soared yesterday , the dollar index found its own 2009 benchmark … a yearly low of 74.9 .
Looking at both together … hmmm … something is wrong with this picture .
“ There are indications that the U.S. dollar is now serving as the funding currency for carry trades , ” reads an IMF report from the weekend , confirming a suspicion we shared last month .
The IMF report was meant as a warning to its clients and colleagues … the group noted that distorted dollar values here have contributed to “ upward pressure on the euro and some emerging - economy currencies . ”
As Nouriel Roubini has recently hinted , we suspect cheap dollars are contributing to a rise in nearly everything .
ELEVEN MEN DIED -- WHY ?
The following article is taken from the June 1943 issue of AFGIB ( Air Forces General Information Bulletin ) .
This was reprinted from the RAF publication Tee Emm and reconstructs the story of what happened to the crews of 3 Blenheim bombers lost in the Libyan desert .
* * *
Here is the tale of how eleven Air Force men died .
They did not die fighting against the enemy .
Their deaths were not even remotely caused by enemy action .
Yet they died one of the most horrible deaths known to human beings -- slowly , by thirst .
Three Blenheim aircraft , each with a crew of four , took off from Kufra Oasis in the Libyan desert on a reconnaissance patrol .
They carried out the patrol successfully and returned to base two and a half hours later .
For some reason , however , they did not land , but flew away from Kufra again .
After half an hour one Blenheim force - landed with engine trouble and the other two followed .
Discussion of their position showed that they were lost , and one pilot took off and flew between south and west to look for base .
He returned after half an hour having found nothing , and in the afternoon he took off again , this time flying south and east , but again unsuccessfully .
During this time all three aircraft were transmitting by radio but got no answer .
According to the only survivor of the twelve , they had been so confident of being soon picked up that they did not ration their water .
Thus as much as 20 gallons had been drunk by the following morning , when they started rationing .
During the second day another pilot took off and flew north .
Once more the flight was unsuccessful , as were all attempts to receive wireless messages .
On the third day another pilot tried flying west , this being the only direction unsearched .
He did not return .
The water had given out that morning , and during the afternoon they broke open the compasses and drank the alcohol .
They also used the fire extinguishers to keep themselves cool .
As a result , they broke out in terrible blisters and sores .
Next morning the first man died .
During the following 4 days , after suffering agonies of thirst and torment from having drunk the alcohol , which led one man to shoot himself , all the men had died but one , when at last the missing aircraft were located on the eighth day after they had been lost .
The search had been hampered by two things .
First of these was lack of accurate information .
The transmission from the aircraft was very weak but the direction - finder procedure of the three radio operators was poor throughout , and they evidently were not properly aware of the direction - finder procedure at Kufra .
The second thing was the bad terrain , coupled with sandstorms which prevented accurate observation from the air .
On the other hand , the searching aircraft did not start operating till the fourth day , and though they then flew 9 hours daily , they were not working on a properly coordinated plan .
The first proper , navigationally planned search was successful within 5 hours .
Now what were the causes of this ghastly and unnecessary loss of life -- this loss , too , of all the time and money expended on the crews ' training , and this wasted war - effort of six searching aircraft and crews which might have been operationally employed ?
Primarily it was bad navigation .
It was basically due , as was afterwards proved , to the inability or slackness of any of the three navigators to keep a proper log .
As a result , they had completely lost themselves half an hour 's flying time from base .
How completely they were lost is shown by the fact that they searched towards all four points of the compass for the base they had left but 30 minutes before .
Blame also attaches to the radio operators , who did not work correctly their direction finder and so keep in touch .
Then when on the ground the crews , knowing they were lost , failed utterly to take their plight seriously , as anyone should who is engaged on desert flying .
They did not ration water till it was too late .
They made foolish use of the compass alcohol and the fire extinguishers .
They failed to lay out any strips or make smudge fires , which might have guided the searching aircraft .
Even so , they might have been saved if the searching aircraft had cooperated promptly and methodically .
For various reasons no search was made on the second day , and on the third and fourth days weather made proper search impossible .
And for 3 days after that only vague sweeps were made , instead of navigationally planned searches .
Finally , it would seem that the tragedy was in great part due to poor leadership .
A good flight commander would almost certainly not have allowed much of what did happen to occur .
One gets the impression that the stranded men did more or less as fancy dictated or as they thought best after general consultation , instead of being made to work under the strict orders of their leader .
In fact , the whole sad business might easily have been avoided in the first place if the flight commander had obeyed a standing order that during desert reconnaissance by a flight , one aircraft at least should remain on the ground ; and again if , after carrying out the reconnaissance , he had landed his aircraft safely and not taken them off for half an hour on a completely unauthorized flight .
But orders were not obeyed .
If even one life is saved in the future from knowledge and understanding of what happened , and why , then those 11 unhappy men will not have died in vain .

The Return of Burzum It 's been 11 long years and now the world will see the return of Burzum .
The highly anticipated new album is entitled " Belus " after the name of the ancient European solar deity of light and innocence .
" Belus " is not a religious album or an anti-religious album , nor is it a political one , but an attempt to explore the myths about Belus and unveil the oldest roots of our cultural heritage .
The album deals with the death of Belus , his sombre journey through the realm of death and his magnificent return .
In essence the album and the story of Belus is meant to be an entertaining story about something that once upon a time played a major role in the forming and shaping of Europe .
" The album has been made according to my heart and spirit , and not to fit into any particular genre or category , or to live up to anyone 's obvious expectations " .
The music can best be compared to the music of some of the old Burzum albums ; in particular the ground breaking " Hvis Lyset Tar Oss " and the atmospheric brilliances of " Filosofem " , only the ambient parts present on these albums has been almost completely left out on " Belus " .
" There is no special reason for this , other than coincidence and the fact that I have for some time made more and better music on the guitar rather than on the keyboard " .
" Inspiration for the album has come from a variety of sources , and I find my inspiration from fairy tales and myths , from classical music , from memories of what once was , from traditional music , from fantasy , from the wind and weather , from deep forests and running water , from the sky and the sunset , from misty mountains and from yellow leaves falling from age old trees " .
" My ambition with " Belus " is to create something I - and hopefully others too - can listen to for years and years to come without ever growing tired of it , and at the same time to share with my audience the experience of getting to know Belus , as he might have been perceived by the ancient Europeans " .
The combination of lyrics and music makes this a fairy tale different from most others , and should appeal to all those who like transcendental music and love to see different things from a different perspective .
" If I can make you dream when listening to this album , I believe I have done a good job " .
" I am aware of the black metal association with the name Burzum , and I have no real and serious problem with that , but I personally see no reason to place " Belus " in any category .
I think " Belus " musically transcends all existing categories , but if I have to choose one - and for the sake of simplicity - I will simply place it in the metal category " .
" Belus " will be released worldwide on It 's been 11 long years and now the world will see the return of Burzum .

Lyrics
Leukes Renkespill ( Introduksjon )
[ Instrumental ]
" Et tordønn kaster ned staven ,
slår ormen i hodet med stein ,
reiser med lyn ned i haven ;
han finner i eiken en tein . "
Belus ' Død
Seidmannen klatrer opp i tre
finner der jords gamle smerte ,
kutter den ned i høstens fred ,
med saks skjærer ut dets hjerte .
Eikens løv mot bakken faller ,
seidmannen åndene kaller !
Eikens løv mot jorden faller ,
seidmannen tryllevers traller !
Løken legges i lintøy ned ,
hellige eiketreånden .
Seidmannen sikrer verdens fred ;
fruktbarhet , solmakt i hånden !
Eikens løv mot bakken faller ,
seidmannen åndene kaller !
Eikens løv mot jorden faller ,
seidmannen tryllevers traller !
Der er solens brennende kraft ;
der er jordens fruktbare hav ;
i seidmannens mektige skaft ;
i drottens beåndede stav .
Glemselens Elv
Med døende sol og måne
starter ferd til skyggenes hav .
Bjørnen vil bålferd bivåne .
Liket legges i steintung grav .
Bakom slør høres jordens gråt ;
sommerens lys som forsvinner ,
eikeånden legges i båt ,
vinter og høst igjen vinner .
Jeg vil komme tilbake .
Jeg vil komme igjen .
Når vinterens ånder er svake ,
vil jeg komme hjem .
Under jord , den skjulte verden ,
bakom skyene imot vest ,
ender den lange bålferden ,
hvor vinter og høst holder fest .
Det er kaldt og mørkt i dypet ,
vokser der bare skyggene ,
der finnes det mørke krypet ,
de dunkleste uhyggene .
Jeg vil komme tilbake .
Jeg vil komme igjen .
Når vinterens ånder er svake ,
vil jeg komme hjem .
Døde hviler i hvite klær
bak tunge , kalde steindører ,
men lytter du til dødens hær
du av og til sangen hører .
Døde hviler i hvite klær
bak tunge , kalde steindører ,
men lytter du til dødens hær
du av og til sangen hører .
Jeg vil komme tilbake .
Jeg vil komme igjen .
Når vinterens ånder er svake ,
vil jeg komme hjem .
Kaimadalthas ' Nedstigning
Eikeåndlik ; tryllestaven .
Trollmann med nøkkel og maske ,
naken og hvit , ned i graven ,
kun kledd i vår verdens aske .
Langs vegger ; lange , spisse spyd .
På benkene brynjer av stål .
Han lister seg inn uten lyd ,
på bakken ser aske fra bål .
Jeg reiser til mørkets dyp der alt er dødt .
Inn i haugens mørke rike ,
der sitter de stille døde .
Må ikke for frykten vike ,
men reise til verdens øde .
Taket tekket med store skjold ,
hjelmer , belter , kniver og sverd ;
over steinhallens brune mold
en skapning , en kvinnes gjenferd !
Jeg reiser til mørkets dyp der alt er dødt .
Seidmannens ham i treet ute ,
henger , sitt hode den luter .
Kuen blør , hører den tute ,
seidmann løser sine knuter .
Seidmannen henter de gaver
som de bleke døde gir ham ,
fra gamle , mørke steingraver
han finner det vakreste fram .
Jeg reiser til Kelio .
Jeg reiser til mørkets dyp der alt er dødt .
Belte og brynje , kaker og klær ,
hjelmer og himmelske våpen ,
runer og vers , tørkede bær ,
døren til graven er åpen !
Fra alver , våpnene smidde ,
til lyse gjenfødte døde ,
dem som mot ulvene stridde
i verden som nu er øde .
Jeg reiser til Kelio .
Jeg reiser til mørkets dyp der alt er dødt .
Sverddans
Har kommet vinterens time ,
når ulven og bjørnen skal dø ;
riv vekk det skinnet , en grime ,
tramp på det , si vinter ; adjø !
Vinterånd , du skal dø !
Vinterånd , i snøen blø !
Vinterånd , jeg er sommer !
Vinterånd , og jeg kommer !
Det blir ild og røyk , skrik og skrål ;
seidmannen løper gjennom skoven .
Anvend løv og sot , sverd og stål .
Snart skinner solen fra oven .
Vinterånd , du skal dø !
Vinterånd , i snøen blø !
Vinterånd , jeg er sommer !
Vinterånd , og jeg kommer !
Det blir ild og røyk , skrik og skrål ;
seidmannen løper gjennom skoven .
Anvend løv og sot , sverd og stål .
Snart skinner solen fra oven .
Vinterånd , du skal dø !
Vinterånd , i snøen blø !
Vinterånd , jeg er sommer !
Vinterånd , og jeg kommer !
Keliohesten
Når snøen smelter gråter vi ;
vinteren har blitt beseiret .
Eikeånden vil bli satt fri ,
sommeråndene har feiret .
Når snøen smelter gråter vi ;
vinteren har blitt beseiret .
Eikeånden vil bli satt fri ,
sommeråndene har feiret .
Kommer en ånd ifra nede ,
hest ifra dypet det skjulte ,
for å mennesker berede ,
hele vår verden den ulte .
Kommer en ånd ifra nede ,
hest ifra dypet det skjulte ,
for å mennesker berede ,
hele vår verden den ulte .
Morgenrøde
Første vårens søndagsmorgen
kan vi igjen se den skare .
Er endelig slutt på sorgen ,
over åker løper hare .
På det høyeste fjell i øst
kan du se solen den røde .
Du kan se , og nyte den trøst ,
fra varden se jorden føde .
Solen har fått sin kraft tilbake .
Eikeånden er født påny .
Solen har fått sin makt tilbake .
Sommeren har kommet .

Shanghai will host the World Expo next year , and city officials are preparing for the influx of foreigners with a campaign to ban citizens from wearing their pajamas out in the streets .
An article in the Chengdu Business Daily expresses outrage over the campaign as a civil rights abuse .
Snip :
Many Shanghai residents are used to loitering around the streets in their pajamas .
But now the municipal government is making every effort to stop them from doing so , because it would be a " loss of face " for city authorities if a foreigner sees people walking the streets in pajamas during the 2010 World Expo . (…)
As a modern international metropolis , Shanghai has been playing host to foreigners for decades .
So why have pajamas become embarrassing only now ?
And will it be okay for people to walk the streets in pajamas after the World Expo ?
Why should we change our habits and customs to suit foreigners ' taste when we travel abroad as well as when we play host to them ?
Do we suffer from a sense of inferiority ?
What 's wrong with a person in pajamas ?
[ via Rebecca MacKinnon ]
A quick Google of " shanghai " + " pajamas " reveals many articles in Western media over the past decade about Shanghai 's pajama - wearing citizenry , and their government 's fruitless attempts to mandate their fashion choices .
Apparently , walking around in the street in your jammies is a familiar part of local culture in old neighborhoods there , in part because the realms of public and private space are so blurred in daily life .
Voting Irregularities in Florida During the 2000 Presidential Election
Chapter 2
First - Hand Accounts of Voter Disenfranchisement
Who are to be the electors of the Federal Representatives ?
Not the rich more than the poor ; not the learned more than the ignorant ; not the haughty heirs of distinguished names , more than the humble sons of obscure and unpropitious fortune .
The electors are to be the great body of the people of the United States .
Although statistics on spoiled ballots and voter purge lists point to problems in Florida ’s election , perhaps the most compelling evidence of election irregularities the Commission heard was the first - hand accounts by citizens who encountered obstacles to voting .
The following chapter presents individual accounts of voting system failures .
VOTERS NOT ON THE ROLLS AND UNABLE TO APPEAL
On November 7 , 2000 , millions of Florida voters arrived at their designated polling places to cast their votes .
Unfortunately , countless voters were denied the opportunity to vote because their names did not appear on the lists of registered voters .
When poll workers attempted to call the supervisors of elections offices to verify voter registration status , they were often met with continuous busy signals or no answer .
In accordance with their training , most poll workers refused to permit persons to vote whose names did not appear on the rolls at their precinct .
Thus , numerous Floridians were turned away from the polls on Election Day without being allowed to vote and with no opportunity to appeal the poll workers ’ refusal .
The following are a few examples of experiences that Floridians had who were turned away from their polling places .
Citizens Who Were Not Permitted to Vote
Cathy Jackson , an African American woman , has been a registered voter in Broward County since 1996 .
Upon registering in Broward County , Ms. Jackson was told that if she ever experienced a problem with her voter registration card , she would be allowed to vote if she could produce a valid driver ’s license .
Ms. Jackson voted in Broward without any incident using her driver ’s license since 1996 .
However , when she went to her polling place , Precinct 52 Z , on November 7 , 2000 , she was told that her name was not on the list .
The poll workers suggested that she travel back to her old precinct in Miami - Dade County to vote .
Ms. Jackson did as she was advised even though she had voted in Broward County since she moved from Miami - Dade County in 1996 .
After waiting 45 minutes at her old precinct , the poll workers in Miami - Dade told Ms. Jackson that her name was not on the rolls and referred her back to Broward to vote .
When Ms. Jackson returned to the Broward precinct , the poll workers advised her to wait while they checked her registration status .
While she waited , Ms. Jackson observed a poll worker from another precinct within the same polling place allow an elderly white voter , whose name did not appear on the rolls , to fill out an affidavit and vote .
When Ms. Jackson asked if she could do the same , the poll workers explained that she could fill out an affidavit , but that she could not vote until they had verified her registration .
The phone lines to the supervisor of elections office , however , remained busy for several hours .
Ms. Jackson became upset and eventually left to go to work .
Undeterred by these delays , Ms. Jackson returned to her precinct after work to try to vote again , but the poll workers were never able to verify her registration status and refused to allow her to vote .
Donnise DeSouza , an African American , has been registered to vote since 1982 in Miami - Dade County .
When she entered the Richmond Fire Station in Miami - Dade County at 6:50 p.m. and showed her identification to the poll worker , Ms. DeSouza was told that her name was not on the rolls .
The poll worker directed her to the “ problem line , ” so that her registration status could be verified with the supervisor of elections office .
Ms. DeSouza recalled that the line of about 15 people did not move , but at 7 p.m. when the poll began to close , a poll worker announced to the group “ if our name was not on the roll that she could not let us vote and that there was nothing she could do . ”
The poll workers stopped their attempts to verify the registration status of the voters who had been standing in line .
When Ms. DeSouza asked if there was an absentee ballot that would allow her to cast her vote , the poll worker explained that there was nothing he could do .
Ms. DeSouza testified to the Commission that she was “ very agitated ” and the next day began to register complaints with various sources about her experience .
Upon further investigation with the office of the supervisor of elections , she discovered that the poll workers should have continued their efforts to resolve the problems of those voters who were in the precinct prior to the 7 p.m. closing time .
Furthermore , Ms. DeSouza learned that her name was actually on the rolls of registered voters , because subsequently a worker at the elections office showed her the sheet that contained her name where she should have been allowed to sign .
But Ms. DeSouza explained , “ at that point [ the election was over so ] there was nothing they could do and I was deprived of my right to vote . ”
Angenora Ramsey , an African American former poll worker with 18 years ’ experience , had changed her address prior to November 7 .
Based on her familiarity with election procedures , when Ms. Ramsey went to vote at Precinct 62 in Palm Beach County , she completed a change of address affidavit .
But when the poll worker tried to call the office of the supervisor of elections to verify Ms. Ramsey ’s registration status , she was unable to get through .
According to Ms. Ramsey , the phone lines remained busy for three and a half hours — a delay she had never experienced during her time as a poll worker .
Ultimately , the poll workers refused to allow her to vote because they could not verify her voter status .
Margarita Green , a 75 - year - old Cuban American woman , went to vote at the same precinct in Miami - Dade County where she had always voted since becoming a citizen in 1966 .
When Mrs. Green showed her registration card to the poll worker , she was told that her name was not on the rolls and that she must speak with another poll worker who would look into the problem .
Mrs. Green recalled that it took a long time for the poll worker to reach the supervisor of elections because the phone line was busy .
When she finally got through , the worker explained that according to their records Mrs. Green had called in 1998 and “ erased ” herself from the voter list .
Although Mrs. Green insisted that she had not called and showed the poll worker her registration card , the poll worker refused to allow her to vote .
R. Jai Howard , vice president of the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University Student Government Association , testified on behalf of more than 12,000 predominantly African American students .
She described the massive voter registration efforts that took place at the school in the months preceding the November 2000 election .
The association ’s efforts continued until October 10 , 2000 ( the last day to register before the election ) and included a rally in which Reverend Jesse Jackson and Ion Sancho , the Leon County supervisor of elections , participated .
Despite its efforts , the Student Government Association learned in the days following the election that large numbers of students had problems voting , “ including one student who had two voter registration cards with two different precincts , some students who received no voter registration cards , switching of precincts without prior notification , misinformation at precincts , and students who had attempted to register numerous times and never received registration [ cards ] and were never entered into the system . ”
As a result of these combined problems , many students who believed they had been properly registered were not allowed to vote .
Poll Workers Confirm Widespread Voter Disenfranchisement
The experiences of these Floridians who were denied their opportunity to vote were corroborated by poll workers who testified at the Commission hearing in Miami .
Many poll workers attempted to follow the procedures they had been taught in their training , such as verifying voter registration with the supervisor of elections , but their efforts were largely futile because of the inadequacies and obstacles they faced throughout the voting system .
Marilyn Nelson , a poll worker with 15 years of experience in Miami - Dade County , testified , “ By far this was the worst election I have ever experienced .
After that election I decided I did n’t want to work as a clerk anymore . ”
At North Dade Elementary School , Precinct 232 , she observed several voters who had presented their voter registration cards showing they were properly registered , but the poll workers did not allow them to vote because their names did not appear on the rolls .
Ms. Nelson also saw voters with their “ orange cards , ” which meant that the voter had registered on time and should be allowed to vote , provided that the poll worker could verify the voter ’s registration status with the supervisor of elections office .
Many of these voters , however , were not permitted to vote because the poll workers could not get through on the phone line to the supervisor ’s office .
Maria DeSoto , a poll worker in Palm Beach County , testified that she used her personal cellular phone to call the supervisor of elections office all day , but was only able to get through two or three times over the course of 12 hours .
Ms. DeSoto added that if voters ’ names did not appear on the rolls , they were not allowed to vote , even if they presented valid identification .
Barbara Phoele , a poll worker in Broward County at Precinct 6C , observed mostly African American and Hispanic voters being turned away because their names did not appear on the rolls .
The precinct clerk at her site was unable to get through to the central election office to give affidavits to those voters whose names did not appear .
According to Ms. Phoele , the clerk did not communicate with the voters and did nothing to encourage them to vote .
In fact , Ms. Phoele noticed later that afternoon that the sign informing voters where they should call if they experienced problems had never been posted .
She brought this to the attention of the precinct clerk who explained , “ I did n’t have time to put it up . ”
Ms. Phoele recalled that in past elections it took only about 10 minutes to reach the elections supervisor , but on November 7 , 2000 , she turned away approximately 40 or 50 people because she could not access the supervisor of elections .
Marvin Rickles , Jr. , a deputy at Precinct 74B in Palm Beach County , observed an African American school principal turned away , after waiting for two hours , because her name did not appear on the rolls and poll workers could not reach the supervisor of elections office .
She returned to the precinct later that afternoon and was allowed to vote only after she discovered that her name had been misspelled on the rolls .
Millard Suid , a poll worker at the Water Works Department in Boynton Beach , testified he was not able to get through to the office of the supervisor of elections .
He recalled helping only one voter over the course of about eight hours .
Mr. Suid stated that the precinct deputy estimated that poll workers “ [ m ] ust have turned away maybe 30 or 50 people that could not vote . ”
Randall Benston worked as an area chair overseeing three precincts in Broward County .
Mr. Benston observed poll workers who were unaware that voters not on the rolls were allowed to fill out affidavits and vote .
He eventually persuaded the poll workers to allow voters to fill out affidavits in accordance with Florida election law .
POLLING PLACES CLOSED OR EARLY OR MOVED WITHOUT NOTICE
Many Floridians experienced extreme frustration on November 7 when they reported to the precincts where they had been voting regularly , in some cases for many years , and discovered that their precincts were no longer being used or had moved to another location without notice from the county supervisor of elections .
In other instances , some voters who had been standing in line to vote at their precincts prior to 7 p.m. were told that they could not vote because the poll was closed .
Under these circumstances , the patience of many Floridians was exhausted .
Polling Places Closed Early
When Lavonna Lewis , an African American first - time voter , went to her polling place to vote , she was told by a white poll worker standing outside that the poll was closed .
As she turned to leave , the poll worker allowed a white gentleman to walk in and get in line to vote .
Donnise DeSouza arrived at her assigned precinct at 6:30 p.m. , but she could not enter until 6:50 p.m. , due to the long line of cars parked on the street waiting to gain access to the polling place .
Once Ms. DeSouza was finally able to enter the polling place , she waited for another 10 minutes while poll workers verified her registration status .
At 7 p.m. , however , the poll workers announced to Ms. DeSouza and about 15 other voters who were waiting to be helped that they could not vote because the poll was closed .
Susan and Joel Newman arrived at the Water Works Department in Palm Beach to vote at approximately 6:15 p.m .
Upon their arrival , they noticed :
[ T ]he iron gates at the entrance were closed , preventing entrance . . .
Several cars pulled into the entrance lane and tried to attract attention by honking horns and ringing an intercom .
We waited 5 – 10 minutes but no one showed up and the gates remained locked .
We drove off thinking we were wrong about the closing time — that the polls must have closed at 6:00 .
A few blocks away we spotted a police car and pulled up to check .
He verified that the polls were open until 7:00 .
We complained about the situation we had just experienced and he told us to go to the Board of Elections ( some 20 minutes away ) .
We drove there and met a policeman as we entered the building .
He listened to our complaint and politely told us there was nothing he could do .
We would have to register our complaint with the [ supervisor ] of elections , Theresa LePore .
Unfortunately , he told us her office had closed at 5 p.m. and her staff went home [ and ] we would have to complain the following day .
We left , realizing that we would have no opportunity to vote this year .
Millard Suid , a poll worker at the Water Works Department on John Road in Boynton Beach , confirmed the above poll closing .
He explained that the gates to the property are on an automatic timer that shuts them every day at 6:15 p.m .
When the automatic timer shut the gates at 6:15 p.m. on Election Day , however , Mr. Suid stated , “ It was a disaster .
The people at the Water Works Department should have known about it or the people , Theresa LePore , who runs that particular district , should have known about that . ”
When asked if he called the supervisor of elections to report that the gates had closed , Mr. Suid testified , “ That would n’t do any good , could n’t get in .
I had called 911 and told the police .
Now there was a young lady at the Water Works Department who worked there all day and she left at like 5:30 and she said , ‘ I ’ll be back at 7:30 to lock up . ’
Now she should have known this gate ’s going to lock automatically .
. . .
That was n’t the first time they used that .
So somebody screwed up . ”
Robert Weisman , the county administrator for Palm Beach County , stated in a response to an interrogatory issued by the Commission after the February 16 , 2001 , hearing , that he did not know about the gate - closing incident until the Commission hearing .
He further acknowledged that a subsequent investigation by representatives of the supervisor of elections office determined that the gate indeed had closed .
Mr. Weisman did not dispute that the automatic locking of the gate blocked access to the Palm Beach County polling place before the official closing .
Polling Places Moved Without Notice
If a supervisor of elections determines that a polling place must be moved , the supervisor must “ not more than 30 days or fewer than seven days prior to the holding of an election , give notice of the change . ”
Such notice is to be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the county , and notices must be mailed to each registered voter at least 14 days prior to the election .
In case of an emergency , the supervisor of elections must post a notice at the old polling place advising voters of the new location .
Regardless of the reasons for the change , the new polling place must be accessible to all voters and conspicuously identified by a sign .
On November 7 , 2000 , however , these requirements of Florida election law were not strictly followed .
Felix Boyle , a registered voter in Miami - Dade County , described his polling place as a “ medieval labyrinth . ”
There were “ sulfuric odors from standing water , orange cones , barriers , deep pits , broken concrete .
It was a real problem getting there . ”
Although Mr. Boyle ’s polling place during the primary was very busy , the new location was “ deserted ” on November 7 , 2000 .
He surmised that the appearance of the site might have resulted in fewer people voting there on Election Day .
NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION ACT : THE MOTOR VOTER LAW
In 1993 , Congress enacted the National Voter Registration Act in an effort to increase participation in federal elections .
Congress gave states three years to implement its provisions .
To implement the act , Florida enacted the Florida Voter Registration
Act to “ provide the opportunity to register to vote or update a voter registration record to each individual who comes to an office of [ the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles ] ” to apply for or renew a driver ’s license , apply for a new identification card , or change an address on an existing driver ’s license or identification card .
Since the Florida Voter Registration
Act was enacted , more than 3,500,000 voter registration applications have been filed .
There were 609,389 applications filed with the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles ( DHSMV ) in the calendar year 2000 .
The DHSMV does not , in fact , register voters ; rather , it provides a method for persons to apply to the county supervisors of elections to register while conducting license or identification card transactions .
This process is commonly referred to as the “ motor voter ” process .
In 1995 , training for the motor voter process began and was conducted by the Florida Division of Elections .
Sandra Lambert , director of the Division of Driver Licenses , described the motor voter process at the Commission ’s Miami hearing :
When a customer comes into a driver license office to have any kind of driver license or identification card transaction , all basic information is initially processed .
The customer is then asked if they would like to apply to register to vote .
If that customer answers in the affirmative all the basic information is transferred from the computer screen on to an additional motor voter screen , so no additional information at that point has to be asked in duplication .
Some additional information does have to be gathered , such as party affiliation , homestead exemption address , [ and ] a few additional things by law .
Once that is completed , the application is printed , it is given to the customer to verify for accuracy , the oath is administered , and the application is signed .
If a person declines to apply to register to vote or to change their address , it is so noted on our computer files .
If a person is not in the office , but rather making a transaction by mail , having their renewal done by mail , there is information in that envelope which they receive and an application so that they can make any kind of changes to their voter registration or to make application to vote at that time .
All of that information is mailed directly to the local supervisor of elections .
And there is a list with all the addresses enclosed in their renewal information .
At the end of each day , in one of our offices , an end - of - the - day motor voter report is compiled , along with all of the applications , and then all of that information is forwarded within five days to the local supervisor of elections .
It ’s pretty much of an electronic process up until this point , and then forwarded on to the local supervisor of elections .
Despite this effort to increase citizen participation through motor voter registration , problems exist in the implementation of the registration process .
Curtis Gans , director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate , testified , “ In this election , thousands of people , not only in Florida , but in other places , who registered at motor voter places , motor vehicle license bureaus , and in social service agencies were not on the rolls when they came to vote . ”
A poll worker who testified at the Commission ’s Miami hearing corroborated this observation :
[ T ] here were people who had registered to vote through motor voter and somehow their registration was not transmitted to the supervisor of elections office .
I saw that with married couples in my own precinct .
One person would be registered to vote , the other person would not .
The person who was not registered to vote could n’t vote unless they physically went to the supervisor of elections office and picked up a piece of paper , which they then brought back to me , because we could n’t reach them on the telephone .
Congresswoman Corrine Brown also noted the failure of proper processing of motor voter registration , stating that “ thousands of people went and got their driver ’s license , but to this date they did not . . . receive their voter card . ”
Despite these allegations , according to Ms. Lambert , the fault should not be assigned to the motor voter registration system set up by Florida .
Ms. Lambert testified that although she did “ receive a number of complaints after the November election , ” she investigated all complaints and “ found a variety of reasons why the person was not on the list . ”
Ms. Lambert asserted that all complaints were resolved , and there was no failure on the part of the DHSMV .
In several cases , Ms. Lambert noted , “ people said they registered to vote at the motor vehicle office when in fact they had renewed by mail and they had received the application in the mail . ”
In this instance , the individual is responsible for mailing the form to the applicable supervisor of elections office .
In another instance , a voter did , in fact , visit a driver license office ; he registered , however , after the closing date and was thus not eligible to vote in the November election .
Finally , according to Ms. Lambert , there were several instances when the supervisor of elections never received the mail .
In this instance , a supervisor of elections would call to notify her office of a complaint .
Ms. Lambert said her office then “ would check and discover that we mailed . . . a batch that day . ”
If the supervisor of elections office had not received that registration , Ms. Lambert said her office “ then recreated that day ’s report for the supervisor of elections . ”
Ms. Lambert claimed , however , that it is the supervisor of elections ’ “ responsibility then to have to make contact with that customer , or all those people , to get them to be on the rolls . ”
Many Floridians alleged that they registered to vote through the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles and learned later that they were not registered .
Many of these disappointed citizens filed complaints with the attorney general ’s office and / or the Democratic Party .
The following are some examples of individuals who used the motor voter provisions to register , but were denied the right to vote .
Marcia and George Seamans of Boynton Beach registered to vote at the DHSMV on two occasions and were told at the polls that their names were not on the voter rolls .
While at the DHSMV to obtain their driver ’s licenses , they were asked to register to vote .
They were directed to fill out a separate registration application and , upon its completion , were told they were registered .
When they went to the polling place , however , their names were not on the rolls .
When the poll worker called the central office to verify their registration status , they learned that their names were not on the central voter file , and they were not allowed to vote .
In response to the Commission ’s interrogatory regarding the Seamans ’ registration , Ms. Lambert stated that the Division of Driver Licenses ’ records confirmed that Mr. and Mrs. Seamans submitted their voter registration applications at the time of obtaining their driver ’s licenses .
The division ’s records also indicated that their voter registration applications and the transmittal reports were forwarded to the applicable supervisor of elections office .
Ms. Lambert , however , was not able to explain the status of their voter registration .
She reiterated that all voter registration applications and transmittal reports are forwarded to the supervisor of elections within five days of receipt .
With regard to the Seamans , Ms. Lambert explained that voter registration applications are forwarded to Palm Beach County by U.S. mail and that copies of the applications are not maintained in their field driver license offices due to confidentiality .
Based on this response , it is impossible to determine whether the voter registration applications were actually transmitted to the supervisor of elections office or whether that office misplaced the applications once they were received .
Nevertheless , Mr. and Mrs. Seamans properly registered to vote at their driver license office and were deprived of their right to vote on Election Day .
Bill Zannie of Palm Beach County registered to vote at the DHSMV when he went to obtain his Florida driver ’s license .
He requested a confirmation to ensure that he was registered to vote .
The DHSMV staff assured him that he was registered .
He did not , however , obtain a confirmation .
When he went to vote on the day of the election , he was told that his name was not on the voter rolls .
He also learned that there was no record of his registration .
Since he registered to vote at a governmental agency , he assumed he was registered properly and to his disappointment , he was not registered .
When asked about the voter registration status of Mr. Zannie , Sandra Lambert responded that according to the division ’s electronic transaction file for December 7 , 1998 , the date Mr. Zannie obtained his driver ’s license for the first time in Florida , the record indicated that he was currently registered to vote ; therefore , DHSMV staff did not forward any forms to the supervisor of elections .
According to Mr. Zannie , December 7 , 1998 , was the first time he had obtained a driver ’s license in Florida and was the first time he requested to register to vote in the state of Florida .
Because the Division of Driver Licenses ’ records indicated that he was already registered , it took no action to register him to vote .
Ms. Lambert explained in an answer to the Commission ’s interrogatory that in the two times that Mr. Zannie moved in Florida and changed his address on his driver ’s license , his identification card / voter registration application indicated that he was currently registered to vote , raising another serious issue .
The fact that Mr. Zannie changed his address twice in Florida and the driver license office file seemed to be current indicates that his voter registration should have also reflected his change in address .
However , the driver license office failed to forward these address change forms to the local supervisor of elections office despite Mr. Zannie ’s repeated requests .
Maria DeSoto , a poll worker in Palm Beach County , testified that many eligible voters who registered through the DHSMV found their registrations were not transmitted to the supervisor of elections office .
She witnessed a couple that registered together at the DHSMV but only one person ’s name was on the voter rolls on Election Day .
The testimony of the witnesses who experienced problems voting after they had applied with the Division of Driver Licenses seems to run counter to contentions made by Ms. Lambert that its motor voter registration process is “ very simple ” and “ very good . ”
Despite some voters being disenfranchised by failures in the motor voter process , the division nevertheless maintains that it should not be blamed for the numbers of citizens who were deprived of their right to vote on Election Day .
ABSENTEE BALLOTS
Florida voters had various absentee ballot related complaints .
The Commission heard testimony alleging there was an effort by organized groups to encourage their constituents to vote absentee for the November election .
In other instances , voters complained that they had requested absentee ballots , but never received them .
Still other voters complained that when they went to the polling place , they were denied ballots because the election records indicated they were sent absentee ballots .
And some voters said they received absentee ballots even though they never requested them .
At the Tallahassee hearing , Alvin Peters , an attorney from Panama City , testified that Governor Bush sent out a letter encouraging selected citizens to vote by mail .
Mr. Peters claimed that this “ vote by mail letter ” offered selected citizens the opportunity to vote by mail , which is not allowed in Florida .
He further pointed out the letter had the seal of the state of Florida and was signed by Governor Bush .
Governor Bush disagreed with the above characterization of the letter referred to by Mr. Peters .
He indicated to the Commission that the letter did not bear the current state seal , but rather the state seal as it first appeared in 1868 .
Following Mr. Peters ’ testimony and presentation of his supporting documents , Moya Burgess responded with outrage .
She explained , “ It makes me sick to think that . . . our governor basically sent out an infomercial to his party . ”
She added that she is registered with “ the other party ” and she never received any information from the governor .
In Ms. Burgess ’ opinion , this letter should have been addressed to all voters .
POLICE PRESENCE AT OR NEAR POLLING SITES
Several Florida voters reported seeing Florida Highway Patrol ( FHP ) troopers in and around polling places .
Troopers conducted an unauthorized vehicle checkpoint within a few miles of a polling place in a predominantly African American neighborhood .
In another area , trooper vehicles were reportedly parked within sight of at least two polling places , which one resident characterized as “ unusual . ”
The FHP reported that troopers only visited polling places to vote on Election Day .
In light of the high voter turnout that was expected during the 2000 presidential election , particularly among communities of color that may have a strained relationship with law enforcement , some Floridians questioned the timing of and the motivation for the FHP ’s actions .
The Florida Election Code provides :
No person , whether acting under color of law or otherwise , shall intimidate , threaten , or coerce , or attempt to intimidate , threaten or coerce , any other person for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person to vote or not to vote as that person may choose .
The state of Florida also restricts the presence of law enforcement officers at polling places .
Specifically , unless he or she enters the polling place to cast a ballot , no law enforcement officer may enter a polling place without the permission of the clerk or a majority of the inspectors .
The clerk or inspectors are required to make an affidavit for the arrest of any law enforcement officer who does not comply with the law .
Sheriffs also have a duty under Florida election law to “ exercise strict vigilance in the detection of any violations of the election laws and in apprehending the violators . ”
Charles Hall , director of the Florida Highway Patrol , testified at the Commission ’s Tallahassee hearing .
He explained that the history of increased checkpoints by the FHP began in the early 1980s , when the vehicle inspection laws were repealed .
The FHP determined that the most effective way to inspect a large number of vehicles was through driver ’s license / faulty vehicle equipment checkpoints .
He also noted that he had no conversations with the office of the governor , the office of the attorney general , or the office of the secretary of state in preparation for the 2000 presidential election .
Colonel Hall admitted that on November 7 , 2000 , the FHP established a checkpoint on Oak Ridge Road in Southern Leon County between the hours of 10 a.m. and 11:30 a.m .
The demographic makeup of the precincts surrounding the Oak Ridge Road checkpoint are as follows : ( 1 ) Precinct 107 is 82 percent Caucasian and 13 percent African American ; ( 2 ) Precinct 109 is 37 percent Caucasian and 57 percent African American ; and ( 3 ) Precinct 110 is 70 percent Caucasian and 24 percent African American .
Approximately 150 vehicles were stopped as a result of the Oak Ridge Road checkpoint that day .
According to FHP records , of the 16 citizens who received notices of faulty equipment , six ( 37 percent ) were people of color .
On the afternoon of Election Day , the FHP received notice of a complaint to the attorney general ’s office that FHP troopers had hindered people of color from arriving at polling places due to the Oak Ridge Road checkpoint .
Colonel Hall indicated that “ the FHP was the first statewide law enforcement agency in the county to voluntarily begin collecting data concerning traffic stops in response to the racial profiling issue . ”
The racial breakdown of the 150 drivers stopped at that checkpoint on Election Day , however , is not available .
As a result of its investigation , the FHP found that some policy violations had occurred , but concluded that no citizen was unreasonably delayed or prohibited from voting as a result of the Oak Ridge Road checkpoint .
The policy violations cited by FHP ’s investigators included the fact that the checkpoint site was not on the monthly preapproved list and the media notification policy was not followed .
The investigators recommended “ counseling ” for the sergeant in charge of the checkpoint and the district commander in charge of the media notification .
Colonel Hall stated the FHP was “ very concerned about the perception people may have about what the patrol did that day . ”
The Commission heard testimony from voters in Tallahassee regarding their reaction to the FHP ’s actions on Election Day .
Roberta Tucker , an African American woman and a longtime resident of Tallahassee , was driving along Oak Ridge Road on her way to vote .
Before Ms. Tucker could reach her polling place , she was stopped at an FHP vehicle checkpoint conducted by approximately five white troopers .
According to Ms. Tucker , the checkpoint was located at the only main road leading to her assigned polling place .
One of the troopers approached Ms. Tucker ’s car , asked for her driver ’s license , and after looking at it , returned it to her and allowed her to proceed .
Ms. Tucker considered the trooper ’s actions to be “ suspicious ” because “ nothing was checked , my lights , signals , or anything that [ the state patrol ] usually check . ”
She also recalled being “ curious ” about the checkpoint because she had never seen a checkpoint at this location .
Ms. Tucker added that she felt “ intimidated ” because “ it was an Election Day and it was a big election and there were only white officers there and like I said , they did n’t ask me for anything else , so I was suspicious at that . ”
In response to the allegations of voter intimidation surrounding this checkpoint , Colonel Hall stated that “ the checkpoint was properly conducted , and it was not anywhere near a polling facility , and I do n’t see how that could affect anybody ’s ability to vote . ”
He added that he was “ not really ” surprised to learn that a trooper may have asked for a driver ’s license and not registration .
He explained that such an action could occur if vehicles had begun to back up .
Moreover , Colonel Hall stated he was “ disappointed ” that the FHP could not speak with Ms. Tucker because she refused to cooperate with their investigation .
Ms. Tucker testified , however , that she reported the incident to her local NAACP and never returned the FHP ’s calls because “ I felt it was a civil rights issue . . .
I felt like it was sort of discriminatory . ”
When John Nelson , an African American resident of Jefferson County in Tallahassee , went to his assigned polling place , Precinct 6 , to vote , he saw an unoccupied FHP vehicle parked across the street .
He considered this to be “ unusual ” because he has voted a number of times at the same precinct , but was not accustomed to seeing a law enforcement vehicle at the precinct .
Moreover , Mr. Nelson stated he did not see any FHP troopers voting inside the precinct or leaving the precinct .
Mr. Nelson added that his precinct is usually frequented by a large number of African American voters .
The FHP vehicle ’s presence piqued Mr. Nelson ’s curiosity , and after voting , he drove to a precinct in the downtown area on North Washington Street and saw another FHP vehicle parked outside the precinct .
In response to Mr. Nelson ’s allegations , Colonel Hall explained that those troopers only visited polling places to vote , and no parking tickets were written in the parking lots of voting precincts .
He added that law enforcement personnel use a service station close to the polling place , which may have explained their presence .
Furthermore , according to Colonel Hall , the FHP has “ no policy that specifically excludes polling places from any law enforcement function . ”
There is also no FHP policy against troopers wearing their uniforms or using their vehicles while voting at any election .
At the request of supervisors of elections , the FHP has assisted in traffic control at polling places in the past , but the FHP received no such request for the November 2000 election .
Florida Attorney General Robert A. Butterworth summarized his position on the use of law enforcement checkpoints on Election Day :
What we do know is that a checkpoint on that date , Election Day , was absolutely not necessary for law enforcement purposes and similar checkpoints should never again be implemented on Election Day . . .
No law enforcement barriers should be placed on Florida ’s roadways when people are going to and from voting .
Regardless of the motivation for the Florida Highway Patrol ’s actions on Election Day , it appears that a number of voters perceived , at minimum , that they were negatively affected by the proximity of law enforcement officers to the precincts around Tallahassee .
CONCLUSION
A wide variety of concerns have been raised regarding the use and effectiveness of Florida ’s voting system controls during the 2000 presidential election .
Many Floridians were denied their opportunity to vote , in what proved to be a historic general election because of the narrow vote margin separating the candidates .
Some voters were turned away from their designated polling places because their names did not appear on the lists of registered voters .
Other voters discovered that their precincts were no longer being used or had moved to another location , without notice from the supervisor of elections office .
In other instances , voters who had been standing in line to vote at their precincts prior to closing , were told that they could not vote because the poll was closed .
In addition , thousands of voters who had registered at motor vehicle licensing offices were not on the rolls when they came to vote .
The Commission also heard from several voters who saw Florida Highway Patrol troopers
in and around polling places , while other troopers conducted an unauthorized vehicle checkpoint within a few miles of a polling place in a predominantly African American neighborhood .
The Commission ’s investigation demonstrated an urgent need for attention to this issue by
Florida ’s state and local officials , particularly as it relates to the implementation of statewide election reforms .
Without some effective redress , the pervasive problems that surfaced in the 2000 election will be repeated .
• Jérôme Valcke says it is ' impossible ' that Ireland will feature • ' There 's no hope that there will be any more than 32 teams '
Fifa has dashed any lingering hopes that the Republic of Ireland could play in next year 's World Cup finals , stating that it would be impossible to add a 33rd team to the tournament .
Fifa 's general secretary , Jérôme Valcke , told a news conference three days before the draw for the finals in South Africa that Ireland should not entertain hopes of being given an extra place because of France 's controversial handball goal against them .
" I would n't say it 's a nonsense but it is impossible , " said Valcke .
" There 's no hope to give that there will be any more than 32 teams at the World Cup in South Africa . "
The Fifa president , Sepp Blatter , revealed on Monday that Ireland had requested a place at the finals in addition to the 32 qualified teams because they felt cheated by Thierry Henry 's controversial goal for France in their play - off match .
Valcke said that , as Ireland had made an official request , the matter would have to go before Wednesday 's organising committee meeting in Cape Town .
But he said Blatter , who runs football 's world governing body , had told the Irish very clearly they had no chance of success .
Valcke said there would be too many organisational problems to overcome and that other teams who felt penalised by wrong refereeing decisions could also come forward and make similar claims .
" We had 853 qualifying matches , " Valcke said .
" It 's sad that we are talking about just one game . "
Many people view retirement as a time to stop working .
But new research shows that people who take on full - or part - time jobs after retirement have better health .
The finding is based on data collected from 12,189 men and women over a 6 - year period .
The participants , who were from ages 51 to 61 at the start of the study , answered questions about their employment history , experiences after retirement and their physical and mental health .
Researchers from the University of Maryland found that men and women who kept working after retirement had fewer major diseases or disabilities than those who quit work , according to the study published this month in the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology .
Retirees benefited whether the work was a full - or part - time job , self - employment or temporary .
Doctors have long known that staying active during the older years is associated with better health .
But the question is whether working keeps older people healthy , or whether the people who continue working are able to do so because they were healthier to start with .
But the new study controlled for health before retirement and found that post - retirement work had a distinct effect on health .
Notably , the hours a person worked did n’t matter , showing that both part - time and full - time employment are beneficial after retirement .
While working after retirement is good for you , the data also suggest that retirees should n’t take on just any job .
Among those who kept working , the retirees who found work related to their previous careers had the best mental health .
The study authors speculated that working outside a person ’s main area of expertise might lead to more stress , explaining the lower mental health for people who worked outside their main career field .
Switching careers after retirement may also be a sign that the person had to find some form of work to cope with financial problems ,
Other studies have also supported the idea that working after retirement is good for you .
A long - term study of 1,000 men and women born in 1920 suggested that working after retirement was associated with living longer .
The participants joined the study at age 70 and were tracked for 14 years by geriatrics researchers from the Hadassah Hospital Mount Scopus in Jerusalem .
After controlling for individuals ’ health at the beginning of the study , the researchers found that whether a person was still alive after 12 years was strongly associated with whether they had been actively working or were fully retired .
Among the 1,000 people studied , those who continued to work at age 70 and beyond were 2.5 times as likely to be alive at age 82 as those who had retired and were not working at the beginning of the study .
Another study showed that losing a job at an older age can be devastating to health .
Yale researchers followed 4,220 workers , ages 51 to 61 , for 6 years .
During the study period , 457 workers lost their jobs .
Being laid off close to retirement increased the risk for stroke by three times , according to the study published in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine .
If you believe some reports , the future of humanity is a super race of genetically - engineered women who can reproduce without men .
“ Take men ’s genetic contribution to humanity out of the equation and – in theory – women could live a third longer , ” said the UK ’s Daily Mail .
The Mail – and a host of other outlets – was covering new research that created mice with two mothers , which lived much longer than those conceived normally .
But experts in the mechanisms of ageing say specific aspects of the way the research was conducted mean it ’s way too soon to declare men a genetic burden who are imposing limits on human lifespan .
So before you ditch your boyfriend or husband , New Scientist answers a few questions about what this intriguing experiment really tells us .

What ’s all the fuss about ?
The excitement surrounds an experiment by Tomohiro Kono of the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Manabu Kawahara of Saga University , who were intrigued by why male mammals usually die younger than females .
They suspected that the explanation may lie partly in a phenomenon called “ imprinting ” – differing activity of genes due to chemical modifications depending on whether they are inherited from the mother or the father .
Paternally imprinted genes may have particularly free rein in males , Kono ’s team reasoned , and may govern traits such as living fast and dying young .
However , paternally imprinted genes will also have effects in females .
So the researchers used methods similar to those used for cloning to create a group of “ bi-maternal ” female mice from two eggs – eliminating the need for sperm and its cargo of paternally imprinted genes .
So what did the researchers find ?
The resulting mice lived for an average of around 840 days – more than 180 days longer than normally - conceived females from the same strain .
They were also smaller .
Kono says the most likely interpretation is that it is due to imprinted genes and suggests that one culprit could be a paternally imprinted gene called Rasgrf1 , which has previously been shown to affect growth .
Specialists in the mechanisms of ageing agree that this is a fascinating possibility , but remain to be to be convinced that Kono ’s results are conclusive .
“ The most likely interpretation ” .
I take it there are disagreements ?
Yes .
There were only 13 mice in each group , which were all relatively short - lived .
In other experiments , females from the same strain have lived for an average of around 860 days – longer than both groups in the experiment .
“ This makes it trickier to interpret the claim that the bi-maternal mice are unusually long - lived , ” says Richard Miller , who studies the genetics of ageing at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor .
What ’s more , the strain used in the experiment is unusual in that its males typically live longer than females .
That makes it particularly hard to tell how the results relate to normal sex differences in lifespan .
I ’m beginning to think we need men after all .
There is also the fact that Kono and Kawahara had to manipulate two genes to create their bi-maternal mice – so the differences in lifespan might be due to this genetic manipulation , rather than the absence of paternally imprinted genes .

MPs gave second reading Wednesday to a bill that would abolish the registry for long guns .
( ( Paul Chiasson / Canadian Press ) )
The federal long - gun registry moved a step closer to being abolished as MPs voted Wednesday in the House of Commons to scrap the controversial program .
With support from 18 Liberals and New Democrats , the private member 's bill passed second reading 164- 137 and now goes to committee .
If passed , Bill C-391 would scrap the decade - old registry and destroy existing data within the system on about seven million shotguns and rifles .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper rises along with Environment Minister Jim Prentice and Defence Minister Peter MacKay to vote in favour of the bill to abolish the long - gun registry in the House of Commons .
( ( Adrian Wyld / Canadian Press ) )
The legislation was proposed by Manitoba Tory backbencher Candice Hoeppner .
" I think it 's important that the Liberals and NDP allowed a free vote and that many of their members supported the private member 's bill , " Hoeppner said .
" It 's step one .
There 's still a lot of work to do , though . "
Because the proposed law was introduced as a private member 's bill , opposition MPs were permitted to break from party lines and support it .
That secured support from New Democrats and Liberals from northern and rural ridings , where opposition to the gun registry is strongest .
" I favour a gun-control system , but I do not favour a gun-control system that makes criminals out of farmers and hunters , " said PEI Liberal MP Wayne Easter .
The Conservatives have long opposed the gun registry , brought in by the former Liberal government in response to the killing of 14 women at Montreal 's L'École Polytéchnique in 1989 .
However , there is unwavering support for the gun registry from such groups as the Coalition for Gun Control , the Canadian Chiefs of Police and the Canadian Police Association .
Wendy Cukier of the Coalition for Gun Control said firearm deaths .
including suicides and murders of women , have declined during the time the registry has been in place .
Cukier , who watched the vote from the public gallery in the Commons , called it " appalling . "
" It was n't even close , " she said .
" It 's horrifying and a lot of Canadians are going to wake up tomorrow and find out about this for the first time . "
The mother of one of the slain Montreal students made a public appeal to the MPs this week , imploring them to preserve the gun registry .
Conservatives argue the registry has been a billion - dollar boondoggle , although a 2006 study by the auditor general found that eliminating the long - gun portion of the registry would only save taxpayers about $ 3 million a year .
In an annual report from Canada 's Firearms Commissioner prepared by the RCMP , police said they used the registry more than 2.5 million times in 2007 .
But Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan has not made the report public .
" Canadians do n't need another report to know that the long - gun registry is very efficient at harassing law - abiding farmers and outdoors enthusiasts , while wasting billions of taxpayer dollars , " Van Loan 's office said in a release Wednesday .
Fans who 've been following anime for more than a decade tend to complain about the medium 's current state of affairs .
In Japan as well as America , in industry as well as hobbyist circles , the ones who witnessed the country 's animated output peak and slowly fall into decline can at any moment be witnessed bemoaning its latest offerings , featuring tired genre retreads and relentless pandering .
While there is certainly no shortage of people who like the new stuff , it 's hard to escape that things are n't as inventive in this space as they once were .
So seldom does a production come along that throws out the rules of the format , that cruises blindly past the deeply warn grooves of Japan 's pulp storytelling , that when such a film does come along one scarcely knows how to react .
But such is the case with Cencoroll , a half - hour one - shot auteur anime by manga artist Atsuya Uki .
On it 's surface it 's merely a well - crafted piece of experimental weirdness : a story about feuding schoolboys and their Pokémon - like fight with giant shape - shifting blob monsters in downtown Tokyo , and the girl who gets mixed up in the proceedings .
The title refers to one such amorphous blob monster , Cenco ( pronounced SEN - ko ) .
In his native form Cenco is a large , off - white and more or less formless mass with eyes and a giant mouth , all of which move around a lot .
Despite looking like he might try to bring about the second impact , Cenco is a pretty tame creature , and serves as a pet to a boy named Tetsu , a sullen , dead - pan type who would prefer to stick to himself .
Cenco accompanies him , changing into a variety of amusing shapes , including an automobile and a little toy panda car , while Tetsu gives him orders with a little antenna that sprouts up from his hair .
The boy and his blob attract the attention of Yuki , a girl who finds Cenco a curiosity .
Monsters such as Cenco seem to appear somewhat frequently , and nobody seems particularly freaked out by them , so Yuki treats it with the mild curiosity of a pet snake .
When a rival monster trainer named Shu challenges Tetsu to a duel , Yuki gets caught in the middle .
Shu 's giant monster ( which can turn invisible ) sits atop a skyscraper , waiting .
What should be little more than a standard shonen anime battle - to - the - finish somehow feels entirely different : a cross between the intense apocalypse of a Katsuhiro Otomo film and the mundane brutality of a gang war .
There 's so much visual inventiveness -- an entire scene takes place inside Cenco -- that any rules of what could happen and what might happen fly entirely out the window .
Little is explained -- the half hour running time is so short that there 's little room for world building .
There 's plenty of room , however , for metaphor -- both in terms of human relationships and youthful arrogance -- and the intellectuals among us could spend days analyzing the film .
Cencoroll is based on Uki's award - winning one - shot manga Amon Game , which he 'd earlier adapted into a short film with Anime Innovation Tokyo .
For all of the publicity surrounding the soundtrack ( featuring a pulsing vocal dance theme by supercell / ryo ) , the majority of the film is actually stark and music - free , lending it a raw and immediate feel .
When there is music , it 's mostly of the action movie variety , quickening the pulse at opportune moments and with only slight hints of inventiveness and Drum ' n '
Bass influence .
The film incorporates the cinema verité style of filmmaking popular among the last great generation of art - house Japanese directors , no doubt influenced strongly by Ozu .
All of this is just to say the plain , naturalistic filmmaking only enhances the feeling of rousing absurdity .
There is , after all , nothing new or inventive about large monsters controlled by teenagers destroying Tokyo .
Variations on that formula have been popular since the late 1950s .
What makes Cencoroll so inventive is n't its subject matter but the starkness itself .
There 's no hint of heroicism , not a shred of honor or charged emotion .
After all , teen years are more about bland boredom and apathy , are they not ?
Cencoroll is awash in such boredom , such detachment , and the recklessness that goes along with these pillars of youth .
After all , despite its mystery , most teens ( and adults for that matter ) would quickly tire of having a monster like Cenco around .
At some point the new dog stops being a new pet and becomes simply a dog that must be taken out and walked and fed .
Sometimes it 's rewarding , and sometimes it 's a misery , but mostly it 's just there : a mundane part of every miserable passing day of your life .
People can get used to just about anything .
The show is really quite honest , that way .
There 's so much going on under the surface that the short running time is particularly frustrating .
The film plays like a pilot , teasing chapters more of what might be lurking around the corner .
At the same time , the puzzle of it all propells Cencoroll into something far bigger than the sum of its parts .
I can only hope that , should it be a success on DVD , more might be made .
But until then , one can only make do with what we have : a film that defies any and all expectations of both medium and genre , that makes us marvel and has really little time to do much else .
To feel that breathless sense of strange again from anime is something for which I am indescribably grateful .
While many Westerners think of witches and witchcraft as being relics of the Middle Ages ( or relegated to modern tourist traps in Salem , Massachusetts ) , in many countries belief in witches is common , and black magic is considered part of everyday life .
In Africa , witch doctors are consulted not only for healing diseases , but also for placing curses on rivals ( or removing curses placed by rivals ) .
Magic ( or at least the belief in magic ) is used for personal , political and financial gain .
America , of course , has its own version of witch doctors : the thousands of independent fortunetellers and psychic soothsayers with hole - in - the - wall shops occasionally arrested for scamming desperate or gullible customers .
( Their victims are often led to believe that a curse has been placed upon them and that it can be removed with a generous " donation . " )
While fortunetellers usually do only financial and emotional harm , belief in black magic has led to dozens of murders .
In Tanzania , East Africa , at least 50 albinos ( people with a rare genetic disorder that leaves the skin , hair , and eyes without pigment ) were murdered for their body parts last year , according to the Red Cross .
An albino 's arms , fingers , genitals , ears , and blood are highly prized on the black market , believed to contain magical powers .
People with albinism anywhere often stand out because of their distinctive features ; in a continent of dark - skinned Africans , albinos are often the subject of fear , hatred , and ridicule .
The belief and practice of using body parts for magical ritual or benefit is called muti .
( Science fiction fans may recall that muti was featured in the hit South African film " District 9 , " in which the hero 's body parts were sought after by a local warlord who believed that the limbs would give him magical powers .
That horrific scene was based in fact , not the screenwriter 's imagination . )
The muti murders are particularly brutal , with knives and machetes used to cut and hack off limbs , breasts , and other body parts from their screaming victims — including children .
Many of the albinos were beheaded , their heads carefully collected and preserved as gruesome good luck charms or for use in rituals .
While many suspects have been arrested for carrying out the albino murders , so far the persons who commissioned the killings ( or offered huge sums for human body parts ) have not been arrested .
Some believe that because belief in witchcraft and muti is so accepted and widespread in East Africa , police , politicians , and judges are hesitant to pursue the criminals too vigorously .
Meanwhile , tens of thousands of African albinos live in fear of their lives , shunned and hated because of the color of their skin .
To those who believe in science , albinism is merely a rare medical condition ; to those who believe in witchcraft and magic , it is a reason to murder and mutilate the innocent .

Three years ago ,
You were 's Man of the Year .
By next year , you could be Public Enemy # 1 .
For years , journalist Michael Collins has been calling them “ the Money Party . ”
It ’s a mere paraphrase of Gore Vidal ’s very correct assertion that there are no Democratic or Republican parties -
There ’s only the Corporate Party and the only difference between the two is how fast their knees hit the carpet when a lobbyist walks into their office .
I would amend that to say it depends on how fast they can make a well - heeled corporate interest cum against the back of their throat .
In order to see just how evil and hostile our Congress is to their constituents , one need look no further back than the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act in the spring of 2005 .
The bill , written by self - dealing lenders seven and a half years before it passed , was essentially a veiled piece of sarcasm that preemptively sought to paint Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Public as criminals or potential criminals for “ abusing ” the bankruptcy protection laws while these self - same , self - dealing corporations as the poor victims whose Plan B was always the bankruptcy courts , corrupt , irresponsible entities that were given the same protections that are rightfully ours .
The “ consumer protection ” part of the bill only protected those consumers of shrinking private incomes , namely the credit card companies who largely wrote the bill .
They were still able to hike APRs up to 36 % and even the subsequent credit card reform bill of this year does little to alleviate these crushing Tony Soprano - like interest rates .
It only forces the credit card companies to give you a little more notice before capriciously jacking up your APR whether or not you ’re a good customer .
Regarding election reform , it ’s long been noted that lawmakers ( especially , audaciously , Republicans ) and the corporate mainstream media are more prone to believe or to have you believe that the real issue is n’t election fraud perpetrated every other year by multi billion dollar , Republican - connected vote tabulation companies and an army of shadowy , partisan operatives , it ’s voter fraud .
Forget the fact that only a handful of voter fraud cases were ever prosecuted by the Justice Department between 2002 - 5 .
Diebold , ES&S and Sequioa Systems are n't the bad guys .
It 's ACORN .
We ’re also the Dillingers , Bonnie and Clydes and the James Gang .
We ’re the ones who abuse the bankruptcy system .
We ’re the ones who bully poor credit card and banking giants .
We ’re the ones who abuse the election laws .
Yet we ’re also the ones who have to bail out Wall Street to the tune of trillions and finance two losing wars thousands of miles away for trillions more whether we want to or not .
It can be said that the only truly criminal act perpetrated by the national electorate is when we keep voting into office actual criminals and corporate stooges ( from now on referred to as “ members of Congress ” ) and it ’s that brief , shining moment when , ironically , we ’re appealed to by these earnest , hopeful candidates and incumbents who never think beyond the next election cycle .
It ’s the one time that we can be trusted to “ do the right thing ” when we walk into the polls .
How many times in the movies have we seen henchmen and accomplices spring the bad guy from prison or do him some other favor only to see the bad guy turn around and shoot his naïve benefactor in the back ?
Last Saturday night , the people that we elected to Congress , did it again and this time we ca n’t blame the Republican Party .
In the dead of Saturday night , the House passed their version of a health reform bill that , frankly , makes Max Baucus ’ first health care proposal look like a bleeding heart liberal / socialist piece of legislation by conspicuous relief .
One of the most alarming aspects of HR 3962 , that passed 220 - 215 ( 219 Democrats and one Republican voted for it ) are the purely evil sections 7203 and 7201 .
The less evil of these sections , 7203 , calls for $ 25,000 in fines and up to a year imprisonment for “ defying ” the federal mandate for getting insurance .
That 's the misdemeanor .
The felony ?
A quarter of a million dollars in fines and up toyears in prison .
You read that right .
A quarter of a million dollars in fines and 60 months in prison for being put in the position of choosing food or your mortgage over health care that are hardly any cheaper than the bloated rates we ’re already paying .
Add to that the nonpartisan CBO ’s projection that any government - run public option would wind up being evenexpensive than those offered in the private sector .
Add to that the fact that Blue Dog Democrats and Republicans had shoehorned language into the bill that allows individual states to opt out of the public option , a tack favored by the President .
It ’s called “ the trigger option ” , so - called because it would trigger the implementation of said so - called option if the private sector does n’t meet certain conditions .
And those of you who are actually found guilty of the crime of not buying over $ 100 of health insurance every week will lose their jobs and earning potential .
For up to five years , we will not be contributing to anything other than a prison economy .
We will not be paying taxes .
We will not be paying child support if we already are .
And when we get thrown into the prison system , who gets to foot the bill for the health care that we 'd defiantly refused to get ?
You guessed it : Joe Sixpack and John Q. Public , aka the already burdened US taxpayer .
The Draconian 7203 and 7201 are supposed to be mere threats , deterrents to prevent us from cruelly withholding and willfully denying poor HMOs who are just trying to get by like the rest of us .
But what difference does that make to the rest of us who are held at gunpoint and told , " Do n't worry .
We wo n't really shoot you unless you refuse to jump ten feet into the air " ?
According to the latest projections , this $ 1.3 trillion health care bill ( HR 3962 ) passed in the House would force you to buy insurance if you do n’t have it already , raise premiums and allow states , including those that have near - monopolies in the health care industry ( such as Maine , for instance ) to drop out of the program .
Essentially , it ’s a massive individual mandate without anything resembling a public option and co-ops would essentially be shouldered and jostled out of contention .
It would be very easy to imagine health insurance giants leaning on state - level lawmakers to opt out of the federal program .
Perhaps the Republican Party had the right idea about this , all along : Perhaps the last thing we need is health care “ reform . ”
At least under the status quo , 48,000,000 of us can’t afford health insurance but no one ’s proposing putting us in jail for the crime of being indigent or fining those that ca n’t afford even $ 5300 in annual premiums or $ 15,000 for family plans ( the cheapest single and family plans under the ratified House bill ) to the tune of $ 250,000 .
The last such early Christmas present to the health care field , the $ 800,000,000 gift - wrapped present to Big Pharma from Congress and George W. Bush was just a precursor , a warmup .
It was obvious from the gitgo that any health care “ reform ” would be a massive corporate giveaway seeking to create a captive customer base of hundreds of millions for a part of the private sector that is already richer and more powerful than most national GDPs .
And the pre-emptive supposition that any working or unemployed man who chooses to feed his family or pays his mortgage to stave off foreclosure for another month is a potential criminal is plainly the most despicable legislation to come down the Beltway in years .
Specifically , four and a half years .
I mentioned the bankruptcy bill of 2005 for another reason .
A 2004 Health Affairs study discovered that out of 1,660,245 people who filed for bankruptcy the year before , around half of them did so because medical bills made them default on credit card or mortgage payments .
And almost 73 % of those people already had health insurance .
At the very black heart of the bankruptcy bill was the need for health care reform , something that took four more years to seriously address .
But We the People are under siege by our own Congress .
They have met the enemy and do so during every election cycle and it is us .
The House passed a bill last Saturday that forces you to buy health insurance at rates higher than what we ’re already paying , without a real public option and credit card companies can still charge you up to 30 % interest even if you ’re a good customer .
It ’s impossible to see how this miraculous “ jobless recovery ” will pan out when unemployed , underemployed and struggling working families are saddled with crushing home lending rates , rising credit card payments and an unwanted mandate that seeks to burden these same families with at least $ 15,000 in corporately / Congressionally - mandated health care costs that at least now are optional and with little to no real chance of successfully filing for bankruptcy protection .
And to somehow be able to do all this with the unemployment now officially at 10.2 % .
What I ’m proposing here is n’t Monday morning quarterbacking .
This is real .
The Democratic Congress did this to us last Saturday after the C - SPAN cameras were turned off for the night .
It was as if they shot us in the back of the head Soviet - style so as to leave behind no witnesses or to take a bigger cut of the heist .
While I ’m not lauding the GOP ’s motive for opposing it , it can be said that this time , unlike 2005 , they did n’t have a hand in this Satanic bill that seeks to enslave and imprison American consumers both literally and figuratively .
And why we ’re not marching on Capitol Hill right now by the tens of millions , torches , ropes , buckets of hot tar , bags of feathers and pitchforks in hand is anybody ’s guess .
And why is it that the only people whom we ’d seen come out in full force and in full - throated , well - organized opposition to health care reform was the clearly insane , criminally stupid and willfully ignorant radical factions known as astroturfers and teabaggers ?
Unfortunately , you can only " pump " water a few inches this way , at best .
Yes , warmer water will rise to the top of a column of water .
But in a pipe open at both ends , once the overpressure created by the water above the source exceeds the total pressure at the source ( ~ 1 atm . ) , water will stop rising .
When you do the math , even very cold water at the source vs. nearly boiling water at the top of the pipe will only allow the water to rise a few inches .
( If your source pipe was insulated and could extend to great depth , and you could heat ALL of the water in the pipe , you could do somewhat better , but heating water at the inlet of the pipe would be costly and difficult enough to outweigh any benefit . )
The other error here is the usual one with solar & wind power .
Yes , the energy itself can be regarded as " free , " but you need land upon which to place the collectors , and even more important , you need to BUILD the collectors , and that costs money ( capital investment ) .
Even solar troughs are not free , nor are long pipes , especially ( as others have mentioned ) , pipes that will not corrode in hot seawater .
And once the facilities are built , they will need MAINTENANCE -- they will get dusty , they will corrode , microbes & insects & birds & animals will do various things to reduce their efficiency , etc. , etc .
There are some viable concepts in ocean - thermal and solar - powered water pumping and desalination , but this is not one of them .
From phallic lamps to erotic figures , a bawdy new exhibition depicting the sex lives of the ancient Greeks has opened at the Museum of Cycladic Art in Athens .

Defending the rights of The Village People , the legendary Web Sheriff threatened The Pirate Bay 's operators with legal action in an attempt to get compensation for the losses the six had suffered .
The threats did n't lead to much unfortunately , so The Village People and the infamous Sheriff are now pointing the gun at Jamie Oliver instead .
Early 2008 , the Web Sheriff , aka John Giacobbi , launched an assault on the operators of The Pirate Bay .
The Sheriff threatened legal action in both Sweden and the US , but despite all the bluster , that ’s the last we heard of it .
Now , nearly two years later , Giacobbi moves away from the Swedish torrent chefs , instead pointing the finger at the British cook Jamie Oliver .
Unlike the Pirate Bay operators , Oliver did n’t host any torrents on his website .
No , he committed the crime of dressing in clothing similar to that worn by The Village People thirty years ago , but without their permission .
In a promo trailer for the show , Jamie ’s American Road Trip , the British cook dressed up as the 70’s style icons .
The clip ran on TV , accompanied with a poster campaign in the London Underground , all featuring Jamie dressed up as each of the six members of the hit disco band .
According to the Web Sheriff , Jamie Oliver ’s actions are blatant trademark infringement , seriously hurting the revenues of the Indian chief , cowboy and the four other members of the band .
“ The Village People are still a huge , multimillion - dollar global business , ” the Sheriff commented .
Much like the Pirate Bay , Channel 4 , the broadcaster of Jamie ’s show , is not impressed by the Sheriffs threats .
“ We are confident that the promotional campaign for Jamie ’s American Road Trip does not infringe any copyright / trademark rights which the Village People may have .
No parties have received a formal legal claim from the Village People and , if one is received , it will be vigorously defended , ” a Channel 4 spokesperson said .
If the case does indeed come to court , it could be risky for the Web Sheriff to dress up in his usual outfit , as that is more than likely trademarked by a third party who might also wish to issue similar frivolous legal threats .
In a previous post , we showed you how to upload several files using the input element .
In Firefox 3.6 , you can let your users drag and drop files directly into your web page , without going through the file picker .
Demo
If you ’re running the latest Firefox 3.6 beta , check out our interactive demo of drag and drop .
It showcases two technologies : the Drag and Drop API and the File API .
Drag and Drop Events
To use drag and drop , you first need to tell the browser that a given element can handle dropped objects and will respond to a drop action , using the dragover and drop events .
You also need to prevent the browser ’s default behavior , which is to simply load the dropped object in the browser window .
dropzone.addEventListener(" dragover " , function ( event ) { event.preventDefault( ) ; } , true ) ; dropzone.addEventListener(" drop " , function ( event ) { event.preventDefault ( ) ; // Ready to do something with the dropped object } , true ) ;
You may also want to use the dragenter and dragleave events to be notified when a drag session starts or stops .
Your element is now ready to receive files with the drop event .
Manipulating the Files
On the drop event , you can access the files with the files property of the DataTransfer object :
dropzone.addEventListener( " drop " , function ( event ) { event.preventDefault ( ) ; //
Ready to do something with the dropped object var all The Files = event.dataTransfer.files ; alert ( " You 've just dropped " + all The Files.length + " files " ) ; } , true ) ;
Once you ’ve accessed the files , the File API lets you do much more , like parsing files as a binary array , or displaying a preview of an image by reading the file as a DataURL .
Of course , you can still drag and drop data other than files ( e.g. text , URLs , remote images … ) using the drag and drop API .
It has the appearance of children 's modelling clay , which once out of its airtight packet , can be moulded into any shape and fixed onto leather , metal , ceramic , wood and plastic .
After about 24 hours it " cures " and will adhere to any substance with the strength of ultra strong glue but it does not become rock hard .
Instead , it stays slightly flexible .
This relationship is new and still awkward , experts say , and there is more hyperbole than evidence surrounding many “ brain - based ” commercial products on the market .
But there are others , like an early math program taught in Buffalo schools , that have a track record .
If these and similar efforts find traction in schools , experts say , they could transform teaching from the bottom up  giving the ancient craft a modern scientific compass .
Beyond Counting
In a typical preschool class , children do very little math .
They may practice counting , and occasionally look at books about numbers , but that is about it .
Many classes devote mere minutes a day to math instruction or no time at all , recent studies have found  far less than most children can handle , and not nearly enough to prepare those who , deprived of math - related games at home , quickly fall behind in kindergarten .
“ Once that happens , it can be very hard to catch up , ” said Julie Sarama , a researcher in the graduate school of education at the University at Buffalo who , with her colleague and husband , Doug Clements , a professor in the same department , developed a program called Building Blocks to enrich early math education .
“ They decide they ’re no good at math  ‘ I ’m not a math person , ’ they say  and pretty soon the school agrees , the parents agree , ” Dr. Clements said .
“ Everyone agrees . ”
In a Building Blocks classroom , numbers are in artwork , on computer games and in lessons , sharing equal time with letters .
Like “ Sesame Street , ” Building Blocks has children play creative counting games ; but it also focuses on other number skills , including cardinality ( how many objects are in a set ) and one - to - one correspondence ( matching groups of objects , like cups and saucers ) .
Teachers can tailor the Building Block lesson to a student ’s individual ability .
On a recent Wednesday afternoon at the Makowski center , Buffalo ’s Public School 99 , Pat Andzel asked her preschool class a question :
“ How many did you count ? ”
She had drilled them on the number seven .
She held up a sign with “ 7 ” and asked her students what number they saw ( “ seven ! ” ) ; had the group jump seven times , counting ; then had them touch their nose seven times .
As the class finished counting seven objects on a poster , she asked again :
“ How many ? ”
“ I never used to ask that , ” Ms. Andzel said in an interview after the lesson .
She asks it all the time now , she said , because it drives home a subtle but crucial idea : that the last number they said in counting is the quantity ; it is the answer .
Wind turbines are said to be not the best way to tackle global warming
Meeting the demand for family planning in poor nations is a cheap and effective way to cut CO2 emissions , a new website initiative claims .
The UK - based Optimum Population Trust says fast - rising population levels lead to growing emissions .
The website is urging wealthy people to offset their own CO2 emissions by funding contraception programmes .
It says taking such action is better value than spending money on wind turbines , solar power or hybrid cars .
Critics would argue the analysis is too simplistic , a BBC correspondent says .
The BBC 's environment analyst Roger Harrabin says they could contend that reducing the number of people born in the US would make a big difference in achieving reductions in CO2 levels .
Our correspondent added that carbon emissions from people in much of sub-Saharan Africa are so low that they can barely be counted .
According to the OPT , every £ 4 spent on family planning saves one tonne of CO2 .
It estimates that a similar reduction would require an £ 8 investment in tree planting , £ 15 in wind power , £ 31 in solar energy and £ 56 in hybrid vehicle technology .
It is promoting a scheme in which wealthy people can offset their own carbon emissions by funding contraceptive programmes in the developing world .

I understand that Barack Obama campaigned on fighting the real fight , Afghanistan , but has he looked at these unemployment numbers lately ?
Currently , 10.2 % unemployed but if you enter underemployed it is close to 18 % .
Olbemann is right , we can not afford this war .
In fact , it was the use of the U.S. credit card , borrowing from China that has sustained these wars , which we are knocking on the 9th year door SOON .
Now we are battling for a weak health care bill , that will not challenge much change towards the health insurance companies , but it is the D.C. congress that are nickle and diming the American public on the premise that , " We can not afford it " .
But we can afford to continue paying for two bullshit wars ?
Yes , at this point , bullshit wars .
And at 10B + a pop , monthly ?

Pro-Israel Lobby Group ’s Iran Petition Features Lots of Questionable Names
Created : December 11 , 2009 14:33 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Earlier today , the Israel Project — a pro-Israel organization that endorses tough measures against Iran ’s nuclear program — sent out a release announcing substantial support for placing sanctions on Iran .
A petition issued by the Israel Project to be sent to “ every ambassador to the U.S. , all UN member states , the president of the World Bank , human rights leaders , governors , members of Congress and the Pope ” urged “ severe sanctions as a means to convince Iran to stop its nuclear program . ”
And that petition had attracted a deep reservoir of support — 90,000 signatories , the group announced :
Our petition now has more than 90,000 supporters , which you can see by clicking
But clicking through that link to take a closer look at those signatories raises substantial questions about their authenticity .
For instance , signatories 84,854 through 85,071 are all named “ Vince Vince ” — although the Israel Project claims that all those different Vince Vinces are from different states .
Well , sort of .
Some of them are from states listed by recognizable acronyms like MN or AZ or PA .
Others , however , are from the great states of GU and AA and XX .
Click to enlarge
Nor does the curious reader even have to examine the list that far down .
Signatory number five is listed as Comfylovely ……. — and no , those are n’t ellipses I ’ve placed in for dramatic effect ; that ’s Comfylovely ’s listed last name — from the proud city of Davao in the historic state of XX .
That ’s not even the most disturbing part of the signatories .
The Israel Project lists the following as enthusiastic supporters of sanctioning Iran : Viagra Kaufen Viagra Kaufen , London , N.Y. ( signatory # 84,570 ) ; Porn Sex Video from London , N.Y. ( signatory # 62,751-62,756 ) ; Stupidwhiteman V , who declined to list an address ( signatory # 83,780 ) ; and Xbox 360 accessories — that ’s a first and last name — from New York , N.Y. ( signatory # 90,046 ) .
When I called Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi , the Israel Project ’s founder and president , she told me that the group “ emailed people who support our issues ” and asked them to sign ; those people then recruited contacts and colleagues to do the same .
Asked if the Project took any measures to verify that the names on the petition were genuine , Mizrahi replied , “ They ’re activists and they go through a secure thing .
We have 140,000 activists who work with us , so yes .
A lot of them have similar names , because they ’re related . ”
But when I read Mizrahi some of the dirtier signatories listed on her petition , she replied , “ Oh yuck , ” and said , “ I did n’t personally go through all of them , but they go through the system , so if they got in like that with that kind of email name , that ’s pretty horrible . ”
She elaborated , “ It ’s not like we called every person and verified ‘ are you the person . ’
But we emailed it through our usual activists . ”
Asked what this suggests about the Israel Project ’s vetting procedures , she replied , “ It suggests this is America and that in any country , there are always some people who are inappropriate . ”
Mizrahi subsequently emailed and called me to say that the Israel Project “ accidentally posted the wrong file ” and is in the process of replacing it with the correct one .
A bright spot for the organization ?
Mizrahi added that the petition itself has yet to be physically released to elected officials and religious leaders — the press release announcing the petition ’s large volume of signatories was sent first .
She thanked TWI for alerting her to the error .

Alex Fu and Siddharth Patel report from San Francisco on a building occupation at SFSU that ended in a police assault and dozens of arrests .
IN THE early morning hours of December 10 , police in full riot gear attacked a peaceful building occupation at San Francisco State University ( SFSU ) that was organized to protest budget cuts , furloughs for faculty and fee hikes .
The police broke into the business administration building through a window and proceeded to clear it with guns drawn , endangering the safety of all the activists .
Officers forced open doors from the inside and violently shoved aside students picketing the entrances on the outside , throwing some to the ground .
In all , 28 students were cited and released , on charges ranging from traffic citations , to failure to disperse , to trespass .
Clearly , the SFSU administration decided to both ignore the grievances of students and collude with police to violently remove them .
The occupation of the building began early Wednesday morning .
About 20 students barricaded themselves inside , declaring an end to " business as usual " and presenting a list of demands .
Hundreds of students came out to hold pickets at each of the building 's entrances throughout the day .
SFSU students linked arms and encircled the occupied business administration building ( Labor Video Project )
At the high point of the action , over 300 students formed a human chain that circled the building .
Cash - strapped students found ways to donate blankets , food and drinks to both the occupiers and those picketing outside .
Members of the community , faculty and staff came out to show support , and protest organizers from City College of San Francisco , University of California Berkeley and University of California Santa Cruz came to campus to participate in the solidarity actions .
Back at UC Berkeley , just over two weeks after 40 students occupied Wheeler Hall on the UC Berkeley campus , the building has been occupied again , this time by a larger group of students proclaiming an " open university . "
The occupation began on December 7 at around 2:30 p.m. when students took over the main auditorium in Wheeler and the entrance lobby , decorating both with banners and signs declaring the building to be liberated space .
An extensive schedule of teach - ins , study sessions and other events have been planned , and on Friday night , Boots Riley of The Coup is scheduled to perform .
What you can do Support the peaceful occupiers by calling the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Dr. J.E. Saffold at 415-338-2032 and demanding that all charges be dropped and no disciplinary action be taken against the protesters .
As a result of the drastic cuts to basic services throughout the UC system , the semester at UC Berkeley has been cut short by a week .
This final week has been renamed a " reading / review / recitation week " -- or more commonly , a " dead week . "
The protesters at Wheeler have called for students and workers to reclaim the week as a " live week " in a show of defiance to the administration , and as tangible proof that our universities can be run in the interests of all , and not just those of corporate fat cats and self - serving administrators .
The SFSU occupation took place in the midst of registration for spring classes , as more and more class sections have been cut and fees are increasing .
The idea that galvanized the very frustrated student population is the idea that if they take our classes , we 'll take their buildings .
" I came out because I support my friends who are a part of this , " said student Keri - Ann Oddman .
" I 'm probably going to get dropped from financial aid , and I 'm basically done with it .
It 's either action now , or they 're going to walk all over us . "
When some of the occupiers were released from detention , they spoke out .
" Today , we saw an increased excitement and involvement in student activism , " said senior Aaron Salazar .
" And that is what gave a lot of us our endurance to carry on .
From here , we need to take those people that showed up and plug them into organizations , so that this energy can grow and materialize into a victory for workers around the state . "
Freshman Napaquetzalli Martinez added : " The most inspiring part of the occupation was that it was part of the larger working - class struggle , not only about the cuts at our school . "
THE OCCUPATION was an important indicator of the campus mood as organizers move toward a day of strikes and protests to defend public education , set for next March 4 , and to involve not the UC and CSU system campuses , but teachers , parents and students in pre-K through 12th grade education .
At SFSU , mini-General Assemblies were held at each entry point to the occupied building , where ideas for March 4 were discussed .
The administration at SFSU has demonstrated that it has no desire to engage with students about even the most basic demands , such as restoring a several - thousand - dollar budget for the Ethnic Studies Student Resource and Empowerment Center .
The shameful fact is that many of these administrators enjoyed big raises on top of their large salaries and perk - packages over the past few years , even as classes have been cut , faculty and workers laid off , and fees hiked .
One important criticism of the occupation has come from faculty and students involved in the campus movement -- the action was organized in secret by a small group of activists , and intentionally excluding other leading campus activists .
The result was that the number of occupiers was small , and outside support had to be put together hastily .
This only made it easier for the police to break up the occupation .
Secondly , the occupation was organized on the same day as a planned SFSU General Assembly -- and actually caused its cancellation .
Dozens of students , faculty and staff had been planning for the general assembly as the next step in building a democratic , united movement on campus .
Building the General Assembly is still an urgent task -- the next one will take place on Wednesday , December 16 ( postponed from the previous week ) .
A united , democratic effort is the best hope of building for mobilizing students , faculty and staff to strike and shut down SFSU 's campus on March 4 -- and of moving beyond to get the budget cuts taken back .
( Note : if you hate the M - word in relation to Perl and the title did n't warn you off , you have only yourself to blame for reading beyond this paragraph . )
Some people hate Perl .
Some of them have good reasons .
More than you might think do n't , but you can't argue with these people .
( If they have n't used Perl in 15 years and still hate the language , the only two appropriate responses are ignoring and mocking . )
Some people hate or dislike or do n't care for Perl for good -- that is , measurable and technical - - reasons .
Arguing that they should like Perl is a futile activity , but discussing those reasons can be enlightening .
Some people do n't care for Perl for aesthetic reasons .
I have trouble reading Python code because my eyes slide off over the horizontal whitespace used to delimit blocks .
Some people cannot read or disambiguate leading sigils no matter how much they work .
Are n't brains interesting ?
Like all languages , Perl 5 has its drawbacks .
Some of those drawbacks contribute to negative perceptions of Perl .
Note that I 'm not suggesting that Perl 5 should or must change nor that any patches or designs are forthcoming or have any chance of acceptance in the Perl 5 core .
I merely document opinions I 've seen and heard when discussing Perl with people who do and do n't like the language .
Perl 5 Drawbacks Contributing to the Marketing Gap
It 's easy to write messy code in Perl 5 because the language and compiler does not encourage you to write clean code by default .
In this case , " messy " means " global variables " , automagic globals springing into existence upon first use , and action at a distance governed by global variables .
For example , all variables are global by default , unless you declare them as lexical .
I know Python and Ruby fans hate the idea of declaring variables ( though both languages still have the automagic vivification problem , even if limited to lexicals , not globals ) , but it solves the scoping problem .
Too rarely people wonder if changing the default scope of undeclared variables to lexical from global would have changed the way people wrote code in Perl 1 through 4 .
The package global action at a distance problem is obvious when you consider the many ways to inherit from a class in Perl 5 .
Where modifying @ Some : : Class :: ISA directly can pass for a metaobject system , it 's an ugly metaobject system .
I like Perl : : Critic and Perl : : Tidy for cleaning up bad code , but preventing people from writing bad code by encouraging them to write good code from the start seems like a better approach .
Similarly , I have only good things to say about Moose -- but it's an additional library that people have to install before they can use it .
( Kudos to the first extended Perl distribution which includes Moose and other Task : : Kensho modules by default . )
CPAN is indeed the best part of Perl 5 , but until CPAN distributions are as easy to install as the average PHP application is to deploy , I believe people will still see CPAN distributions as , at best , second class extensions with no guarantee of working together effectively or correctly .
Backwards compatibility is generally a good thing , but the fact that the Perl 5 parser can ( and has to continue to ) accept , silently , random garbage written fifteen years ago by someone with no business writing maintainable code is n't necessarily a benefit .
Yes , it 's good that Perl 5 does n't wantonly break working code , but when it costs 3 % of the Perl 5 parser to support a feature obsoleted by Perl 5 in 1995 , and when the replacement feature makes code simpler , more concise , and easier to read , it seems like a credible time to consider the cost of supporting old , obsolete features .
Perl has no Big Name Corporate Sponsor .
That can be a good thing -- Perl does n't depend on the whims and fortunes of any single company , but it also relies on the kindness and interests and free time of a collection of individuals for advocacy , development , testing , experimenting , polishing , and support .
Then again , volunteer Perl web sites have lately far surpassed the utility , attractiveness , and freshness of supposedly well - sponsored corporate sites .
I do n't even have to write about the abominable book , tutorial , and training material situation .
A handful of us scream into that void , but it 'll take some time before we can fill in that gap and erase the collective memory of Matt 's Script Archive from the Internet .
I know , I know -- mature , experienced Perl programmers know how to work around all of these problems .
They 're not problems if you 've written effective Perl for five years .
Put yourself in the shoes of a novice for a moment .
Forget that you know how to configure the CPAN client .
Forget that you know the difference between @ISA = ' Parent ' ; and use base ' Parent ' ; and use parent ' Parent ' ; .
Pretend that no one has told you that Perl 5 can catch your typos for you ( if you ask it ) or warn you about deprecated constructs ( if you ask it ) or recommend alternate approaches that are safer , more secure , more concise , more readable , and better supported ( if you install additional software and ask it ) .
In short , pretend that you want to write good , modern Perl 5 -- not Perl 4 -- and do n't know how .
How much time will you have to spend fighting the obvious battles before you realize what to do differently ?
( Before you start angrily telling me that PHP and Python and Ruby and Haskell and C # and who cares what else have similar problems , I do n't care , because I 'm not talking about that .
Feel free to have that discussion elsewhere . )
Next time : Perl benefits .

Uninterrupted , sustainable economic growth is impossible .
Those who support it are “ Impossibleists ” .
They practice , preach , and defend to the death at times , “ Impossibleism ” .
It is a universal phenomenon , practiced across economic , political , cultural , and social spectrums around the globe .
Impossibleism is an umbrella philosophy that captures the insanity of any system that is completely unsustainable and obviously so , but charges forward regardless .
Systemic insanity , if you will .
We are all living at the thin sharp point of always more , always bigger , always better , always new , improved and disposable .
That much should be obvious , even though it is not .
We want our homes to be worth more today than yesterday , we demand it to be so .
Prices must always fall , wages must always rise , and our wealth must always increase .
We must have more than our parents and we must ensure more again for our children .
Standing still is failure .
Going backwards is unthinkable .
This is simply impossible to sustain , we all know it , but we carry on regardless .
Impossibleism .
It ’s a math problem , or more correctly , it is our collective ignorance of natural forces , and the tyranny of arithmetic behind them .
In our civilized hubris , certainty is something malleable , something which we can and will in time conquer .
A war on 2+2=4 .
The inevitable as the enemy .
Invisible , exponential terrorists whose design it is to take away our cherished free markets , destroy our twin towers of freedom and democracy , and bust us all back to the dark ages before cars , coke , and plasma TV’s .
Absolutely nobody alive today wants that .
According to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , world output “ collapsed ” by 1.1 % in 2009 .
That data point the official manifestation of what everybody already knew — that our world was in trouble and we were living with less .
The value ( in US dollars ) of everything produced on our small blue planet in 2009 was about 60 trillion dollars — give or take a fish in Indonesia or the occasional bribe in Saudi Arabia .
The American GDP is about 14 trillion dollars , where a ham sandwich is about five bucks — for purposes of scale .
A contraction in production was both cause and effect of a serious economic “ meltdown ” , one which has squeezed our societies and cultures in fundamental and dramatic ways .
It was , and is , a catastrophe .
1.1 % it turns out , is a lot .
The IMF forecast for 2010 is much rosier , as they predict a “ return to growth ” of about 3.1 % .
The consensus is that this is a good thing of course , growth being the only acceptable state of affairs , and by any measure .
Absolutely nobody wants contracting production of stuff , nor do they want piddling increments of same .
No , we all alive today want increasing production of stuff and nothing less , Amen .
The only caution the IMF reserves is that our recovery is weak , and we must all be on our guard lest it slip back or sideways .
And again , Amen to that .
In fact , it wo n’t be long before we just simply assume , as we had before , that growth is the natural order of things and forget completely the lessons of the great economic collapse .
We will expect that growth is constant , and pay no heed to the annual IMF reports , just so much wallpaper in their dull , never changing prognosticating .
A constant line of 2 % growth our just reward for taming the earth and making it our own .
Sustainable growth as many economists say , sustainable in the “ we can keep this sucker moving ” kind of way , not in the antithetic “ can we keep this up ? ” heretical kind of way .
So we have a 60 trillion dollar world and it is n’t good enough it appears .
We want a bigger world , a better world , and 2 % a year should give it to us .
That ’s 2 % compounded of course — we want our 2 % added to our current amount of stuff , and we want this to happen every 365 times the earth rotates on its axis — per annum , once a year .
In 2010 , we will be expecting to produce about 1.8 trillion dollars worth of “ wealth ” above and beyond the 60 trillion we have now ( my apologies to economists who normally demand footnotes and qualifiers for this kind of thing .
You get the point regardless ) .
Maybe another 1.2 trillion or so the year after .
We could n’t be happier when our world GDP grows to 63 trillion USD ’s in just two years .
Good , sustainable progress we all can believe in , the effects of which we intuitively know will make us all healthier , happier , and richer .
A lot of us anyway , or at least those of us who matter .
What is a 63 trillion dollar world going to look like ?
More jobs , more cars , more I Pods and I Phones .
More people perhaps , more food we would expect , more industries and factories and technology .
More of everything : poverty , stress , and Hollywood plastic .
Three trillion does n’t seem much against sixty , and it seems manageable .
Certainly compared to a 120 trillion dollar world , which would be twice the amount of productivity we are churning out today .
It ’s much harder to imagine that .
Spend a day out in the workaday world we all inhabit , and we can see what 60 trillion dollars looks like .
Spend the same day trying to picture a 120 trillion dollar world … and it confounds the senses .
Of course , it is easy to forget that our current world is powered by the resources of the planet , and once reminded it makes for perfect common sense .
More cars , industry , and flip flops require more coal , iron , and oil .
It is reasonable to consider that a 3 trillion dollar increase in production worldwide will require additional stuff dug , scraped , or pumped out of the ground .
This is concerning to many , as there is common understanding that raping the earth is morally and ethically to be avoided .
We do it anyway of course , depending on our children to figure out a way to fix the imbalance for us .
But a 120 trillion dollar world ?
Twice the oil pumped at twice the rate , twice the fish killed at twice the rate , twice the consumption with twice the debt .
What about a 240 trillion dollar world ?
Four times the wealth , based on four times the resources our current world is built upon .
Four times the rate and amount of extraction and consumption of oil than today .
85 billion barrels of oil in 2008 , 340 billion barrels of oil consumed every day in a 240 trillion dollar world .
And rising by design .
Impossible .
Impossibleists want unrestrained sustainable growth in the face of its inevitable impossibility .
It is a mystery how they think this way , knowing as they surely do that eventually the bill will come due , and the engine will run out of gas — literally .
Think about it — growth that never stops , ever .
Even with limitless resources , it is simple intuition that eventually , somewhere , sometime … .
But of course we do n’t have infinite resources , another intuitive understanding even though it seems to us every day that we do .
We know we do n’t .
Impossibleists will not reconcile these two basic intuitions , that all growth must eventually end , and that all resources must eventually tap out .
Impossibleism is a form of insanity , a shared delusional neurosis .
It ’s a party game of trick or treat all humans are invited to , a game where treats are redeemed by us in the present , and tricks are reserved for the ghosts of future people we will not know , and of whom we do not care .
Not our children , nor theirs .
The legacy of Impossibleism is the certain destruction of the future , the hope of the Impossibleist that he will not have to face the damned .
Pop quiz .
How long will it take , at 2 % annual growth compounded , to turn our 60 trillion dollar world into a 120 trillion dollar world ?
35 years .
If we do exactly what we plan to do , and everything goes swimmingly , and we have sustainable growth of 2 % a year , our children will have a 120 trillion dollar world to deal with , and most of us alive today will live to see it .
Children today of ten years of age will be alive and drowning in a 240 trillion dollar world , which by deliberate and calculated design will arrive in a single lifetime of 70 years .
It ’s a tyrannical feature of unflinching math called “ doubling time ” , a feature of exponential growth hidden in plain view .
The future ghosts are not just real , they are alive today and are our very own children .
We have met — and love , and cherish , and protect — the very people we are cashing in the chits on , on whom we are knocking out the jams .
Think about it , we are nurturing the very people — people who carry our names , our genes , and paradoxically our dreams — who will watch and live in and deal with a world four times larger than our own .
We ourselves will breathe our last on a small blue planet that has to produce twice as much as today ’s planet .
Progress , as we all define it , is impossible to sustain .
Why ?
Leave the dogmas , politics , and bullshit aside and do the math .
That ’s why .
Impossibleism .
Santa Claus was prevented from giving presents to the imprisoned children of asylum seekers at the notorious Yarl 's Wood detention centre by private security guards .
Yarl 's
Wood is a privately run prison whose inmates are UK immigrants who arrived seeking asylum , but whose claims have been denied .
They are dragged out of bed in the dead of night and stuck in mesh - windowed vans without their belongings and without the chance to say goodbye to their loved ones , and then detained in terrible conditions that have been decried by human rights advocates , doctors , psychiatrists and other experts .
Their " crime " is trying to escape torture , privation , and disaster .
The rent - a- cops at Yarl 's Wood told the Anglican church 's leading expert on Father Christmas ( dressed in a Santa costume ) that he could n't enter the centre to give the children presents .
They also blocked the canon theologian at Westminster Abbey .
Then they cancelled a later scheduled visit with detained families at the centre .
And the whole mess is on video .
But when the Anglican church 's leading expert on Father Christmas , dressed as St Nicholas himself , arrived with one of Britain 's most distinguished clerics to distribute presents to children held at the Yarl 's Wood immigration removal centre in Bedfordshire , things took a turn straight out of Dickens .
An unedifying standoff developed that saw the security personnel who guard the perimeter fence prevent St Nicholas , the patron saint of children and the imprisoned , from delivering £ 300 worth of presents donated by congregations of several London churches .
In a red robe and long white beard , clutching a bishop 's mitre and crook , St Nick – in real life , the Rev Canon James Rosenthal , a world authority on St Nicholas of Myra , the inspiration for Father Christmas – gently protested that he was not a security threat , but to no avail .
Then as St Nicholas , accompanied by the Rev Professor Nicholas Sagovsky , canon theologian at Westminster Abbey , attempted to bless the gifts , the increasingly angry security guards called the police .
The resulting ill - tempered and surreal impasse between church and state was videotaped by asylum seeker support groups and could become an internet viral hit .
Anglican ' Santa ' barred from giving gifts to children at detainee centre
Thanks to a ballooning Federal fiscal deficit , Oliver Biggadike and Daniel Kruger of Bloomberg.com report that the chief fixed - income economist at Morgan Stanley believes the yield of 10 year U.S. Treasury will climb to 5.5 % in 2010 , which is about 40 % higher than the current yield . Â
( Click here to read their article in full ) .
This is pretty sobering news for the economic recovery , as many consumer and business loans , including many of the most popular types of mortgages , are tied to Treasury yields .
As these yields increase , the more expensive it becomes to borrow money , not just for the U.S. government , but for the Average Joe , as well .
Obviously , the more it costs to borrow money to finance a home purchase , the more likely we are to see the recovery in housing â€ “ and the economy in general â€ “ stall out .
However , this may be what is needed to get our countryâ€™s finances in order , and to help foster long - term , sustainable economic growth .
In order to truly get the deficit under control , lawmakers will likely have to attack the problem aggressively from both the revenue and expense side of the problem .
This means raising taxes â€ “ on everyone , not just the â€œwealthyâ€ â€ “ and cutting government spending .
Unfortunately , since both of these actions are political suicide â€ “ voters tend to not re-elect people who take more of their hard - earned money ( tax increase ) or pass legislation that hurts employment and curbs social programs ( spending cuts ) â€ “ Iâ€™m afraid the deficit wonâ€™t be addressed until itâ€™s too late .
At that point , welcome to the more painful second - leg of The Great Recession .
Dallas
THE Senate Finance Committee has for the moment rejected the idea of creating a public health insurance plan .
It ’s difficult to see how Americans will be able to find good , affordable health insurance without one .
But if we are to go forward without a public option , it is more important than ever to make sure that we get another part of health reform right : the exchanges , where it is envisioned that small businesses and people without employer - sponsored insurance could shop for policies of their own .
Back in the 1990s , I was the founding chairman of Texas ’ state - run purchasing alliance  an exchange , essentially  which ultimately failed .
There are lessons to be learned from that experience , as well as the similar failures of other states to create useful exchanges .
The Texas Insurance Purchasing Alliance , created by the Texas Legislature in 1993 , was meant to help small businesses , which often cannot afford coverage for their employees .
( More than half of all uninsured Americans work for small businesses . )
Small businesses are charged higher rates  on average 18 percent higher than those paid by large companies .
And their administrative costs , built into those premiums , are typically as high as 25 percent of the premium , compared to only 10 percent for big companies .
Our system pooled small employers into purchasing groups large enough to obtain the lower wholesale insurance rates that big companies get .
TALLAHASSEE , Fla . --
There are just over 100 people in the world serving sentences of life without the possibility of parole for crimes they committed as juveniles in which no one was killed .
All are in the United States .
And 77 of them are here in Florida .
On Monday , the Supreme Court will hear appeals from two such juvenile offenders : Joe Sullivan , who raped a woman when he was 13 , and Terrance Graham , who committed armed burglary at 16 .
They claim that the Eighth Amendment 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment forbids sentencing them to die in prison for crimes other than homicide .
Outside the context of the death penalty , the Supreme Court has generally allowed states to decide for themselves what punishments fit what crimes .
But the court barred the execution of juvenile offenders in 2005 by a vote of 5 to 4 , saying that people under 18 are immature , irresponsible , susceptible to peer pressure and often capable of change .
A ruling extending that reasoning beyond capital cases “ could be the Brown v. Board of Education of juvenile law , ” said Paolo G. Annino , the director of the Children 's Advocacy Clinic at Florida State University 's law school .
Judges , legislators and prosecutors in Florida agree that the state takes an exceptionally tough line on juvenile crime .

The Government ’s own report says it all .
The Northern Territory invasion is a failure .
Closing the Gap in the Northern Territory shows that far from reducing the major indicators of despair , the rates of violence , substance abuse and child abuse have increased .
School attendance rates have not changed at all .
Jenny Macklin , Labor ’s Indigenous Affairs Minister , says this is because of the higher police presence , ie saturation policing .
That may partly be true .
An alternative explanation is that the invasion has removed any sense of control over their own lives that Aboriginal people had and has driven them further into despair .
The invasion imposes compulsory income management on many communities .
The people there cannot spend their income on what they like .
The invasion imposes restrictions on alcohol availability , restrictions that if applied in any white suburb would have seen a revolt .
The invasion takes away the rights to land of some aboriginal communities .
Liberal Prime Minister John Howard developed the invasion strategy in response to the Little Children are Sacred Report .
That Report recommended comprehensive consultation with Aboriginal communities .
Howard ignored that recommendation , as have Labor in power .
The idea that you address the dispossession of Aboriginal people by micro-managing their lives and racially discriminating against them is a nonsense .
It flows from the racism the colonial settler state was founded on – that the land of aboriginal people was ours for the taking .
It also performs an important justificatory and reinforcing role for alienated labor – we are not the bottom of the pile ; we have power over others .
The reality is the opposite of course – the more the capitalist state imposes itself on Aboriginal people , the weaker we all are and the easier it is for capital to continue its exploitative rule over us .
So the flip side is that many workers and unions express solidarity with aboriginal people .
The union movement has a long history of support for aborigines in struggle .
Liberation from above – from Afghanistan to Iraq and now the Northern Territory – is a failed philosophy .
Liberation of the oppressed flows from the struggles of the oppressed .
Northern Territory aborigines are fighting back .
As Jerome Small says in Tour builds solidarity for Aboriginal walk off :
In July , Aboriginal people walked off the government - controlled community of Ampilatwatja in the Northern Territory .
Protesting against years of racism and government neglect , the people of Ampilatwatja ( pronounced “ umblud - witch ” ) have established a permanent protest camp , vowing not to return to a life under government control .
Richard Downs and Harry Jakamarra Nelson toured the country helping get the message about the racist invasion and aboriginal resistance out to the wider Australian community .
The invasion is racist .
Howard made sure that the Racial Discrimination
Act did n’t apply .
Labor promised it would remove that restriction by October this year ( almost 2 years after they won power ) but that deadline has come and gone .
The delay is because Labor wants to give the impression of removing racial discrimination while keeping its substance .
Such sleight of hand is proving difficult to develop legislatively .
Here is what some community members are saying .
We were asked which brand of compulsory income management we would like , what kind of alcohol controls or police powers .
But communities have said many times we want and end to all racist control measures .
Taking away what little power aboriginal people have does n’t empower them ; it furthers their disempowerment , dispossession and despair .

Workers employed in low - wage and poorly regulated industries ( most prominently restaurants , residential construction , domestic cleaning , and mechanics ) are confronted with staggering exploitation as employers look to cut corners in today ’s recession .
Such exploitation includes health and safety violations , discrimination , sexual harassment , retaliation , firing for participating in union activity , and wage theft — failure to pay workers for work performed , including overtime hours and final pay periods .
To combat this wave of illegality , a Chicago worker center has collaborated with a local university to create a map of law - breaking employers against which they have organized , giving workers and activists a powerful visual tool to bring to politicians and the community .
The Arise Chicago Worker Center has no shortage of evidence for the dire conditions facing Chicago ’s low - wage workers , having collaborated with over 2,050 workers in the past seven years .
None of the restaurant workers who have contacted our organization during that time received overtime wages .
One of our members seriously injured his back at a construction site , but his employer refused to pay legally required workers ’ compensation .
One African - American member , who works for a state - funded social service agency , has consistently received paychecks one to three weeks late , for more than two years .
A group of candy manufacturers were denied bathroom breaks .
Recently , we spoke with a Guatemalan immigrant car wash worker who works from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. , six days a week , for $ 5.25 an hour .
He does not receive overtime pay and takes home an average of $ 9 a day in tips .
If that were n't enough , the employer does not provide gloves needed for the work , and illegally deducts the cost of the workers ' required uniform from his paychecks .

With the help of the University of Illinois - Chicago Center for Urban Economic Development , Arise has mapped by ward — a political district — the law - breaking employers against which Arise has organized .
The maps illustrate law - breaking employers in 43 of Chicago ’s 50 wards , affecting workers living in 47 of the wards .
Groups of worker center members plan to meet with their ward aldermen to discuss workplace abuses and enlist support for a city response to the biggest problem facing low - wage workers : wage theft .
Clergy whose congregations are located in the 43 wards will join the workers .
Recently , Catholic Bishop John Manz attended a meeting with Alderman Danny Solis in the 25th Ward , where Arise has recorded a dozen labor violations .
Solis committed to introducing the issue to the city council ’s Hispanic Caucus , whose wards include great concentrations of Arise membership .
Alderman Mary Ann Smith ’s office offered to explore legislative strategies that could deny additional business permits to law - breaking employers .
Additional meetings and research are planned to determine the best approach to address wage theft in Chicago — which may include a citywide ordinance that could make stealing a worker 's wages treated like other forms of theft .

Terrifying the public can be a dodgy undertaking nowadays , and in fin de siecle America it 's not hard to see why .
After a formulaic procession of quotidian disaster flicks such as Asteroid , Deep Impact , and Volcano , audiences seem to be rendered catatonic by catastrophe .
NBC's Y2 K , airing Sunday at 9 p.m. , falls just as flat .
Technical glitches and Y2 K woes are an unconvincing pretext for what turns out to be a rather pedestrian action movie , in which our Hero Designate ( Thirtysomething 's Ken Olin as Nick Cromwell ) must pull the plug on a Seattle nuclear power plant before it vomits radioactive detritus over much of North America .
Bonus incentive :
His daughter and wife are downwind .
Sound familiar ?
It should .
Anyone who 's suffered through similar brink - of - the - apocalypse flicks knows what happens next .
( It 's no coincidence that the movie 's executive producer is David Israel , creator of the even more banal viral - terror miniseries Pandora 's Clock . )
In fact , the most interesting thing about Y2 K might be the buzz .
Can fictitious depictions of a jet screaming toward the Potomac River , blackouts spreading from Virginia to Canada , and cash machines not doing what they 're told panic Americans ?
Without even seeing the two - hour movie , industry groups have become as jittery as Bill Gates near a pie factory .
The Edison Electric Institute – a trade association representing the big power companies – has repeatedly asked TV stations not to air it .
" It is our hope that your station might be willing to consider alternative programming that evening , " EEI wrote in a letter to all NBC affiliates .
Bankers got queasy , too .
" We strongly urge you to pull this movie , " the Independent Community Bankers of America wrote in a letter to NBC .
The network did not return phone calls .
But they should n't worry .
It 's not particularly likely that NBC would air a movie that would incite a riot at the local supermarket – " cause the herd to stampede , " in typically unflattering Y2 Kese – and anyway , in the end , Cromwell manages to stave off disaster .
That 's an ending sure to disappoint both computer buffs hoping for a sober discussion of the risks of unreliable technology , and Y2 Kers who have busied themselves stockpiling guns , gold , and grain – while hoping for a movie that would demonstrate to their family that it is n't entirely nutty to stuff one 's attic with bulk beans and rice .
It wo n't be this one .
Y2 K shows us one too - stereotypical survivalist busy girding his suburban ranch home with barbed wire .
He gets shot by US Army soldiers .
But the biggest problem with the movie is n't its hackneyed approach to storytelling , which is no worse than similar efforts in the genre .
It 's not even the predictable onslaught of horrors designed to play on human fears :
Missing children , airplane crashes , problems giving birth , getting lost in a rowdy New York City crowd , blackouts , riots , and martial law .
No , it 's the sheer implausibility of the last few minutes that should make any rational person irritable .
If a nuclear plant in Sweden really did contaminate " millions " of acres of Europe and Asia and there really were blackouts that left half of the United States paralyzed and open to looting and riots , why is that a happy ending ?
Unlike women , men are not generally brought up to express their emotions or ask for help .
This can be especially problematic for new fathers , since the prospect of parenthood carries all kinds of insecurities :
What kind of father will I be ?
Can I support my family ?
Is this the end of my freedom ?
And there is probably more to male postpartum depression than just social or psychological stress ; like motherhood , fatherhood has its own biology , and it may actually change the brain .
A 2006 study on marmoset monkeys , published in the journal Nature Neuroscience , reported that new fathers experienced a rapid increase in receptors for the hormone vasopressin in the brain ’s prefrontal cortex .
Along with other hormones , vasopressin is involved in parental behavior in animals , and it is known that the same brain area in humans is activated when parents are shown pictures of their children .
There is also some evidence that testosterone levels tend to drop in men during their partner ’s pregnancy , perhaps to make expectant fathers less aggressive and more likely to bond with their newborns .
Given the known association between depression and low testosterone in middle - aged men , it is possible that this might also put some men at risk of postpartum depression .
By far the strongest predictor of paternal postpartum depression is having a depressed partner .
In one study , fathers whose partners were also depressed were at nearly two and a half times the normal risk for depression .
That was a critical finding , for clinicians tend to assume that men can easily step up to the plate and help fill in for a depressed mother .
In fact , they too may be stressed and vulnerable to depression .
And there is the child to think about .
Research has clearly shown that maternal postpartum depression can impair the emotional and cognitive development of infants .
A father could well buffer the infant from some of the adverse effects of maternal depression  but that is a tall order if he too is depressed .
Skunk , the powerful form of cannabis dominating the street drug market , is seven times more likely to cause psychosis than ordinary cannabis , scientists say .
Dr Marta Di Forti and Prof Robin Murray , who are among the authors of today 's paper published in the British Journal of Psychiatry , say skunk is now the same price as ordinary cannabis on the streets of south London , where the study was carried out , and is now the one that is easiest for young people to obtain .
The researchers at the Institute of Psychiatry in London analysed the cannabis consumption of 280 people who were admitted with a first episode of psychosis to the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust , and compared them with 174 healthy people from the area .
Those who used skunk were almost seven times more likely than ordinary cannabis users to develop psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia , they found .
" In the last five to six years it has been established that there is a link between heavy cannabis consumption and psychosis , but there is a lot of argument about how important it is , " said Murray .
Most cannabis users remain healthy , he said , but he pointed to the growing takeover in the street markets of skunk , which contain 18 % THC , the substance thought to trigger psychosis , compared with about 4 % in cannabis resin ( hash ) .
Forti said 80 % of the cannabis sold on the streets of south - east London was now skunk .
People who use skunk do not necessarily appreciate its toxicity , she said .
Those in the study had an average age of 25 .
Those who had psychotic attacks heard voices and had paranoid delusions , such as a conviction that neighbours or family were conspiring against them .
About 1 % of the population suffer psychosis at some time in their life .
Studies have shown the risk of psychosis doubles in those who use cannabis a few times .
When I run my D&D 4e game I use a random encounter generator .
I look at the stats for the various monsters , and I then put those monsters into the game .
This might result in a zombie , some lizard people , a classic magical beast , and a handful of human minions being the encounter .
If the PCs decide to travel into the woods that evening these monsters are suddenly re-skinned as various wild elves with a strange fey creature that acts as a watch dog .
If the PCs head into the city this encounter becomes a group of bandits , a necromancer who has hired them , and the enchanted beast that serves at his side .
I do not care what the monster ’s name is .
I am not going to spend hours designing the perfect encounter for the woods , and then even more time on an encounter for the city .
The only thing I care about is if the encounter is correct for the party ’s level .
I even generate random treasure and just come up with a plausible reason for why it is there ( wherever there is ) .
I do throw in one custom chosen magic item per session for a particular PC , but as long as the treasure is appropriate for the party ’s level I am happy .
This is how I prep for a highly structured game like D&D .
For a more subjective game like Fudge I prep by practicing several different accents and mannerisms to generate an NPC on the fly with .
I read essays on the classic works from the genre that we will most likely be playing that session ( with Fudge you never know ) , and I analyze what are the common story elements used within those works .
I do not plan the details for my games .
I have a general idea of where the plot will most likely go , but there is really very little that I nail down as absolutes before the session begins .
That is not to say that details do not matter .
My games have a lot of details .
I just do not plan them .
I improvise them and add them to my notes so as not to forget them as the game progresses .
So while my prep notes might say “ treasure : artwork , 350 gold pieces ” , my in game notes say “ PCs found a portrait of the murdered Baron ’s wife .
Artist ’s signature is that of the suspected villain . ”
I started GMing like this when I realized that my strength as a GM was reacting to the players , and not in world building .
Some people can create very detailed worlds and adventures easily .
I cannot .
It is difficult for me to write up even a few pages of material for my games .
Where I am strong as a GM is in deciphering what is going to be the most fun for the players based on the moment .
My plots are never set in stone .
My encounters are merely the frameworks of the opponents until the very last minute when I suddenly apply the outer layer right before the PCs “ stumble ” across them .
The words “ Clue found . ” in my prep notes become “ The stable boy is dying in your arms , but with his dying breath he whispers the name Elandra . ”
Who is Elandra ?
I usually have no idea until the next session .
You may not be comfortable with trying to GM like I do .
I am not suggesting that anyone else use my style .
What I am suggesting is that you might find it useful to not include all of the details when you are preparing for your next session as the GM .
Players have a way of negating a GM ’s highly detailed plans with unexpected tactics and approaches .
GMs sometimes miss chances to enhance a game based on the players ’ input at the table because the GM has a plan already laid out .
Yet GMing is a form of performance art , and that means you have to react to your audience .
Like a great jazz musician you need to practice your art , but you cannot know for sure what the music will sound like when you go to jam with others .
You just have to roll with it .
My advice to you is pretty simple : try to prepare your next session with a little less detail than what you need during the actual game .
Do not try to plan every description , scene , or even the encounters .
Instead leave a few gaps for you to fill in on the fly .
When the time comes to fill in those details ask “ What details will make this more fun for my players right now ? ”
Then roll with whatever pops into your head at that moment and right that down in your notes immediately .
You will probably make a few mistakes , but I am confident you will make less mistakes the next time .
You will eventually find the right balance between planning and improvising for your style of GMing , and that is just one more tool you will have developed for many game sessions to come .
In other words , forget the details of the plan and pay attention to the details of the game being played .
What about your GMing style ?
How much detail do you prepare for your games ?
Leave your comments below to share with myself and others , and remember that the GM is a player too .
Have fun with it !
Every few weeks , someone emails me a link to this bike .
It ’s one of the most famous BMW boxers on the net .
But it ’s also widely reported , so I ’ve been resisting the temptation to feature it , until now .
What ’s so special about it ?
The objective was to “ build a cafe racing boxer that was both pleasing to look at and inspiring to ride . ”
The bike was bought for just $ 950 and then virtually destroyed after a 70 mph tankslapper ; since then , everything has been heavily modified by master builder Scott Kolb .
A ’92 R100GS provided a new frame — thoroughly cross- braced , lightened and strengthened — plus the paralever and transmission .
The engine is mildly tuned , running a 9.5:1 compression ratio , a 336 BMW sport cam , 44 mm intakes , titanium retainers and 40 mm Dell ’ Orto carbs .
The seven - gallon asymmetrical tank , nine months in the making , came from Scotland .
The top clamp is from an early Ducati 851 .
And the seat is a Harley XR750 number from Airtech .

It is really fun and uplifting to see Schiff talk and relate to people on the campaign trail …

The hidden costs of the Afghan escalation
Whatever numbers you hear about the cost of Obama ’s escalation in Afghanistan are bound to be low .
Once you add in veterans ’ benefits , the long - term costs of medical treatment for wounded soldiers , replacement costs for the equipment they will use up and wear out , etc. , you end up with a lot more than the extra $ 30 billion that Obama mentioned in his speech on Tuesday .
If you want to be prudent , assume that the true costs are at least twice what you ’ve heard .
Together with the money already allocated , it ’s going to be well in excess of $ 100 billion per year .
Keep that in mind the next time you pass a rusting bridge , or when your local School Board has to cut its budget and lay off a few more teachers .
But there is another cost to digging in deeper in Afghanistan .
Obama has now bet the future of his presidency on being able to achieve something he can describe as “ success ” there , and he has only 18 months to do it .
He ’s shackled with a sluggish economy that is unlikely to turn around soon , so there are going to be plenty of disaffected voters by 2012 .
The Dems are going to lose a bunch of seats in the midterms , making it even tougher to pass domestic legislation that might win broad voter approval .
And having alienated a lot of the people who worked their butts off for him in 2008 ( because they thought he would be different ) , he ’s going to have a hard time generating the sort of grass roots enthusiasm that won him the White House in the first place .
Progressive Dems wo n’t switch sides , but some of them will stay home .
He may even have trouble getting Shepard Fairey ’s endorsement if Afghanistan does n’t turn around fast .
All this means that Obama will have to devote a lot of time and attention and political capital to the war in Afghanistan , an impoverished land - locked country of modest strategic importance .
Meanwhile , life will go on in the rest of the world , and U.S. relations with a number of far more important countries will not receive the attention they should .
Here are three examples .
1 . The new Japanese government is actively rethinking its security partnership with the United States , and while I do n’t think we should rush to accommodate all of their concerns , we certainly ought to be paying very close attention .
But having just returned from a quick Asian trip , Obama is likely to put relations with Japan ( and other key Asian allies ) on the back burner .
That would be a mistake , because a significant erosion in the U.S. position there would have far more significant effects than the outcome of the Afghan campaign .
Mapping out a long - term security strategy for Asia will take time and attention , and that ’s precisely what Obama does n’t have right now .
2 . The democratic government of Turkey has been carving out a more independent and influential position at the crossroad of Europe and Asia .
Its recent decision to reject Israeli participation in a scheduled NATO military exercise ( which led to the exercise being canceled ) is one sign of this new independence , as is its more active engagement with Syria and Iran .
This development is not necessarily a bad thing , if Turkey uses its growing influence constructively .
But it is a new feature of the global scene that calls for sustained attention and a nuanced U.S. response , and I ’ll bet it does n’t get either .
3. Brazil is becoming a more independent and less deferential power here in the Western hemisphere .
President Lula da Silva has opened more than 30 embassies around the world since 2003 , remains on good terms with Venezualan strongman Hugo Chavez , has defended Iran ’s nuclear research program , and recently hosted Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Brasilia .
Obama and Lula have exchanged letters on some of these issues , and Brasilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has said there is “ no crisis ” between the two countries .
But he has also said that the two countries “ are in different latitudes ” and “ must get used to disagreeing . ”
A stronger and more assertive Brazil will also create new diplomatic opportunities for other Latin American countries ( who have long resented U.S. dominance in the Western hemisphere ) , as well as opportunities for other great powers .
And might this herald a gradual erosion of the Monroe Doctrine ?
None of the developments poses an immediate threat to vital U.S. interests , but all could use some adroit attention on Washington ’s part and a sophisticated strategy for dealing with them .
But my guess is that they will get short shrift , because Obama ’s attention and a lot of the intellectual oxygen in Washington will be sucked up by the endless debate on AfPak .
You might reply that I ’m being too pessimistic , because Obama has a talented administration that is deep in foreign policy expertise and nobody expects the President to do everything himself .
He can turn these problems over to DoD , the NSC staff , and the State Department while he focuses laser - like on Central Asia ( and the economy ) .
I wish I could believe that , but I have n’t seen much evidence of a smoothly running foreign policy apparatus so far .
What I read suggests that the White House holds tight control on the main lines of policy , and apart from the president himself ( who does show occasional flashes of strategic vision ) , I still ca n’t figure out who ’s in charge of the big picture .
So in addition to the human and financial costs of the decision to escalate in Afghanistan , throw in the opportunity costs .
There are only 24 hours in a day and seven days in a week , and a lot of important issues are going to get less attention than they deserve .

LONDON : Baroness Sayeeda Warsi , a Tory lawmaker and one of the most powerful British women politicians faced the ire of fundamentalist men when they pelted eggs on her , claiming she was not a proper Muslim .
Warsi , a member of House of Lords of Pakistani origin , was confronted by the fundamentalist while she was campaigning in Luton , a London suburb who started shouting abuses at her , according to British Television reports .
The protesters took objection and charged that the Baroness was not properly attired and that she supported the death of Muslims in Afghanistan .
But Warsi , stood her ground and challenged the men to a debate on their charges .
But the group of men refused to listen to her .
The television footage showed egg in her hair and on her jacket , and the Baroness later described the men as " a bunch of idiots " who did not represent the Muslims in Britain .
Warsi is a member of the British House of Lords and also a member of the Tory Shadow Cabinet .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The recession has slashed U.S. output of planet warming gases and puts the country on track to reach President Barack Obama ’s short - term emissions goal , but cutting the pollution further will take more effort as the economy recovers .

“ Losing weight by starving is different than shedding pounds through exercise , ” said Kevin Book , an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners , LLC .
He said as the economy recovers electricity demand should rise , pushing up emissions from that sector .
That will require the world ’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China to move faster to low - carbon sources like renewable energy if Obama ’s short - term goal is to be met , he said .
Obama is expected to pledge next week at a U.N. climate meeting in Copenhagen that the United States will cut output of gases blamed for warming the planet , including carbon dioxide , roughly 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 .
On Tuesday the Energy Information Administration said in a monthly outlook that U.S. carbon dioxide output in 2009 will fall about 6.1 percent to 5.45 billion tonnes as the recession cuts demand for coal used to generate electricity .
That was about 8.9 percent below the 2005 level of 5.98 billion tonnes , putting the U.S. on track , at least for now , to reach Obama ’s goal .
Carbon dioxide emissions represent about 80 percent of overall U.S. greenhouse gas output .
A small increase in emissions could begin to show as early as next year , however .
In 2010 , the EIA said , U.S. carbon emissions are expected to rise 1.5 percent to 5.53 billion tonnes as the economy recovers .
Coal consumption by U.S. electricity generators fell nearly 12 percent for the first nine months of 2009 , as the recession cut power demand .
But emissions also were reduced by greater generation from lower - emission sources such as natural gas , hydropower and wind power , the EIA said .
Analysts said the United States need to speed up its moves toward a low - carbon economy .
“ We have a drop in emissions as a result of the recession , but that does not mean that future cuts will come easily , ” said Tim Cheung , an analyst at New Energy Finance in New York .
“ Those will have to come from somewhere , such as the electricity or industrial sectors . ”
U.S. emissions jumped steadily from 1990 to just before the recession .
In May the EIA said U.S. energy - related carbon dioxide output had jumped nearly 16 percent from 1990 to 2008 .
During his presidential campaign , Barack Obama repeatedly called for expanding the war in Afghanistan .
Be careful what you wish for .
The bells of Afghanistan echo the Vietnam War .
Like then , we have a powerful military establishment linked to civilian foreign and defense intellectuals clamoring for an expansive military adventure to protect us from an onrushing enemy .
The pressure on President Barack Obama to substantially increase troop levels in Afghanistan is enhanced by a high - powered , hardly subtle campaign .
Vietnam cost more than 50,000 Americans killed in action , hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese dead or missing , untold numbers of maimed and wounded on both sides , and incalculable American treasure .
Afghanistan promises to be as long and as expensive .
Tension and conflict between the military high command and the Obama administration over Afghanistan are obvious .
Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , in August described the Afghanistan security situation as “ serious ” and “ deteriorating . ”
Less than a month later , he told a Senate panel that “ probably ” more troops were needed .
Mullen ’s remarks prefaced the report of Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the field commander in Afghanistan .
Predictably , McChrystal has called for 45,000 more troops .
And equally predictable , his “ confidential ” report to his commander in chief was leaked to The Washington Post , using none other than Bob Woodward , the serial conduit for power holders ( or grabbers ? ) .
Who leaked and why is a mindless Beltway parlor game ; the simple answer will do :
The leak clearly is designed to pressure President Obama .
McChrystal paints an impressive analysis of the war in Afghanistan and the shortcomings of our counterinsurgency responses .
He suggests that failure is certain if he is denied additional troops .
His report has been in circulation for nearly a month , yet the president has maintained that he will withhold a decision until he has charted a clear course .
The White House take is that the United States must define its strategy before making any further commitment .
McChrystal and other military leaders , however , will apparently have none of that .
The report ’s conclusions are stated in urgent terms , citing the imminent danger of a Taliban triumph .
Indeed , reports of the Taliban ’s increasing successes mount , but that only draws into question whether an expanded military effort can do much to stem the tide against a Kabul government that is inept , corrupt and lacking of popular support .
Meanwhile , the Taliban freely uses the soil of our ally Pakistan as a sanctuary and launching pad .
Some ally .
Gen. David Petraeus , head of Central Command , weighed in with support for McChrystal ’s recommendations .
The generals are post - Vietnam , anxious to prove they are more adept in counterinsurgency .
They have also learned to operate more effectively in the domestic political arena .
They are not Gen. William Westmoreland .
Important civilian voices have lent their support , apparently well informed of the military ’s thinking .
Condoleezza Rice again has warned that if we abandon Afghanistan , we invite further terrorist attacks , reminding one of the dire “ mushroom cloud ” warnings she made before the Iraq debacle .
More ominously , Sen. John McCain soldiers on .
Following the leak of McChrystal ’s report , he attacked a “ disconnect ” between the military and the White House , as if the president is constitutionally , perhaps divinely , mandated to follow wherever the military leads .
Since McCain campaigned for the presidency in 2008 as being best qualified to serve as commander in chief , he should know that the constitutional phrase asserts civilian supremacy .
When Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon confronted unsound or incorrect military advice , McCain was a POW in Vietnam , unmindful of civilian - military clashes over Vietnam .
Today , with the hindsight of history , we can look back over those conflicts and see that the wiser course was all too apparent .
Clearly McCain in his certitude does not .
We will not hear much dissent among the political elite from McChrystal ’s recommendations , aside from the usual array of war critics .
But what is at work here is that vague , almost incalculable force : public opinion .
Polls now reflect diminishing public support for our involvement and a corresponding increase in opposition .
The Afghanistan war has been difficult and long .
McChrystal knows it will be even longer and more difficult — but he promises light at the end of the tunnel .
Old idea , new garb .
The president is in a bind of his own making .
How ironic .
His campaign attempts to show his toughness have come back to bite him .
Where were progressive voices then ?
In their zeal to pile on George W. Bush and Dick Cheney , they offered few criticisms of their own candidate , who eagerly promised to pursue a similar policy , only better .
The futility of that approach should have been evident , but candidate Obama got a free ride .
Obama inherited an imperial America ; he also inherited the need to maintain it with military force .
In the meantime , whatever the wisdom or viability of McChrystal ’s military solution , his mission seems predicated on maintaining a corrupt , ineffective regime in Kabul .
Or is it ?
McChrystal has not said anything on the subject , but does he have contingency plans for supporting a coup in Afghanistan ?
We should remember the futility of coups we sponsored in South Vietnam that resulted only in still another incompetent general .
If Obama rejects McChrystal ’s call for more troops , and carries on an inconclusive war interminably , he will have to shoulder the blame and carry the burden of “ we told you so ” barbs .
The right , determined for the president ’s policy initiatives to fail , enthusiastically urges a more expansive war .
But that is not to suggest a moratorium on its criticism .
Obama has little wiggle room ; he cannot continue the war he already has expanded without imperiling his presidency .
Time is not his ally .

Apache Open For Business ( OFBiz ) offers an amazing amount of functionality across a wide variety of business processes .
The scope of OFBiz , as with most ERP systems , is very broad — including e-commerce , inventory and order management , accounting , manufacturing , and much more .
As you consider all of the ground covered by OFBiz , it follows that any given OFBiz system is likely to encounter other systems with which it needs to gracefully interact .
3rd party integrations can sometimes become very complex .
For my post today , however , let ’s consider a few simple example together : we will look at three types of integrations commonly used by online e-tailers running OFBiz direct - to - consumer e-commerce storefronts .
There are many ways that HotWax Media helps our customers drive traffic to their e-commerce sites , including various SEO ( search engine optimization ) and PPC ( pay per click ) tactics , but we will leave detailed discussions of those tactics for a separate post .
For our example today , our story begins with a visitor arriving at the OFBiz e-commerce storefront .
Upon arriving at the merchant ’s OFBiz e-commerce site , the visitor browses products .
There are some really effective merchandising features available with OFBiz , including cross-sell , up - sell , layered navigation , promotions , and so forth .
As our visitor navigates the site and finds the products she wants , she adds them to her shopping cart .
Eventually , she has her cart loaded up and is ready to checkout .
Using OFBiz , HotWax Media creates completely custom checkout experiences for our customers .
One - page checkout , split shipments , anonymous checkout , coupon codes — it ’s all available through OFBiz .
There are , however , additional 3rd party checkout options that are also available .
So these will be our first examples of 3rd party integrations available with OFBiz .
OFBiz Payment / Checkout Integrations
Google Checkout and PayPal Express checkout are both available to OFBiz merchants .
The idea with these 3rd party checkout services ( as with most concepts in online retail ) is to boost conversion rates .
This works well for users who already have established checkout preferences .
For example , if our site visitor prefers PayPal Express , she simply selects that checkout option , enters her PayPal username and password , chooses her shipping method , and she is done .
The benefit is that she may have saved a minute or two , and presumably she is comfortable with PayPal and confident in the quality of her purchase transaction .
OFBiz Shipping Integrations
We mentioned shipping , and this is our next example of 3rd party integration options .
Unless our merchant is exclusively selling digital products that are downloaded by the end user , he needs to offer shipping options in order to fulfill his orders .
Using OFBiz , HotWax Media offers many integration options with 3rd party shipping services .
The idea is to make this as simple as possible for the shopper by allowing her to see custom , real - time shipping costs ( based on her shipping address ) from a variety of carriers and allow her to select her preferred method .
Shipping integrations available with HotWax Media and OFBiz include the biggest names in shipping , such as FedEx , UPS , USPS , and DHL .
We also offer more specialized integrations with Endicia ( includes USPS support ) and Oagis Shipping .
( As of December 2009 , Endicia ( with USPS support ) , UPS WorldShip , and a more complete FedEx integration are currently not offered out - of - the - box with OFBiz , but are available through HotWax Media . )
These 3rd party shipping integrations allow our online merchant to control rate display in the user ’s shopping cart ( using real time shipping rate quotes that the merchant can then adjust as needed — see screenshot above ) .
Once the order is picked and packed , the merchant can automatically print shipping labels , email a tracking number and shipment confirmation to the customer , and more .
OFBiz Payment Gateway Integrations
Finally it is time to submit the order and process payment .
Our visitor has her products in her cart , has selected her shipping method , and has entered her payment information .
She clicks “ Submit Order , ” and this is where the payment gateway comes in .
Using OFBiz , HotWax Media offers integrations with a variety of 3rd party payment gateways .
The industry leaders are PayPal , Authorize.net , and Orbital , so we generally recommend one of these .
These integrations offer credit card processing along with fraud monitoring , scoring , order separation for manual review , and many other useful features for our online merchant .
The order is submitted , the card is processed , and there you have it — e-commerce !
That was just a simple example of a very common e-commerce use case that makes use of a few 3rd party integrations .
Of course , there are many other 3rd party integrations available using OFBiz , such as multi-channel sales ( eBay , Amazon , etc. ) , single sign - on ( Crowd ) , and integrations with other systems like Magento .
I plan to address many of these in future posts .
In the mean time , for a more complete list of 3rd party integrations available from HotWax Media / OFBiz , take a look at our 3rd Party OFBiz Integrations page .
Computing Thoughts
I Believe in Design
by Bruce Eckel
November 19 , 2009
Summary
I finally bought a Dyson vacuum cleaner yesterday .
It completely changes my cleaning experience .
Design that asks and answers the right questions can completely change other experiences , too .
Advertisement
Whoever imagined exceptional designs from Britain , the land of government , banking , and consistency ?
But anytime the subject of cleaning came up , anyone within earshot who had a Dyson would wax enthusiastic about it .
These people love their Dysons , and want to loan them to you so you 'll try it out .
A viral marketer in their wettest of dreams never hopes for this kind of result .
Dysons apparently last forever , and I do n't plan on buying another one until ( A ) they make a cordless one with an ultracapacitor and / or ( B ) they make a robotic one .
I suspect ( B ) will follow from ( A ) , and also that it will likely be Dyson that will do it .
The machine has all kinds of clever ways that the tubes and attachments connect and store , but in the end it 's just vacuuming .
However , it 's very different from all the vacuums you 've bought before ( because they kept breaking , or the new ones kept making seductive promises ) .
It does what all vacuums claim to do : you move the device over your floor and it picks up dirt .
The difference is , it actually works .
You 're not fighting to make the vacuum do its job , by running it over the same place trying to get it to pick stuff up .
Because you 've never experienced it before , there is a feeling of rightness when it pulls itself over the carpet leaving it clean in one pass .
I 'm giving away all the other floor - cleaning tools except for the mop .
This makes me think of the way business works ( lots of things do , lately ) .
If over 80 % of people hate their jobs ( as I keep hearing ) , then business is like a vacuum cleaner that has lots of bells and whistles but does n't actually suck things up very well .
We still believe in the concept of vacuuming , and assume that it 's operator error or that numerous other cleaning devices are natural in order to fill the gaps .
Of course , that 's only if you think that " happiness " should be the goal of work .
But even if " making money " is the goal , I still think our current business models work like most of the vacuums work -- you keep scrubbing the machine over the same piece of carpet and eventually , if you 're persistent , it gets a bit cleaner .
People seem to feel that , if it makes enough money for the business to survive , the business model is vindicated .
We 've been trained from birth to believe that American Capitalism is the pinnacle of right - thinking business ; so much so that if you question it you 're labeled crazy .
Of course , during the dot - com bubble , brokers who did n't kowtow to the idea of The New Economy were often fired .
And some people still cling to the idea that real estate is the sacrosanct Field of Dreams , that the only problem with the industry is that we 've stopped building , and , shades of the New Economy , supply and demand does n't apply here .
It 's true : if a business does n't make money , it fails .
It 's also true that if you stop eating , you 'll starve .
We 've seen what happens when our sole goal is to consume as many calories as possible , or when body cells decide that their goal is to grow uncontrollably .
But no appropriate moderation exists in our business models ; if you can make more money , then of course that 's the right path .
A friend who owns a business recently wrote about how things were n't working , mostly from key employees quitting so she was forced to fill in .
The company is making money , but it has n't been a pleasant experience for her .
I keep thinking that there must be some way to redesign the structure of our businesses so that the first priority is that you love your job .
I have a strong suspicion that such a company would be a lot more financially successful as a consequence .
I can't prove it , but I think if people love their jobs then the company will do far better than competing companies where people hate their jobs .
The problem with revolutionary thinking is that , by definition , it goes against everything we " know " to be true .
Open Spaces conferences are like this , as are many of the TED talks .
When I learned about Open Spaces , that form had been created and tested by someone else , and I reluctantly tried it under experimental conditions -- certain it would fail , because of what I " knew " about conferences .
A business where employee happiness is job one is only something I 'm imagining , and I have no idea yet what such a thing would look like or how it would be designed .
But I believe it 's possible , and that somehow the way to make it happen will appear ( I also see the creation of these ideas as a community effort , and not something I will invent on my own ) .

A business decision by Citibank has some experts scratching their heads .
An unknown number of credit card accounts , co-branded with oil companies like Shell and Exxon - Mobil , have been closed by the creditor .
After filling up her gas tank , Shannon Burdette was confused when she was told her card had been rejected .
AP reports that she called the customer service line on the back of the card , but was told her account was closed because of something that appeared on her credit report .
The only negative statement on her report was the notice of closure by the creditor ’s request .
ADVERTISEMENT
Citibank ’s reason for taking action against customers is unknown .
The bank ’s spokesman declined to give an explanation for the massive closure , according to American Banking News .
A statement issued by the bank pointed out that they “ continuously evaluate their products . ”
Estimates for the number of account closures are in the hundreds .
A card being closed has the potential to damage a person ’s credit rating .
If a customer had a high credit limit on their closed account and a high balance in another line of credit , the “ utilization ratio ” drives the customer ’s credit rating down , according to John Ulzheimer , president of educational services for Credit.com .
No law , including the recent Credit CARD
Act , prohibits banks from closing credit accounts , even if no warning is given .
Citibank mailed out the closure letters only two days before the accounts were closed .
Accounts affected include Mastercards co-branded with Shell , Exxon - Mobil , Citgo , and Phillips Conoco - 66 .
Citibank posted $ 8 billion in losses for its third quarter report last week .
Like most banks , Citi expects defaults on credit cards to rise in the next few months .
Before the announcement of account closures , analysts noted that the bank has “ sharply reduced its outstanding credit to customers , ” according to AP .
A report released by the Organic Center found that the amount of herbicides used on genetically engineered crops has increased in the past 10 years , not decreased as might be expected .
Since many genetically engineered crops were modified so that farmers could spray Roundup , or Glyphosate , to kill the weeds in their fields but not the crops themselves , the expectation was that less herbicide would be required .
But the new report found that this is not what happened .
The authors of the report , entitled “ Impacts of Genetically Engineered Crops on Pesticide Use , ” used US Department of Agriculture data to look at America ’s three largest genetically engineered crops – soybeans , corn , and cotton .
They found that the amount of herbicides used on them has increased from 1996 to 2008 by approximately 7 or 8 percent , with a particularly sharp increase from 2005 on .
In particular , the amount of Roundup that is used on genetically engineered crops has multiplied several times during the time period , says the report ’s main author , Charles Benbrook , who 's the chief scientist at the Organic Center .
“ This big increase in herbicide is driven largely by the emergence of Roundup - resistant weeds , ” Dr. Benbrook says .
But “ industry is still saying to the public that genetic engineering [ has ] reduced herbicide use . ”
Benbrook found that Roundup - resistant weeds have become a particularly big problem in soybeans .
Roundup originally killed all weeds , leaving only soybeans in the fields , but after a few years , farmers had to use more Roundup as well as the older , more toxic chemicals to kill the weeds , according to the authors of the report .
Troy Roush , a farmer in Indiana , says resistant weeds became such a big problem that this year he decided to switch back to conventional soybeans .
“ The only advantage a genetically modified soybean has over the value of ( conventional soy ) is diminished , ” Mr. Roush says .
“ We might as well not pay for the technology and use conventional seeds . ”
His fields of genetically engineered soybean became infested with “ mare ’s tail ” , a bushy weed that looks like the tail of a horse , and with genetically - engineered corn , he says .
Because Roush rotates corn and soybeans on the same field , the Roundup - resistant corn actually became a weed when it went to seed the following year .
Because of these problems , Roush is now back at growing soybeans the old way and using a more toxic 2,4 - D herbicide .
He is saving money on seeds ( genetically engineered seeds cost five times more than the seeds a farmer saves himself ) , and he can make more from selling his crop to customers in the European Union and Japan , who prefer non-genetically modified soy .
The authors of the report also found that the amount of insecticide used on genetically modified crops decreased during the same time period ( although by a smaller amount ) .
According to the report , herbicide use grew by 383 million pounds from 1996 to 2008 , while insecticide use decreased by 64 million pounds due to the adoption of crops that are engineered to resist insects .
Farmer John Reifsteck from Illinois , says he used to have a problem with root worms that chewed the roots off his corn plants , causing them to fall over .
Now that he ’s growing genetically modified corn , the worms no longer come .
That ’s because genetically engineered corn plants contain a toxin that is safe for humans , but repels the worms .
“ It irritates their stomach , they do n’t like it , they quit feeding , and they move away , ” Mr. Reifsteck explains .
Before bioengineering , Reifsteck used a toxic insecticide on his corn , which he described as “ the most dangerous product that I handle . ”
He had to wear a respirator and rubber gloves , and have blood tests , he says .
Now he does n’t need to treat the corn as much because it ’s engineered to repel worms on its own .
“ I ’m happy or I would n’t be using them , ” he says about genetically engineered crops .
Karen Batra , the spokeswoman for the Biotechnology Industry Organization , and Bob Callanan , of the American Soybean Association , also say that farmers are happy with bioengineered crops .
That the majority of farmers adopted the technology speaks for itself , they say .
They also point out that the Organic Center ’s report considered all herbicides as one group , without making a distinction between the more toxic herbicides , which are now being used less , and weed - killers such as Roundup , which are generally considered more benign .
On the issue of weed resistance , Mr. Callanan of the Soybean Association has a different solution .
Although he admits that resistance to Roundup became a problem about three years ago , he says the best way to tackle weed resistance is with new technology .
A soybean called Liberty Link , that is engineered to be resistant to a different type of herbicide , is currently being introduced .
Rotating Liberty Link and Roundup Ready crops will reduce resistance , he says .
“ Every farmer I know is using less herbicides than they ever had in the past .
It ’s a cleaner , better crop than it was , ” Callanan says about genetically engineered soybeans .
But organic food advocates say that the bioengineering industry is on a slippery slope , and as scientists engineer plants to be resistant to new types of herbicides , more chemical residues are going to end up in food and in the environment .
Efforts are currently underway to engineer a corn variety that is resistant to 2,4 - D , which is considered a carcinogen , says Bill Freese , a policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety who worked on the report .
If the project is successful , farmers will be able to spray the herbicide directly on the corn , rather than use hooded sprayers or spray before seedlings sprouted as they have done in the past , he says .
“ That ’s bad news because that will mean more residues on the corn , ” Mr. Freese says .
“ We see that as very much the wrong approach because it ’s going to mean even more use of these nasty herbicides , more pollution of the environment , and more impact on farmers as well as consumers . ”

Whew , this one took a while .
See you Monday !
Abortion rights activists dreamed of legislative victories across Mexico after the Supreme Court last year upheld a Mexico City law allowing abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy .
Instead , the opposite has happened .
In state after state , antiabortion forces have won changes to local constitutions declaring that life begins at conception and explicitly granting legal rights to the unborn .
In all , 17 state legislatures have approved such measures , often with minimal debate , since the August 2008 court decision validating Mexico City ’s law .
The Gulf coast state of Veracruz last month became the most recent state to do so .
Its measure also called on the Mexican Congress to consider a similar amendment to the nation ’s Constitution .

The flurry of state amendments has rattled abortion rights advocates , who say the measures in effect criminalize abortion in much of Mexico and will drive many women deep underground to terminate a pregnancy .
The leftist - dominated legislature of Mexico City , a federal district treated as a state , voted in April 2007 to allow abortions during the first trimester .
Since then , nearly 34,000 women have undergone abortions in the capital , many after traveling from distant states .
Abortion is illegal outside Mexico City , except in some circumstances , but it is seldom prosecuted .
In their new laws , states have included provisions allowing exceptions in cases of rape or if the woman ’s life is at risk , and to give judges the option of sending women to counseling instead of jail if convicted of undergoing an abortion .
But abortion rights activists are not comforted .
Advertisement
“ This is very offensive because they still treat women as if they are criminals , ” said Maria Luisa Sanchez , director of a Mexican abortion rights group , GIRE .
Sanchez said women in states that have passed the laws might avoid seeking a doctor ’s help after undergoing an abortion or if the procedure is incomplete .
“ It ’s going to be more clandestine than before , ” she said .
Reproductive rights groups have sought to head off the laws by filing legal actions in state courts .
Advertisement
Abortion foes characterize their recent victories as a popular backlash against the Supreme Court ruling .
They hope to persuade the Mexican Congress to approve similar changes at the federal level .
After the Mexico City rule was approved , lawmakers in many states “ began to debate it and concluded that abortion goes against the rights of the person , against the woman , ” said Jorge Serrano Limon , who heads an antiabortion group called Pro Vida .
“ It was a response .
The response was pro-life legislation . ”
The drive for stricter abortion laws has featured the Roman Catholic Church and the National Action Party of President Felipe Calderon .
The party , known as the PAN , has a strong religious tilt and favors conservative social policies .
The surprise is that Mexico ’s once - dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , has been providing the votes needed to pass the new laws and , in a number of cases , leading the charge .
The center - left PRI , which lost the presidency in 2000 , has long touted its advocacy of women ’s rights and the sanctity of church - state separation .

Political analysts and people on both sides of the abortion debate see election - year maneuvering at work in the PRI ’s embrace of constitutional changes on abortion .
Daniel Lund , a Mexico City - based pollster and analyst , said the PRI is shifting rightward on abortion to deny the PAN possible votes on an issue that could mobilize a significant number of voters .
Thirteen states will hold elections in 2010 ; six of them have passed laws in recent months declaring that life begins at conception .
A seventh , the northern state of Chihuahua , has had such a law on the books since 1994 .
“ The PRI is not going to leave the field to the PAN in those states , ” Lund said .
“ They want to neutralize the issue . ”

Although the abortion issue is pivotal to a fairly small segment of voters , that could affect turnout at the state level in off - year elections , Lund said .
Serrano said antiabortion advocates hoped to raise the profile of the issue during next year ’s elections and in presidential balloting two years later .
He said there could be more efforts in some of the remaining 14 states to pass laws granting legal rights from the moment of conception .
PRI lawmakers ’ support for the recent measures has angered feminists and abortion rights activists , who accuse party leaders of trading principles for possible electoral advantage .
The criticism has especially targeted the PRI ’s president , Beatriz Paredes , a former governor and self - described feminist who is mentioned from time to time as a possible presidential candidate .
Advertisement
“ She ’s lost a lot of respect , ” said Sanchez , the abortion rights activist .
Paredes has said it is up to PRI legislators at the state level to decide how to vote on the volatile abortion issue .
“ It ’s clear that the issue divides the Mexican public and that the PRI delegation , which reflects that society , also has a divided position , ” Paredes wrote in an opinion article last month .
“ The debate remains open . ”

From McClatchy -- How Goldman secretly bet on the U.S. housing crash :
WASHINGTON — In 2006 and 2007 , Goldman Sachs Group peddled more than $ 40 billion in securities backed by at least 200,000 risky home mortgages , but never told the buyers it was secretly betting that a sharp drop in U.S. housing prices would send the value of those securities plummeting .
Goldman 's sales and its clandestine wagers , completed at the brink of the housing market meltdown , enabled the nation 's premier investment bank to pass most of its potential losses to others before a flood of mortgage defaults staggered the U.S. and global economies .
Only later did investors discover that what Goldman had promoted as triple - A rated investments were closer to junk .
Now , pension funds , insurance companies , labor unions and foreign financial institutions that bought those dicey mortgage securities are facing large losses , and a five - month McClatchy investigation has found that Goldman 's failure to disclose that it made secret , exotic bets on an imminent housing crash may have violated securities laws .
" The Securities and Exchange Commission should be very interested in any financial company that secretly decides a financial product is a loser and then goes out and actively markets that product or very similar products to unsuspecting customers without disclosing its true opinion , " said Laurence Kotlikoff , a Boston University economics professor who 's proposed a massive overhaul of the nation 's banks .
" This is fraud and should be prosecuted . "

Jersey Shore is a new MTV reality show combining elements of The Real World with elements of Hot Chicks with Douchebags .
Some people are very excited about this .
And others , especially UNICO , an Italian - American service organization , are not .
The group ’s president , Andre Dimino , has asked MTV to pull the show because it perpetuates the stereotype of young Italian men as mindless drunk oafs with more hair gel than brain cells .
“ Trash television sells , and they ’d be more interested in making money than how they ’re offending a great group of people , ” Dimino says .
Weighty ethnic issues are n’t really our thing , so here ’s the show ’s trailer so you can decide for yourself .
’ Jersey Shore ’ offends Italian - American group ; president protests use of ‘ Guido ’ [ Star - Ledger ]
The station is sandwiched midway between the street - level entrances to the modern Broadway Station above and the platform below , accessible through a silver door marked “ T personnel only . ’’
Beyond the old mosaic “ Broadway ’’ sign at the platform , a track bed and tunnel extend about a quarter - mile to a street - level fence that faces Foundry Street , across from an MBTA rail yard .
“ If you were standing here in 1919 , you ’d be taking a streetcar to Andrew or to Bayview ’’ in South Boston , Clarke said at the old Broadway station .
But on a walk through this ghost world , it ’s easy to imagine the bustling Boston of old , when streetcar traffic dominated daily life and was so robust that an underground system , the first American subway , was needed to relieve congestion above .
As the group stepped through the rubble , flashlights and strung - together utility bulbs lighted the old corridors like a noir movie , casting eerie shadows over dust clouds .
Smells varied by location , with a sewage leak penetrating the mildew at one point , and cool air freshening segments near the portals .
MBTA walkie - talkies , brought along for safety , bounced a cacophony of chatter against otherwise silent walls .
Clarke , a 65 - year - old who became interested in transit when he was 10 , probably knows as much about the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ’s past as anyone .
He identified about 10 noteworthy sections of the abandoned tunnel system at the Globe ’s request .
And on a recent weekend , he joined a rare expedition into a hidden world that includes locations unfamiliar even to many longtime MBTA employees .
“ It ’s all here and it ’s exactly as it was built , ’’ he said .
“ Exactly . ’’
Bradley Clarke , president of the Boston Street Railway Association , stands in a cobwebbed tunnel that , from 1897 to 1962 , linked the present - day Boylston Street Station with the South End .
He takes measure of the nooks on the sides of the tunnel walls that were designed to fit 19th - century track workers , smaller men by contemporary standards , and stares at the rusted tracks .
This hidden world of abandoned tunnels and stations lies below the familiar landmarks : the Freedom Trail , City Hall Plaza , and Brattle Square in Cambridge .
But the corroded rail spikes , the antiquated mosaic signs , and the dust - covered corridors offer another layer , a Pompeii of sorts , preserved under the civilization that followed it .
Boston ’s bars have poured their last drinks .
Stragglers are stumbling home .
But beneath the modern metropolis , in the bowels of the city , a group of six men wanders abandoned tunnels with heavy coats and flashlights , dodging the occasional rodent , to uncover the lost relics of America ’s first subway system .
Over the years , crews have come through the old Tremont Street tunnel to run utility lines or , in recent years , to consider and then reject the possibility of fitting high - speed Silver Line buses in the narrow tunnels .
There is also a large mound , probably 15 feet high , of rusted - out 10 - gallon water and biscuit containers that date to the 1960s , the height of the Cold War , when the tunnel was considered a nuclear fallout shelter .
Its use declined and it closed for good in 1962 after the last of those trolley lines was converted to a bus route , a phenomenon that occurred earlier and to a greater extent in other cities around the nation as Americans adopted cars and the suburban lifestyle that came with them .
“ This was the Boston roller coaster , ’’ Clarke added , noting the steep decline on the walk down from Boylston station to the South End .
“ The fun lasted until about 1961 . ’’
But between 1897 and 1901 , it would have been bursting with trolleys , as many as 100 per hour , Clarke said .
The old Tremont Street Subway segment from Boylston Station to Eliot Norton Park , which extends for about a quarter - mile , connected the first section of the subway , now part of the Green Line , and as many as 20 trolley lines , Clarke said .
The old tunnels and tracks in the subway system were abandoned over decades for a variety of reasons .
In some cases , the MBTA or its predecessor companies built extensions that eliminated the need for a subway turnaround loop or train storage yard .
Other tunnels were rerouted to make way for station updates , the abolition of overhead rail lines , or changes in the city ’s layout .
Because some abandoned tunnels overlap with the modern subway system , the MBTA insisted that the tour take place overnight on a weekend , when the modern - day tunnels are largely free of trains and maintenance crews .
Mulhern , who began at the T as a track walker and has rebuilt many of the existing tracks , helped lead the Globe ’s tour .
He was joined by two MBTA employees - Charles Murphy and Barry Page - assigned to keep the group safe while walking near live electrified tracks .
Though used only between 1917 and 1919 , the abandoned station became something of a test kitchen for the subway system .
In the 1930s , Boston Elevated Railway Co. even tried growing mushrooms there , Clarke says .
In the 1980s , the T brought blind passengers in to test rubber warning strips now used on platform edges .
And after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 , firefighters simulated a burning train emergency in the tunnel , says Michael Mulhern , a retired MBTA general manager .
At the end of the tunnel , near the Church of All Nations at Tremont and Charles streets , Mulhern locates a broken hatch leading to the sidewalk .
It opens just a crack , enough to glimpse the fluorescent lights of the modern South End .
By the 1980s , the T was phasing out tunnels for another reason , the rerouting of the Orange Line and the removal of the elevated track that extended over Washington Street into Roxbury .
A few hundred feet from the current Chinatown station , the old Orange Line tunnel that once connected to an overpass above the Massachusetts Turnpike ends abruptly .
Built between 1904 and 1908 , it was sealed off in 1987 , when the elevated line was taken down .
“ Here we are 101 years later , looking at what is essentially a reasonably complete subway , ’’ says Clarke , standing amid discarded cinder blocks and a junked cash register .
Other elements of the old subway have been reclaimed for new uses .
The old Court Street Station , used between 1904 and 1916 to connect with what later became the Blue Line , sits atop the modern Blue Line , adjacent to Government Center , formerly Scollay Square .
It is difficult to locate , up an iron stairway and hidden behind two 4 - foot - high doors , like the kind in Willy Wonka ’s chocolate factory .
And even once inside , it is barely recognizable as a station , now that much of it has been cleaned , refurbished , and converted into an attic used for electrical utilities and ventilation .
Clarke is one of the few people who knew about it , and is excited to have found it again after at least 20 years .
“ See the curvature of the subway .
It ’s all here , ’’ he says .
Likewise , an old track loop near Harvard Square has been largely cleaned up since the 1980s , when it was last in use .
To get to the old , gritty section requires confronting a door with a sign that reads “ Danger , ’’ next to a handwritten warning : “ Do not let this door close behind you .
You will be locked inside . ’’
Once past the daunting signs , the group enters a darker and dirtier room , then crosses a puddle over a wooden plank .
A few hundred yards later , Mulhern finds a staircase that leads to an exit on the street , across from an International House of Pancakes .
The final stop on the tour leads to East Boston ’s Maverick Square Station and the search for a trolley loop that was abandoned on Jan. 5 , 1952 , another casualty of the end of the streetcar era .
The MBTA recently finished a complete renovation of the station , and the group had received mixed messages about whether the loop might have disappeared when crews expanded the station .
But in the back of a power substation , through another hidden door , lies a gravel path the length of one or two city blocks .
There are no tracks .
The walls are bare and musty .
There are puddles .
It does not look much like the narrow Green Line tunnel witnessed earlier in the evening or the shadow station at Broadway .
But there are signs it was once used as a subway : the curvature of the tunnel walls and the cutout niches every 10 feet that would have provided a haven for rail workers who needed to escape an oncoming trolley .
Clarke , who had harbored his own doubts about the ghost tunnel ’s existence , is thrilled .
It ’s about 4:30 a.m. and he ’s been up all night , but is not tired at all .
This is a transit historian ’s dream .
“ My God , ’’ he says .
“ It ’s still here . ’’

A 20 - year - old woman divorcee accused of committing adultery in Somalia has been stoned to death by Islamists in front of a crowd of about 200 people .
A judge working for the militant group al - Shabab said she had had an affair with an unmarried 29 - year - old man .
He said she gave birth to a still - born baby and was found guilty of adultery .
Her boyfriend was given 100 lashes .
It is thought to be the second time a woman has been stoned to death for adultery by al - Shabab .
The group controls large swathes of southern Somalia where they have imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law which has been unpopular with many Somalis .
' Lenient '
According to reports from a small village near the town of Wajid , 250 miles ( 400 km ) north - west of the capital , Mogadishu , the woman was taken to the public grounds where she was buried up to her waist .
The Islamists want to impose a strict version of Sharia on Somalia She was then stoned to death in front of the crowds on Tuesday afternoon .
The judge , Sheikh Ibrahim Abdirahman , said her unmarried boyfriend was given 100 lashes at the same venue .
Under al - Shabab 's interpretation of Sharia law , anyone who has ever been married - even a divorcee - who has an affair is liable to be found guilty of adultery , punishable by stoning to death .
An unmarried person who has sex before marriage is liable to be given 100 lashes .
BBC East Africa correspondent Will Ross says the stoning is at least the fourth for adultery in Somalia over the last year .
Earlier this month , a man was stoned to death for adultery in the port town of Merka , south of Mogadishu .
His pregnant girlfriend was spared , until she gives birth .
A girl was stoned to death for adultery in the southern town of Kismayo last year .
Human rights groups said she was 13 years old and had been raped , but the Islamists said she was older and had been married .
Last month , two men were stoned to death in Merka after being accused of spying .
President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , a moderate Islamist , was sworn in as president after UN - brokered peace talks in January .
Although he says he also wants to implement Sharia , al - Shabab says his version of Islamic law would be too lenient .
The country has not had a functioning national government for 18 years .

The Cry of the Sloth by Sam Savage
As everyone who 's worked in a literary profession knows , being a writer and editor is glamorous , fun , lucrative , and generally totally awesome .
Even if you 're a minor poet whose works are published in tiny literary magazines sponsored by a community college in southeast Nebraska , the biggest problem you 'll have on a daily basis is which car to take to the liquor store to buy your top - shelf Islay Scotch and comically expensive cigars .
It 's not a frustrating , soul - crushing career path in the slightest .
Or so , you know , I thought , once upon a time .
I was young and naive and believed a lot of things contrary to fact .
I think I also thought I would one day be asked to play guitar for Sonic Youth , all war would end once marijuana was legalized , and the Democratic Party would successfully lead the nation one day without shooting itself in its collective foot .
In other words , I was incredibly stupid .
I do n't regret becoming a writer and editor ; I just wish I 'd realized that one day I would be clipping coupons for generic canned beans and wondering how many electric bills I 'd have to miss before the city cut me off completely .
It turns out this is hard , and I have n't been offered one single seven - figure advance from a Manhattan publisher .
( Though getting to use the Bookslut private jet and ski chalet in the Alps is pretty cool . )
I 'm happy , though , and I regret nothing .
Except maybe the marijuana thing .
If you 're ever looking to scare someone out of pursuing a career in literature -- and you just might want to do that , if you 're either a realist or a complete dick -- all you have to do is give them a copy of The Cry of the Sloth , Sam Savage 's bitter , brilliant , and devastatingly hilarious second novel .
Savage made his debut as a published novelist last year at the age of 67 with Firmin , a dark - but - sweet novel about a complicated rat who lives in a bookstore basement ; his follow - up is much funnier , but does n't have a hint of the gentleness or sweetness of his previous book .
That 's not a bad thing -- it 's difficult to pull off a novel as bleak and hopeless as The Cry of the Sloth , and even harder to execute it so your readers are laughing even as they 're horrified beyond belief .
It 's almost certainly an exaggeration to say Sam Savage is the only one who could make it work , but it 's not much of one .
It 's hard to imagine anyone else doing it this well .
Savage 's second novel follows Andrew Whittaker , a would - be writer and editor of a failing literary magazine , Soap , in the Nixon - era upper Midwest .
He makes his meager living as a rentier , a neglectful landlord who treats his tenants with unvarnished scorn .
The properties he owns are in awful shape ; he tries to make his renters foot the bill for repairs , since most of his money goes to alimony payments to his ex-wife , the expenses of publishing Soap , and increasingly desperate and unhealthy purchases at supermarkets and liquor stores .
( One grocery list he makes starts off with " sliced cheese " and " rolls , " and ends with " coffee , " " Crisco , " and " a different life . " )
He 's planning a literary festival to promote his magazine , and suffering from hilarious delusions of grandeur -- he seems to think he 'll be able to pay for a parade ( with elephants ! ) and convince Norman Mailer to be a featured speaker .
As his life starts to unravel , he begins a flirtation , via mail , with a high - school girl who 's submitted poetry to Soap , seemingly unaware that the romance , like his planned festival , has no hope of coming to fruition .
This is mostly an epistolary novel ; the bulk is told in letters from Whittaker to his ex-wife , his old friends , his contributors , and his tenants .
It 's punctuated with shopping lists , signs he 's posted at his properties , and his laughably clumsy attempts at fiction .
It 's a perfect narrative choice ; it gives the reader a chance to watch Whittaker change his tone and register in different situations , though only slightly -- Whittaker is basically a deluded , sad , arrogant , hateful ass .
He writes with reluctant anger to his ex-wife , slavishly devoted flattery to Norman Mailer and the other writers he 's trying to lure to his festival , patronizing meanness to his tenants , and pathetic , cap - in - hand sadness to his creditors , bankers and lawyer .
Whittaker might be one of the most unlikeable characters in recent American fiction ; he 's also one of the most compelling .
His closest literary analog is Ignatius J. Reilly of A Confederacy of Dunces , but Whittaker is actually sadder , more pitiable , and infinitely more hopeless .
He writes letters to the editors of the local arts newspaper under fake names , praising himself and his magazine .
Even as his telephone service is being cut off and his properties are being foreclosed upon , he envisions a float with flashing colored lights as the centerpiece of the literary festival he hopes to host .
His delusions are sad , but at no point does the reader believe that Whittaker is acting out of any motive beyond selfishness .
His love of literature seems to be inauthentic , just a symptom of his self - aggrandizement and narcissism .
But it 's still impossible not to feel sorry for him .
Savage asks the reader to laugh at Whittaker , which is risky -- in the hands of a lesser writer , this could come across as unbearably mean .
And it would if it were n't for the fact that this book is so relentlessly funny , despite its incredible darkness .
The Cry of the Sloth hits like a punch in the solar plexus , and never , ever lets up .
Savage is a brilliant humorist who 's created one of the most original antiheroes in recent American fiction .
It 's as painful as it is hilarious , as sad as it is remarkable .
And yeah , it could scare off impressionable youths from wanting to pursue writing or editing as a career .
It 's lucky for us , though , that Savage was n't scared off himself ; he 's become one of America 's funniest , cleverest , and most vital writers of fiction .

He has since left his position as managing editor of Bookslut , and now plays guitar for Sonic Youth , and is Undersecretary of State for Peace and Getting High .
Only 57 % of Americans feel that the planet 's atmosphere is warming , a fall from 77 % two years ago
The number of Americans who believe in global warming has plummeted , falling 20 % in two years , a survey said today .
Only 57 % of Americans believe there is solid scientific evidence that the Earth 's atmosphere is warming , said the poll of 1,500 people by the Pew Research Centre for the People & the Press .
That is a fall of 77 % from 2007 .
The number of people who believe that human activity is causing global warming also fell to just 36 % .
The public uncertainty about the evidence behind global warming comes as the Senate prepares to begin debate next week on climate change legislation .
Yesterday , 18 scientific organisations wrote Congress to reaffirm the consensus behind global warming .
Michael Dimock , the associate director of the Pew Centre , said the economic crisis and the struggles over healthcare reform had squeezed out climate change and the environment as issues of concern .
" The public is just not as focused on global warming and environmental [ issues ] as they have been in the past . "
But James Hoggan , a PR executive and author of Climate Cover - Up , blamed an intense lobbying campaign against global warming legislation now before the Senate .
" I would say a big part of this problem is this campaign to mislead Americans about climate science , " he said .
" This is a very sophisticated group of people who know how to create doubt and confusion and they have done a very good job of it . "
The decline was sharpest among independent voters and Republicans .
Republicans in Congress have almost uniformly lined up against climate change legislation .
There were also regional differences , with people in the mid-west and Rocky mountain states less inclined to see climate change as a serious problem .
But the perceived lack of concrete evidence for global warming did not necessarily hurt the prospects of voting on climate change legislation , Dimock said .
Half of Americans polled remain in favour of putting limits and carbon emissions and making companies pay for their emissions -- the basics of the cap and trade bill now before the Senate .
A majority , 56 % , also want America to join other countries in a global agreement on climate change .

In part 1 , we ran down a list of the standard Django features for controlling transactions .
Now , we ’re going to look at some ways to optimize how these tranactions happen .
Let ’s look at the SQL that our create_order ( ) view function generated , with the transaction middleware turned on , and no transaction decorators on the function :
LOG : statement : SET DATESTYLE TO ' ISO ' LOG : statement : SHOW client_encoding LOG : statement : SHOW default_transaction_isolation LOG : statement : BEGIN ; SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED LOG : statement : SET TIME ZONE E'America / Los_Angeles ' LOG : statement : SELECT version ( ) LOG : statement : INSERT INTO " example_address " ( " street_address " , " city " , " state " , " zip " ) VALUES ( E'1313 Mockingbird Lane ' , E'Mockingbird Heights ' , E'CA ' , E'90026 ' ) LOG : statement : SELECT CURRVAL ('" example_address_id_seq " ' )
LOG : statement : INSERT INTO " example_order " ( " customer_name " , " shipping_address_id " ) VALUES ( E' Herman Munster ' , 5 ) LOG : statement : SELECT CURRVAL ('" example_order_id_seq " ' )
LOG : statement : COMMIT
Setting aside the overhead statements ( and , good grief , there are a lot of those ) , what ’s wrong with this ?
Well , not much , except that as of 8.2 , PostgreSQL has a much better way of getting the primary key ( or any other field , for that matter ) back from an INSERT statement , which is the INSERT … RETURNING construct .
It ’s perfect for just this situation , when you ’re inserting a record and creating the primary key at the same time , and want to et the primary key back for further operations .
Now , let ’s look at the SQL we get from our show_order ( ) function :
LOG : statement : SET DATESTYLE TO ' ISO ' LOG : statement : SHOW client_encoding LOG : statement : SHOW default_transaction_isolation LOG : statement : BEGIN ; SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED LOG : statement : SET TIME ZONE E'America / Los_Angeles ' LOG : statement : SELECT version ( ) LOG : statement : SELECT " example_order " . " id " , " example_order " ." customer_name " , " example_order " . " shipping_address_id " FROM " example_order " WHERE " example_order " . " id " = 1 LOG : statement : ROLLBACK
In this case , we do n’t need that transaction at all .
At it happens , there ’s a Django feature that can address both these problems at once , as long as you are running PostgreSQL 8.2 with the postgresql_psycopg2 backend …
Enter the autocommit
This functionality is kind of buried in the Django documentation , almost apologically stuck in the Notes about supported databases section .
It ’s an option you add to your settings .py file :
DATABASE_OPTIONS = { " autocommit " : True , }
What does this do ?
The documentation , I ’m afraid , is pretty obscure about the actual effect .
Groveling around in the code , we discover that what it does is prevent Django from automatically starting a new transaction on the first database operation .
If we switch it on , our SQL traffic for show_order ( ) now looks like :
LOG : statement : SET DATESTYLE TO ' ISO ' LOG : statement : SHOW client_encoding LOG : statement : SHOW default_transaction_isolation LOG : statement : SET TIME ZONE E'America/ Los_Angeles ' LOG : statement : SELECT version ( ) LOG : statement : SELECT " example_order " . " id " , " example_order " ." customer_name " , " example_order " . " shipping_address_id " FROM " example_order " WHERE " example_order " . " id " = 1
That ’s much better !
Well , how about for create_order ?

Hm .
That ’s not what we expected , at all .
As it happens , there ’s a bug in Django 1.1 when using autocommit ; it blows up if the very first thing that you do on a new database connection is an INSERT that expects a return value back .
As a workaround , we can add a line to our create_order ( ) function to force it to do some traffic before the first insert :
def create_order ( request ) : cur = connection.cursor ( ) # Work around Django 1.1 autocommit bug address = Address ( street_address = " 1112 E Broad St " , city =" Westfield " , state = " NJ " , zip = " 07090 " ) address.save ( ) order = Order(customer_name= " Gomez Addams " , shipping_address=address ) order.save ( ) return HttpResponse ( " Created : " + unicode ( order ) )
And now , we get …
LOG : statement : SET DATESTYLE TO ' ISO ' LOG : statement : SHOW client_encoding LOG : statement : SHOW default_transaction_isolation LOG : statement : SET TIME ZONE E'America/ Los_Angeles ' LOG : statement : SELECT version ( ) LOG : statement : INSERT INTO " example_address " ( " street_address " , " city " , " state " , " zip " ) VALUES ( E'1112 E Broad St ' , E'Westfield ' , E'NJ ' , E'07090 ' ) RETURNING " example_address " . " id " LOG : statement : INSERT INTO " example_order " ( " customer_name " , " shipping_address_id " ) VALUES ( E' Gomez Addams ' , 82 ) RETURNING " example_order " . " id "
Wow , that ’s great !
Notice the nice , efficient RETURNING clause , and notice … uh , the complete lack of a transaction block around the INSERTs .
This is why this particular function is called “ autocommit ” : since we ’re not running inside an enclosing transaction , each statement is “ autocommitted ” upon completion .
( Calling a feature “ autocommit ” when the practical effect is that the framework does not automatically generate COMMIT statements is perhaps not the best choice of nomenclature . )
So , what are our options ?
Let ’s add the @transaction .
commit_on_success decorator , and see if that improves matters :
LOG : statement : SET DATESTYLE TO ' ISO ' LOG : statement : SHOW client_encoding LOG : statement : SHOW default_transaction_isolation LOG : statement : BEGIN ; SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED LOG : statement : SET TIME ZONE E'America / Los_Angeles ' LOG : statement : SELECT version ( ) LOG : statement : INSERT INTO " example_address " ( " street_address " , " city " , " state " , " zip " ) VALUES ( E'1112 E Broad St ' , E'Westfield ' , E'NJ ' , E'07090 ' ) RETURNING " example_address " . " id " LOG : statement : INSERT INTO " example_order " ( " customer_name " , " shipping_address_id " ) VALUES ( E' Gomez Addams ' , 84 ) RETURNING " example_order " . " id " LOG : statement : COMMIT
Perfect .
Wait .
What ’s going on ?
The following is a digression , and is n’t really required to use autocommit … but you might find it interesting .
You might well be thinking , “ That ’s all a very nifty trick , but what in the world does INSERT ... RETURNING have to do with autocommit ?
And why is autocommit limited to PostgreSQL 8.2 , when that behavior has been standard with PostgreSQL since ever ? ”
First , note how Django gets the result of an INSERT if it does have the INSERT … RETURNING syntax available :
LOG : statement : INSERT INTO " example_address " ( " street_address " , " city " , " state " , " zip " ) VALUES ( E'1313 Mockingbird Lane ' , E'Mockingbird Heights ' , E'CA ' , E'90026 ' ) LOG : statement : SELECT CURRVAL ('" example_address_id_seq " ' )
That is , it calls the currval function .
This works great … as long as you are assured that you are the same connection as you were when you issued the insert .
But why would n’t you be ?
Good question , and the answer is : Pooling .
Pretty much any site with any degree of load will , at some point , need pooling software like pgpool - II or PgBouncer to multiplex connections between the application and database server .
The base mode on both of these fine products simulates as closely as possible being directly connected to the database :
Each time the client connects to the intermediate connection pooler , it appears that a new , isolated connection has opened up .
However , more aggressive forms of connection pooling are possible .
For example , PgBouncer has transaction pooling , in which the connection to the database is only assigned to a client while it has a transaction open .
Between transactions , the connection between PgBouncer and the database could switch , which would cause ( really strange and hard - to - reproduce ) errors .
“ But , ” you say , having read the PgBouncer docs , “ it ’s inside a transaction !
That keep it from switching to a new connection , even when you ’re using transaction pooling ! ”
That ’s true … unless you are running with autocommit turned on , and take no special precautions to make sure that your INSERT is inside of a transation block ( remember , it ’s not by default , as we saw above ) .
Note that it is never wrong to use INSERT … RETURNING ; it ’s just required if you are using transaction pooling ( Django does n’t know if you are or not , so it assumes that you are ) , with autocommit turned on , and if you do not take special pains to put each INSERT or group thereof into its own transaction .
Back to Reality .
That ’s right , you heard me : I ’m glad .
I ’m glad someone put together a subversive script , packaged it as a deb file , and released it on gnome - look.org .
Cheers , I say .
Sure , it ’s unfortunate that some Ubuntu users installed it thinking it was a screensaver , and then discovered it was grabbing something bad from some faraway site , and implanting it in their system .
And yes , it ’s completely unethical and therefore a Very Bad Thing to do that , but to be honest , we need to get past the “ I use Linux , I am therefore bulletproof ” mentality .
I ’m not calling anyone dumb .
I merely want to make a point .
I ’m glad because every list of reasons to use Linux includes that “ no viruses , no malware ” clause .
But truth be told , most Windows systems that are properly maintained and carefully managed can go quite some time making the same claim .
And part of “ carefully managed ” is the idea that you do n’t arbitrarily install software from untrusted sources or repositories , no matter what OS you run .
I can remember a few years ago when someone set up an Ubuntu repository that included an update to the wallpaper for the standard Gnome desktop — and the image that was installed was a giant warning not to install software from unreliable repositories .
No harm done , and the lesson was learned .
My point is that somebody still has to press the buttons before the machine becomes a threat to itself .
Let ’s face it , the real danger to a computer system is n’t the hardware and usually is n’t the software .
It ’s the human on the other side of the screen who poses a real threat .
Left alone with no interference and a computer — any computer , regardless of operating system — will likely continue to idle for decades , or until its components finally stop working or someone accidentally unplugs the thing .
But insert a human into the equation , and suddenly all bets are off .
Security be damned , the fact of the matter is that you , and I , are the weakest link .
So let ’s move past the idea that a Linux system is able to walk on water , or that you and I are both somehow impervious to human fallacy because we chose a superior operating system .
As long as we sit behind at the keyboard , the risk remains that one of us , you or I , will delude ourselves into thinking the machine is unsinkable , and suddenly prove ourselves wrong .
And the day someone finally puts together a virus with some real teeth in it , and dumps it on the Linux public ?
Well , that will be a happy day too .
But for different reasons . 😈
Unlike lions , which favor groups , tigers are solitary animals .
A female may have cubs by several males in her lifetime .
That said , there are many reports of tigers sharing kills with other tigers , which may have been because they were related by blood .
I stopped writing regularly for this blog a few weeks ago because of work .
Many a night now spent at the computer , but not watching hockey .
So in the most recent post - game , when I was asked to explain what Pythagorean expectation meant , well I was n't going to answer .
For one , I do n't have that much free time to spare these days , and for two , why reinvent the wheel , right ?
This is the age of Google , after all .
But I can't let a comment like this go :
Good Lord
I did n’t realize that a teams projected point total based on their GF and GA was related to the equation for solving the hypotenuse of a right triangle ( surely you know the formula a ^2 +b^ 2 = c ^ 2 ) .
The Pythagorean Point Equation eh ?
Please explain this formula to me R O .
You posted the link so you should be willing to back it up .
Maybe you could complete a derivation of it so I can gain a better understanding .
Or you could complete an uncertainty analysis based on the projected point totals and actual point totals of all thirty teams using their GF and GA ( I will explain this if needed ) to prove that it is n’t complete bogus
Two things :
1. ) My personal belief , which Kent may not share ( this is his blog after all ) , is that commenters who want to move the conversation forward should be ready and expected to do some legwork themselves .
There are a ton of resources out there ( www.nhl.com, www.behindthenet.ca, www.hockeyanalytics.com, etc. etc. ) and Microsoft Excel is also your friend here .
2. ) Asking why P % can be predicted by an a ^2 + b^2 = c^2 formula is missing the forest for the trees .
Again , my belief ( and one that Kent may not share as well ) is that this whole hockey - stats movement is not about glorifying seemingly meaningless numbers .
It 's about gaining insight into hockey - measuring what 's important , seeing what drives success , and more importantly , what does n't drive success .
So the right question to ask is n't " why does a ^2 + b ^2 = c^2 predict points percentage " ??
The right question to ask is " is it really possible to predict how often you pick up points simply by looking at how often you score and how often you get scored on " ??
Because , folks , if this is possible , then BIG GOALS and BIG SAVES are mirages .
Pythagorean formula : Points % = GF^2 / ( GF^2 + GA^2 )
I was asked what the origins of the Pythagorean point expectation was .
I believe its origins are in baseball , and as far as I know it 's an empirical equation .
Basically some sharp guys decided that they ought to take runs scored for and against and try and map it to wins , and the Pythagorean formula fit best .
Alan Ryder of HockeyAnalytics did some research on a more improved model for goals -> wins .
Some really crazy stuff , you can check it out here under " Probability Models " .
The point is not the model though , it 's the assumption he made : goals are rare , uniformly random and memory - less .
Read that again .
Goals are rare .
Goals are uniformly random .
Goals are memory - less .
Alan Ryder did a quick check that suggests with a high degree of convincing - ness that the above is true , except for in the first minute of each period and the last minute of the third period .
There are some conjectures as to why these exceptions occur ( the last minute of the game is empty - net time , the first minute of each period contains less time spent in the zone during PPs ) but the exceptions are less interesting than the main result .
For you see , if goals really are rare , and uniformly random , and memory - less , then there 's not very much real estate for the BIG GOAL and BIG SAVE to coexist with regular , boring hockey truth .
No matter how much a skater might elevate his game to the level of CLUTCH or how well a goalie just makes BIG SAVE after BIG SAVE because he wants to win more , goals keep getting scored and saves made in the same measures , minute after minute after boring minute .
And this ties in to Pythagorean expectation quite well .
Because sometimes you look at a team that just keeps on winning , but without the goal differential to back it up .
For example , the Avs .
And their troll fans will come to you after winning against your team despite playing like garbage , and when you point that out one of the usual retorts is " we found a way to win " or " we scored a big goal and our goalie made some big saves " .
And that , friends , is absolute grade - A bullshit .
Because point percentage can be modeled by the Pythagorean expectation .
And even more important , point percentage can be modeled by randomly distributing goals scored for and against over 82 games .
Observe :
The red dots are true points % for the 120 post - lockout team seasons .
By " true points " I mean 2 points for a win ( regulation or OT ) , 0 points for a loss ( regulation or OT ) , 1 point for a tie .
Shootouts and loser points are gone , the model does n't account for that .
And before anybody says anything , you can augment the model to account for shootouts by adding a coinflip component in the case of ties .
See point 1 . ) above about legwork .
The blue line is what the Pythagorean expectation predicts .
Pretty straight down the middle eh ?
I did n't calculate R^2 or what not , that does n't really interest me - more insight can be gained by the green dots .
The green dots , ah the green dots , these are points %'s from simulations that I did for every team season .
Basically I took the GF and GA of each team - season and randomly distributed them ( with uniform distribution ) over 82 games .
Did that 500 times per team season , calculated the point % , put it on the plot .
You see ?
EVERY team season in the post - lockout is well within the range that one would expect from a parallel universe where there was no dispute about BIG GOALS or BIG SAVES - where goals are scored when they are scored and goalies make saves as best they can and we do n't ever talk about clutch or elevating your game .
Maybe , just maybe , that parallel universe is this one .
Legendary game designer Peter Molyneux has been notorious for hyping his games up beyond our wildest dreams .
He ’s said things like Fable II being the “ best , most complete game I ’ve ever worked on ” and that it would “ set the standard for which all RPG ’s are compared . ”
However , in an interview with Retro Gamer Magazine , the designer revealed that this is n’t always his intention .
In the interview , he spoke about his career , games , and what he has learned over the years from his experiences .
Molyneux specifically talked about his biggest game , Fable .
“ Fable was another one of those games which people were very excited about , and it was another which was a little over - hyped to be honest with you , ” he said .
“ When I did Fable I learned a real lesson about talking to journalists . ”
Fable , even more so than its sequel , was immensely over - hyped .
It was a wonderful game , but it certainly lacked numerous things Molyneux claimed the game would achieve .
Many features were cut , and many features he talked about were simply concepts never put into action .
“ With Fable and with Black & White , I really was just actually being a designer at this point , saying ‘ imagine we ’re going to have this game feature , and it ’s going to do this and this is why we ’re going to have it and why it ’s important , ' ” continued Molyneux .
“ And of course the poor games journalist writes down all these things and it comes across as ‘ oh my god , it ’s going to be amazing ’ but really they were just words because a lot of the time with Fable and with Black & White I was actually talking , I was n’t really demoing . ”
Molyneux said he has learned a lot from his past experiences .
He ’s much more careful about promoting his games , and he said he wo n’t talk about something unless it ’s actually in the game .
“ … whenever I talk about a game feature , I ’m going to show it and be honest about it , and if it is an experiment , I ’ll call it an experiment .
I wo n’t call it a game feature , ” he stated .
Right now , Molyneux and his team at Lionhead are working on Fable III .
He said the game is expected to release sometime in late 2010 .
The game will revolve around the player trying to become the king of the fictional land of Albion , leading the people to happiness and the kingdom to glory .
He promises the game will be something bold , a completely different experience .
Players will be given more control over their actions .
As king , a player ’s charisma will be put to the test .
Players have to keep their promises in order for the people to accept them as king .
“ Look at Obama , he ’s not looking as fresh - faced as he was , is he ? ” Molyneux said .
The designer has a lot of plans for the third game in the series , but will he deliver ?
Based on the lessons he has learned , expect to see more show and less tell when it comes to Fable III .
Peter Molyneux has made a point not to repeat his past mistakes .
Just about every time the monthly jobs numbers comes out , economic research firm TrimTabs comes out and slams the government 's methodology , usually honing in on the Birth / Death model of new businesses entering the market .
This week is no exception .
Frankly , we 're not sure what to make of their arguments .
We 've been hearing about this Birth - Death issue for a long time , but unless you believe they 're changing their methodology from month to month , then that issue only goes so far .
We welcome your thoughts .

TrimTabs ’ Estimates 255,000 Jobs Lost in November , While BLS Reports a Decline of Only 11,000
BLS Revises September and October Results Down a Whopping 45 %
Something ’s Not Right in Kansas !
TrimTabs employment analysis , which uses real - time daily income tax deposits from all U.S. taxpayers to compute employment growth , estimated that the U.S. economy shed 255,000 jobs in November .
This past month ’s results were an improvement of only 10.2 % from the 284,000 jobs lost in October .
Meanwhile , the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) reported that the U.S. economy lost an astonishingly better than expected 11,000 jobs in November .
In addition , the BLS revised their September and October results down a whopping 203,000 jobs , resulting in a 45 % improvement over their preliminary results .
Something is not right in Kansas !
Either the BLS results are wrong , our results are in error , or the truth lies somewhere in the middle
We believe the BLS is grossly underestimating current job losses due to their flawed survey methodology .
Those flaws include rigid seasonal adjustments , a mysterious birth / death adjustment , and the fact that only 40 % to 60 % of the BLS survey is complete by the time of the first release and subject to revision .
Seasonal adjustments are particularly problematic around the holiday season due to the large number of temporary holiday - related jobs added to payrolls in October and November which then disappear in January .
In the past two months , the BLS seasonal adjustments subtracted 2.4 million jobs from the results .
In January , when the seasonal adjustments are the largest of the year , the BLS will add anywhere from 2.0 to 2.3 million jobs .
In our opinion , trying to glean monthly job losses numbering in the tens of thousands or even in the hundreds of thousands are lost in the enormous size of the seasonal adjustments .
In November , the BLS revised their September and October job losses down a surprising 44.5 % , or 203,000 jobs .
In the twelve months ending in October , the BLS revised their job loss estimates up or down by a staggering 679,000 jobs , or 13.0 % .
Until this past month , these revisions brought the BLS ’ revised estimates to within a couple percent of TrimTabs ’ original estimates .
The large divergence between the two results begs the question of what is causing the difference .
While we do n’t have an answer today , we will be poring over the data in an attempt to answer that question .
A comparison of TrimTabs ’ employment results versus the BLS ’ results from January 2008 through November 2009 is summarized below .
Source : TrimTabs Investment Research – www.trimtabs.com and Bureau of Labor Statistics – www.bls.com
Several other employment related data statistics support the conclusion that the labor market is not as robust as the BLS is reporting :
· Automatic Data Processing reported on Wednesday that 169,000 jobs were lost in November .
· The Institute of Supply Management ( ISM ) Non-Manufacturing
Survey reported that the majority of companies surveyed were still shedding employees .
· The ISM Manufacturing Survey reported weaker employment conditions in November .
· Weekly unemployment claims were 457,000 in the week ended November 27 , 2009 .
While last week ’s results were below the important psychological level 500,000 , the weekly claims are still uncomfortably high and point to a contracting labor market .
· The TrimTabs Online Jobs Index reported lower online job availability in the past three weeks .
· The Monster Employment Index declined in November .
We will have the opportunity to truth our employment model estimates at the end of January 2010 when the BLS releases its annual benchmark revisions .
The BLS revisions are based on actual payroll data for March 2009 .
The BLS revision is then divided by twelve to correct prior month ’s data back to April 2008 .
We also use the March 2009 revisions to adjust our model inputs and make any necessary corrections .

Not so easy to spot the finer details ( Image : Jason Todd / Getty )
DEPRESSION really does change the way you see the world .
People with the condition find it easy to interpret large images or scenes , but struggle to “ spot the difference ” in fine detail .
The finding hints at visual training as a possible treatment .
Depressed people have a shortage of a neurotransmitter called GABA ; this has also been linked to a visual skill called spatial suppression , which helps us suppress details surrounding the object our eyes are focused on – enabling us to pick out a snake in fallen leaves , for instance . …
Ivan Peregorodiev , a 22 - year - old medical student and blogger , has been arrested on December 3 for spreading rumors about pneumonic plague in the city of Saratov .
Authorities accused him of disseminating false information related to an act of terrorism .
On December 2 , the Russian bloggers actively discussed allegations that a large population of Saratov had been infected with H1N1 virus .
The rumors said that authorities concealed many fatalities caused by the swine flu and the whole city was about to be closed for quarantine [ RUS ] .
Later , people started talking about alleged cases of pneumonic plague blaming them on a local “ anti-plague ” research institute .
The situation became so serious that Saratov Governor Pavel Ipatov [ ENG ] interrupted his visit to Belarus and returned to the city to deal with public outcry .
Citing a post from a Russian social news Web site , Ivan Peregorodiev , aka lj - user iperegorodiev ( his account is currently suspended ) , challenged an official statement that dismissed any possibility of pneumonic plague :
Turns out we may have a plague .
“ The results of the autopsy of people that died of swine flu – that became publicly available – caused panic .
According to witnesses , the results of lung destruction resembled the cases of pneumonic plague described in medical literature . ” ( http://smi2.ru/saratoff/c243648) [ RUS ]
Do our authorities tell the truth when they dismiss this information ?
Today they plan to spray disinfectant solution against pneumonic plague from helicopters …
P.S. And here is another one http://www.epidemiolog.ru/prof/index.php?SECTION_ID=&ELEMENT_ID=3868 [ RUS ]
He followed up with another post just hours after the first one :
What is going on ?
Gentlemen , here is the latest news from an epidemic station : helicopters are loaded with disinfectant solution .
P.S. Plots of American movies about the Apocalypse become reality .
The city officials denied any rumors about the plague but confirmed 17 fatal cases of swine flu .
The authorities also admitted that city hospitals were overcrowded and Saratov 's budget did not have enough money to purchase H1N1 vaccine .
Some bloggers [ RUS ] found Peregorodiev 's message similar to the one that escalated the swine flu panic in Ukraine a month ago .
Like in the case with Saratov , the rumors in Ukraine also had “ helicopters spraying disinfectant solution . ”
The Saratov Prosecutor 's Office quickly announced [ RUS ] its plans to find disseminators of the rumors and Ivan Peregorodiev became the first to be arrested .
He was accused of transmitting a “ deliberately false information related to an act of terrorism ” ( Article 207 of the Russian Criminal Code ) .
The Prosecutor 's Office did not explain how the information in Peregorodiev 's blog posts and the pneumonic plague rumors were related to any act of terrorism .
The Institute for Collective Action , a Russian non-profit organization , started a campaign [ RUS ] to free Peregorodiev .
Activists argue that , by questioning an official statement of Saratov officials , the blogger was exercising his right to the freedom of speech .
UPD : Ivan was released from jail on December 4th but is still under suspicion of committing a crime , reports Novaya Gazeta .
Two German men who killed an actor in 1990 are suing the charity behind the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia , claiming that its inclusion of detail of their crimes infringes their right to privacy .
The case has become an instant online cause celebre – with one lawyer saying that the integrity of history itself is at stake – because it ranges the US 's First Amendment , which guarantees freedom of speech , against German privacy and criminal laws , which dictate that after a certain period a crime is " spent " and can not be referred to .
The UK has similar rules on the reporting of lesser crimes .
The two men , who cannot be named here because the Guardian is available in Germany , became infamous for the killing , for which they were sentenced to life in prison in 1993 .
They were released in 2007 and 2008 .
But Alexander Stopp , the lawyer for the two men , noted that Germany 's courts allow a criminal 's name to be withheld in news reports once they have served a prison term and a set period has expired .
" They should be able to go on and be resocialised , and lead a life without being publicly stigmatised " for their crime , Stopp told the New York Times .
" A criminal has a right to privacy , too , and a right to be left alone . "
German editors of Wikipedia , which is available in multiple languages around the world , have already removed the killers ' names from the German - language version about the victim , Walter Sedlmayr .
But Stopp has also filed suit in German courts to demand that the Wikimedia Foundation , which funds and runs Wikipedia , remove their names from the English - language article .
In fact Wikipedia administrators – the unpaid group that helps oversee the running of the site – have been discussing the challenge for more than a year .
But there is deep disagreement about whether the individuals ' German - determined right to privacy overrides the US First Amendment .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , an online civil liberties group , said in a bulletin on Thursday that " he who controls the past , controls the future " – intentionally echoing George Orwell 's 1984 , in which the government controls the records of the past in order to control the population .
Jennifer Granick , a lawyer for the EFF , wrote : " This slogan from Orwell 's Ministry of Truth is anathema under US law , which takes it as an article of faith that people must be allowed to publish truthful information about historical events .
A foreign power should not be able to censor publications in the United States , regardless of whether doing so suits the country 's domestic law .
" At stake is the integrity of history itself .
If all publications have to abide by the censorship laws of any and every jurisdiction just because they are accessible over the global internet , then we will not be able to believe what we read , whether about Falun Gong ( censored by China ) , the Thai king ( censored under lèse majesté ) or German murders .
Wikipedia appears ready to fight for write once , read anywhere history , and EFF will be watching this fight closely . "
The English - language Wikipedia article about Sedlmayr notes that the details of the killers ' names are available from a number of online sources in Germany .
Floyd Abrams , a prominent First Amendment lawyer who has represented the New York Times , told the paper that every judge on the US Supreme Court would agree that the Wikipedia article " is easily , comfortably protected by the First Amendment " .
But Germany 's courts have come up with a different balance between the right to privacy and the public 's right to know , Abrams said , and " once you 're in the business of suppressing speech , the quest for more speech to suppress is endless " .
The German law springs from a decision of Germany 's highest court in 1973 , which has led to publications there referring to people whose convictions are " spent " are as , for example , " the perpetrator or , Mr L "
But the German duo may discover that their attempts to remove their names from the electronic record has precisely the opposite result – a phenomenon known online as the " Streisand effect " , after the singer , whose attempts to remove pictures of her beach house from online records outraged people , who then copied the pictures and distributed them over the internet .
Michael Godwin , the general counsel of the Wikimedia Foundation , said the foundation " does n't edit content at all , unless we get a court order from a court of competent jurisdiction … if our German editors have chosen to remove the names of the murderers from their article on Walter Sedlmayr , we support them in that choice . "
But , he added : " The English - language editors have chosen to include the names of the killers , and we support them in that choice . "
Wikipedia , as one of the top - ranking sites for information from many searches , is often a key source of information about events or people .
It has reined in editing on biographies of people who are still alive after a number of embarrassing incidents where people 's details were altered to create libels .
And when David Rohde , a New York Times reporter , was seized by the Taliban in Afghanistan , the co-founder of Wikipedia , Jimmy Wales , personally appealed to the site 's editors to keep details about it quiet .
Yet the information was available on other smaller sites .
Wikipedia has more than 12 m articles , including 3 m in English , but has just 30 staff – and Godwin comprises its entire legal staff .
The killers ' lawyer contacted Wikimedia about both men , citing cases since 2006 that had suppressed publication of their names in Germany .
He has won a default judgment against Wikimedia for one of the men in a German court , and last month sent the foundation a letter regarding the other , whose case against Wikimedia is pending .
" The German courts , including several courts of appeals , have held that our client 's name and likeness cannot be used any more in publication regarding Sedlmayr 's death , " he wrote .
Wikimedia told Stopp it questioned the relevance of any judgments in the German courts , since , it said , it has no operations in Germany and no assets there .
Based on surveys and professional experience , she estimates that as many as half of all alcoholics are high - functioning types .
The abuse can go on for decades until and unless some alcohol - related crisis occurs , like being arrested for drunken driving , exposed for having made unwanted sexual advances or being asked for a divorce when their spouses can no longer tolerate the abusive drinking .
Or , like Ms. Benton , they may seek help after recognizing that no matter what they try , they are unable to drink normally and fear that sooner or later their luck will run out .
Many well - known people have publicly acknowledged their battles with alcohol and entered recovery before their lives were destroyed .
Among those listed by Ms. Benton are Betty Ford , the astronaut Buzz Aldrin , the actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Mary Tyler Moore , the actor Robin Williams , the singers Keith Urban and Eric Clapton , the football legend Joe Namath and former President George W. Bush .
But there are millions of others  including dentists and doctors , professors and teachers , lawyers and judges , journalists and authors , firemen and C.E.O. ’s of major companies  who work for years while abusing alcohol , sometimes putting their lives , and the lives of others , at great risk .
Surgeons have been known to operate with shaking hands , yet colleagues who knew or suspected that alcohol abuse was the cause failed to confront the doctor .
Employees who suspect a problem often cover up for their bosses .
Ms. Benton emphasized that people in positions of power are often the hardest to detect and help because they tend not to be closely supervised at work , they are assumed to be able to deal successfully with the pressures of their jobs , their high pay enables them to escape the financial consequences of excessive drinking , and they see drinking as their reward for hard work .

An Indian villager has used a hammer and chisel over the span of 14 years to carve a tunnel through a rocky mountain so that he could park his truck in front of his house .
" I could not park my truck near my house since the mountain blocked my path , " said 53 - year - old Ramchandra Das , who lives in eastern Bihar state 's Gaya district .
Mr Das said the fear of thieves stealing his truck prompted him to work on the tunnel all by himself after authorities refused help .
" I had to leave my truck miles away , so I decided to do something about it myself , " Mr Das said .
Local villagers , who had to trek for miles to get around the mountain , are using the tunnel to reach their farms , and praising Mr Das for his work .
" We rarely come across a man who can work so hard to achieve his goal , " said Prabhat Kumar Jha , a local government official .

A plan that forces people to buy insurance , and then offers no affordable alternative , is n't reform at all , but the opposite .
AFTER MONTHS of rancorous right - wing complaints about a government " takeover " of the health care industry , a proposal for a " public option " has made it into proposed legislation for health care reform under consideration in both the House and Senate .
But the public option is so scaled back that it 's barely public -- and it can hardly be called an option for most of the millions of uninsured in the U.S .
The House version of health care legislation is supposed to be more " radical " than the Senate's , and closer to what proponents of reform have long pressed for .
But the 1,990 - page bill unveiled by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi October 29 shares all the hallmarks of proposals that put the interests of the medical - insurance - industrial complex before those of ordinary people .
Liberals like Rep. Anthony Weiner admit that the public option -- a government - run program to provide health insurance for people who are n't covered through an employer plan -- has been whittled down to a shadow of what they first envisioned .
Nancy Pelosi discusses health care legislation alongside ( left to right ) with Barney Frank , Harry Reid and Chris Dodd
According to a Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) study of the House bill , only 6 million Americans would be enrolled in the public option by the time it 's fully phased in , in 2019 .
That 's just 2 percent of the 282 million Americans younger than 65 ( who are n't covered by Medicare ) .
The CBO explains that the low numbers are in large part because the plan " would typically have premiums that are somewhat higher than the average premiums for the private plans . "
" Somewhat higher " prices for the government - run public option ?
If that 's the best the Democrats can do , why bother with reform at all ?
On top of this , conservatives are pushing for " opt-outs " ( giving individual states the right to opt out of offering the public option ) and " triggers " ( under which the public option would only go into effect if no insurance option exists at a given price level in a particular state ) -- and the Obama administration is indicating that it 's open to these proposals .
Leaving the decision to individual state governments would cancel out what little effect the public option could have as a national alternative .
Why all the compromises and retreats ?
" The concern was that the public option would destabilize the bulk of private insurance , " economist Karen Davis , president of the Commonwealth Fund , told the Associated Press .
Under the House plan , though , Davis says , the industry has nothing to worry about .
" It 's not going to be taking away the insurance industry 's core business , " Davis concluded .
This is a far cry from what Obama promised during a 2007 campaign debate .
" My emphasis is on driving down the costs , taking on the insurance companies , making sure that they are limited in the ability to extract profits and deny coverage , and the drug companies have to do what 's right by their patients instead of simply hoarding their profits , " he said .
AND THE public option is supposed to be the concession to progressives to get them to swallow the parts of health care " reform " that are outright giveaways to the health care industry , at the expense of ordinary people .
Like the Senate bill , Pelosi 's health care legislation includes a provision that mandates everyone to purchase insurance , with the government providing subsidies to the poor to help them get coverage .
This is a bonanza for the insurance industry - - a government requirement that tens of millions of people buy their defective product .
People who do n't get coverage through their employer -- or who have their health insurance dropped at work because companies will have a further incentive to dump benefits -- will face a painful financial burden meeting the mandate , as the New York Times , a strong proponent of the Democrats ' reform legislation , admitted in an editorial :
A survey by the Commonwealth Fund found that 73 percent of the adults who tried to buy insurance on the open market over a three - year period never bought a plan - - because they could not afford it , could not find a plan that met their needs , or were turned down .
Pending legislation would help some of them by preventing rejections or high charges based on health status and by setting minimum benefit requirements .
But many people who might still find the premiums too high will face an agonizing choice : buy insurance coverage or pay a penalty of hundreds or even thousands of dollars per family if they still decide to forgo insurance .
A plan that forces people to buy insurance , and then offers them no affordable alternative , is n't reform at all , but the opposite .
The federal government is bending over backward to protect the insurance industry 's profits -- and no matter what Obama administration officials say , they 're doing it by requiring workers to pay more for health care than they did before .
FROM THE beginning , the Republicans unleashed an all - out assault on health care reform in any form .
They have n't stopped yet , either .
According to Rep. Virginia Foxx ( R - N.C. ) , the House bill is downright dangerous .
" I believe we have more to fear from the potential of that bill passing than we do from any terrorist right now in any country , " said Foxx .
The insurance industry has given support to these Republican opponents of health care legislation -- from organizing its employees to join right - wing protests at town - hall meetings this summer to issuing reports targeting Democratic proposals as wasteful and expensive .
But the industry also played the other side of the fence .
Its lobbyists have been hard at work shaping Democratic proposals for reform -- to make sure the mandates have as few loopholes as possible and the public option is as restricted as they can make it .
Throughout the discussion of health care , the Obama White House and Democrats in Congress have done everything they can to appease the health care industry -- while cracking the whip to keep liberal supporters in line .
The arguments for compromise are n't directed at Republicans -- or the conservative Democrats who have relentlessly hammered away at any provision that the health care industry does n't approve of -- but progressives .
Now , we 're left with health care legislation in the House that will do more harm than good -- and the final shape of the proposal in the Senate is bound to be even more tailored to the interests of the industry .
In the long run , when this legislation passes -- as it likely will , in some form -- and people feel the full consequences , the fact that it was considered " reform " will contribute to the conservative , pro-business sense that the government can't be put in charge of doing anything .
In reality , the central problem with health care reform as it has emerged in Congress this year is n't that it goes too far , but that it does n't go far enough .
It leaves untouched what is the chief source of the health care crisis -- domination of the system by private companies and their thirst for profit .
A small core of people who support a single - payer alternative - - a government - run system that covers everyone , and cuts out the private insurance industry -- have challenged the half - measures and concessions put forward by Democrats throughout the discussion this year .
Their participation at forums , their demonstrations and their sit-ins helped keep the possibility of an alternative alive .
If congressional Democrats showed any backbone in the health care debate -- for example , by not dumping the public option altogether - - it 's because they felt pressure from below .
One important source of that pressure was the activists who pointed out a real solution to the health care crisis .
The battle for a rational health care system will go on , and the case made for a single - payer system during the debate now can help shape the struggles of the future .
Black Hawk pilots on hero missions are given first priority to land at bases .
Once on the ground , soldiers from the dead soldier 's unit or base often escort each body from a Humvee or an ambulance to the helicopter , at times in the blackness of night , occasionally so soon after the incident that the soldiers who are escorting them are still bloody from the attack that killed their friend .
There , an entourage of soldiers often forms two lines at the helicopter door , and the body passes between them as they give a slow salute .
" The hardest part is when the helicopter takes off , " said Capt .
J.D. Moore , the 1 - 150th 's chaplain , who goes on every hero mission with his unit .
" The dust is swirling around those soldiers , and they 're just standing at attention . "
Mr. Johnston , who is from Carneys Point , N.J. , keeps a record of each soldier he transported : name , unit , hometown and cause of death .
He said he wanted those details so he could someday visit the soldier 's family and tell them he had cared for their loved one , in some small way , when they could not be there .
He often volunteers to transport the soldier 's or contractor 's belongings a few days later , a task called a hero effects mission .
One day in August , Mr. Johnston offered to pick up the personal effects of four soldiers killed in a roadside bombing , but he was told to wait for a general , whom he was transporting that day , to finish a meeting .
Mr. Johnston became more and more upset , insisting that picking up the soldiers ' belongings should be the priority .
" I 'm going to call the general about this , if I have to , " he told his battle captain .
Finally given the go - ahead by the general 's assistant , he flew as quickly as possible to Camp Speicher to pick up 16 black plastic footlockers , eight Army green duffel bags , two folding chairs and a guitar , all of which belonged to soldiers from the First Brigade Combat Team , Third Infantry Division of Fort Stewart , Ga .
Last names were stenciled on the ends of the duffel bags : BOUCHARD , DOYLE , FUHRMANN , SEAMANS .
But the guitar case , black and battered and taped shut with green duct tape , bothered Mr. Johnston the most .
On it was an America West Airlines luggage tag with Nathan Bouchard 's name and his parents ' address in Arizona written on it .
