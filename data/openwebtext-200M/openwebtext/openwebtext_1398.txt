In my last column , I asked why Ofcom was so willing to surrender oversight of the BBC by allowing the broadcaster to opt into a DRM scheme that put British telly rules into the domain of a cartel of offshore entertainment giants .
Truth be told , I think I know the answer : Ofcom 's worried that if the US media giants ( as well as sport leagues and other major rightsholders ) make good on their threat to boycott unrestricted high - def television , the ensuing absence of " good content " will stop you from upgrading your receiver .
If enough people refuse to upgrade , it will be politically difficult to complete the " analogue switchoff " ( termination of all non-digital TV broadcasts ) in 2012 .
Nothing upsets a voter like a broken telly , after all .
Why does anyone care about analogue switchoff ?
Spectrum .
The last major British spectrum auction was one of the most successful money - raising exercises in the history of world government , with more than £ 50 bn coughed up by telecoms companies for 3G licences .
As government struggles to patch the yawning pits in its balance sheet , another £ 50 bn would be most welcome .
And , more importantly , the failure to realise the expected windfall would be fatal to the career of any civil servant who could be blamed for it .
The problem of how to get punters to replace their tellies is a hard one .
TVs tend to enjoy second and third lives in the kids ' rooms , in the garage or in the shed .
Chucking them out — or even buying Freeview boxes for all of them — requires major carrot ( Freeview is free ) and stick ( analogue switchoff makes your set obsolete ) , and it 's never a sure thing .
The history of earlier changeovers is a colourful one .
My favourite example is the US colour TV transition .
In the mid-1950s , the US regulator and NBC ( a broadcaster whose parent company , RCA , made colour sets ) began the process of rolling out colour broadcast apparatus across the nation .
This was a substantial investment , and in order to recoup it , the broadcasters would need to see an increase in the number of viewers ( this being before practically every American household owned a TV – penetration in 1955 stood at 64.5 % ) and a higher rate from advertisers for reaching those viewers , on the strength of the new possibilities opened up by colour adverts .
But there was a problem : there was practically no colour programming .
Broadcasters did n't want to commission colour broadcasts to transmit to a nation of black - and - white sets ; viewers did n't have any reason to switch their sets to colour if everything being aired was in black - and - white .
There was one source of ready - made colour material that could have gone out over the airwaves : Hollywood had been shooting feature films and accompanying short subjects in colour for decades and had amassed a prodigious back - catalogue of material that might have jumpstarted the colour TV transition .
There was another problem , though : the studios hated TV , feared it , and would like to have seen it dead and dusted .
It was the competition .
Until Walt Disney decided to build Disneyland , that is .
The Walt Disney Company came through the second world war as a publicly listed firm , and Walt spent the next decade chafing against shareholder control and squabbling about spending with his brother Roy , the adult in their partnership .
When Roy refused to open the company coffers to him for the $ 17 m he needed to embark on a mad scheme called Disneyland , the company instead raised millions by opening their vaults to ABC , a broadcaster .
In 1961 , the Disney show moved to NBC , where its mission became the promotion of colour TV .
The programme was eventually retitled Walt Disney 's Wonderful World of Color , and each episode featured subjects that were apt to make the black - and - white viewer feel like she was missing out on something special , indeed .
My favourite segment from those days is something called The Spectrum Song , which was presented by the character Ludwig Van Drake ( himself a remix of the Nazi war criminal and rocket scientist Werner Von Braun , whose reputation Disney had helped to rehabilitate with TV specials that presented the former SS Sturmbannführer as a cuddly , daffy scientist who would help America win the space race ) .
In it , Von Drake sits down at a piano keyboard whose keys have the " octave " of colour – red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo , and violet ( yes , it 's an octave with seven members ! ) – and he sings a song that names all the colours and the colours that they can be combined to make .
As he names the colours , they shoot out of the organ and dance around the screen ( the whole video is available on YouTube – watch it before Disney copyright - nukes it from orbit ! ) .
The best part is the version so that people with black - and - white TVs do n't feel left out : the keyboard 's saturation fades to monochrome , and Von Drake begins to play and sing : " Black , black , grey , grey , black , black , black , white , black , grey , " and so on .
And there you have it : a cuddly duck based on a fearsome Nazi , gently taunting the technological refuseniks who would n't stump up for the next generation in colour TV .
It 's hardly the most plausible way to get a TV transition , but it certainly has more plausibility than crippling our sets and handing over our cultural regulation to a foreign cartel as a means of getting there .
Austin Plane Crash Pilot May Have Raged Against IRS in Suicide Note Officials : Pilot , two others killed as plane hits IRS office building .
Feb. 18 , 2010  -- A
Texas pilot flew a small plane into an Austin office complex today and authorities are investigating links to a hate - filled note found on the Internet , telling the IRS to " take my pound of flesh and sleep well . "
Investigators are trying to determine whether Andrew Joseph Stack , the man identified by authorities as the pilot of the plane , is the same person as " Joe Stack , " the name signed to the online rant that warns , " Desperate times call for desperate measures . "
The office building complex where the plane crashed houses IRS offices employing about 190 people .
The Austin Fire Department has concluded its search of the building and located the remains of two victims who have not yet officially been identified .
Police earlier said Stack died in the crash and two other people were taken to the hospital -- though later it was not clear whether or not those were the two people whose remains were found .
One of the injured was taken to the Brook Army Medical Center 's burn unit .
Referring to the missing person , Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo said , " The prospects are not very positive for this person at this time . "
Watch " World News with Diane Sawyer " tonight at 6:30 ET for more on the pilot 's suicide mission .
The online note appears to have a taken responsibility for the attack on the IRS in an anger - fueled rant that was posted online and was signed signed " Joe Stack ( 1956-2010 ) " .
Federal officials investigating the note believe it have been written by Stack and consider it evidence , a sort of manifesto to help understand motive .
The web page has been taken down at the request of federal authorities .
The note was titled " Well Mr. Big Brother IRS Man … take my pound of flesh and sleep well . "
It details years spent working and paying taxes , but not reaping the benefits of what he considered to be a functional government .
" I choose to not keep looking over my shoulder at ' big brother ' while he strips my carcass , I choose not to ignore what is going on all around me , I choose not to pretend that business as usual wo n't continue ; I have just had enough , " the note reads .
" I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be white washed and ignored that the American zombies wake up and revolt ; it will take nothing less , " he wrote .
While firefighters battled the huge blaze at the office complex , other firefighters were working to contain a fire at Stack 's house , which he apparently touched off before heading for his plane .
The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed today that the plane , a Piper Cherokee , took off from Georgetown Municipal Airport around 9:40 a.m .
The FAA said the pilot did not file a flight plan or communicate with air traffic controllers once in the air .
President Obama Notified of Austin Plane Crash
Department of Homeland Security officials were quick to say they did not believe the crash was an act of terrorism , but White House officials said both President Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano were notified about the crash , and Norad launched two jet fighters to patrol over Austin as a precaution .
Eyewitnesses who saw the plane slam into the building said the pilot appeared to be in control of the plane in the moments before the crash .
" It hit it and the strange thing was the engine seemed to me to running at full power .
It did n't seem like the plane was in trouble .
It was going full blast .
It 's not a very fast airplane , but this thing was really moving fast , " pilot Jerry Cullen told ABC 's Austin affiliate KVUE .
Beth Jones told ABCNews.com that she was headed downtown on Highway 183 when she spotted the plane overhead and immediately noticed how low it was flying .
" The plane was just coming down , " she said .
" He was so low you could actually see him in the plane . "
She said the plane flew " just straight , right in " to the complex .
Dawn Clopton , Austin Fire Department division chief , said the impact engulfed several floors of the building in flames .
In the apparent suicide note , the author rages against everyone from President George W. Bush to deceased New York Senator Patrick Moynihan .
Near the end , he takes aim at Austin accountant William Ross , blasting him for failing to warn him about $ 12,700 in his wife 's unreported income .
" Ross knew all along this was missing and I did n't have a clue until he pointed it out in the middle of the audit , " the note read .
" By that time it had become brutally evident that he was representing himself and not me . "
Reached at his office hours after the crash , Ross confirmed to ABCNews.com that a man with the same name as Joe Stack was a client of his last fall and that Stack did fire him as an accountant after he was audited .
They had worked together for about a year .
" I 'm shocked , " Ross said after being told that not only was Stack being eyed as the suspect in the crash , but that Ross himself was named in the apparent suicide note .
" Wonderful , " he muttered shortly after .
Ross said he knew very little about Stack or his wife , only that they seemed like regular clients .
" I really did n't know the man , " Ross said .
" You have people that are annual type of clients .
You see them once a year . "
The domain service provider for the angry letter is Tucows , Inc. , based in Toronto .
The page hosting the suicide note appears to have been last updated today at 10:12 a.m. right around the time of the crash .
Data shows the author apparently began work on the note two days ago .
The note detailed attempts to get ahead in life and the setbacks that always seemed to follow , the never realized dream of becoming a prosperous independent engineer , a divorce , the dwindling of his retirement funds .
" If you 're reading this , you 're no doubt asking yourself , ' Why did this have to happen ? '' he wrote .
" The simple truth is that it is complicated and has been coming for a long time . "
Neighbor Natalie Kunkel told ABC
News that she used to socialize with the Stacks and their daughter Margot , swimming with them at a community pool .
In the summer of 2008 , the family seemed to withdraw and become " noticeably less social . "
" I can't believe how he just cracked like that , " Kunkel said .
Albert Hutchins , who lives two doors down from Stack but did not know the family , told ABC News that he heard a loud noise and the windows in Stack 's house exploded .
The fire was so intense , he said , that he could feel the heat just standing on his porch .
Hutchins said he saw the man 's wife and daughter leave the house in the morning before the explosion .
He confirmed that Stack 's wife 's name is Sheryl – the same name as the wife mentioned in the " Joe Stack " suicide note .
Austin Plane Crash Directed at IRS
Cullen described the plane as a blue and white Piper Cherokee , a plane he used to use in flying lessons .
" I thought it was going to hit me for a second .
It was flying right across the top of the trees .
It went right across the building and slammed directly between the first and second floors , " he said .
Emergency officials swarmed over the scene , which left the building a smoking hulk of shattered glass .
Two people were taken to a hospital and one person was unaccounted for .
The building was located on the 9400 block of Research Boulevard , located along a major highway that runs through Austin .
ABC News ' Luis Martinez , Lisa Stark , Matt Hosford , Miriam Smith , Stephen Splane and The Associated Press contributed to this story .
For evolution to take place , you need DNA or RNA to change through mutation , providing the variations for natural selection to select .
Right ?
Well , it may be more complicated than that .
A new study suggests an exception : prions , the infectious protein bits that can cause degenerative brain diseases like mad cow disease .
In a paper in Science , researchers document these lifeless structures evolving , despite the fact that they lack any DNA or RNA .
Study leader Charles Weissmann and his team transferred prions from brain cells to other kinds of cells and watched as certain members of the prion population adapted to the new environment and took over , out - competing their brethren .
When he transferred the prions back to brain cells , the ones most adapted to brain living got the upper hand and increased in number as they out - competed the prions that had adapted to other cells .
Weissmann argues that this shows Darwinian evolution can go even further than we thought :
" In viruses , mutation is linked to changes in nucleic acid sequence that leads to resistance .
Now , this adaptability has moved one level down - to prions and protein folding - and it's clear that you do not need nucleic acid ( DNA or RNA ) for the process of evolution " [ BBC News ]
.
In diseases like mad cow and the human version of it , Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease , proteins in the brain go awry .
Mammals produce the normal protein cousins of infectious prions as part of normal cell development , but during infection , misfolded or warped proteins can convert normal host prion protein into its own toxic , misfolded form .
When this happens enough times , massive tissue and cell damage can occur [ Popular Science ]
.
This pattern of warping proteins could be the key to how this DNA - less evolution occurs , the researchers propose .
When a prion converts a normal protein , it typically forces it into the same structure as itself , but at a low probability , other variant structures result .
The population of these variants can then expand or contract based on selective pressures [ Ars Technica ]
.
This appears to happen more quickly when the prions are transferred to a new host , as happened in previous research when scientists moved prions from sheep to mice — the more virulent variants got a chance to take hold .
Given the problems today with bacteria and viruses evolving drug resistance , the idea of evolving prions seems like more bad news .
But , taking a note from DISCOVER blogger Carl Zimmer 's " Evolving Viruses to Death , " perhaps doctors could use prions ' strength against them :
Since infectious prions need their normal cousins to feed their own replication and evolution , therapies that limit the supply of normal prion proteins could essentially starve the degenerative cycle that makes those illnesses so effective at killing their hosts [ Popular Science ]

Video : Laser fusion
Fusion experiments at the National Ignition Facilty use a two - stage process called inertial confinement .
First , clusters of laser beams are fired into opposite ends of a metal cylinder called a hohlraum ( pictured ) , which contains a fusion fuel pellet .
In about 15 nanoseconds , the hohlraum reaches about 3.3 million °C , yielding an intense burst of X rays .
This burst implodes the target , compressing its core to the density needed for fusion ( Illustration : Lawrence Livermore National Security , LLC / Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory / Department of Energy )
The world ’s largest laser is approaching the long - sought goal of igniting a fusion reaction that produces more energy than the laser delivers .
Lasers are intended to do this by super - heating a fusion fuel pellet until it implodes , heating and compressing its central core to the temperatures and pressures needed for nuclear fusion .
Past experiments have been plagued by irregular implosions that wasted most of the input energy .
But now , researchers led by Brian MacGowan of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California have managed to squeeze targets of material into spheres rather than pancakes or more lopsided shapes , paving the way for future attempts at fusion .
Advertisement
The work was performed at Livermore ’s 192 - laser beam National Ignition Facility ( NIF ) , which began operating in 2009 .
The team used targets that did not contain the key ingredients for fusion – two isotopes of hydrogen known as deuterium and tritium .
But the symmetrical implosion of the targets suggests that NIF should be able to ignite fusion with laser pulses of 1.2 to 1.3 megajoules – well below its full 1.8 - megajoule capacity .
“ From everything we can see , we ’re on the right path here , ” Jeff Wisoff , a top NIF manager told New Scientist .
Researchers spent last year slowly cranking up the output of the laser , ultimately reaching a total energy of more than 1 megajoule .
Now they ’re pausing to mount new instruments on the 10 - centimetre - thick aluminium target chamber and to install giant concrete doors to contain neutrons they expect to produce in future fusion experiments .
In a few months , they will begin testing a series of new targets designed to assess beam interactions and compression .
If all goes well , they could try for fusion ignition by the end of the year .
I ’ve been trying to use Scala more and more so I can gain some experience and exposure to it .
A couple of weeks ago , I wrote a Scala log parser for Ruby on Rails .
It is terribly newbie -ish – the classes are mutable and it ’s disorganized .
It ’s a mess .
Jorge Ortiz from the Scala mailing list was kind enough to rewrite it in a more Scala style .
It completely blew my mind how terse Scala can become when written correctly .
It bothered me , however , dealing with regular expressions the way that I did .
The Java interface is pretty clumsy and nowhere near as clean as regular expression pattern extraction in Perl or Ruby .
As it turns out , it ’s surprisingly easy to extract text using Regular Expressions in Scala .
Throw away Pattern.compile !
Check out this hotness below :
First , let ’s import Scala ’s regex package :
import scala.util.matching .
Regex
Now we declare a regular expression to match against .
We can do this one of two ways :
val LogEntry = new Regex ( " " " Completed in ( \d+ ) ms \( View : ( \d+ ) , DB : ( \d+ ) \ ) \| ( \d+ ) OK \ [ http://app.domain.com(.*)\?.* " " " )
I use triple quotes here to signify that I am creating a raw string .
A raw string means that I do not need to escape characters like the \ character .
If I did n’t do this , I ’d be forced to use strings like “ \\d + ” .
Believe it or not , that extra slash throws me off .
Just goes to show that I have written way too many parsers .
Alternatively , I can declare a new Regex by doing this :
val LogEntry = " " " Completed in ( \d+ ) ms \( View : ( \d+ ) , DB : ( \d+ ) \ ) \| ( \d+ ) OK \ [ http://app.domain.com(.*)\?.* " " " .r
Strings have a method called “ r ” , which will convert it to a Regex object .
I ’m not sold on this syntax at the moment , since it does n’t play well with eyeball scans , but I ’m putting it here for those folks that absolutely need to save characters .
There ’s nothing really special here yet .
The next step is REALLY cool :
val line = " Completed in 100 ms ( View : 25 , DB : 75 ) | 200 OK [ http://app.domain.com?params=here] "
scala > val LogEntry ( totalTime , viewTime , dbTime , responseCode , uri ) = line
totalTime : String = 100
viewTime : String = 25
dbTime : String = 75
responseCode : String = 200
uri : String =
The local variables totalTime , viewTime , dbTime , responseCode and uri are now bound to the values we want to extract from the original line !
The regular expression value defines an unapplySeq method .
I ’m not quite good enough at Scala to tell you in any definite terms what that means , except that you can use the code in a pattern match :
line match {
case LogEntry ( totalTime , viewTime , dbTime , responseCode , uri ) => {
/* Process the data */
// do something with totalTime .
toInt
// do something with viewTime .
toInt
// etc ...
}
case _ => //
Do nothing
}
Because you can use a pattern match , and patterns will be be matched in the order of definition , this means that you can create several regular expressions representing lines you want to extract , then process them easily in using pattern matching .
Pretty powerful stuff .
What would really make my day would be if someone knew how I could extract the values totalTime , viewTime , and dbTime as integers and not have to do a conversion – I ’m already matching with \d +.
Ideas ?
Twitter 's got a new plan to make money from its ultrapopular micropublishing system – copy Google 's lucrative search ads – according to All Things D .
The idea is that Twitter will let advertisers sign up to have their ads show up as tiny 140 - word posts when users search through Twitter or through other search engines that use its API .
As Peter Kafka describes it :
A search for , say , “ laptop , ” may generate an ad for Dell .
The ads will only show up in search results , which means users who do n’t search for something wo n’t see them in their regular Twitterstreams ....
The services will have the option of displaying the ads , and Twitter will share revenue with those that do .
That 's a fine way to start , because it wo n't really interfere with the current reading and publishing of the system , and allows the company time to tune its algorithms .
Google 's tech juggernaut runs on text ads , and still makes some 60 percent of its more than $ 20 billion annual revenue from these kinds of contextual ads placed next to search results – the first ad product it ever introduced .
Google makes about a third of its money from its AdSense program , which lets publishers sign up and have little text ads run on their websites .
That kind of program is the logical next step for Twitter , allowing users to sign up to have , say , every 10th post be an ad placed through Twitter .
That ad is related to something the user is talking about ( an ad for a nearby restaurant if a user is talking about a neighborhood ) , or simply a branded ad placed because the advertiser likes a particular Twitterer 's audience .
While that might be more lucrative for Twitter , it would certainly be a larger change and could alienate users .
So that makes starting with search ads – something nearly all net users are comfortable with and expect – a smart place for Twitter to start , even if there is n't all that much searching going on .
Pundits and tech journalists have been wondering for years when and how Twitter would make money .
Add this plan to the current recurring millions it gets from licensing its real - time streams to Microsoft and Google , and Twitter has a pretty good answer .

With the Recent release of 2012 at the cinemas there is a massive hype circulating the world .
The hype is that in two years ( 21/12/12 to be exact exact ) the world will end .
On this date the Mayan Long Count Calendar ends and theorist believe that this spells the end of the world by means of cataclysmic disasters .
With this in mind I thought I would write this list of Bizarre Apocalypse Scenarios .
These are all certainly possible end of world events , and they supplement the previously published list of Mass Extinctions that would Really Suck .
10 Impending Disaster of Planet X
This one started life as an archaeological find .
A mysterious clay tablet was found in the Middle East years ago , made by the Sumerians ( earliest inhabitants of middle east ) .
Upon this tablet was a depiction of something that looked like our solar system ; all the planets were there , and all of them were rotating around the sun .
But there were 11 celestial bodies .
Now we know there are only 9 planets .
Maybe one of them was our moon or the recently discovered mini-planet Sedna ?
But where did the 11th come from ?
At the same time astronomers were perplexed by a strange force in the outer solar system .
It seemed as though the outer planets were being pulled out of their orbit .
Something massive must be out there .
These combined findings led to the theory of the mysterious planet X .
Planet X is predicted to be 100s of time larger than Earth and to have a massive orbit of about 3,600 years .
When it comes through the inner solar system it could cause cataclysmic disaster upon our planet .
It is so massive that it could turn our poles upside down , slow down the earth ’s rotation or even stop it .
If it gets close enough it could even peel the earth ’s crust off , or push us into the sun .
All bad scenarios .
9 Runaway Greenhouse Effect
Here is one we ’re heading straight for right now .
In a few decades our climate may just go completely mental .
Temperatures might rise rapidly , melting the ice caps , turning our planet ’s climate into something comparable to that of Venus ’ .
We all know about global warming ; for the past 10 years you have n’t been able to open a newspaper without reading something about it .
But The Runaway Greenhouse Effect is basically what will happen if we reach that point of no return .
As temperatures rise water evaporates , which makes the atmosphere thicker , which in turn traps in more heat , which causes more water to evaporate – a chain reaction .
It will really become similar to Venus ’ atmosphere , because that is exactly what is happening there .
The atmosphere is so thick that solar heat never escapes so it just keeps getting hotter .
And there is nothing to stop it .
Just like there will be nothing stop it here on Earth .
The threshold could happen as soon as 2015 .
The polar ice caps hold trillions of tons of C02 , trapped in tiny bubbles of ancient air .
If this is released then it could literally break the atmosphere .
It could cause the initial rapid temperature rise and start the water vapor reaction .
We could possibly be heading for a world where tin and lead would melt instantly in our atmosphere .
When all the water is trapped as an evaporate , it is too hot to support 99 % of all life , and we humans can do nothing to stop it .
8 Fine Tuning of the Universe
Is the world we live in and perceive real ?
Like the movie ‘ The Matrix ’ are we just a simulation ?
Perhaps we ’re being played out by a superior alien race ; watching us on a T.V. or controlling us with a computer .
One of the best pieces of evidence for this theory is the Universal Fine Tuning factor .
The fact that the universe is so precisely tuned to support life is a huge astronomical coincidence .
I do n’t just mean animal or plant life ; I mean all life essentially - stars , black holes , galaxies , even atoms and particles .
The entire universe seems to be fine tuned .
A British Cosmologist , Fred Hoyle , was the first to realize the implications of this ‘ coincidence ’ .
You see there is a very peculiar thing about the fundamental constants ( Atomic masses , the speed of light and all that ) , in that if they were slightly different , everything would n’t exist .
Take the strong force inside atomic nuclei .
If the force were just slightly stronger , it would boost up the burning of stars so much that they would explode only seconds after they were formed .
We would n’t have a sun – or even a planet .
If on the other hand the force were a tad weaker , it would be too weak to hold together elements like the heavy hydrogen isotope deuterium .
Stars would n’t light up , and we would n’t be here either .
And the same goes for everything else .
Slightly more or less of any constant and it wo n’t work .
So the question is , why are all the fundamental constants tuned to support the universe ?

7 The Infertility Problem
As you will already know , there are lots of men and women out there who cannot conceive .
But did you know that the amount of people who cannot conceive is rising ?
And rising very fast might I add .
So fast in fact that scientists predict it to be a very serious problem for the future of our species .
There are a few theories about why infertility is on the rise .
One is that pollution , or the chemicals in pollution , have over the years caused damage to our cells and in turn our reproductive system .
Another one is that evolution has determined who can have kids and who can’t .
You know through survival of the fittest ?
This one is very complicated to explain so I wo n’t bother .
But in truth it is most likely a combination of lots of things ; these two , diseases etc .
This is a slow extinction .
At first the streets will be a little less crowded , no more traffic jams , it ’s easier to get a house and there are more jobs .
There are also a lot more fertility clinics that are crowded .
People know that there is a problem but think the fertility treatment will help them .
Cut to a few generations later .
The roads are empty , most of the buildings ( including the fertility clinics ) are abandoned .
A few people are still alive but with nobody running things like power plants , treatment plants etc , it has thrown them back to the middle ages .
People are living in small communes , but children are very rare .
And someday , the last child will be born .
Killed off by Non-Swimmers .
6 The Solar Collision
A comet is going to hit the Earth huh .
Pah !
I ’m much more concerned about Gliese - 710 .
Not heard of it ?
I ’m not surprised with a name like that .
It is a Red Dwarf star and you probably can’t see it with the naked eye .
Yet !
As time passes it will become more noticeable .
Then one day it will hit us .
Not directly you understand , but close enough to destroy the solar system .
Either by ripping it apart by gravity or by hitting the Oort Cloud .
The Oort cloud is a huge collection of solar dust , ice and planet sized rocks – millions of them , that surrounds our solar system .
If GL - 710 hits this cloud it would send these planet sized asteroids hurtling in our direction .
Not just a few of them but enough that we would have to defend our planet for thousands of years .
This star is far away so do n’t start panicking just yet .
It would take over a million years .
But GL - 710 is n’t the only star heading towards us .
There are about 8 before this one that will hit our solar system .
The nearest is called Barnard ’s star and will hit us in 10,000 years .
After that there is a twin system called alpha Cen A/B .
This one could pull us in and burn us up , or it could slingshot us out into open space and we ’d freeze .
Or Both .
One things for sure though .
It is very difficult to predict the path of a star so hopefully they will miss by enough not to do any permanent damage .
But do n’t hold your breath .
They would have to miss us by billions of miles .
5 Quantum Vacuum Collapse Inevitability
This one ’s simple enough , scientists will destroy the universe .
I ’m sure you ’ve all heard of the Large Hadron Collider .
It was in the news last year and was deemed a doomsday device because theorists said that it could destroy the planet .
Well they ’re wrong , because it could in theory , destroy the entire universe .
In quantum physics it is predicted that the universe is filled with something called vacuum energy .
Now think of this energy as gunpowder .
It ’s ready to explode , all you need is a fuse .
So scientists built the Large Hadron Collider .
They have recently fixed the LHC .
One day during a collision experiment , the use of specific elements could trigger the quantum vacuum collapse .
Less than a second later the Earth will be wiped out .
It ’s just gone without a trace .
Now a wave of destruction is spreading out through the universe at the speed of light destroying everything in its path .
Nothing will stop it until the universe is completely gone .
Scientists argue that elements smash into each other in nature all the time , and that the universe is still here so there is no risk of this catastrophe .
But what they fail to realize is that the particles they use in the collider are rare .
Such as gold .
Or they play about with elements that are so unstable they do n’t exist in ‘ nature ’ .
Who knows what will happen with those ones .
4 Increase of the Constants
Do you remember what I said about how the universe is fine tuned and that if the constants were n’t exactly right then the universe just would n’t happen ?
Well unfortunately in 2001 physicists discovered something bizarre .
One of these constants , the ‘ fine structure constant ’ seems to be very , very slowly getting bigger .
Surely this ca n’t be true ?
Constants are by definition ‘ constant ’ and should be impossible to change .
This sparked a massive physics debate which still goes on today .
In the meantime more evidence has been gathered that more constants are on the move ; the mass of the proton ; the speed of light ; are all going a bit iffy .
What this means to us is that one day the universe may just collapse .
All the stars will burn up within seconds , light will bend around corners then everything will eventually go dark .
Some truly weird things could also occur ; you could witness buildings turn into liquid rock and metal ; you could see people just start vanishing into thin air ( given that the air is still there because the atmosphere will disappear pretty much instantly ) .
All this sounds too far fetched to believe , but if we take what the scientists have seen to be true , then we are heading to this kind of universe quite soon .
Well …… like a few million years .
3 Vanishing Act
This one is just about as serious as this list will get ( Apart from # 9 ) .
This one comes straight from the mouths of high ranking UN officials , government agencies and scientists , and is locked away among thousands of reports that hardly anyone reads .
There are a lot of figures that float around in these reports and I could reel them off one by one but it would take ages .
Basically it says in three generations there will be half the population on Earth as there is now .
And it will keep declining .
No its not a virus , there is no prophecy saying that a comet will hit the Earth killing 3 billion people .
The truth is as simple as not having enough children .
Decades ago people had to have lots of children .
The main reason was , the more children you had , the more hands you had to help farm lands , work in shops and look after you when you were older .
Modern technology combined with social programs has replaced our need for many children .
We only really have children now because we want them .
The problem now is less and less people want children .
Maybe because of poor finances ; the inability to find a suitable home ; whatever .
More women work now than ever before so they have children later and bear fewer .
50 years ago women had , on average , 5 children .
Today that number is 2.7 .
On average a couple needs to have 2.1 children ( compensating for children that die young ) to ensure the continuation of the species .
The decline is rapidly reaching that crunch point of 2.0 .
When that happens the population of the planet will go down .
Faster then you think .
3 generations from now the population will be 3 billion .
And still falling .
Think of it ,
We could all die out because we just do n’t do enough conceiving .
Breed people !
2 Grain Situation
This one is seriously stupid , but it is taken very seriously among biologists .
Someday our planet could be completely covered in grain .
And I mean absolutely everywhere ; on the beaches ; in the swamps ; through cracks in the pavement .
Sure there will be enough food .
But the only food will be bread .
Grain will overrun all other crops , pushing back all other agriculture , until the entire biosphere is swamped with grain .
Forests will turn into roaming fields of grain and the food chain will break down and all the land on earth will be one endless desert of grain .
Grain dust will cause fires that may burn an entire continent or two , or all the water could be sucked up by the grain causing irreversible damage to our water supplies .
We may even experience an ice age because of the extra C02 in the atmosphere from all the fires .
I know , stupid right ?
I mean taken down by grain .
Well biologists seem to believe that one day the human race is going to create the mother of all GM crops .
With Genetic Modification , you can take out a certain gene , or add another here and there , so that the crop is resistant to certain diseases or insects .
What is predicted however is a Super Grain capable of withstanding anything ; diseases , insects , extreme temperatures .
They will be able to grow in practically any soil , maybe even rocks , and would probably be immune to anything mankind can throw at them .
And it does n’t have to be grain , that was for arguments sake .
It could be anything .
In Canada for instance GM Rapeseed ( canola ) leaked from a test field and into the countryside .
Now Super Rapeseed is shooting up all over Canada .
But it could be anything .
Not just stuff that will make bread or vegetable oil .
What if it turns out to be Cotton .
We ’re totally screwed .
1 Grey Goo Hypothesis
This is my favorite scenario , because its utterly terrifying .
As technology progresses it gets smaller and smaller .
Pretty soon we are going to enter the realms of Nano technology .
In a simple way we are already there .
IBM for instance placed single atoms to spell out the IBM logo .
For this scenario we have to go a little bit into the future , not long , say 10 years .
Nanobots are what I ’m talking about .
They will be microscopic robots designed to do all sorts of tasks , mostly in the medical field where they can seek out and eradicate bacterial infections , repair tissue damage , mend blood vessels .
Lots of things that would be very helpful to everyone .
They will be able to rearrange single atoms and for instance , make water out of sand .
They will be able to take carbon atoms and turn them in diamonds .
They will pick up raw materials and rearrange them into what they need .
Well , obviously they will be extremely difficult to make , being microscopic and everything .
And herein lies the problem .
Scientists realize the only way to make them would be to use the Nanobots themselves .
To make them self replicating .
So each one is a microscopic Nanobot factory .
Here ’s the scary bit .
What would happen if just one of them were accidentally thrown away ?
Well it would pretty much go around changing atoms into robots .
Then those robots would make more , and more , and more , at an exponential rate until the horror has unfolded .
Scientists believe within 72 hours every single atom on earth will be turned into a Nanobot .
All buildings , cars , plants , rocks , the water , animals and yes , even us humans … are now Nanobots .
There it is , an endless sea of grey goo .
And if ever some extra terrestrial were to land on the planet , then they too would be turned into Nanobots .
What ’s even more scary is that scientist are really working on creating Nanobots and are very close to achieving it .

" This trial is about taking smart , green technologies out of the lab and putting them to the test in the real world with a real family , " he said .
" We 're looking for a family with children because we know that kids use technology different to their parents . "
The home is in the old Olympic village in Newington and is powered by rooftop solar panels and a fuel cell that converts natural gas into electricity .
There will be an electric car , organic LED TV , and technology that will enable the family to turn lights and appliances on and off from an iPhone or laptop .
Mr Robertson says the family will be asked to write about their experiences .
He also says the technology might put the family to the test .
" We need someone who can blog , " he said .
" And we 'll probably need a family who 's got a good sense of humour and plenty of patience , because not everything we test in the house we know is going to work perfectly every time .
" This project is a bit like The Jetsons meet Big Brother . "
But Mr Robertson says there will be no cameras , instead energy and water use will be monitored .
The family will be selected in April or May and will move into the house for approximately 12 months from June or July .
It is the first home of its kind to be trialled in Australia .

' Big savings '
Energy Australia says it is hoping to make energy savings of between 20 and 50 per cent in the trial .
Company spokesman Adrian Clark says the trial will help identify the savings that can be made using new technology .
" Time will tell as we do the trial .
That 's why we 're doing a lot of monitoring , but we believe there will be significant savings from the types of appliances in the house , " he said .
" [ We can do it ] also by the customers knowing what they 're using in the house so they can make appropriate decisions . "
A simple matter of incentives : “ Israelis must learn the language of human rights ”
H a’aretz runs today a stunning and thoughtful article about how Israel must learn the language of human rights .
Written by a media consultant and former adviser to the Interior Ministry , Gilad Heimann , the article manages to cut through Israeli social psychology and government hasbara efforts with admirable efficiency .
The core argument is this : Israel does n’t have an image problem , nor an antisemitism problem , but rather a behavioral and conceptual problem in how it is willing to trade for pennies on the dollar , or shekel as the case may be , Palestinian ( and increasingly Israeli ) human rights in favor of “ security ” - based arguments .
Without a fundamental change in Israeli understanding and protection of human rights , it is facing the real “ battle for the country . ”
The subtexts of this article are , as I count them , three .
First , Israel is currently , at least partially , deaf to the language of human rights ( “ Most important , we Israelis must also be taught the discourse of rights .
The better we understand that the world is not willing to accept the continual undermining of human rights for reasons of security , and the more we ourselves adopt the discourse of rights , the easier we will find it to present our viewpoint to the world . ” )
Second , the increasing pressure on Israel in the form of negative media attention , legal battles , nonviolent protests , universal jurisdiction for war crimes , the BDS ( boycott , divestment , and sanctions ! ) movement , and so on , is starting to take a serious toll on Israeli attitudes .
Israelis are accustomed to a small number of brave and well - known “ leftist ” journalists making such arguments , but they find themselves in unfamiliar ideological territory when “ mainstream ” figures such as this guy , or when retired judge Boaz Okon , or when Defense Minister Ehud Barak start to frame the discussion in terms of human rights , nonviolence resistance , apartheid , civic equality , etc .
This shift is the clearest evidence that the goals and methods of the BDS movement are both morally right as well as effective ( a point I credit to Ali Abunimah , @avinunu , via Twitter ) .
Third , even in this positive example of introspection , Palestinians are still not deemed fully human beings .
It is not the case , from the perspective of Gilad Heimann in the article , that Israel must educate itself and defend human rights among the people it dispossesses and occupies because they are living , conscious agents , who are capable of the full range of human emotions , who think and contribute to the world , who bleed and cry when they die , when they are murdered .
Nor should Israel stop violating Palestinian rights because , in violating the rights of human beings , it degrades itself in the process .
No , in his perspective the rights of Palestinians must be protected because “ the more we ourselves adopt the discourse of rights , the easier we will find it to present our [ Israeli ] viewpoint to the world . ”
Despite the important arguments the author raises , this sentiment reflects how far Israeli thinking must still travel to truly grasp human rights .
This article represents the future of debate in Israel , the US , and the wider Jewish community .
You should / must read it .
You should also realize this type of self - awareness is not happening in a vacuum .
We can assist this process — concretely and nonviolently — by supporting the ever - growing boycott , divestment , and sanctions movement .

A grizzly bear Ursus arctos , spotted from the air in Manitoba , Canada Grizzly bears are being spotted in Manitoba , Canada , where biologists say only polar bears are usually found .
Scientists from City University of New York say sightings are increasing .
" Grizzlies would likely hibernate in polar bear maternity denning habitat , " says CUNY 's Linda Gormezano .
They would come out of hibernation at the same time and can kill polar cubs , " warned Ms Gormezano , who has seen the grizzlies from the air .
The researchers first spotted a grizzly bear ( Ursus arctos ) in August 2008 .
" The first time we saw a grizzly we were flying over the middle of Wapusk , counting fox dens , " explained CUNY 's Professor Robert Rockwell , who is also a research fellow at the American Museum of Natural History .
Since then they have examined the records and found no evidence of grizzly bears before 1996 .
Between 1996 and 2008 they found nine confirmed sightings .
In the summer of 2009 , three more were spotted .
The data has been published in Canadian Field - Naturalist .
Pizzlies or grolars ?
The scientists say that the barren landscape north of the Hudson Bay had been thought to be impassable for migrating grizzlies .
But now some have reached Canada 's Wapusk National Park to be rewarded with abundant caribou , moose , fish and berries .
" We do n't yet know if they are wandering or staying - the proof will come from an observed den or cubs - these animals will eventually be residents of this national park , " said Professor Rockwell .
A wild hybrid between a grizzly and polar bear was shot in Canada " The Cree elders we talked to feel that now grizzly bears have found this food source , they will be staying .
" A big question is how to deal with these new residents ...
In Canada , both the polar and grizzly bear are federally listed as species of special concern , " he added .
As grizzly bears move into areas usually populated only by polar bears , hybrids between the two become more likely .
Also known as pizzly , prizzly or grolar bears , these have been bred in zoos .
Their presence in the wild was confirmed by DNA tests after one was shot in Banks Island , in the Canadian arctic .

Our train trip via Russia to North Korea - using an officially closed for foreigners route inside the " Hermit Kingdom "

I scribbled a few more notes on my pad before looking back to Chad .
He was staring at me intently .
At least , so it seemed .
All the built - up prosthetics on his face , the tufts of red and green on the brows and cheeks , and the strange lensing overlay on his eyes made it hard to tell .
I found it a worthy challenge , though : interpreting the patient 's state of mind without the easy crutch of readily understandable body language .
" Let 's go back to what you were saying earlier , " I suggested .
" About this need of yours … this pack urge you feel .
Do you feel like you encounter many others who are experiencing this same impulse ? "
Chad 's inscrutable faux - alien expression seemed to sharpen and focus for a moment .
Then he picked up a writing pad of his own to make a quick note in .
" There 's nothing … impulsive … about it , Charlie , " he said calmly .
" We 're a social species .
The pack organizational layer is essential to the integrity of our society , both in how it governs the families below it and the tribes above it . "
For some reason , I could feel that tic in my left eye returning .
Sometimes , the calm , even tone of voice that Chad always spoke in threatened my own demeanor .
It was almost like …
I pushed the thought away before it could form any further .
" Essential … to a society which you feel you belong in ? "
" Of course I feel like I belong in it , Charlie .
We all should .
You should .
You used to , after all . "
My eye - tremor was making it harder to sort through Chad 's words .
I tried to review my notes but they were suddenly rather swimmy .
" I 'm not sure I understand … "
Chad set his pad back down .
" Let 's not mince words .
It 's because of your pack 's concerns that you 're here , Charlie .
Shaving your fur… the paralytic injections to keep your outer lenses from functioning … "
No , I said .
I tried to say .
No , you 're talking nonsense .
" You … " I managed to get out , but my mouth felt strange .
Gnashy .
Trembly .
" You 're the one …
It 's you . "
Chad raised his paws in the universal gesture for non-threat .
His hands .
His hands .
Not really paws .
Just a costume .
Chad raised his costumed hands : " We just want to help you , Charlie .
Your family , your pack , your tribe .
You 're not meant to run alone . "
" You 're the fucking furry here ! " I managed to shriek .
Then the tremors became too strong and I felt my teeth emerge , breaking through the restraining plugs .
Chad immediately leapt back as the door opened .
Two burly orderlies entered .
" Grab him ! "
I shouted , but they were coming for me .
Their manes flared with exertion as they rushed me .
I could not spring fast enough .
Their paws dug deep , hooked me well and truly .
" Do n't struggle , " one said , as she plunged some sort of needle into my flank .
The other could not conceal a look of … contempt ?
disgust ?
" Why the fuck would someone do this to themselves ? "
Chad snapped his notebook shut .
" Be kind to him .
Social trauma has driven Charlie into a fantasy world where the individual is the unit that matters most .
It makes him desperate to eschew body markers .
He would rather be hairless and alone than furred in a tribe that he believes has hurt him . "
The other shook his head sadly .
" That 's about the most pathetic thing I 've ever heard . "
Then , mercifully , the world closed around me in darkness , as though I were returning to my mother 's pouch .
I will never wake up .
I will never wake up .
I will never wake up .

Alice in Wonderland will not be shown in Odeon cinemas
Mia Wasikowska plays a teenage Alice in Tim Burton 's 3D film Tim Burton 's new film version of Alice in Wonderland will not be screened at Odeon cinemas in the UK , Irish Republic and Italy , the cinema chain says .
The move is in response to the Disney studio's plan to reduce the period in which it can be shown only in cinemas from the standard 17 weeks .
The plan would allow Disney to release the film on DVD at the end of May .
Cinema chain
Vue said today that it had entered a " far reaching " agreement to screen the film on its 69 screens .
And Cineworld cinemas announced last week that they will also show the movie on its release on 5 March .
But Odeon said it would " set a new benchmark , leading to a 12 - week window becoming rapidly standard " .
Odeon 's decision will not affect the film 's Royal premiere on Thursday , which is coincidentally set to take place at the Odeon Leicester Square in central London .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Nor will it affect its plans to show the film in Spain , Germany , Portugal and Austria - territories where Disney intends to observe the normal DVD release window .
Starring Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter , Alice in Wonderland sees the novel 's heroine return as a teenager to the magical kingdom for more surreal adventures .
Inspired by the works of Lewis Carroll , the film also stars Helena Bonham Carter , Anne Hathaway and Little Britain 's Matt Lucas .
The Odeon & UCI Cinema Group is Britain 's largest cinema chain with more than 100 sites nationwide .
Cineworld and Vue are the second and third biggest .
Together they represent just under two - thirds of all cinema screens in the UK .
' Need for exceptions '
It is the amount of time that separates a film coming out in cinemas and its release on DVD that is at the centre in this dispute .
In the UK , the window for theatrical release is 17 weeks .
In the case of Alice in Wonderland , Disney wants to reduce that to 12 .
TOP FIVE UK AND IRELAND CINEMA CHAINS Odeon - 107 sites / 834 screens Cineworld - 74 sites /758 screens Vue - 63 sites /608 screens National Amusements - 21 sites /274 screens Ward Anderson - 24 sites /206 screens Source : UK Film Council Disney told the BBC that one of the main reasons for the decision was to bring the film to customers more quickly , thereby helping to beat piracy .
It said if a cinema stopped showing a film before the 17 - week exclusivity period , the audience did not have a legitimate way to see the movie - potentially leading to piracy .
It said it had agreed to take this approach with a limited number of movies every year in certain countries .
Bob Chapek , Disney 's president of distribution , has said the company remains " committed " to theatrical windows .
However , he believes there is a " need for exceptions to accommodate a shortened time - frame on a case - by - case basis " .
Odeon , though , believes such a move will damage not just its business but that of all cinemas in the UK .
" The negative impact on cinema attendance that such a reduction in the window will have will threaten the continued existence of many cinemas , especially the smaller and medium - sized cinemas . "
Odeon also highlights the additional costs the chain has incurred making its screens suitable for 3D movies .
" Odeon / UCI has invested considerable sums of money , especially in the UK , over the past 12 months to install digital projection systems in its cinemas , " it said .
Opposition " The proposed reduction in the window on a high - profile 3D title like Alice in Wonderland undermines the investment made . "
Disney also faces opposition in Belgium , the Netherlands and the US over its plans for this title .
Anne Hathaway co-stars in the film alongside Johnny Depp
It is not the first time , however , it has attempted to make overtures in this area .
Last year , the company attempted to reduce the theatrical window of Up , the hit Pixar movie named best animated feature at the Baftas on Sunday .
In that instance it dropped its plans after UK exhibitors threatened not to screen another of its titles , A Christmas Carol , later in the year .
Neither is Disney the only studio to have faced opposition over theatrical exclusivity from UK cinema chains .
In 2007 , Odeon and Vue removed Ben Stiller comedy Night at the Museum from their cinemas after 20th Century Fox shortened its theatrical window to 13 weeks .
The Cinema Exhibitors ' Association , the body representing the interests of around 90 % of UK cinema operators , has not commented on this latest case .
Speaking " in general terms " , though , it said it " strongly " supported the maintenance of " a clear and exclusive window between a film 's theatrical release and its release on other platforms " .
" The CEA believes maintenance of the window will ensure that audiences continue to enjoy the widest possible range of films in their intended environment , the cinema theatre . "

Coming soon : a new Iran NIE ?
The Cable is hearing from multiple congressional sources , diplomats , and former officials that the Obama administration is getting ready to finalize a new National Intelligence Estimate that is expected to walk back the conclusions of the 2007 report on Iran ’s nuclear program .
The new NIE has been expected for a while , but now seems to be close to release , perhaps within two weeks or so , according to the pervasive chatter in national - security circles this week .
In addition to the expectation that the new estimate will declare that Iran is on a path toward weaponization of nuclear material , multiple sources said they are being told there will be no declassified version and only those cleared to read the full 2007 NIE ( pdf ) will be able to see the new version .
The Obama administration finds itself in tough situation as it pursues new sanctions against Iran both at the United Nations and using domestic levers .
Many feel the administration needs to correct the record by somehow disavowing the intelligence community ’s controversial 2007 conclusion :
“ We judge with high confidence that in fall 2003 , Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program . ”
The new estimate might not directly contradict that judgment , but could say that while the intelligence community has not determined that Iran has made the strategic decision to build a nuclear weapon , it is seen to be working on the components of a device — a parsing that some would see as too clever by half .
“ It ’s like saying that you ’re not building a car , but you are building the engine , the chassis , the upholstery , ” said one Middle East hand who had no direct knowledge about the estimate ’s contents .
“ It ’s a distinction without a difference . ”
Multiple Hill aides said they expect only a classified version with no public document ; the 2007 estimate included an unclassified version .
They see that move as an effort by the Obama administration not to have the new estimate unnecessarily complicate the ongoing negotiations to seek new sanctions against Iran at the U.N .
David Albright , a nuclear - weapons expert and president of the Institute of Science and International Security , said that the administration might want to avoid a lengthy and complicated public debate about the new estimate ’s conclusions , seeking to prevent the fractious debate that followed the release of the older estimate .
He said the nature of the estimate , which seeks to find consensus between all of the various intelligence agencies , makes it tough to give out enough information to make it bulletproof .
Regardless , he lamented that the administration might not provide some of the information in a public way .
“ They owe it to us to provide clarification of their position publicly , ” he said .
“ Speaking just as a citizen , I want my government to be transparent about something that could potentially involve military strikes . ”
Any clarification would bring the U.S. position more in line with that of with key allies like France and Germany , who have been long arguing for a stronger public position on Iran ’s nuclear program , according to Albright .
A clarification would also help square the U.S. conclusions with the recent IAEA report on Iran that went further than previous reports in expressing concerns about weaponization , he added .
“ The 2007 NIE really hurt things politically for getting sanctions and building momentum and they had to relook at this , ” Albright said .
“ Who knows if was really a mistake ?
It may be what they honestly believed at the time . ”
Any walking back of the 2007 estimate is likely to give Republicans comfort that their longstanding criticism of that report was justified .
A spokesperson for Senate Intelligence Committee ranking Republican Kit Bond , R- MO , told The Cable Bond has long argued the 2007 NIE went too far in suggesting that Iran did not intend to develop weapons .
“ They may intend to , they may not , but the bottom line is that we just do n’t know , ” the spokesperson said .
“ Unfortunately , the NIE gave people a false security by making them think the Intelligence Community assessed there was no intent . ”
The NIE is compiled by the National Intelligence Council , but rollout and classification decisions are ultimately made by Dennis Blair , the director of national intelligence .
Blair ’s office declined to comment .

Polls show that Scott Brown 's supporters in tomorrow 's special election are particularly motivated .
So this strikes an off note .
The Brown campaign is hiring scores of paid temp workers from temp agencies to help staff Brown ’s get - out - the - vote effort , work that ’s typically handled by unpaid volunteers , a Massachusetts temp agency tells me .
Dems are likely to grab onto the use of temp workers to argue that the grassroots energy behind the Brown candidacy is overstated — and contrast it with the massive volunteer effort lining up behind Martha Coakley .
Diamond Staffing , a temp agency in central Massachusetts , circulated an email to other temp agencies telling them that they are sending temp workers to the Brown campaign in response to the campaign ’s request .
The email asked other agencies to send their own workers , according to Joe Asciotti , the president of Reliable Temps , an agency in Agawam .

In a December New York Times op - ed , we called for the full public release of AIG email messages , internal accounting documents and financial models generated in the last decade .
Today , a Bloomberg story revealed that under Timothy Geithner ’s leadership , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York told AIG to withhold details from the public about its payments to banks during the crisis .
This information was discovered when emails between the company and the Fed were requested by representative Darrell Issa , ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
The emails requested by Issa span five months beginning in November 2008 .
If five months of emails reveal information key to our understanding of the aftermath of the crisis , imagine what 10 years of emails could contribute to our understanding of its causes .
We believe the AIG emails and other internal company documents are the ‘ black box ’ of the financial crisis .
If we understand the failure of AIG , we will more fully understand the crisis - what caused it and more importantly how to prevent it from happening again .
The emails today detail the efforts of the Fed to suppress the disclosure of payments made to banks such as Goldman , Sachs Group for reimbursement of their credit - default swap exposure .
When the Treasury Department stepped in , AIG had at least $ 440 billion in credit - default swaps outstanding .
The Fed , led by Tim Geithner , paid Goldman , Sachs Group and other banks 100 cents on the dollar for these instruments rather than negotiating a lower rate closer to the actual value , ( estimated by some to have been as little as 20 cents ) .
In testimony to the Congressional Oversight Panel , Tim Geithner insisted it was necessary to make these payments in full , arguing that even a small downward negotiation would prove catastrophic to the financial sector .
Elizabeth Warren , head of the oversight panel has repeatedly challenged repeatedly this assertion .
Regardless the size of the payments , the Fed ’s request to suppress both their amount and the parties to whole these payments were made would not have come to light without the release of these emails .
Without the rest of the emails , we will be unlikely to fully understand what led to the collapse of AIG and the financial markets .
If we ca n’t understand it , we will be unable to prevent it from happening again .
As such , today we are renewing our request for the full public disclosure of all AIG documents .
We believe the government should put these documents on - line , thereby establishing an open - source investigation that would allow journalists and citizens the opportunity to piece together the story of what happened at AIG and in so doing more fully understand what happened in the broader financial collapse .
AIG — and more specifically its credit - default swaps exposure — was an important contributing factor to the crash of the financial markets .
What sets this company apart from others that played a role in the crisis is that we , the taxpayers , own it .
As we noted in our original piece , US taxpayers bought 80 % of AIG when they bailed the company out with $ 180 billion last year .
As owners of the company , taxpayers are also owners of AIG .
As owners of the company we can demand the release of these documents .
The taxpayer ’s stake in AIG is held by the A.I.G. Credit Facility Trust , whose three trustees are Jill M. Considine , a former chairman of the Depository Trust Company and a former director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ; Chester B. Feldberg , a former New York Fed official who was chairman of Barclays Americas from 2000 to 2008 ; and Douglas L. Foshee , chief executive of the El Paso Corporation and chairman of the Houston branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas .
We call on these three officials ( interestingly all former Fed officials ) to immediately release the documents we request .
The value of these documents , if it were ever in doubt , was certainly proved by today ’s revelations .
Release the emails .

Hurley for really saving Tuesday night 's episode of " Lost . "
It was a stroke of brilliance to have Hurley see dead people , because his interactions with Jacob have been one of the highlights of this season .
He also made this week 's Jack - centric episode a lot more bearable .
Before we get to the real meat of this episode , there was another visit to the alternate timeline .
And just in case it was n't clear before , things are quite different there - seeing as Jack has a teenage son , with whom he has an uneasy relationship ( yes , just like his relationship with his own father ) .
One big , obvious question here :
Who is his mother ?
And , oh yeah , the alternate version of Dogen pops up at a conservatory where Jack 's son auditions .
Back on the island in the " real " timeline , Jacob tells Hurley to get Jack to follow him somewhere so they can help bring someone to the island .
Jack being Jack , he 's hesitant to go , but the words " You 've got what it takes " convince him .
On the way , they encounter the cave where they lived during much of the first season ( remember that ? ) and they find the " Adam and Eve " skeletons , where Hurley puts forth a theory voiced by many fans that they 're castaways having traveled through time .
And since Hurley said this , I 'm guessing that 's wrong .
Jack also reminds us that he found his father , Christian 's empty casket there and smashed it .
" Jack smash ! " is second only to " Hulk smash ! "
There are lots of references to Christian in this episode , including one by Claire , who mentions to Jin that he and " her friend " told her that the Others have her son .
While Claire is tending to his wounds from the trap she set a couple of episodes ago , she also captures one of the Others at her makeshift camp , and he swears that they do n't have her baby .
Right as she 's about to kill him , Jin tells her the truth : Kate took and raised her baby .
Right after this sinks in , she kills her hostage anyway .
Did I mention Claire is off her rocker ?
Realizing this , Jin convinces her to return to the temple with him where the Others are keeping her baby .
( Good news for Kate , who might be next on Claire 's chopping block if she found out the truth . )
He sees that she 's lived like Rousseau in the jungle for three years now and , creepiest of all , has a replacement " baby " in a crib that resembles Norman Bates ' mother at the end of " Psycho . "
Is this a preview of Sayid 's future ?
Tellingly , Sayid was not invited by Jacob to go on this quest with Hurley and Jack .
The two eventually happen upon a lighthouse they 've never seen before , where Hurley was instructed to line up the apparatus inside to 108 degrees ( the total when you add " the numbers " together ) .
Soon , Jack sees what appears to be the church where Jacob met Sawyer as a kid .
Then Jack sees his childhood home , when the lighthouse points to the written name " Shepherd . "
The candidate names , many crossed out , are all there , just like in the cave the Man in Black showed Sawyer last week .
Jack freaks out , demanding answers from Jacob , who is n't in a hurry to show up and dole them out .
So , altogether now - " Jack smash ! "
Who is at 108 degrees ?
Thanks to Jack , we 'll never know .
Could it be ... Desmond ?
Whoever it is , Jacob is n't too torn up about their chances of finding the island when he shows up to inform Hurley that this was all a ploy to get Jack to see the reason why he's here , and to get the two of them away from the temple because someone bad is coming .
The two of them , and not Sayid anymore , I 'm guessing , are still candidates , after all ( no clarity yet on which Kwan is a candidate ) .
Who is that " someone bad ? "
I 'll throw out the strong possibility that it's the Man in Black / the fake Locke , who is also Claire 's " friend . "
I 'll further assume that he's also responsible for the Christian sightings on the island all of these seasons .
However , it still does n't explain where his body went ( and where his casket went in the alternate timeline ) .
As great as it was to find out more about Claire and the candidates , an episode with little or no Michael Emerson or Terry O'Quinn just is n't " Lost " at its best , so I 'll hope for more of them next week .
What did you think ?
What are your theories about the person at 108 degrees , and the mother of Jack 's son ( or do you even care about the alternate timeline at this point ) ?

A federal judge in San Francisco said today that he wants the trial on the constitutionality of Proposition 8 to be videotaped and distributed over the Internet .
" This certainly is a case that has sparked widespread interest , " U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn R. Walker said during a hearing .
" I think a trial can be highly informative . "
If Walker 's view is endorsed , as expected , by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , the legal battle over same - sex marriage will become the first federal trial in nine Western states to be videotaped for public distribution , according to Thomas Burke , a media attorney .
In addition to running the entire proceedings on a delayed basis on YouTube , the videotape would be broadcast at several other federal courthouses , Walker said .
As humanitarian agencies ship food , water and medicine to earthquake - ravaged Haiti , one U.S. company is sending aid of another type : solar - powered audio Bibles .
Officials at Faith Comes by Hearing says 600 " Proclaimer " devices have been shipped to Haiti , where they 'll be able to broadcast holy scriptures in native Haitian Creole to up to 300 people at a time .
" Peoples ' houses are crumbled , their families are shattered and they are living in ruins , " spokesman Jon Wilke said in a statement posted on the company 's Web site .
" Haitians will need that long - term hope and comfort that comes from knowing God has not forgotten them through this tragedy . "
Wilke said there is an " immediate need " for an additional 3,000 devices to be used by disaster relief teams , church groups and ministries .
The devices , which can play scriptures in more than 400 languages , can be used in tandem with a printed Bible to assist " illiterate children and villagers , " according to the company 's Web site .
" Faith Comes By Hearing provides the ability to access our recordings of the Bible and download them from any computer terminal in the world , " the Web site reads .
" Those in the mission field are able to reach more souls than ever before , without literacy being a barrier . "

How to use Snow Leopard ’s new QuickTime Screen Recording feature to record Hulu content for your iPhone
Step 1
Make sure you ’re running Apple ’s latest operating system , Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard .
If you are , then you will notice a new version of QuickTime Player in your Applications folder .
We ’ll be using that in a minute , so just remember where it is .
Step 2
The best way to do a full screen showing of a Hulu show to be recorded by QuickTime Player is to install the Hulu Desktop Application , which you can grab directly from Hulu Labs .
Download and install it .
Note : I ’m not entirely sure if any of what I ’m about to show you is legal or illegal , although I do n’t really see how it ’s much different from setting a TiVO or other DVR to record your favorite show while you ’re out to dinner or to make a VHS copy of a show on TV .
It probably violates some user agreement with Hulu , I would imagine .
I ’m not a lawyer , nor do I play one on TV , I ’m just sharing how to do this if you ever think : “ Hey , I really wish I could record a copy of this Hulu show to watch on my iPhone while I ’m riding to ________ for Labor Day weekend . ”
Step 3
QuickTime does n’t allow you to capture system audio when you are doing a screencast , probably because they want to avoid allowing you to do exactly the type of thing that I ’m showing you how to do in this How to .
In order to get around this little shortcoming of QuickTime , you ’re going to want to download and install SoundFlower .
Although Soundflower ’s installation does n’t ask you to restart your computer once installation is complete , you should go ahead and do so .
Step 4
Go to your System Preferences ( either Apple logo — > System Preferences … or navigate to Applications — > System Preferences ) and select the Sound control panel , choose the Output tab , and select Soundflower ( 2 ch ) , like so :
Note that once you make this change , you will no longer hear any sound from your computer ’s speakers ( because it ’s all being routed to Soundflower .
Also , keep in mind that absolutely * all * sounds that your computer makes are being piped to Soundflower and since we ’re going to be using Soundflower to capture the audio from your Hulu show , you ’re going to want to make sure that every other application that makes sounds is turned off while recording ( this includes Growl notifications , iChat , and even hitting the audio up and down buttons on your keyboard ) .
Step 5
Launch Hulu and queue up the show you want to record .
Pause it .
Choose Hulu Desktop — >
Hide from the menu bar at the top of the screen to temporarily get Hulu Desktop out of your way .
Step 6
Launch QuickTime Player and select File — > New Screen Recording , like so :
Step 7
A new Screen Recording window that is little more than a small black box with a red REC button in the middle will open up .
Click on the little downwards facing arrow and make sure that under the Microphone setting that Soundflower ( 2 ch ) is selected , like so :
Step 8
Click that little red REC button in the middle of the Screen Recording window .
A notice will pop-up saying “ Are you sure you want to start recording the screen ? ” along with instructions telling you that you can stop recording by either clicking on the Stop Recording button in the menu bar or by hitting Command + Control +
Esc simultaneously on your keyboard .
Keep in mind that once you start recording whatever is visible on your screen will be recorded .
We ’ll be making Hulu full screen but should you use any sort of applications with on - screen notifications , like Growl or Google Notifiers , you ’re going to want to make sure that you turn those off .
Once you are sure you are ready , click Start Recording , like so :
Step 9
Click on Hulu Desktop in your Dock to bring that app back to the front now that you ’re recording .
Click on View — > Fullscreen ( Command + F ) in order to have Hulu fill your screen and begin playback .
Walk away and let the show record .
Make a note of how long it is so you know when to come back .
Go walk your dog , take a walk , spend some time with a loved one , or do something to get away from this digital world for a while .
When you return and the show is over , simply hit Command + Control + Esc simultaneously on your keyboard to stop recording .
Step 10
As soon as you stop recording the freshly recorded file opens in QuickTime Player .
You wo n’t be able to hear anything until you go back to the System Preferences and switch the Output back to Internal Speakers ( see Step 4 above ) .
If you had to rewind at the beginning or you forgot the key command at the end and ended up recording some of your onscreen actions , do n’t worry .
Simply hit Command +T to bring up the trim controls for trimming the beginning and end of your video in QuickTime Player , like so :
Step 11
Once you are done trimming your video , select File — > Save As… ( or hit Command + S ) to bring up the save as dialog .
Choose iPhone ( or whatever other output you ’d like ) from the drop down Format menu , name the video , and click Save :
That ’s it you ’re done .
I ’ve not recorded a full show yet , but I have tested this method and it works .
Keep in mind that the screen capture is n’t at a full 29.97 frames per second as most video ; it ’s only recording about eight frames per second , so the video is n’t the smoothest quality and there is some noticable jitter in extremely high action moments of video ( like the 30 seconds or so of ABC ’s Crash Course that I used to test ) .
It ’s not unwatchable , however , especially if you ’re exporting it for watching on a small screen like the iPhone’s .
BrightSideofNews claims that Apple is refusing to accept Intel 's upcoming mobile Arrandale chip which incorporates Intel 's integrated graphics chipset :
According to sources close to the heart of the matter , Apple allegedly refused to adopt Intel 's Arrandale and the Calpella platform in its default form .
In order for Apple to implement Calpella design with their next refresh of Mac mini / MacBook / MacBook
Pro lines ,
Intel will have to provide Apple with the 32nm version without the integrated graphics part .
Again , we cannot confirm the information about the replacement CPU , we only know that Apple rejected Arrandale .
The report has generated some debate in our Waiting for Arrandale thread both due to the untested source of the rumor as well as the technical implications of creating a custom chip just for Apple .
Intel 's addition of integrated graphics into the Arrandale processor comes at an interesting time with the legal battle ongoing between Intel and NVIDIA .
Apple had switched from Intel to NVIDIA chipsets for their most recent line of notebook computers .
The transition from Intel to NVIDIA in that case resulted in significantly improved integrated graphics performance in the latest round of MacBooks and MacBook Pros .
Due to a licensing disagreement with Intel , NVIDIA has since exited the chipset market .
Intel 's new integrated graphics chipset included in Arrandale is said to be a significant improvement over their previous offerings .
Apple , of course , would still be able to offer additional " discrete " graphics cards in their notebooks in conjunction with Intel 's system .
The benefit of a custom graphics - less Arrandale , however , is less clear , though Intel and Apple have been known to collaborate on custom chip designs , as in the CPU found in the original MacBook Air .
The past report had suggested that Intel and Apple were continuing to work on more projects that were " equally aggressive " .
We 're not sure what there is to these claims , though based on timelines , the MacBook Pro line is due to be refreshed in the first half of 2010 .
[ digg - reddit - me ] Gotta say – this lede bugs me :
Republicans will also be invited to the White House this weekend to watch the Super Bowl , as well as to Camp David and other venues for social visits .
The outreach represents a marked shift in both strategy and substance by Mr. Obama and his allies at a time when Democrats are adapting to the loss of their 60 - vote supermajority in the Senate and the president has been losing support among independent voters .
This is typical of the distorting attempts to reporters to fit facts into a preconceived storyline – as it is a rather manufactured bit of evidence that Obama is reaching out .
Events predictable far in advance are portrayed as proof of the story of the day ( e.g. , the loss of the New Jersey and Virginia governorships . )
Oft - reiterated statements become interpreted as responses to events of the day ( e.g. , the White House ’s position on the public option , which remained consistent and unchanged until the final Senate negotiations , and arguably even then . )
Which is why this lede bugs me – as the fact that Obama is inviting Republicans is taken as a response to a new outreach when last year , at this time , the headline was :
Obama to Host Democrats , Republicans at White House Super Bowl Party … The White House says the gathering is another step in the president ’s continuing effort to get to know lawmakers better in hopes of reducing the partisan rancor as they work together on the people ’s business .

New device could make solar cells cheaper .
Tiny rods of silicon ( top ) could lead to cheaper solar cells ( bottom ) .
Credit : T. TAKAHARA / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY
Roll out the micro-carpet — a new solar - cell design based on a blanket of silicon rods could produce electricity at a fraction of the cost of conventional solar devices .
The carpets have yet to be made into a working solar cell , but preliminary measurements of their ability to absorb light and generate current suggest they could become a cheap replacement for existing technology .
The idea behind photovoltaic solar cells is straightforward : when sunlight strikes a material , it dislodges electrons , which start to flow in one direction .
The electrons leave behind empty , positively - charged ' holes ' that move the other way , effectively creating a current .
It 's a simple idea , but it is n't cheap .
The material of choice for cells is often thin silicon wafers , which are efficient at absorbing light but expensive to produce .
Now Harry Atwater and his colleagues at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena have found an alternative that uses one hundredth of the material of current silicon technology .
Using a well - established technique for assembling nanowires on a surface , the researchers grew a ' carpet ' of micrometre - scale silicon rods lined up like hairs standing on end .
They then embedded the rods in a transparent polymer .
Absorbing science
This configuration alone is not enough to absorb light efficiently .
Although the array can absorb light coming in at shallow angles — the angle at which early morning sunlight might strike a solar roof panel , say — light beating down from directly overhead tends to pass between the rods and is lost .
" Not being able to absorb light at noon is n't a great property for a solar cell , " says Atwater .
To solve this problem , the team sprinkled aluminium oxide particles into the transparent polymer .
These particles scatter incoming light so that it bounces around inside the array , increasing the light 's chances of striking a silicon wire .
As a result , up to 85 % of usable incident sunlight can be absorbed effectively , says Atwater .
The team reports its results in Nature Materials1 .
ADVERTISEMENT
Atwater is pleasantly surprised to find that the silicon carpet outperforms conventional wafers at absorbing infrared frequencies .
The result , says Atwater , flies in the face of the " established dogma " that the most highly absorbing surface is a roughly textured wafer .
" We 've broken through what people thought was the absorption limit , " he says .
" This is a beautiful demonstration and a striking set of results , " says physicist Ken Durose , an expert on solar cells at Durham University , UK .
" The fundamental issue with all solar cells is that they are too expensive , and reducing the material and the cost , but keeping the efficiency , has been the main thrust of research in this field . "
Not so fast
The next step for Atwater 's team will be to make a fully functional solar - cell device from their silicon array , says Durose .
He notes that a group based in St Petersburg , Russia , recently built a solar cell based on a nanowire array made from gallium arsenide — a more expensive alternative to silicon2 .
Atwater says that his team is now attempting to scale up their creation .
If successful , their silicon - based technology has the advantage that it should be relatively easy to incorporate into current manufacturing processes .
" The tools and facilities we need to build the wires are already in use , " Atwater says .
However , Keith Barnham of the Quantum Photovoltaics Group at Imperial College London says that it is too early to say whether the little carpets really will work .
Material defects are a big problem when building a solar cell because they prompt separated electrons and holes to ' recombine ' , reducing the cell 's performance .
Atwater 's team must demonstrate that this is not a significant issue in devices made using silicon wires , says Barnham .
" By demonstrating that they can get an efficient current , the group are halfway there though , and that 's great . "
Ca n’t quite settle on a New Year ’s resolution ?
How about this : Resolve not to repeat the media ’s mantra of America in decline .
The airwaves and netwaves are full of reviews of the decadem horribilis – a decade of terror attacks , two hot wars , hurricane Katrina , a great recession , a record federal deficit , and more .
The common conclusion is that the American sun has set , much like the end of the British , Ottoman , and Roman empires .
That ’s , well , nonsense .
There ’s no denying that these past years have been tough for many in the United States , especially military families and the unemployed .
But focusing on decline blinds one to the deep well of renewal that has always defined America in difficult times .
Accepting a fall as a fait accompli avoids the opportunity to learn from mistakes .
It obscures facts that would encourage .
The US is still the world ’s largest economy , though fast - growing China moved up to third place in 2009 .
Despite US trade and fiscal deficits , the dollar remains the world ’s reserve currency .
The World Economic Forum ranks the US as No. 2 in global competitiveness , and still No. 1 in innovation .
That ’s hugely important , because new ideas spark new industries and jobs .
Corporate spending on R&D may have slowed , but peek inside engineering schools and home offices .
Innovation is humming .
The Wall Street Journal reported recently a surge in “ tinkering ” as plummeting prices on materials and equipment allow individuals to turn their ideas into inventions .
Engineering schools are reporting more students wanting to do hands - on work .
“ Hackerspaces , ” where tinkerers can share ideas and tools , are blossoming across the country .
Financial upheaval in the late 19th century sparked a golden age of independent inventors in the US .
Will that happen again ?
It could be that individuals – as opposed to institutions – lead the way into the next decade .
That would n’t be surprising .
Americans are renowned for their can - do attitude and resourcefulness , and the Internet gives them more voice and opportunity .
Unlike Washington and Wall Street , Americans in general seem to have learned from the Easy Street values that begot the stock market and housing bubbles .
Lost wealth jolted them into saving ( though whether they ’re saving enough is still an open question ) .
They ’re also practicing a personal pay - as - you - go policy – choosing debit over credit cards .
Many jobless Americans are doing their utmost to take responsibility for their lives .
A December New York Times / CBS poll of unemployed adults found that over 40 percent had moved or were considering moving to find work .
Meanwhile , 44 percent have pursued job retraining or other education .
Online learning is growing , making it easier for Americans to improve their skills .
Americans also want to help others .
Community service has soared over the last 20 years .
“ If you want to feel depressed about the country , think about the government .
If you want to [ be ] really optimistic about the country , look at people under 30 , ” New York Times columnist David Brooks said recently on PBS ’s “ NewsHour . ”
Youth violence , crime , and teen pregnancy are all down .
Of course , it ’s easy to get down about polarized Washington .
But do n’t give up yet .
Both parties back education reform based on performance – a key ingredient for a healthy economy .
And the government has made a down payment on infrastructure , essential to moving goods and people and improving competitiveness .
Concern about the federal debt is mounting on both sides of the aisle .
The states , meanwhile , are in the forefront on tough issues like greenhouse gases .
Overseas , America is working hard to win back respectability .
Unlike Rome , London , or Istanbul , though , it has n’t sought an empire .
Its interest is the promotion and defense of freedom – the basis of American greatness , but also of world greatness , if countries embrace it .
That national characteristic has n’t changed .
It ’s why applications for US citizenship are still rising , despite much higher fees .
Outsiders see the promise .
Americans should , too .

US airport security measures have been tightened since the alleged plot The US has moved dozens of names on to " watch " and " no - fly " lists as it seeks to overhaul security in the wake of an alleged jet bomb plot , officials say .
The US government has also introduced new security measures for all travellers flying to America .
There will be extra screening for people travelling from 14 countries .
Meanwhile , US President Barack Obama is to meet officials assigned to review security after the suspected plot and is expected to announce reforms .
These will aim to " improve our watchlisting system as well as our ability to thwart future attempts to carry out terrorist attacks " , an Obama administration official said .
Among those attending Tuesday 's briefing will be Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , defence secretary Robert Gates , CIA director Leon Panetta , Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano and FBI chief Robert Mueller .
The review comes after an alleged plot by a 23 - year - old Nigerian to blow up an airliner shortly before it was due to land in Detroit on Christmas Day .
White House spokesman Bill Burton said that since then , lists had been checked and updated , with names moved from the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment ( Tide ) , to a watch list or no - fly list .
" Probably dozens were moved to different lists , " he said .
Those on the watch list are subject to extra security checks , while those on the no-fly list are not allowed to board flights to the US .
Focus on Yemen
The suspect in the alleged Christmas Day bomb plot , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , came to the attention of US authorities in November , when his father voiced concerns about him to the US embassy in Nigeria .
But he was never moved from the Tide list , which includes hundreds of thousands of names , to the extra screening or no - fly lists .
We see global implications from the war in Yemen
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
As US authorities moved to tighten security , they announced that people travelling from or through 14 countries would be subject to enhanced screening measures , including pat - downs , scanning , and the inspection of hand luggage .
The countries include Cuba , Iran , Sudan and Syria , which the US considers to be sponsors of terrorism , as well as 10 other states considered " of interest " based on recent intelligence .
Passengers flying from other countries will be checked at random .
Among the states considered " of interest " are Yemen - where Mr Abdulmutallab allegedly received training - and Nigeria , through which he travelled on his way to Detroit .
Nigeria called its inclusion on the list " unfair " , while Cuban government newspaper Granma dismissed the measures as " anti-terrorist paranoia " .
Al - Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) claimed responsibility for the plot , increasing concerns about Yemen , where the group is based .
On Monday , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stressed the international nature of threats resulting from instability there .
" We see global implications from the war in Yemen and the ongoing efforts by al - Qaeda in Yemen to use it as a base for terrorist attacks far beyond the region , " she said .
She also said Western support for the country was conditional on Yemen working for peace and stability for its own people and the region .
The US re-opened its embassy in Yemen on Tuesday , following what it called successful counter - terrorism operations by government security forces on Monday north of the capital .
A BBC correspondent in Sanaa says the embassy was referring to a strike that reportedly killed two al - Qaeda operatives .
The embassy had closed on Sunday in response to what it had said were al - Qaeda threats .
The British and French embassies have resumed operations but remain closed to the public .
Yemeni authorities have tightened security measures at Sanaa 's airport , as well as around several other embassies .

MGMT 's new album , Congratulations , comes out in April !
We 're excited .
MGMT 's 2008 debut album , Oracular Spectacular , was fantastic , and we can't wait to hear what they 've got in store for the follow - up .
We 're positive it will be awesome , as those weird - ass kids are only going to get weirder as they go along .
Hey , let 's whet our appetites by having a sneak peek at the album cover , shall we ?
That 's it up there .
Sweet fancy Moses .
What in the holy hell is that shit ?
Is that the cover for an MGMT album or a poster for an animated film about taking LSD in 1989 ?
Do n't worry , though , because even though the album cover is horrifying , the album will still most likely be wonderful .
There are many precedents for great albums with hideous covers , eleven more of which follow .
11 . Beck ,
The Information Beck 's 2006 album was an interesting excursion in sonic experimentation ; all of the instruments are either acoustic or digital , there are almost no electric instruments on the album .
Coupled with the album 's adventurous spirit was a novel idea for an album cover : a completely DIY approach .
The Information came packaged with stickers , which the listener was supposed to use to make their own personalized cover .
The only problem : it was impossible to make a good - looking album cover with the stickers provided .
Check out the many iterations on the album 's Amazon page if you do n't believe us .
10 . The Hold Steady , Boys and Girls in America
Why would an album of amazing , literary bar rock need a cover photo that looks like it was taken of the crowd at a Jonas Brothers concert ?
Guess you 'll have to ask the Hold Steady .
9. Death Cab For Cutie , Narrow Stairs
Where did the inspiration for Death Cab 's welcome 2008 return to experimentation come from ?
We do n't know for certain , but in Neal Stephenson 's novel Snow Crash , there is a killer loose in the cyberpunk society 's virtual , Second Life - like environment who kills by showing a picture containing a virus to users ' avatars .
Somehow the viral information is relayed optically to the avatar 's real - life counterpart , who dies .
This album cover is what that picture looks like .
Grab some tissues , your nose is bleeding .
8. The Constantines , The Constantines The Constantines ' album covers have always been rather spartan , but none were more unattractive than their debut .
You should n't be allowed to pick a random wrapper out of the trash , photograph it , and then just use that as your album cover .
Especially not if you 're as terrific a band as the Constantines .
7. Fastbacks ,
The Day That Didn't Exist Looks like a Rhino label repackaging of 1950 's radio hits instead of the original , stellar collection of pop-punk it is .
Completely undersells an underrated band .
6. Jimmy Eat World , Chase This Light A feather ?
Really ?
That was what you guys settled on ?
We almost did n't even listen to this album because we were afraid it was going to sound like early Cher .
5. James , Best Of
If you 're a dynamic , involving alternative - rock band , maybe having your grandmother quilt your greatest - hits album cover is n't the best idea in the world .
4. Yeah Yeah Yeahs , Isis The YYY 's phenomenal 2007 EP was sweepingly gigantic stadium rock , even bigger than the previous year 's Show Your Bones .
It 's hard to decide which collection was better , just as it was hard to decide which album cover was uglier , this one or the one for Fever To Tell .
We ultimately went with this one , because Fever To Tell may have been busy and garish , but at least you could tell what the fuck was going on .
Are we underwater here ?
Under a microscope ?
And you 're seriously just going to import that text from Microsoft Paint ?
Guh .
3. PJ Harvey , Rid of Me Well , there you have it : A photograph that somehow makes a soaking - wet PJ Harvey look unattractive .
True , it kind of fits with the album 's badass gutter - garage - grrl sound , but still .
Polly Jean is way sexy , and we hate to see photos which pretend otherwise .
Call us old - fashioned .
2. Nine Inch Nails , Pretty Hate Machine Forget for a moment all of the pleasant memories you have associated with this album and just look at it .
That is goddamn ugly .
The color scheme is atrocious , and what the hell are we looking at , a bike tire ?
This looks like something Nitzer Ebb rejected .
Trent Reznor would never release an album this horrible - looking again .
And last but not least , the ugliest album cover of all time :
1. Phantom Planet , Phantom Planet
And there it is : the ugliest album cover of all time .
Was this done by layering the KidPix scribblings of brain - damaged children on top of each other ?
Did the computer overheat and catch fire while rendering the image and they had to turn it in at the last minute ?
This cover looks like an aneurysm feels .
You 'd never know that it contained a shift to loud , tough garage rock , defying ( and exceeding ) expectations following Phantom Planet 's radio - friendly breakthrough album , The Guest .
Instead you 'd probably think it was full of sounds designed to make war prisoners in Guantanamo think their brains were haunted .
They could have each spat a mouthful of food onto a Jackson Pollack painting and come up with a better album cover than this .
You 'll notice we barely even touched on the ' 80s , not to mention all the great / eye- raping prog rock albums from the ' 70s we missed .
Leave your own favorites in the comments , but remember the criteria :
The album itself must be great ; its cover must be godawful .
Get to it .
The US space shuttle Endeavour and its crew of six astronauts are preparing for a weekend mission to deliver a space module dubbed Tranquility to the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The mission comes as NASA begins to reevaluate its future after President Barack Obama effectively abandoned the US space agency 's plan to send astronauts back to the moon by 2020 .
The Constellation program was intended to develop a successor spacecraft to the shuttle , which could be used to carry astronauts to the moon where they would use a lunar base to launch manned missions to Mars .
Constrained by soaring budget deficits , Obama submitted a budget to Congress that encourages the agency to instead focus on developing commercial transport alternatives to ferry astronauts to the ISS after the shuttle program ends .
There are just five missions scheduled for NASA 's three shuttles before the program is scheduled to wind down later this year .
The first shuttle launch was in 1981 .
The Endeavour mission 's main goal is the delivery of the Tranquility module , also known as Node 3 , which comes with a multi- window cupola attached .
The cupola , built for NASA by the European group Thales Alenia Space in their Turin factory , will allow for panoramic views of Earth , space objects and spacecraft arriving at the ISS , the US space agency said .
Endeavour is scheduled to takeoff early Sunday at 4:39 am ( 0939 GMT ) from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral , Florida .
" Everything thus far is going exceeding well .
We 're right on schedule where we 're supposed to be and we 'll continue to work through the day on our preparations , " NASA test director Jeff Spauling told journalists during a press conference .
Countdown began as scheduled at 0700 GMT on Thursday and by Friday the weather forecast had improved to an 80 percent " go " for launch .
Mike Leinbach , the shuttle launch director , reported that his team had not encountered any technical problems and everything was on track for loading of the external fuel tank with propellants at around 7:15 pm Saturday ( 0015 GMT Sunday ) .
" The team is energized and excited about the countdown ... looking forward to getting Endeavour off the ground Sunday morning , " said Leinbach .
With Endeavour 's delivery of Tranquility and its attached cupola , the International Space Station will be 90 percent complete , NASA said .
Tranquility , which weighs in at 18 tonnes , is seven meters long and has a 4.5 meter diameter , while the cupola dome weighs 1.9 tonnes , and measures 1.5 meters with a 2.9 meter diameter .
Installing the module is expected to require a team of two astronauts to undertake three spacewalks lasting 6.5 hours each .
Tranquility , named after the lunar sea where Apollo 11 landed , has the most sophisticated life support system ever flown into space .
It has air revitalization , oxygen generation and water recycling systems and also contains a waste and hygiene compartment for the crew .
The cupola attached to Tranquility boasts six windows arrayed along its sides as well as a central window -- all built with protection against the impact of tiny meteorites -- that will offer an unprecedented panoramic view for those onboard .
But the cupola will also serve an important work function , accommodating two crew members at a time , and is equipped with portable workstations that can control station and robotic activities .
The view will allow the crew to monitor spacewalks and docking operations , NASA said .
The ISS , a joint project involving 16 countries , has cost around 100 billion dollars , mostly provided by the United States .
Under Obama 's new budget , the floating research station could see its life extended by five years until 2020 .
Meanwhile , NASA will work on sponsoring commercial development of new US spacecraft that can ferry astronauts to the ISS after the shuttle program ends .
Astronauts will have access to Russia 's Soyuz craft for transport to the station , but the US space agency will be called upon to help a US private sector alternative .

Sarah Palin will appear next month at the tea party movement 's convention in Nashville .
Tea partiers give big bucks for Palin
Sarah Palin ’s appearance early next month at the first tea party movement ’s convention in Nashville , Tenn. , has stirred controversy in conservative circles over her reported decision to charge a substantial fee .
Palin ’s aides and conference organizers wo n’t comment on financial arrangements , but documents obtained by POLITICO reveal the going rate for the former Alaska governor : $ 100,000 a speech , with a discount to $ 75,000 for West Coast appearances .
Palin has reportedly waived the fee for some charitable events , but what ’s billed as a meeting of the grass - roots conservative movement is not among those .

Tickets for the Nashville event run $ 549 , plus a $ 9.95 fee , while separate tickets to see only Palin cost $ 349 .
Republican Reps. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee are also scheduled to speak at the three - day conference at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel and Convention Center .
Palin ’s speech will be closed to the press .
Conference organizer Sherry Phillips confirmed to POLITICO that , unlike some of the events with other speakers , reporters will not be permitted to be in the room .
Retired politicians often make a living off public speaking .
Former President Bill Clinton reported making more than $ 10 million at it in 2007 alone , charging $ 150,000 that year for a basic domestic speech .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was charging $ 25,000 a speech last year , according to a person familiar with his arrangements .
But charging money to speak means that political celebrities are n’t raking in another valuable commodity : goodwill .
Even those who charge for speeches typically appear for free before political audiences , in order to fill the favor bank .
And those who can afford it , like former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , always speak free .
“ I 'm hearing through sources Sarah Palin is getting $ 75 k to speak at this Tea Party convention , ” blogger Dan Riehl , an admirer of Palin and of the tea partyers , wrote recently after learning that she was charging a substantial fee .
That 's a lot of damned tea . ”
Palin ’s spokeswoman did n’t respond to an inquiry about the fees , and conference organizer Judson Phillips declined to discuss the fees .
“ I know who your sources are .
They are not reliable , ” he said in response to an inquiry from POLITICO .
Phillips was apparently referring to internal critics , who have complained that the convention ’s price tag of $ 560 is too high for a grass - roots event .
In a recent interview with POLITICO , one of those critics warned Palin off the event .
“ She thinks she ’s coming to endorse the tea party movement , but most tea party people wo n’t be there because they can’t afford it , ” said Anthony Shreeve , an East Tennessee tea party organizer who quit the convention ’s steering committee .
“ The tea party movement is a grass - roots movement ; it ’s not a business , he said .
But Greg Mueller , a veteran conservative political consultant , was more sympathetic .
" She 's in demand as a best - selling author , a former governor and a former GOP VP candidate and is capitalizing on that demand while she decides what 's next for her , ” said Mueller .
“ She is doing nothing different than former Vice President [ Al ] Gore , former President Clinton , and former Joint Chiefs [ of Staff ] Chairman Colin Powell , who are just a few that come to mind who have taken similar paths . "

Although there are other people at the controls , manning and updating my websites , I do read all of the mail , and the questions I get asked most often ( hundreds upon hundreds of times now ) are about my diet .
All of the emails and letters are so hard to keep up with , so I finally sat down and decided to write a comprehensive look at my diet .
I ’m writing this on the fly , so even though it ’s long , I will most certainly leave some important things out ..
‘ Sorry ’ about that in advance .
This is not going to be political or preachy .
I am not here to push my beliefs on anybody .
This is a chance for all of you who have asked for diet advice from me , to get some ideas and hopefully gain a better understanding of how easy it is for me to maintain athletic performance with the foods I consume .
In the mean time , I will simply lead by example .
I noticed that a lot of fighters write down what they may generically eat on a given day and simply post that as their “ diet ” .
I ’m sure this leads to confusion with most readers and still leaves many questions unanswered .
My diet , in particular is extremely varied and also very specialized .
As you will see , I eat completely differently when I am cutting to 155 , than when I am simply in training without having a weight - cut …
And even more differently than when I am lazying around , eating whatever I want and getting fat …
By no means whatsoever , is this ‘ the gospel ’ of vegan eating … I am just sharing what I do …
It may work for you , it may not …
Take what works and discard the rest .
I can tell you right now , I do n’t spend nearly as much time doting over my diet as most people think ..
I know what to eat and what not to , and following those guidelines , I ’m looking to get it done with and get on with my day …
I usually do n’t have the time to cook , so unless my girlfriend is cooking for me ( she ’s great ) , or I am eating at a restaurant , I am usually looking for something quick and easy …
A few articles on me have gone into detail on what my daily diet is like …
This one in particular stands out : UFC.com weekly article .
Also , Mike Mahler happens to be the one person whose diet I followed in the beginning of my change to a vegan diet .
He inspired me and I hope I can do the same for some of you …
I urge you to check out his diet if you ’re interested in mine .
Before I get into specifics , I ’d like to address something that ties into the same discussion …
For the record , I cut dairy completely out of my diet in 1999 ( over 5 years before I ever committed to a full - Vegan diet ) …
This was due to an allergy that I developed in my adolescent years to dairy that affected my sinuses and everything connecting to them .
For a good part of my teenage years , I suffered from severe ear infections and chronic Vertigo ( which is completely miserable ) .
It took me a few years of to finally realize that the antibiotics were only temporarily subduing a much bigger problem .
I did my research and finally found the source .
A lot of people do n’t realize how hard milk , whey , and other dairy products are on the sinuses and respiratory system , and the dairy industry would like you to believe that you need milk to get calcium .
That notion is as oxymoronic as you can get .
Although not everybody has as severe an allergy to dairy products as I did , I just wanted to point out that after years of battling with ear and sinus infections , eliminating dairy completely cured my problems .
Anyone with similar problems may want to try it for a while .
Also , let me just say that although protein intake is important , especially for athletes , I find the usual listed “ requirements ” for protein are blown completely out of proportion , and the thought of consuming “ 1.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight ” during down time seems ridiculous to me …
I truly feel that all the articles telling people to eat that way are written by people who copied the diets of fanatical body - builders and tried to present them to the general public .
If you ingest that much protein a day , you ’re taxing your liver and kidneys big - time …
For example , I walk at 168lbs and I usually eat between 100 and 140 grams of protein per day when I ’m in grueling , peak training …
When I ’m taking time off , I do n’t pay attention to it and I ’d say it ’s usually around 70 grams a day , give or take …
One thing I consciously try and do is eat a higher amount of Alkaline - forming foods than acid - forming foods throughout each day …
I do n’t have time to get into the whole “ alkaline foods ” discussion , but I ’ll just leave it out there , that there is plenty of info about it on ‘ teh interweb ’ …
Ok , first here , I ’m going to list some regular foods that I eat a lot of , along with an explanation on each one .
Essentially these are of some basics that really make up a large portion of my weekly caloric intake …
Afterwards , I ’ll list some broader ideas of diet , some supplements , then list some junk foods I eat and finally some daily examples …
Brown Rice :
One of my main sources of complex carbs along with Oatmeal …
I buy the ‘ microwave in the bag ’ frozen brown rice from Trader Joe ’s …
It ’s pretty easy to make and can be added to almost any meal .
Wild Rice ( actually a grass seed ) is even better if you can get ahold of it .
Portobello mushrooms :
These are great .
Good protein source , low calories , low sodium …
Can be sauteed or stir - fried with vegetables .
I eat many of these when cutting weight .
Tempeh :
This is a Tofu - based food and a good source of protein and fiber …
Although a little bitter when eaten plain , I find that some flavorings can really make this good …
Quinoa :
This grain is sometimes a chore to cook , and if you live in the middle of nowhere , it might be hard to find , but it ’s a great source of not only carbs and protein , but fiber as well .
This is one of the most nutritionally complete foods out there with a full , balanced set of amino acids …
Black Beans , lentils , etc : Really , many Mexican foods I find to be pretty substantial as long as there ’s some beans and rice in it …
Lentils are great in soup and have some decent protein and fiber …
My girlfriend makes some really good lentil soup as well as squash soup .
Now , here are some things I will simply list and then explain how they work with my system .
Drinks : I drink water 99.9 % of the time …
Rarely do I ever feel the need for soft drinks or juices , although I might add some orange juice to a protein shake to make it taste better …
I drink in excess of 1.5 gallons of H2O per day when I ’m training hard and about 1 gallon per day on the regular .
Wheat :
My diet is not “ wheat - free ” but I do my best to avoid it …
It ’s an allergen ( mild for most people ) and not as easily digested you might think …
Every now and then I have something that has wheat gluten in it as well …
I ’m not really into sandwiches , so bread is easy to avoid .
I do eat pasta every once in a while and I might have some wheat tortillas , but if I had my choice of carbs , it ’d be brown rice or quinoa .
On a side note , they have come out with some good rice - based pastas that are identical to normal wheat pastas in every way .
Fake meat products :
These are usually geared towards people making the change to vegetarianism and are made to mimic various meat products …
I usually do n’t mess with these all that much , with the exception of “ riblets ” made by Gardenburger brand …
Most of the stuff out there does n’t taste anything like meat to me ( unless it ’s seitan ) and I do n’t need my food to .
Unfortunately , if you live in the midwest , or any place who ’s stores have n’t adapted to vegetarian diets , you may find that these are the only things sold in the frozen section without meat or dairy …
On the other side of this , many vegan restaurants have great fake meat products that are much more palatable than the stuff sold in the stores .
Vegetables :
These are very necessary .
I do n’t eat them as much as I should , but when I do , it ’s broccoli , peas , corn , green beans and spinach most of the time .
Whenever I have a salad , I do my best to use organic kale or baby spinach as the main source rather than romain or iceberg lettuce .
The leafy greens like collards , spinach and kale are extremely good for you ..
Do n’t sleep on them .
Nuts & seeds : I find almonds are the best for me .
Some articles have stated that they boost testosterone …
I ca n’t say that ’s true or false , but I do find almonds to be superior to most of the other nuts and seeds out there …
Trader Joes sells raw , sliced almond flakes that can be turned into powder ( if you have a chopper ) and put into a protein shake .
I do eat peanuts sometimes , and natural peanut butter , but too many peanuts can be bad for you because of the naturally - occurring toxins in them .
I eat cashews in moderation , and I usually stay away from Macadamias when I ’m cutting weight because of their high fat content .
I do n’t eat as much seeds as I probably should , but Pumpkin seeds are definitely recommended …
They are high in iron , which is important , because as an athlete , iron can be lost rapidly through sweat .
Sunflower seeds are also pretty good and are a decent source of protein and vitamin E …
Seitan : although this stuff is delicious and has the most meat - like texture , it is essentially just wheat gluten and is pretty hard to digest …
I stay away from it when I ’m in hard training , but during the off - season , it ’s fair play .
Many restaurants have good meals with seitan .
Soy milk , almond milk , etc : I do n’t eat cereal all that much , but when I do , I prefer almond milk and rice milk over soy milk …
Just a personal preference .
These can be added to protein shakes too .
Rice milk is a little thinner that almond and soy usually …
Sodium : Many of the foods I really enjoy have a lot of sodium in them .
I have no problem eating moderately sodium - rich foods until I get close to cutting to lightweight …
Sodium causes you to retain water , so it ’s pointless to consume if you want to drop water weight .
3 weeks before a fight , I start watching my sodium intake , and by the week of the fight , I ’m down to less than 100 grams per day .
Supplements :
Vega :
This is awesome .
It has everything I need and it ’s quick and easy .
Although not ideal , I could really live off of this with no problems .
Full nutrition .
Vega makes powdered whole food meal replacements and energy bars that I eat pretty much every day .
Their meal replacement uses hemp protein and pea protein as a base .
When I ’m taking this and / or The Ultimate Meal ( see below ) I find there ’s no reason for a multi-vitamin .
The Ultimate Meal : I swear by this stuff , it ’s a whole meal and has made up a huge part of my diet for 3 years now .
It ’s a bit of an acquired taste , but I truly notice myself feeling better when I use it daily .
Remember to follow the directions and add the apple and banana .
( This is not your normal “ add powder to water ” supplement )
Organic food bar :
These are great for cutting weight … there is some fat but it ’s good fat , and there ’s hardly any sodium .
Made of mostly almond butter and date paste .
Cliff Builders Bar :
As far as protein bars go , these are the best tasting and pretty addictive …
There ’s a decent amount of sodium and calories , so they ’re not ideal when you ’re cutting weight .
Protein powders : I stay away from soy as a powdered protein supplement , and not because of the idiotic claim that it is “ bad for men because it boosts estrogen ” ( which is complete nonsense ) , but because it does n’t have a full amino acid spectrum and has less protein content percentage …
Instead of soy powder , I use brown rice protein from Nutri-Biotic brand when I ’m looking for plain protein supplement .
Nutri-Biotic Rice protein has an 80 % protein content and all the amino acids .
I also find that Rice protein is digested a lot easire than soy .
Junk Food :
I eat a ton of soy ice cream and vegan cookies when I ’m not dieting …
This is my weakness , but my metabolism burns most of it off …
Also , I eat a lot of Thai food from vegan restaurants that , although normally not considered ‘ junk - food ’ , certainly has a lot of fat and sodium .
Example : Yellow Curry ( made with coconut milk ) with tofu and deep fried soy “ chicken ” …
Oh yeah , I ’m a potato chip fiend too …
Even with all the sugary stuff I indulge in , I do my best to completely avoid high fructose corn syrup .
Examples :
Ok , here is an example of just one day of my diet leading up to a lightweight fight that I posted on a blog a while back …
You must remember that this week and next are atypical of what I ’d normally eat calorie - wise daily compared to , say , a month or more out …
There is no way I could sustain this low - calorie diet for long periods of time …
I love vegan cookies and Thai Food too much .
Morning : woke up at 166lbs and after a short 35 minute run and some calisthenics , I had The Ultimate Meal , which is a pulverized meal replacement .
I swear by this stuff .
There is n’t a single other product out there that comes close to this as far as recovery goes in training .
Put it in a blender , add some water , an extra scoop of rice protein powder , an apple and a banana and I ’m good to go .
400 cal
Noon time : Organic food bar 300 cal
Afternoon : Low - carb tortilla chips with Salsa .
Soy yogurt with Fresh Pinapple .
350 cal
Mid Day :
After working a private lesson at 3 pm , and then at 4:00 sparring , consisting of five 5 - minute rounds with 30 seconds rest and finishing with jump - rope interval training , I had a Clif Bar immediately to replace glycogen and help speed up recovery so I can function in my third workout .
250 cal
Evening : Rice Noodle mushroom soup with sautéed high - protein tofu added .
Fresh pineapple .
300 cal
Night : After my Night workout in west LA , which consisted of 45 mins grappling , followed by ab work , I had a Clif Builders Bar and a rice protein shake .
350 cal
Last meal : Salad w/ baby greens , artichoke , olives , mushrooms , high - protein grilled tofu and light goddess dressing .
Fresh strawberries and grapes for dessert .
300 cal
So that ’s 2250 calories total , which is fine since I ’m training 3 x a day .
The next week I ’ll start to taper off my training and cut out all the sodium , so that I ’m not retaining water .
_______________________________________________
Here ’s an example of a typical ( non- weight cutting ) training day :
Breakfast : Oatmeal and soy yogurt with fruit .
Snack : almonds and dried cranberries
Lunch :
Barley salad
Sauteed zucchini and mushroom and ‘ garden ’ flavor tempeh with curry dipping sauce .
Midday :
Vega shake , Clif Builder Bar .
Snack : Tortilla chips and Guacamole
Dinner :
Brown rice pasta with fresh portabello ’s and eggplant and marinara sauce .
Late night :
Coconut sorbet with pineapples .
Ok … well , I hope this answers at least a few of the diet questions some of you may have , and if not , I do n’t know what to say …
It took me almost 7 months to get around to writing this , so who knows when my lazy ass might get around to writing more …
Thanks for all the feedback and positive emails , you guys …
Even though I can’t always write back , I hope all of you understand that I ’m grateful to have such loyal and intelligent fans !
Take care ,
Mac

On 7th of December , Tom Lane committed patch by Jeff Davis that adds general exclusion constraints :
Log Message : -----------
Add exclusion constraints , which generalize the concept of uniqueness to support any indexable commutative operator , not just equality .
Two rows violate the exclusion constraint if " row1.col OP row2.col " is TRUE for each of the columns in the constraint .
Jeff Davis , reviewed by Robert Haas
Now , this sounds , useful , but after checking the docs , I have only slight idea on how to actually use this feature .
I know what it is for – it's a way to specify that such 2 rows cannot exist together .
Simplest possible way of exclusion is unique index – 2 rows with the same ( NOT NULL ) value for given row , cannot exist at the same time in the same table .
So , knowing that it 's the simplest way , let 's try to use this new capability to emulate UNIQUE CONSTRAINT ( side note : as docs say – it 's possible , but not suggested , standard UNIQUE will be always faster ) .
So , test table , will have only 1 column , and this EXCLUSION CONSTRAINT on it .
Here 's the definition :
CREATE TABLE test ( i INT4 , EXCLUDE ( i WITH = ) ) ;
What does it mean ?
It 's simple – for every row , there is a violation , is there is any other row with the same ( operator “ = " ) value in column i .
Let 's test it .
First , let 's see how the table looks via \d :
Table " public.test " Column | Type | Modifiers
--------+---------+-----------
i | integer | Indexes : " test_i_exclusion " btree ( i ) Exclusion constraints : " test_i_exclusion " EXCLUDE USING btree ( i WITH =)
2 simple sanity - checks by standard , correct inserts :
INSERT INTO test ( i ) VALUES ( 1 ) ; INSERT INTO test ( i ) VALUES ( 2 ) ;
And then INSERT that should break :
# INSERT INTO test ( i ) VALUES ( 1 ) ; psql:z .
sql : 9 : ERROR : conflicting KEY VALUE violates exclusion CONSTRAINT " test_i_exclusion " DETAIL : KEY ( i ) = ( 1 ) conflicts WITH existing KEY ( i ) = ( 1 ) .
Nice .
Now for something more complex .
Let 's try to use this capability to check for overlapping time ranges .
This could be used for example for making sure that given room is only reserved by 1 user at any give point in time .
There is a problem with it , though , that I can't seem to find a way to define this exclusion using plain timestamptz datatypes – I have to resort to use geometric types for comparing ranges .
In case you 're not familiar with the idea , here we go with some overview :
If you have a range , that you specify with 2 endpoints ( 1 - 10 , or from 1st to 15th of November 2009 ) , you can change it to geometric type ( rectangle for example ) .
For example – range < 1,10 > can be stored as rectangle ( 1,1 ) - ( 10,10 ) .
What is the purpose ?
That 's simple – searching for ranges in this way is usually faster using GiST indexes for geometric data , than using standard BTree indexes on base columns .
So , knowing this , let 's create test table with time ranges , and exclusion constraint based on them :
CREATE TABLE test ( from_ts TIMESTAMPTZ , to_ts TIMESTAMPTZ , CHECK ( from_ts < to_ts ) , CONSTRAINT overlapping_times EXCLUDE USING GIST ( box ( point ( EXTRACT ( epoch FROM from_ts at TIME zone ' UTC ' ) , EXTRACT ( epoch FROM from_ts at TIME zone ' UTC ' ) ) , point ( EXTRACT ( epoch FROM to_ts at TIME zone ' UTC ' ) , EXTRACT ( epoch FROM to_ts at TIME zone ' UTC ' ) ) ) WITH && ) ) ;
PLEASE CHECK COMMENTS BEFORE IMPLEMENTING
IT
Scared with the example ?
Just check this :
# \d test Table " public.test " Column | Type | Modifiers
---------+--------------------------+-----------
from_ts | timestamp with time zone | to_ts | timestamp with time zone | Indexes : " overlapping_times " gist ( box ( point ( date_part ( ' epoch ' : : text , timezone ( ' UTC ' :: text , from_ts ) ) , date_part ( ' epoch ' : : text , timezone ( ' UTC ' :: text , from_ts ) ) ) , point ( date_part ( ' epoch ' : : text , timezone ( ' UTC ' :: text , to_ts ) ) , date_part ( ' epoch ' : : text , timezone ( ' UTC ' :: text , to_ts ) ) ) ) )
Check constraints : " test_check " CHECK ( from_ts < to_ts ) Exclusion constraints : " overlapping_times " EXCLUDE USING gist ( box ( point ( date_part ( ' epoch ' : : text , timezone ( ' UTC ' :: text , from_ts ) ) , date_part ( ' epoch ' : : text , timezone ( ' UTC ' :: text , from_ts ) ) ) , point ( date_part ( ' epoch ' : : text , timezone ( ' UTC ' :: text , to_ts ) ) , date_part ( ' epoch ' : : text , timezone ( ' UTC ' :: text , to_ts ) ) ) ) WITH && )
I 'll get back to it ( what it is , and how it works ) in a minute , but first let 's see if it really works .
First , standard sanity check :
INSERT INTO test ( from_ts , to_ts ) VALUES ( ' 2009-01-01 01:23:45 EST ' , ' 2009-01-10 23:45:12 EST ' ) ; INSERT INTO test ( from_ts , to_ts ) VALUES ( ' 2009-02-01 01:23:45 EST ' , ' 2009-02-10 23:45:12 EST ' ) ;
Works fine , ranges do not overlap .
But when I 'll try to insert row with invalid ( overlapping with some previous ) range :
# INSERT INTO test ( from_ts , to_ts ) VALUES ( ' 2009-01-08 00:00:00 EST ' , ' 2009-01-15 23:59:59 EST ' ) ; psql:z .
sql : 18 : ERROR : conflicting KEY VALUE violates exclusion CONSTRAINT " overlapping_times " DETAIL : KEY ( box ( point ( date_part ( ' epoch ' :: text , timezone ( ' UTC ' :: text , from_ts ) ) , date_part ( ' epoch ' :: text , timezone ( ' UTC ' :: text , from_ts ) ) ) , point ( date_part ( ' epoch ' :: text , timezone ( ' UTC ' :: text , to_ts ) ) , date_part ( ' epoch ' :: text , timezone ( ' UTC ' :: text , to_ts ) ) ) ) ) = ( ( 1232078399 , 1232078399 ) , ( 1231387200 , 1231387200 ) ) conflicts WITH existing KEY ( box ( point ( date_part ( ' epoch ' :: text , timezone ( ' UTC ' :: text , from_ts ) ) , date_part ( ' epoch ' :: text , timezone ( ' UTC ' :: text , from_ts ) ) ) , point ( date_part ( ' epoch ' :: text , timezone ( ' UTC ' :: text , to_ts ) ) , date_part ( ' epoch ' :: text , timezone ( ' UTC ' :: text , to_ts ) ) ) ) ) = ( ( 1231645512 , 1231645512 ) , ( 1230787425 , 1230787425 ) ) .
So , we know it works .
But how and why ?
Let 's bring back table definition for discussion :
CREATE TABLE test ( from_ts TIMESTAMPTZ , to_ts TIMESTAMPTZ , CHECK ( from_ts < to_ts ) , CONSTRAINT overlapping_times EXCLUDE USING GIST ( box ( point ( EXTRACT ( epoch FROM from_ts at TIME zone ' UTC ' ) , EXTRACT ( epoch FROM from_ts at TIME zone ' UTC ' ) ) , point ( EXTRACT ( epoch FROM to_ts at TIME zone ' UTC ' ) , EXTRACT ( epoch FROM to_ts at TIME zone ' UTC ' ) ) ) WITH && ) ) ;
First line is obvious , so are next 2 lines – they simply define columns with timestamptz datatype ( timestamp with time zone ) .
Next line is check – I added it so that I will be sure that from_ts is always before to_ts – to avoid application / test errors that would provide from_ts after to_ts .
This could have been also done with trigger , with optionally switching values in case of bad order in them .
And now the constraint .
First of all – this time I used named constraint .
Without “ CONSTRAINT overlapping_times " it would work just as fine , but on violation , it would report constraint check as “ test_box_exclusion " which is not really usable .
Now , this exclude has been defined using GIST – it means that it will create GiST index – just like docs say – you will practically always use GiST for your constraint exclusions .
Within the exclusion , we create box ( ) , and use && operator , which ( as you can check ) finds whether 2 polygons overlap .
So , we have to create the polygons .
Choosen polygons are boxes ( rectangles ) , which are defined using 2 points .
Each point gets its coordinates from from_ts and to_ts respectively , but since coordinates are assumed to be float values , and we have timestampts , we have to convert them to floats , using extract ( ) function .
One more notice – extract ( ) on timestamptz is not immutable – which is required for indexes – so we could n't use it directly – I had first to convert timestatmptz to timestamp , by requesting timestamp at specific timezone – in this situation I choose UTC which seems to be pretty sane – stable , does n't have daylight savings , just works .
So , let 's do it step by step , what are the actual values that our index ( overlapping_times ) will store , for row with ( from_ts => ‘ 2009-01-01 01:23:45 EST ' , to_ts => ‘ 2009-01-10 23:45:12 EST ' ) .
First , let 's convert the values to UTC :
# SELECT '2009-01-01 01:23:45 EST ' :: timestamptz at TIME zone ' UTC ' , ' 2009-01-10 23:45:12 EST ' :: timestamptz at TIME zone ' UTC ' ; timezone | timezone
---------------------+---------------------
2009 - 01 - 01 06 : 23 : 45 | 2009 - 01 - 11 04 : 45 : 12 ( 1 ROW )
Now , let 's extract epochs :
SELECT EXTRACT ( epoch FROM '2009-01-01 01:23:45 EST ' :: timestamptz at TIME zone ' UTC ' ) , EXTRACT ( epoch FROM '2009-01-10 23:45:12 EST ' :: timestamptz at TIME zone ' UTC ' ) ; date_part | date_part
------------+------------
1230787425 | 1231645512 ( 1 ROW )
Now , let 's convert it to box :
< code > SELECT box ( point ( EXTRACT ( epoch FROM '2009-01-01 01:23:45 EST ' :: timestamptz at TIME zone ' UTC ' ) , EXTRACT ( epoch FROM '2009-01-01 01:23:45 EST ' :: timestamptz at TIME zone ' UTC ' ) ) , point ( EXTRACT ( epoch FROM ' 2009-01-10 23:45:12 EST ' :: timestamptz at TIME zone ' UTC ' ) , EXTRACT ( epoch FROM '2009-01-10 23:45:12 EST ' :: timestamptz at TIME zone ' UTC ' ) ) ) ; </ code > box
-------------------------------------------------
( 1231645512 , 1231645512 ) , ( 1230787425 , 1230787425 ) ( 1 ROW )
Sweet .
It looks pretty convoluted , but once you “ get it " – it 's all fine and simple .
What 's more – readability of the code can be dramatically improved by providing a wrapper around calculations , like this :
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION box_from_ts_range ( in_first timestamptz , in_second timestamptz ) RETURNS box AS $ $ DECLARE first_float float8 : = EXTRACT ( epoch FROM in_first AT TIME ZONE ' UTC ' ) ; second_float float8 : = EXTRACT ( epoch FROM in_second AT TIME ZONE ' UTC ' ) ; BEGIN RETURN box ( point ( first_float , first_float ) , point ( second_float , second_float ) ) ; END ; $ $ LANGUAGE plpgsql IMMUTABLE ;
And then , making the table like this :
# CREATE TABLE test ( from_ts TIMESTAMPTZ , to_ts TIMESTAMPTZ , CHECK ( from_ts < to_ts ) , CONSTRAINT overlapping_times EXCLUDE USING GIST ( box_from_ts_range ( from_ts , to_ts ) WITH && ) ) ; \d test TABLE " public.test " COLUMN | TYPE | Modifiers
---------+--------------------------+-----------
from_ts | TIMESTAMP WITH TIME zone | to_ts | TIMESTAMP WITH TIME zone | Indexes : " overlapping_times " gist ( box_from_ts_range ( from_ts , to_ts ) ) CHECK constraints : " test_check " CHECK ( from_ts < to_ts )
Exclusion constraints : " overlapping_times " EXCLUDE USING gist ( box_from_ts_range ( from_ts , to_ts ) WITH && )
Actuall error message now is also more readable ( although only slightly ) :
# INSERT INTO test ( from_ts , to_ts ) VALUES ( ' 2009-01-08 00:00:00 EST ' , ' 2009-01-15 23:59:59 EST ' ) ; psql:z .
sql : 21 : ERROR : conflicting KEY VALUE violates exclusion CONSTRAINT " overlapping_times " DETAIL : KEY ( box_from_ts_range ( from_ts , to_ts ) ) = ( ( 1232078399 , 1232078399 ) , ( 1231387200 , 1231387200 ) ) conflicts WITH existing KEY ( box_from_ts_range ( from_ts , to_ts ) ) = ( ( 1231645512 , 1231645512 ) , ( 1230787425 , 1230787425 ) ) .
Now , let 's try to use the EXCLUDE for something more realistic – room reservations for hotel .
Let 's assume following table structure :
CREATE TABLE reservations ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY , room_number INT4 NOT NULL , from_ts DATE NOT NULL , to_ts DATE NOT NULL , guest_name TEXT NOT NULL , CHECK ( from_ts <= to_ts ) , CHECK ( room_number >= 101 AND room_number <= 700 AND room_number % 100 >= 1 AND room_number % 100 <= 25 ) ) ; \d reservations TABLE " public.reservations " COLUMN | TYPE | Modifiers
-------------+---------+----------------------------------------------------------- id | INTEGER | NOT NULL DEFAULT NEXTVAL ( ' reservations_id_seq ' :: regclass ) room_number | INTEGER | NOT NULL from_ts | DATE | NOT NULL to_ts | DATE | NOT NULL guest_name | text | NOT NULL Indexes : " reservations_pkey " PRIMARY KEY , btree ( id ) CHECK constraints : " reservations_check " CHECK ( from_ts <= to_ts ) " reservations_room_number_check " CHECK ( room_number >= 101 AND room_number <= 700 AND ( room_number % 100 ) >= 1 AND ( room_number % 100 ) <= 25 )
Small explanation – hotel works in “ days " – you can't have reservation from 8 am to 1 pm – it is assumed that you can check - in not sooner than 3 pm , and you have to check - out by 11 am .
And as for days – we store to_ts as the last day that customer reserverd “ till midnight " .
For example – if somebody makes a reservation from 1st of November , till 7th of November , – i.e. his room will be reserved for him from ‘ 2009-11-01 15:00:00 ' to ‘ 2009-11-07 11:00:00 ' , but in reservations table we will store it as :
from_ts – 2009 -11-01
to_ts – 2009 - 11-06 ( not 7th , but 6th – as this is the last midnight for this reservation )
This means that single - day reservations will have the same day in from_ts and to_ts columns .
A bit strange perhaps , but workable .
Now .
We need / want to add constraint that will make sure that the same room cannot be reserved 2 times .
Since we are creating the constraint using boxes , we actually have 2 axes – one can be used for time , and the other for room_number , so we can :
ALTER TABLE public .
reservations ADD CONSTRAINT check_overlapping_reservations EXCLUDE USING GIST ( box ( point ( from_ts - ' 2000-01-01 ' :: DATE , room_number ) , point ( ( to_ts - ' 2000-01-01 ' :: DATE ) + 0.5 , room_number + 0.5 ) ) WITH && ) ;
You might wonder why I add 0.5 – it 's simple – to avoid creation of boxes that have 0 width or height .
Since base numbers ( number of days since 2000 - 01 - 01 , and room_number ) are always integers , adding 0.5 there is safe – it will not get mixed with another day / room .
And now , let 's test .
First , insert simple reservation :
# INSERT INTO reservations ( room_number , from_ts , to_ts , guest_name ) VALUES ( 101 , ' 2010-01-05 ' , ' 2010-01 - 23 ' , ' test1 ' ) ; INSERT 0 1
Now , let 's insert reservation that is in the same time , but for different room :
# INSERT INTO reservations ( room_number , from_ts , to_ts , guest_name ) VALUES ( 102 , ' 2010-01-07 ' , ' 2010-01 - 21 ' , ' test2 ' ) ; INSERT 0 1
And now , same room , but different time :
# INSERT INTO reservations ( room_number , from_ts , to_ts , guest_name ) VALUES ( 101 , ' 2010-01 - 25 ' , ' 2010-01-30 ' , ' test3 ' ) ; INSERT 0 1
All works fine .
And now – let 's add real conflict :
# INSERT INTO reservations ( room_number , from_ts , to_ts , guest_name ) VALUES ( 101 , ' 2010-01-07 ' , ' 2010-01-08 ' , ' test4 ' ) ; ERROR : conflicting KEY VALUE violates exclusion CONSTRAINT " check_overlapping_reservations " DETAIL : KEY ( box ( point ( ( from_ts - ' 2000-01-01 ' :: DATE ) :: DOUBLE PRECISION , room_number : : DOUBLE PRECISION ) , point ( ( ( to_ts - ' 2000-01-01 ' :: DATE ) :: NUMERIC + 0.5 ) :: DOUBLE PRECISION , ( room_number : : NUMERIC + 0.5 ) :: DOUBLE PRECISION ) ) ) = ( ( 3660.5 , 101.5 ) , ( 3659 , 101 ) ) conflicts WITH existing KEY ( box ( point ( ( from_ts - ' 2000-01-01 ' :: DATE ) :: DOUBLE PRECISION , room_number : : DOUBLE PRECISION ) , point ( ( ( to_ts - ' 2000-01-01 ' :: DATE ) :: NUMERIC + 0.5 ) :: DOUBLE PRECISION , ( room_number : : NUMERIC + 0.5 ) :: DOUBLE PRECISION ) ) ) = ( ( 3675.5 , 101.5 ) , ( 3657 , 101 ) ) .
Error message is ( as usual ) nearly unreadable ( the DETAIL : line ) , but that 's not the point .
The point is that the conflict was nicely caught .
What 's more – since this is constraint – we can add it to table that already has bad data in it , and it will correctly detect problem :
# SELECT * FROM reservations ; id | room_number | from_ts | to_ts | guest_name ----+-------------+------------+------------+------------
1 | 101 | 2010 - 01 - 05 | 2010 - 01 - 23 | test1 2 | 102 | 2010 - 01 - 07 | 2010 - 01 - 21 | test2 3 | 101 | 2010 - 01 - 25 | 2010 - 01 - 30 | test3 4 | 101 | 2010 - 01 - 07 | 2010 - 01 - 08 | test4 ( 4 ROWS ) # ALTER TABLE public .
reservations ADD CONSTRAINT check_overlapping_reservations EXCLUDE USING GIST ( >> box ( >> point ( >> from_ts - ' 2000-01-01 ' :: DATE , >> room_number >> ) , >> point ( >> ( to_ts - ' 2000-01-01 ' :: DATE ) + 0.5 , >> room_number + 0.5 >> ) >> ) >> WITH && >> ) ; NOTICE : ALTER TABLE / ADD EXCLUDE will CREATE implicit INDEX " check_overlapping_reservations " FOR TABLE " reservations " ERROR : could NOT CREATE exclusion CONSTRAINT " check_overlapping_reservations " DETAIL : KEY ( box ( point ( ( from_ts - ' 2000-01-01 ' :: DATE ) :: DOUBLE PRECISION , room_number : : DOUBLE PRECISION ) , point ( ( ( to_ts - ' 2000-01-01 ' :: DATE ) :: NUMERIC + 0.5 ) :: DOUBLE PRECISION , ( room_number : : NUMERIC + 0.5 ) :: DOUBLE PRECISION ) ) ) = ( ( 3675.5 , 101.5 ) , ( 3657 , 101 ) ) conflicts WITH KEY ( box ( point ( ( from_ts - ' 2000-01-01 ' :: DATE ) :: DOUBLE PRECISION , room_number : : DOUBLE PRECISION ) , point ( ( ( to_ts - ' 2000-01-01 ' :: DATE ) :: NUMERIC + 0.5 ) :: DOUBLE PRECISION , ( room_number : : NUMERIC + 0.5 ) :: DOUBLE PRECISION ) ) ) = ( ( 3660.5 , 101.5 ) , ( 3659 , 101 ) ) .
This is simply amazing .
Brilliant feature .
Even if the end - user - interface ( the way actual constraints are defined ) is a bit convoluted .

Inside the Elephant mind
Are elephants so smart that they can spot the difference when they hear people speaking different languages ?
Armed with a giant loudspeaker in the back of a land rover , it is a possibility that researchers have been exploring on the plains of Amboseli National Park in Kenya .
We are a bit limited by how little we know about elephants , but the odd glimmers we get seem to be rather remarkable
Professor Dick Byrne
They have also been trying to see if elephants can count lions and figure out the age of other elephants .
Elephants do not have good eyesight but their sense of hearing is acute .
It is much more sensitive than ours .
The same is true for their sophisticated sense of smell .
The scientists on the research team have been playing sounds or laying down scents which elephants would encounter in nature , but doing so in clever ways that reveal elephant knowledge and thought processes .
Mental skills Dick Byrne , Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at St Andrew 's University has studied the cognitive abilities of primates and has been carrying out the experiments with elephants at Amboseli , using different scents to probe mental skills .
He said : " They 've proved to have abilities which have only been found elsewhere in the great apes and humans .
" We are a bit limited by how little we know about elephants , but the odd glimmers we get seem to be rather remarkable . "
One of the team 's findings has been the elephants ' ability to recognise many other individual elephants from the sound of their call .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Karen McComb , an animal psychologist at the University of Sussex , UK , carried out a sound playback study designed to discover how many other elephants a single elephant might recognise from the sound of their calls .
The specific call in question was a long , deep rumble known as the contact rumble .
An elephant makes it to say , " I 'm here .
Where are you ? " .
The low frequency message can be heard by other elephants several kilometres away .
The contact call was played to numerous elephant family groups .
It was calculated that elephant matriarchs were able to learn the identity of at least 100 other individual elephants by voice .
Dr McComb's Sussex colleague , Graeme Shannon said it was akin to putting 100 people behind a wall in the far distance , getting each one to shout something and asking someone to identify each person correctly .
Numerical skills
There is also evidence from a study with animals in zoos in Japan that elephants have considerable numerical skills .
Elephants have proved adept at recognising the difference between two quantities of objects as they were placed into buckets .
It is a test which has also been done with a range of primates , including human children .
According to Professor Byrne , elephants outperformed all those other species .
" Their abilities did n't seem to be limited in quite the same way as monkeys , apes and children would be .
" Most of us would find it much easier to discriminate two from one than from five and six ...
" But these effects did n't show up with the elephants .
They are just as good at telling five from six as one from two . "
Elephants can be alarmed when they hear the Massai speaking
The latest playback experiment by the Sussex team has been designed to see if Amboseli 's elephants can discriminate between different human languages .
The elephants commonly encounter speakers of three different human tongues as they move in and out of the national park 's boundaries .
There are the semi-nomadic cattle herders of the Maasai ethnic group , who speak a language called Maa .
The animals also travel through land farmed by the Kamba people , who have their own language , and they hear English , which is spoken by the majority of tourists .
Detecting whether they can tell languages apart depends on whether the elephants exhibit defensive or perhaps aggressive behaviour .
According to Graeme Shannon , the animals are most likely to be alarmed when they hear the Maasai speaking .
Amboseli's elephants and Maasai community are wary of each other .
Sometimes elephants will kill Maasai cattle and , very occasionally , people .
When this happens , young Maasai warriors will go out and spear an elephant to death in retaliation .
Least threatening to the animals are the English - speaking tourists who just want to watch and take photos .
The Sussex team have only just begun to play recordings of these different languages to the animals so it is too early to tell if elephants can tell the difference .
However Mr Shannon recalls an incident when his assistant , Katito Sayialel , a Maasai who speaks Maa , was talking to the elephants .
Katito said : " They were nervous , raising their heads . "
Yet when she spoke in Swahili they calmed down , relaxed and continued feeding .
Mr Shannon said that as a scientist , he was a little cautious about saying it was definitely a response by the elephants but " there seemed to be something going on there " .

New details on Kunduz massacre disprove German government claims
By Ulrich Rippert
5 February 2010
New details about the massacre in Kunduz , Afghanistan , at the beginning of September last year , which costs the lives of 142 people including many civilians , disprove the statements and declarations made by the German government concerning the incident .
Under the heading “ Secret Commando Operation Kunduz , ” the online site of the weekly Die Zeit reports that an unusually high number of German elite soldiers — the so called KSK special operations force — were stationed in Kunduz at the beginning of September .
The Web site also reported that the devastating bombing of two tankers in Kunduz was not an isolated event .
At least five bombardments of targets in Afghanistan on the orders of German commanders had been carried out prior to the September 4 Kunduz bombing .
The report presents the following scenario :
Of the 120 soldiers from the secret special - purpose Taskforce 47 in direct proximity to the German army camp in Kunduz , at least 60 belonged to the elite KSK unit .
Such a concentration of KSK members in a single location is highly unusual .
The exact role played by the KSK in Taskforce 47 is unknown and subject to a blanket of secrecy .
The role of the KSK as an elite unit within the German army , however , indicates that its members have command superiority over Taskforce 47 .
The activities of Taskforce 47 in Afghanistan had been shrouded in secrecy until the autumn of last year .
The role of the unit is to gather information on rebel forces , protect German field camps and cultivate Afghan informants .
In addition , the unit controls the operations of fighter planes in the north of Afghanistan .
“ Taskforce 47 is not directed from Kunduz , but from the regional command post in Mazar - i- Sharif , ” Die Zeit reports .
Taskforce 47 played a central role in the bombing attack carried out on September 4 .
The ISAF [ International Security Assistance Force ] report on the bombardment goes so far as to conclude that the air strike was initiated by the Taskforce .
The German army denies this , but refuses to release all relevant information .
There are many unanswered questions surrounding the role of the KSK and the concentration of its force in Kunduz days before the air strike .
Total membership of the KSK is just 1,200 soldiers , and according to a military spokesperson only around 240 men are actively involved in operations at any one time .
This means a quarter of these active KSK soldier were gathered in Kunduz at the start of September — an unusual circumstance , according to Rainer Arnold , ( Social Democratic Party , SPD ) chairman of the parliamentary defence committee .
Normally the KSK operates in very small teams with groups of four or five men taking part in special operations .
They may observe farmyards for days at a time in order to uncover leading Taliban rebels .
The fact that so many KSK members were present in Kunduz points to a much bigger operation , but , as Arnold adds , “ Nevertheless , the Defence Ministry is saying nothing . ”
The concentration of KSK forces in September was also confirmed by Hans Peter Bartels , defence expert of the SPD .
Bartels is one of the members of the German parliamentary committee of inquiry called to investigate the events in Kunduz .
So far , however , speakers for the Defence Ministry and German army have refused to release any details , stressing that the activities of KSK units are top secret .
Nevertheless , other reports from ISAF and the German army indicate the real role played by the KSK .
One officer of the KSK attached to Taskforce 47 was in contact with an Afghan informant who was in the vicinity of the stranded tankers and provided up to date information on what was taking place .
It was on the basis of information from this informant , together with aerial photographs of the area , that Colonel Georg Klein gave the order for two American F15 - fighters to bomb the tankers .
The flight sergeant who maintained contact with the US combat planes was also a member of Taskforce 47 .
It is unclear if this officer was also a member of the KSK .
In any event , he played a key role in transmitting information between Colonel Klein and the US - fighter pilots who suggested on a number of occasions they carry out warning sorties before resorting to a direct attack .
The participation of KSK units in the massacre at Kunduz serves to disprove the statements by the German government that Colonel Klein had taken the decision to bomb the tankers alone and in order to prevent the tankers from being used to attack the German army operation centre .
The organizational structure of the KSK would not have allowed Klein to operate and give commands on his own .
The elite unit is strictly disciplined and centrally organized .
The leadership of the KSK in Afghanistan has its operation centre in Potsdam , near the German capital of Berlin , where all important decisions are made .
“ The KSK does nothing without agreement from Potsdam , ” Rainer Arnold stressed , complaining about the wall of silence he has encountered from the relevant authorities in the German Defence Ministry .
According to Arnold , any attempt to increase parliamentary control over the activities of the KSK is met with refusal and resistance .
Zeit - on - line quotes another parliamentary deputy as follows : “ If there was a KSK deployment in the region on the night of the bombardment then there must have been contact with the operational centre in Potsdam . ”
The parliamentary committee of inquiry into the Kunduz incident has already met on two occasions , but any questions on the role of the KSK and other relevant information have been stonewalled .
It is the army leadership that decides what deputies should know and to what extent information can be passed on and published .
Upon its creation 10 years after the Second World War , in May 1955 , the German army was subject to strict parliamentary control .
Such control was aimed at preventing a return to the forms of German militarism that had led to the formation of the state within the state responsible for horrendous crimes in the war .
The current parliamentary investigation into the massacre at Kunduz makes clear that the former relationship between the army and parliament has already been transformed .
Instead of parliament investigating the legal status of military operations and calling the army leadership to account , it is the military high command that calls the tune .
It demands that parliamentarians demonstrate their increased support for a war that is opposed by two - thirds of the German population .
There are many indications that the massacre at Kunduz was consciously undertaken by sections of the army leadership in order to force politicians to provide far more support for this overwhelmingly unpopular military operation .
At the same time , the massacre was to used in an effort to overcome the restrictions placed on the German army since its establishment in relation to so - called targeted killings — a practice long since used by the US , British and Israeli armies .
The strengthening of militarism in Germany is not limited to the pursuit of foreign policy aims — i.e. , the securing of Germany ’s geo-strategic interests against a background of increasing conflicts between the great powers .
It is also directed toward the situation inside Germany itself as part of the preparations to use the German army against strikes and other forms of social militancy .
The litany of half truths and open lies on the part of the government and its defence minister represent a conspiracy against the population , but there is not a single party in parliament prepared to stand up to the military high command .
In different ways , all of the German parliamentary parties support the war and declare their understanding for the “ difficult tasks ” being carried out by the army leadership .
The Left party is no exception in this respect .
It has voted in parliament against extending the army ’s mandate in Afghanistan — well aware that its vote would have no effect .
At the same time , however , the party ’s representatives on the committee of inquiry and defence committee abide strictly to the dictate of secrecy .
They use their work in the committee in order to signal their support for the government ’s stance and demonstrate their credentials as a reliable constitutional party .
Nobody dares to examine the criminal behaviour of the responsible military leaders and confront them with the legal consequences of their actions .
It should also be noted in this connection that the chief federal prosecutor in Karlsruhe has indicated that it is unlikely that any charges will be brought against Colonel Klein .
The prosecutor ’s office plans to wind down its investigations , arguing that the German army ’s deployment in Afghanistan is covered by international law and should be classified as a “ non-national armed conflict . ”
The Kunduz bombardment would then in turn be subject to “ humanitarian international law , ” which permits such military attacks against opponents in conflict .
Media reports indicate that according to this interpretation of the law , civilians temporarily lose their right to protection if they enter a conflict situation .
In other words : the biggest war crime committed by the German army since the wartime atrocities of Wehrmacht are to go untried and unpunished , providing another important step in the strengthening of German militarism .
I was all set to do a blog about how using Windows is like growing evil tomatoes , then American corporations became real people .
They ’ve been people for a while , of course : they have the right to own things and sue you and claim they ’ve been defamed .
Your chair ca n’t do that .
A corporation can , because it ’s a person .
But they were n’t enough of a person , apparently , so now they have First Amendment rights .
In particular , they have the right to spend as much money as they like on political advertising : airing ads in favor of anti-regulation candidates over pro-regulation ones , for example .
I find it helpful to think of corporations as lawnmowers .
Lawnmowers are good at cutting grass .
It ’s all they want to do .
They ’re not very concerned about what gets in the way of cutting grass .
If , for example , we discover that one of the lawnmowers sometimes kills people , the lawnmower would rather pretend there is n’t a problem than stop mowing lawns .
It seems callous to us .
But you have to remember , it ’s not a person .
It ’s a lawnmower .
Corporations pursue profit ; the fewer people watching , the more ruthlessly they do it .
It ’s not coincidence that Apple is a relatively nice corporation and Halliburton is not .
It ’s not that Apple was raised right while Halliburton had a distant father .
It ’s that Apple ’s profits depend more heavily on consumer opinion .
It ca n’t make money unless it ’s likable , so it is .
I think lawnmowers are useful .
I do n’t want to get rid of them .
But I very much want to keep them on the lawns .
The Supreme Court has let them into homes : now the lawnmowers will speak to us through TV , radio , internet , print , and tell us who to vote for .
That might not seem like a problem .
After all , you are a smart person .
You ’re probably not persuaded by advertising .
The thing is , everyone thinks that , and advertising is an $ 600 billion industry .
Someone , somewhere is getting $ 600 billion worth of persuasion .
It ’s pretty obvious that lawnmowers will back pro-lawnmower candidates .
They are functionally and legally prevented from doing anything else .
In fact , now that the opportunity exists , lawnmowers are compelled to exploit it .
Honestly , I had started to think that the world of Jennifer Government was getting far - fetched .
It seemed like corporations were not overpowering the government at all ; instead , the two were slowly merging into a govern - corp megabeast .
But this changes things .
Until now , corporate lobbyists have essentially stood in opposition to voters : politicians wanted lobbyist money , but resisted giving in too much for fear of being punished at the ballot box .
Now corporations can work it both ways .
They can buy off the politicians and sell the voters on why that ’s A - OK .
They wo n’t have to come up with the media messages themselves .
That ’s a job for the ad agency .
All they ’ll do is write up the ad brief , spelling out what they want people to think , and sign the checks .
Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens , in handing down a dissenting decision , raised the prospect of corporations being given the vote .
Since , after all , they are people now .
We might as well .
A single vote is nothing compared to what they ’ll do by bringing their wealth to mass persuasive political advertising .
It ’s interesting to note how corporations get to pick and choose the good parts of being a person .
They can own property but ca n’t go to prison .
They can sue you into bankruptcy , which you have to live with for the rest of your life , but if you win a big case against them , you get nothing while they reconstitute their assets and arise , Phoenix - like , under a new name .
If you misbehave , you are personally responsible ; a corporation jettisons a minor component it says was to blame .
There is no ending them .
This is the kind of personhood you would choose , if you could .
It ’s what happens when people making laws about corporations are themselves beholden to corporations .
It ’s not evil , exactly .
It ’s just everyone doing their jobs .
It ’s just the way the system works : the system that is increasingly designed by lawnmowers .

In March , Jean - Marie Le Guen , a Socialist member of Parliament who is a doctor , proposed wide - ranging legislation to combat his country 's expanding girth .
" We are confronting a major public health problem , " said Le Guen , author of " Obesity , the New French Disease , " which was just published and is one of many new books on the topic .
Germany , Italy and England are also battling serious obesity problems , but the issue is particularly striking here because , until recently , the slenderness of the French has been so mythic that some scientists theorized that it must have genetic roots .
In fact , in France , as in much of the world , the culprit is changing eating habits , experts said , as France 's powerful culture of traditional meals has given way to the pressures of modern life .
The French now eat fewer formal meals than they did just a decade ago and they snack more .
Another cause is the rising availability in France of fast food and prepared foods , which tend to be higher in fats and calories .
Food companies say that France is one of the most promising international markets for prepared items like frozen pizza , as well as for outlets like McDonald 's and Kentucky Fried Chicken , both of which are planning to open dozens of new stores in the country this year .
Perhaps predictably , sales of Weight Watchers products , introduced to France in 1992 , are also booming ; it now sells 3,000 tons of frozen food annually .
Doctors here say that the French are unusually susceptible to the invasion of convenience foods since their culinary traditions insulated them for so long .

I 'm the girl longed for by you , I 'm still an angel and a devil .
I slagged on Jeff Petry last year , probably more than he deserved .
A combination of his awful numbers and seeing him play two brutal games caused me to drop him out of the top 15 in my prospect rankings .
In the games I saw , Petry was getting beat wide pretty easily and did not look mobile , especially for a guy labeled as a great skater .
He coughed the puck up and had trouble making a pass .
It may have been an over - reaction .
Michigan State was brutal last year , and Petry averaged close to thirty minutes per game .
Even the best defenseman in the NCAA would n't have been able to keep his head above water on a team that was outscored nearly two - to - one while he was eating up half of the total ice time for the defense .
This year Michigan State has turned it around and Petry 's stats have rebounded .
His points per game have doubled and his +/- does n't look like he plays for the Oilers anymore .
There is a distinct possibility that I was snared in the " saw him bad " trap that I 've harped on for awhile .
His team was n't back checking and he was erring on the side of protecting the net .
His passes were n't so much off of the mark as they were n't received cleanly .
Petry 's numbers below the jump .

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will open an investigation into a possible flaw in the steering systems for the 2009 - 2010 Corolla , likely to lead to another massive recall for Toyota , ABC News has learned .
NHTSA says it has received 163 complaints about the steering causing the Corollas to veer from side - to - side .
A number of accidents and injuries have been tied to the issue , according to federal officials .
CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE TOYOTA RECALLS .
Approximately 363,000 2009 Toyota Corollas and 136,000 2010 Toyota Corollas are affected , the U.S. Department of Transportation said .
The problems emerged soon after Toyota introduced a new electrical system for its power steering with the 2009 Corolla model .
Safety expert Sean Kane of Safety Research & Strategies Inc. said that in recent years complaints relating to steering have surged .
" We look at complaints from 2008 , there 's about two complaints related to steering , " said Kane .
" All of sudden in 2009 model year , you see the complaints shoot up to nearly 200 complaints related to steering issues . "
Owners have reported their cars suddenly veered side to side , even though they never turned the steering wheel .
In Japan today , Toyota 's CEO Akio Toyoda again apologized — the third time in two weeks - as he revealed the Corolla problem and admitted the company had cut too many corners before he took over .
" It 's hard to say which is worse , a runaway vehicle or a car that wants to steer itself off the road , " Clarence Ditlow , head of the Center for Auto Safety , told ABC News .
" Either one is a serious safety hazard . "
Toyota Sudden Acceleration
As for the runaway cars , Toyota and U.S. safety regulators have known for more than two years that some new electronic systems in some models had design flaws .
A 2007 government tape shows test drivers for the federal safety agency , NHTSA , having difficulty turning off Toyota models that had a new keyless ignition system .
" Your last resort is to cut off the engine and it shows it 's very difficult to shut the engine down with one of these buttons that takes three seconds to work , " said Ditlow .
Toyota did not implement a brake over - ride system used by some other car companies that cuts off acceleration when the brake is applied .
In his announcement today , the motor company 's CEO said new models of vehicles will have the brake over - ride , but he said nothing about retrofitting Toyota vehicles already on the road .

Peter Beinart notices an underlying theme in Cheney 's latest attacks :
Usually , when reporters ask politicians why they ’re attacking the other party for things their own side has done they deny that there is any double standard , and find some distinction to suggest that what the other guys are doing is much worse .
Cheney did n’t do that .
To the contrary , he repeatedly acknowledged that his gripes with Obama are also gripes with George W. Bush .
Scott Brown was elected a Republican U.S. senator from Massachusetts in 2010 .
He lost re-election in 2012 and subsequently became a political commentator for Fox News .
In March 2014 , Brown announced that he was considering entering the U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire .
West Ham 's co-owner David Gold has claimed the Premier League " must take responsibility " and ensure Portsmouth do not go out of business .
Last Wednesday Portsmouth were granted extra time to fight a winding - up petition from Her Majesty 's Revenue and Customs .
The Premier League 's bottom club were given seven days to produce a statement of affairs to HMRC to detail their exact financial position .
HMRC claim Pompey owe them more than £ 11 m in total .
A figure of £ 7.4 m of VAT is included in the winding - up petition , which Portsmouth are disputing .
The former owner Alexandre Gaydamak claims to be owed £ 28 m and the ex-Portsmouth defender Sol Campbell is suing for £ 1.7 m .
If Portsmouth were closed down , the Premier League would be reduced to 19 teams and their results would be wiped out , giving the table a new look .
" Anything that impacts on the integrity of the Premier League has to be addressed and if a club go bust , all the points are wiped out , giving an advantage to some clubs and a disadvantage to others , " Gold told the Mail on Sunday .
" That ca n't be right .
For that reason , you have an obligation to save a football club .
We have allowed Portsmouth to get into this mess .
The brand is 20 Premier League football clubs .
We must take responsibility . "

He has been living at family members ' homes , an ironic twist for someone who often used to stay for free at hotels when he traveled .
" It takes a lot of understanding and time to get used to living with other people again , " says Mr. Winters , who started his career in hospitality in 1996 .
Mr. Winters says he has applied for approximately 170 hotel - management positions and has had 14 interviews , but no job offers yet .

But sales plummeted in recent years , prompting the third - generation craftsman to take a job building cabinets for corporate jets to make ends meet .
Still , Mr. Jones is optimistic that one day he will return to his custom woodworking full time .

-- Interviews by Sarah E. Needleman
I do n't much care for Julie Bindel , unlike Beatrix Campbell , who defended her on this site yesterday .
That does not mean I do n't admire her .
As a feminist whose radicalism would probably surprise her , I appreciate Ms Bindel 's advocacy and the genuine good that has come for her work against violence directed at women .
Yet in her long , lonely crusade against transsexuals she contradicts three of her own three feminist principles :
1 ) Gender is a social construct and malleable – unless you try to change yours .
2 ) Biology is not destiny – except men are always men and women are always women .
3 ) Bodily autonomy is something all women struggle for – but not something trans women are competent enough for .
4 ) Misogyny is evil – unless it is directed at a trans woman , even if , as is often the case , no one knows she is trans .
Indeed , what is astonishing about Bindel 's writing on transsexuals , which has been published in the Guardian , is how often it resembles the diatribes of anti-gay bigots : the disregard of our own voices , the disbelief that transness is anything but a degeneracy , and the general air of condescension and paternalism .
Gays and lesbians have long known that such diatribes are not merely " offensive , " but dangerous – as is transphobic writing like Bindel 's , and for the same reason : they support social attitudes that have often proven deadly for trans people .
According to the Transgender Day of Remembrance web site , 130 people were murdered in 2009 simply because they were transgendered – and those were only the deaths that were reported .
Like gay and lesbian people , trans people face the very real threat of violence every day simply for being themselves .
Very often , even in places where legal protection exists for gays and lesbians , no similar protection exists for trans people .
That Stonewall , an organisation named for riots that were led in part by a trans woman , Sylvia Rivera , should honour a writer with such disdain for the transgendered was a profound insult .
Its action deserved protest , but protest is not censorship , as Campbell argued .
Neither is the NUS applying its " no- platform " policy to Bindel nor other groups who no longer want her to appear at their functions .
This is more a sign of an evolution of the modern feminist movement away from its historic transphobia towards an inclusive model ; one that , as Laurie Penny puts it , " ... holds that gender identity , rather than being written in our genes , is an emotional , personal and sexual state of being that can be expressed in myriad different ways that encompass and extend beyond the binary categories of ' man ' and ' woman ' " .
Like any woman , a trans woman experiences having her anatomy scrutinised , commodified , and criticised ; her appearance criticised for being either too masculine or too feminine ; and is told repeatedly how her gender disqualifies her from many positions – all before she transitions .
Afterwards , she is subject to both the misogyny that all women face plus the added prejudice faced by trans people , sometimes from the very organisations who exist to help women in need .
We are neither dupes nor Jake Sully - like avatars of the patriarchy : we are just ordinary women and men facing the same problems of other women and men .
It is my guess that neither Campbell nor Bindel would have a problem with the NUS refusing someone a platform who had frequently published homophobic writings , even if they had done other good works .
Both , I suspect , would happily write about and protest against such a person .
Their surprise that the same thing should happen to a person with a long record of public transphobia must thus seem a bit disingenuous – unless you do n't think trans people are worthy of human dignity .
Which is neither good activism , feminism – or politics .
Steve Jobs was reportedly wearing a top hat when he visited New York publishers last week .
It 's a fitting lid for the Apple CEO , who can be as tricky as a magician .
Jobs has a knack for throwing off Apple watchers with his masterful misdirections .
Ever wonder why analysts and journalists grossly overestimated the price of the Apple tablet prior to its official announcement ?
Part of the reason is that Jobs had said during a 2008 earnings call that Apple could not make a $ 500 computer that was not a " piece of junk . "
That assertion lent credence to rumors that the tablet would cost $ 1,000 .
Oops .
The entry - level iPad announced in January will cost : $ 500 , at least at the low end of scale .
Presumably Jobs does n't consider it a piece of junk .
Nice one , Steve .
You got us there .
Actually , you 've fooled us not once or twice , but at least six times , by our count .
What follows is a list of five more famously misleading quotes that Jobs pulled from his bag of tricks .
No Plans to Make a Tablet — — — — — —— —-
There were plenty of naysayers who , for the longest time , thought the Apple tablet was a pure myth .
Jobs did , after all , tell Walt Mossberg during a 2003 All Things Digital conference that Apple was not working on a tablet – because the keyboardless form factor was a recipe for failure , according to a second - hand account .
" There are no plans to make a tablet , " Jobs was quoted saying to Mossberg .
" It turns out people want keyboards ....
We look at the tablet , and we think it is going to fail . "
That was seven years ago .
And a lot can change in seven years .
But there 's plenty of evidence Apple has been mulling over tablets for a while .
The New York Times ' Nick Bilton reported the Apple tablet was in development for at least five years , and that it was actually a precursor to the keyboardless iPhone .
And Apple filed a patent for a touch tablet device in 2004 .
To rewind even further , Apple was working with Frog Design on tablet prototypes as early as 1983 .
Those ancient tablets included keyboards , but Jobs has clearly had tablets on his mind for a very long time .
Not Interested in the Cellphone Business — — — — — — — — — — —— —-
In that same interview with Mossberg , Jobs said he did n't feel Apple would fare well in the cellphone business .
" I get a lot of pressure to do a PDA .
What people really seem to want to do with these is get the data out .
We believe cellphones are going to carry this information .
We did n't think we'd do well in the cellphone business .
What we 've done instead is we 've written what we think is some of the best software in the world to start syncing information between devices .
We believe that mode is what cellphones need to get to .
We chose to do the iPod instead of a PDA . "
Of course , in hindsight that quote served as a clue that Apple was n't making a traditional cellphone , but rather a brand new device that fused the characteristics of an iPod , a PDA and a cellphone into one .
The result was the iPhone .
Still , a tricky statement nonetheless .
People Don't Read Any More — — — — — — ——
–
Jobs made a rather provocative statement in 2008 when he told The New York Times that the Kindle would go nowhere :
" It does n’t matter how good or bad the product is , the fact is that people do n’t read anymore , ” he said .
“ Forty percent of the people in the U.S. read one book or less last year .
The whole conception is flawed at the top because people do n’t read any more . ”
Of course , the CEO backpedaled on his Kindle - dissing during his iPad keynote when he was introducing the iPad 's very own e-book reader and store , iBooks .
" Amazon 's done a great job at pioneering this functionality with their Kindle , and we 're going to stand on their shoulders and go a bit further , " he said during his Jan. 27 keynote this year .
No Movies on a Tiny Little Screen — — — — — — — — — ——
When Mossberg in 2003 asked Jobs whether he planned to put video in an iPod , the CEO said he was turned off by the idea .
" I 'm not convinced people want to watch movies on a tiny little screen , " Jobs said .
" To paraphrase Bill Clinton , ' It 's the music , stupid , it 's the music ! '
Music 's been around for a long time , will continue to be , it 's huge . "
Then two years later , in 2005 , Apple released the fifth - generation iPod whose tiny , 2.7 - inch screen played video .
And then in 2007 Apple released the third - generation iPod Nano with video — with an even littler 2 - inch screen .
But hey , people 's minds change , and clearly so does Jobs ' .
We Don't Need to Add New Stuff — — — — — — — — ——
In a September 2009 interview with Jobs , New York Times columnist David Pogue asked the CEO why Apple crammed a camera into the puny iPod Nano and not the new iPod Touch .
Jobs explained the lack of a camera was to keep the price down , so Apple could market the Touch as an inexpensive gaming device .
" So what we were focused on is just reducing the price to $ 199 , " Jobs said .
" We do n’t need to add new stuff .
We need to get the price down where everyone can afford it . ”
But later , teardown company iFixit ripped apart the iPod Touch and found a gap that would fit a camera .
And on top of that , AppleInsider received a tip that cameras were planned for the iPod Touch , but ultimately delayed due to technical problems .
We 've yet to see if Apple does indeed add a camera to the iPod Touch , but we suspect that 's likely to happen eventually .

The phrase " October Surprise conspiracy " refers to an alleged plot to influence the outcome of the 1980 United States presidential election between incumbent Jimmy Carter ( D–GA ) and opponent Ronald Reagan ( R - CA ) .
One of the leading , national issues during that year was the release of 52 Americans being held hostage since November 4 , 1979 , in Iran .
Reagan won the election .
On the day of his inauguration -- in fact , twenty minutes after he concluded his inaugural address -- the Islamic Republic of Iran announced the release of the hostages .
The timing gave rise to an allegation that representatives of Reagan 's presidential campaign had conspired with Iran to delay the release until after the election in order to thwart President Carter from pulling off an " October surprise . "
According to the allegation , the Reagan Administration would have rewarded Iran for its participation in the plot by supplying Iran with weapons and by unblocking Iranian government monetary assets in US banks .
After twelve years of mixed media attention , both houses of the US Congress held separate inquiries and concluded that the allegations lacked supporting documentation .
Nevertheless , several individuals -- most notably former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr , former Naval intelligence officer and National Security Council member Gary Sick , and former Reagan / Bush campaign and White House staffer Barbara Honegger -- have stood by the allegation .
According to records of President Lyndon B. Johnson 's secret monitoring of South Vietnamese officials and his political foes , Anna Chennault played a crucial role on behalf of the Nixon campaign which attempted to sabotage of the 1968 Paris peace talks which could have ended the Vietnam War .
She arranged the contact with South Vietnamese Ambassador Bui Diem whom Richard Nixon met in secret in July 1968 in New York .
It was through Chennault 's intercession that the Nixon campaign advised Saigon to refuse participation in the talks , promising a better deal once elected .
Records of FBI wiretaps show that Chennault phoned Bui Diem on November 2 with the message " hold on , we are gonna win . "
" The tactic ‘ worked , ’ in that the South Vietnamese junta withdrew from the talks on the eve of the election , thereby destroying the peace initiative on which the Democrats had based their campaign . "
Before the elections President Johnson “ suspected ( …) Richard Nixon , of political sabotage that he called treason . "
No one was ever prosecuted for this crime .
And in Paris , the chances of peace seemed to be receding every day .
Every time the North Vietnamese appeared to be ready to agree to a condition , the South Vietnamese raised the bar .
The reason was that Nixon had sabotaged the negotiations .
His agent was Anna Chennault , known to one and all as the Dragon Lady .
She told the South Vietnamese not to agree to anything , because waiting to end the war would deliver her friend Richard Nixon the election , and he would give them a better deal ...
Kissinger was the double agent [ at the Paris Peace Talks ] feeding the intelligence to Nixon that let him scotch the peace deal before the election .
The opposition was , at the time , a bit perplexing , considering the praise the legislation received from many of the revered members of the 9/11 Commission itself .
Now , following a botched terrorist attack that nearly brought down an airliner over the city of Detroit -- and subsequent conservative complaints that Democrats mishandled matters of national security -- the bill and that vote contain obvious , additional meaning .
The Improving America 's Security Act of 2007 mandated 100 percent inspections of air and sea cargo , authorized $ 4 billion for rail , transit and bus security , and changed methods of allocating security funds so that states and cities with greater risks received a greater share of money .
More relevant to current times , the bill provided the Transportation Security Administration with the authority to use $ 250 million in funds to " purchase , deployment , installation , research , and development of equipment to improve security screening for explosives at commercial airport checkpoints . "
It also urged the TSA to " to deploy such technologies quickly and broadly to address security shortcomings at passenger screening checkpoints . "
Southers , a former FBI special agent , is the Los Angeles World Airports Police Department assistant chief for homeland security and intelligence .
He also is the associate director of the University of Southern California 's Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events , and he served as a deputy director of homeland security for California Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Two Senate committees have given Southers their bipartisan blessing .
An acting administrator is in place pending his confirmation .
Marshall McClain , the president of the Los Angeles Airport Peace Officers Association , said that the Senate should have acted sooner to confirm Southers .
" Friday 's terrorist attack on U.S. aviation makes it all the more imperative that there be no further delays in filling this crucial position , " he said .
... Reid spokesman Jim Manley said Monday that the majority leader is working with the White House to get Southers confirmed " as quickly as possible " and charged that " Republican obstructionism has prevented TSA from having the leadership in place that the organization deserves . "
DeMint spokesman Wesley Denton said that Obama did n't nominate Southers until September , and he charged that Reid " has been too busy trading earmarks for votes on health care " to deal with DeMint 's concerns .
DeMint 's objection creates a procedural hurdle that could take three days of debate and test votes to overcome , or could potentially be limited if Democrats offered DeMint a compromise [ by throwing unionized workers under the bus ] .
No one was taking conciliatory stance on Monday , however .
Manley called DeMint 's opposition " disgraceful . "
First we found out that Senator Jim DeMint is the sole reason America had no one in charge of air security when Al Qaeda terrorists tried to blow up an airliner over Detroit last week .
DeMint 's been blocking Erroll Southers ' Senate confirmation as Director of the Transportation Security Administration , in spite of his qualifications for the job and bi-partisan support .
Now , we find out that putting politics ahead of our families ' safety is a pattern with Senator DeMint .
In 2007 , DeMint was one of only 8 Senators who voted against explosives detection equipment and training for the TSA .
You read that right .
DeMint was one of only 8 Senators who voted against the Improving America 's Security Act of 2007 , an act that , among other anti-terrorism measures , authorized $ 250 Million for explosives detection equipment and training for the TSA .
" Jim DeMint has a long history of putting his political agenda ahead of our safety , " said US Senate candidate Chad McGowan .
" It 's not just one time .
DeMint plays politics with our safety over and over again .
That 's not what South Carolina needs and it's certainly not what America deserves , especially now . "
McGowan repeated his call for DeMint to stop blocking the confirmation of America 's TSA Director .
" DeMint needs to stop playing his political games and start worrying about our safety .
He says he wants a vote on the nominee .
So let 's have a vote , up or down .
Right now . "
If you do n't recall 1980 's October Surprise , let me refer you to Wikipedia for a quickie history recap Honneger explained that " the very possibility that Carter could bring the hostages home was close to certain to wreck a Reagan bid for the presidency .
So the Reagan campaign took phenomenal secret measures to ensure that the Carter White House was not successful .
Reagan 's 1980 campaign manager , William Casey , was knowledgeable , before the fact , of the upcoming Carter Desert 1 rescue attempt of April , 1980 .
Now that is a phenomenal fact , because many of even the highest level officers in Carter 's own CIA were kept in the dark about that very operation ...
Richard Allen was head of the October Surprise working group .
It met every morning to try to come up with ways to try to prevent Carter from bringing the hostages home .
We do know from published accounts , in the Knight Ridder papers across the country , that Richard Allen met with Robert McFarlane and an alleged emissary from Khomeni 's regime in Washington in early October of 1980 to discuss a deal to delay the release of the hostages until after the 1980 election .
There is no question that that meeting happened , Allen and McFarlane have acknowledged that it did ...
Allen and McFarlane deny that any deal was cut , but the bulk of the evidence shows that that 's not the case .
For instance , Allen , in late November of 1986 on the , referred to a deal between Reagan and Iran .
He was being interviewed at the time , and he was referring to the very first day that Reagan was president .
Allen recalled for the audience that he had told Reagan that there was a 53rd hostage , Cynthia Dwyer , who had not been released , and Reagan responded , ' You get the Iranians on the phone for me , and I 'm going to tell them that our deal is off unless she is released . '
Well , you would have expected the interviewer to have jumped up and said , ' Just a minute , sir , what deal was that ? '
Now the reason that that had to have been , in my studied opinion , a deal between Reagan and Khomeni , made before Reagan was president , is because at the time that Reagan made that phone call to the Iranians , all of Carter 's deals with Khomeni had been consummated So , when Reagan referred to a deal with the Iranians , he had to have been referring to a separate deal .
Congress was unwilling to label the beloved , even iconic , Reagan a traitor , so they skirted the issue of William Casey 's deal -- aided and abetted by CIA reactionaries like George H.W. Bush , Richard Allen , Donald Gregg , Robert Gates ( yeah , him ) and Ted Shackley -- with the Iranians in July and August in Madrid .
A couple of CIA hits , " suicides , " wiped out the witnesses willing to testify and it all got chalked up to " inconclusive . "
Gary Sick 's book , October Surprise : America 's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan may be very persuasive but it's going to take a major exposé on Jesse Ventura 's Conspiracy Theories tv show before the American public pays any attention .
But they should ; Reagan was n't the only treacherous right - wing politician willing to betray the country to gain partisan advantage .
Even further back , in 1968 , we had Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger sabotaging LBJ's Vietnam peace talks in Paris to guarantee a Nixon presidential win .
If you do n't have time to read Evan Laine 's book , Nixon and The Dragon Lady , let 's go back to Wikipedia for a moment : Chennault -- aka , The Dragon Lady -- worked with Nixon , Kissinger John Mitchell ( Nixon 's campaign manager who went on to be Attorney General and was later convicted in the Watergate scandal , becoming the only Attorney General ever convicted of illegal activities and serving time in prison ) and Senator John Tower ( R - TX ) .
Historian Rick Perlstein deals with it in his book Nixonland on pages 350 and 370 : Nixon ?
Reagan ?
Would you expect less from Jim " Waterloo " DeMint ( R - SC ) , the worst obstructionist and furthest right - wing member of the U.S. Senate , the many who embraced Rush Limbaugh 's braying about wanting to see Obama fail regardless of the impact on America ?
As Sam Stein pointed out at HuffPo yesterday , on July 26 , 2007 , DeMint voted against -- one of only 8 senators , all far right Republicans of course -- to vote against H.R.1 , a relatively non-controversial measure that effectively implemented several un-acted - upon recommendations from the 9/11 Commission , the he Improving America 's Security Act .
Minutes before passage , the Senate voted on DeMint 's motion to recommit ( kill ) the bill , which was rejected 26 - 67 , every Democrat against it , along with 19 Republicans who decided to put America first for a change and ignore DeMint 's lunatic ravings .
Among the 25 Republicans who joined DeMint in voting to kill the bill that day -- hard core obstructionists like John Barrasso ( R - WY ) , Richard Burr ( R-NC ) , Saxby Chambliss ( R- GA ) , Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) , John Cornyn ( R - TX ) , John Ensign ( R-NV ) , Chuck Grassley ( R- IA ) , Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - TX ) , Jim Inhofe ( R - OK ) , Johnny Isakson ( R- GA ) , Jon Kyl ( R - AZ ) , Miss McConnell ( R- KY ) , Jeff Sessions ( KKK - AL ) , John Thune ( R - SD ) and David Diapers Vitter ( R - LA ) -- were the nucleus of what turned into the Senate cabal determined to sabotage Obama 's presidency regardless of what harm they would do to the nation .
That has n't stopped DeMint from actively doing everything he could to facilitate a national security catastrophe on Obama 's watch , a catastrophe Republicans could use against Democrats in elections .
He has put a hold on the confirmation of Erroll Southers , a widely admired anti-terrorism expert , until he comes out against unionizing TSA employees .
Yesterday BuzzFlash awarded DeMint it 's Hypocrite of the Week Award , pointing out that " there was once a time when , if the nation were under attack , even the strictest of partisan hacks would put away their petty squabbling and try their best to figure out how to make the United States a safe haven for its citizens .
Not anymore . "
DeMint deserves much more than an award from BuzzFlash .
As we pointed out last month before the terrorist attack DeMint had been hoping for , another Democratic President once said his biggest regret is not having hung another vicious South Carolina wingnut for treason .
That senator was slavery 's most ardent and fanatic defender , the disgraceful John Calhoun , a kind of pre-Civil War political amalgam of Cheney , Strom Thurmond and DeMint .
He was an early secessionist who is best known for the doctrine of nullification , something neo-Confederates and reactionaries are still yammering about to this day .
Chad McGowan is a Democratic opponent of DeMint 's and on New Year 's Eve his campaign issued this press release

Paul Rolly ’s column in the Sunday ’s Salt Lake Tribune admirably conjured up the witch hunt some are said to be conducting up at the Capitol into lobbyists ’ drinking habits following the downfall of metal band lover and former State Senate majority leader Sheldon Killpack .---
One comment by Rolly caught my eye .
Legislative leaders viewed the only sin worse than drinking as hiring a prostitute , Rolly noted .
I had a conversation several days after Killpack ’s bust with a Republican source who remarked on how deep the dismay was among the Republican LDS leadership .
He said , “ The only thing Sheldon could have done worse than a DUI was getting caught in bed with a male prostitute . ”
He stressed the gender .
Which makes you wonder if Killpack had been found twixt the sheets with a lady of the night would he still be our senate ’s leader ?
LDS Church member Killpack ’s acknowledgement of his penchant for social tippling left one friend of mine also wondering if along with bars ’ mandatory carding of folks who look under 35 , perhaps those who are clean shaven in suits should also be asked for their LDS Church temple recommend .
Tit for tat as it were .
The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has presided over a series of damaging blunders , but how and why has so much gone wrong ?
Governments around the world rely on its findings to support policies on climate change and it is meant to be the gold standard .
It admits that its findings that glaciers in the Himalayas could disappear by 2035 is wrong , but there has been a wave of criticism .
Newsnight 's Kirsty Wark spoke to Professor Chris Field , co-chairman of the IPCC Working Group responsible for that report , and Professor Roger Pielke Junior , who says his work has been misrepresented in an IPCC report .

Gretchen Bleiler has set her sights on Olympic gold at the Vancouver Games , after settling for a silver medal in the 2006 Torino Olympics .
When the 29 - year - old Snowboard Halfpipe athlete is n't competing on the snow , she enjoys surfing , mountain biking , interior design and fashion .
She has been profiled in numerous sports and lifestyle publications and has posed for Lucky , Shape , Self , Maxim and FHM .
Bleiler competed on Thursday , February 18 , 2010 in Women 's Halfpipe .
She finished a disappointing 11th place after falling on her final run .
Check out the now famous SI bikini photos and video of several Team USA members : Vancouver gold medal winner Lindsey Vonn , and talented Snowboard Halfpipe athlete Hannah Teter , who competed with Bleiler and won a silver medal .
Equally gorgeous Snowboard Cross athlete Lindsey Jacobellis did n't pose for SI but her gallery is still worth a look .
One of the real stars of the Vancouver Games is Alpine skier Julia Mancuso .
She has captured two silver medals and will compete in two more events .

Last summer
Wired magazine ran a cover story on Craigslist , the classified - advertising Web site , and its founder , Craig Newmark .
Craigslist , the headline read , was a mess .
The story said the site was underdeveloped .
It refused to monetize itself .
Mr. Newmark would n't add new features , and his motivations were obscure .
Indeed , so poorly is Craigslist run that it 's easily one of the 20 biggest Web sites in the U.S. and , according to Wired , likely topped $ 100 million in revenue last year .
It did this with minimal effort and ...
It 's not often that right - leaning guests on " The Daily Show " get the better of host Jon Stewart .
But the Comedy Central star admitted that John Yoo , author of the Bush administration torture memos , " slipped right though my fingers " on Monday .
After his skewering of CNBC's Jim Cramer last year and his famous appearance on " Crossfire " in 2004 , has Stewart gone soft ?
( Watch video clip of Stewart 's timid Yoo interview below )
Jon Stewart is just a comedian : Stewart was " completely outmatched " by the " charming , tactful " Yoo , says Adam Serwer at the American Prospect .
Not only did he fail " to make
Yoo look as if he had done anything wrong , " he also " made him look entirely reasonable . "
This is what happens when you rely on a " comedian to do a reporter 's job . "
" When Jon Stewart fails "
This should be the last takedown : Stewart 's humbling was " predictable , " says Ezra Klein at the Washington Post .
Most of his famous takedowns " came before people understood that this late - night comedian did takedowns . "
Now , guests come " armed to rebut " his " scolding . "
Stewart should stop inviting " people whom he thinks are liars and frauds " onto his show — he 's " doing more harm than good " by giving them a " platform . "
" Stewart vs. Yoo "
Stewart should n't be too hard on himself :
It was n't the " intelligent " host 's fault that the legality of torture is " more difficult than usually presented " when one is " confronted directly with its details , " says David Frum in the National Post .
John
Yoo came off well because he did n't try to hide what he is : " a conscientious public servant , trying to do the best job he knew how to do to protect his country in a time of declared war . "
" An interview with Bush 's torturer - in - chief "
This is n't about Stewart : Jon Stewart 's " sense of moral outrage " is admirable , says Will Bunch in the Huffington Post .
In a " perfect world , " there would be " criminal investigations and charges " of those behind the " Bush torture regime " — but America is n't willing to hold anyone accountable .
The idea that the " worst stains on our nation 's legacy " should be cleansed by a " late - night comedy show " is the " biggest joke of all . "
“ When Your Nation 's Only Accountability Is A Late - Night Comedian ”
WASHINGTON -- Sen. Richard Shelby , R- Tuscaloosa , is dropping
, saying this evening through a spokesman that he has succeeded in drawing the White House 's attention to his concerns over the handling of an aerial refueling tanker contract and a planned explosives analysis center planned for Huntsville .
Shelby said he would continue to hold up three nominees for top defense jobs from winning Senate approval until the final bid package for the tanker is released .
Two of those candidates -- Frank Kendall , and Erin Conaton -- were already facing a blockade from Sen. Jeff Sessions , R-Mobile .

A Shabaab suicide bomber killed seven people in an attack at a medical clinic used by African Union forces .
The suicide bomber detonated his vest while waiting in line to enter the Halane medical clinic at the Mogadishu airport , the headquarters for the African Union Mission in Somalia .
Shabaab , al Qaeda ’s affiliate in Somalia , took credit for the suicide attack , claiming African Union doctors and soldiers were among those killed .
“ We killed some of the senior medical officers and soldiers in the mercenary base , ” Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Ali Mahamoud Rage told reporters .
“ It is part of our retaliation attack against the occupiers ’ massacre of our people . ”
An African Union spokesman said that only Somalis were killed in the suicide attack .
Eleven people , including three African Union soldiers , were wounded in the attack .
The last suicide attack carried out by Shabaab also targeted medical personnel .
On Dec. 3 , 2009 , a suicide bomber , who was disguised as a woman , detonated his vest in the midst of a graduation ceremony for Somali medical students from Banadir University .
The ministers of health , education , and higher education , along with two reporters from Shabelle and Al Arabia , nine medical students , and a well - known doctor , were killed in the blast .
Scores more were wounded , including the sports minister .
Shabaab has vowed to continue to attack African Union forces and the weak Somali government , which controls only small enclaves in the Somali capital .
Shabaab and its predecessor organization , the Islamic Courts , have conducted 20 suicide attacks since September 2006 , when the first suicide attack was recorded in Somalia [ see list below ] .
The latest four attacks have focused on senior leaders in the government and the African Union .
One of the most deadly suicide attacks took place on Sept. 17 , 2009 , when two suicide bombers penetrated security at an African Union base in Mogadishu and killed 21 people , including the deputy African Union commander and 16 other peacekeepers .
One of the suicide bombers was later confirmed to be an American citizen recruited by Shabaab in Minneapolis .
State Minister for Defense Sheikh Yusuf Mohammad Siad , who is better known as Indha ’adde , sold intelligence to Shabaab that allowed the terror group to conduct the attack .

I read a book proposal years ago on the subject of teaching kids to program with C++.
" After a week , " it said , " children will know enough to create their own simple text games and animations . "
I was perhaps six years old when I saw my first minicomputer .
I flipped open the first page of the manual and typed in the lines verbatim — except I left off the line numbers , likely thinking that they were merely a convenience for readers .
Perhaps I 've had good taste from the beginning .
My typing skills were , as you might expect , abysmal .
Even so , I had feedback from the computer within fifteen minutes or less .
If I 'd had to spend a week learning things to move characters around on the screen , I 'd have given up .
I like games .
I enjoy thinking about how they work .
I like writing stories .
I play games .
The mechanics of rules and balance and design and enjoyment and player participation and perception are fascinating .
Even more important is the idea that games can have a didactic purpose .
I spent a lot of time in my childhood years playing games but also breaking games .
A bit of work with a hex editor could give my party more experience points so that two or three well - placed fireball spells would clean out the kobold lair .
( Any role - playing system which starts magic users with four hit points wo n't have them surviving the tetanus shot before they get their passports . )
Because I could only get time on computers at school if they had an educational purpose , I taught myself how to write programs so I could write games .
I do n't suggest my experience is representative of all children , but it 's not so far different from that of many of my friends .
A few years ago , I tried to help revive SDL Perl when the maintainer retired .
The experience was difficult ; it 's a big wad of XS code that needs plenty of probing and configuration for a handful of somewhat - optional libraries .
I do n't even want to think about everything required to detect which version of OpenGL you have installed and available in a cross- platform fashion .
Fortunately , Kartik
Thakore is everyone 's hero ( and plenty of other people are helping too ) .
I 've heard the arguments that " Kids these days are too busy texting each other ! " or " It 's okay that kids make YouTube mashups of pop songs and clips of their favorite anime characters , that 's creativity ! " and " You can teach a kid PHP and HTML and call him a programmer , and that 's super fun ! "
I do n't believe any of them .
I think instead that you can plop your smart seven year old in front of a real computer with a real keyboard and show her that typing something makes a picture appear and typing something else makes it move and give her a few other commands and boom she 'll play with that for a while .
Not everyone 's suited to the deep , dark logic of understanding the bindings from a high level language to a shared library and memory management techniques thereof , but what a privilege to teach a younger generation that a computer is n't merely an appliance to read Wikipedia and text their friends , but a general purpose device they can control .
Show a few of them how to make pretty graphics move around on screen per their command — per textual instructions they have to reason about and maintain themselves — and you just might have something .
Sure , Pygame and Pyglet are great .
I 've used them productively .
Even so , more options for free software and free environments can only help .

There are no games on this day .
Remember that smart German iPhone - controlled car that used cameras , GPS , and lasers to perfectly run through the streets of Berlin ?
Well , screw German efficient engineering .
That 's not how we do things in America .
Here we modify battered , crappy cars — like this 1988 Oldsmobile Delta — in just four weeks using " a few motors , potentiometers , a Compact RIO embedded controller , and LabVIEW , " which get connected to the iPhone using Wi-Fi .
And then we strip out the doors for fun .
And we ride it on top of its roof .
Hopefully to an In - n- Out drive - in .
Would you like to do it yourself ?
Your lucky day , Mad Max .
Here 's a video tutorial :

The Times Square chaos stirred up by a thug using a stolen gun from out of state is another example why the nation needs tougher gun laws , Mayor Bloomberg said yesterday .
“ We ’ve got to stop this , ” he said .
“ This is one of the great public health threats .
And our police officers are clearly in danger . ”
Investigators are trying to figure out how Raymond Martinez got a hold of the MAC - 10 - style pistol that had been stolen earlier this year from its registered owner in Virginia .
Martinez was able to fire two shots before the gun — which carried a total of 29 bullets — jammed .
He was also carrying business cards from several gun dealers in Virginia when he was shot and killed , cops said .
“ We keep getting this lesson every day , ” Bloomberg said .
“ If you think of all the publicity about the terrible tragedy of Virginia Tech , we have a Virginia Tech in this country every day .
It ’s just spread across 50 states . ”
With Tim Burton ’s Alice in Wonderland finally set to come out March 5 ( that crazy Cheshire cat is already burned on my brain from the trailers alone ) , it seems he may already have his sights set on another Disney fairy tale – but , of course , from his own twisted viewpoint .
AICN is reporting he may – sort of – turn his attentions next to Sleeping Beauty , but instead of just putting his own dark touch on the original , he would transform it to be told from the viewpoint of Maleficent , the “ mistress of all evil ” who is the movie ’s antagonist and would go on to appear in the Kingdom Hearts video game series and other Disney offerings .
The movie would , in fact , be called Maleficent .
Personally , I think this sounds like great news , if it actually happens .
When he coasts through by - the - numbers remakes like Planet of the Apes and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , Burton seems as genuinely uninterested in making them as I was in watching them , but when he really bites into something classic and makes it his own , his movies can be a heck of a lot of fun .
And it would certainly give Helena Bonham Carter something wild to play with .
Hit the jump to find out what else Tim Burton has on his plate , and of course let us know if you think Maleficent the movie would be a good idea or not .
Though Maleficent is the latest rumored project for Tim Burton to direct , there are two others that might happen first .
He is also at least in “ pre-production ” on a stop motion , feature length version of his own 1984 short film Frankenweenie for Disney .
More interesting than that would be Dark Shadows , based on the 1960 ’s TV show .
It ’s been announced that Johnny Depp would both star as Barnabas Collins and serve as executive producer for the movie , but those plans have been delayed for at least a little while .
TV - to - movie transformations generally bore me to tears ( when I bother to watch them at all ) , but the cheesily weird world of Dark Shadows would certainly give Burton ’s imagination a lot of room to roam .
But getting back to Maleficent for a second , Slashfilm reported a while back ( via the seriously Disney obsessed Jim Hill Media ) that Disney has in fact already registered the domain name maleficentmovie.com , though it is of course empty right now .
As Jim Hill ’s initial report made very clear , Disney and other studios register all kinds of domain names just to protect them , not necessarily because they are ready to greenlight a movie right away .
And on a personal note , I can report that the Tim Burton exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City is well worth a visit if you do n’t mind being surrounded by hordes of excitable children .
It has all kinds of character sketches from his various movies and odd artifacts from the different sets , and it ’s just a fun way to get into Tim Burton ’s mind for a little while – a place I ’m not sure I ’d want to live , but still a great place to visit ( it runs until the first week of April . )
Over the past six months , Elizabeth O’Herron has banished nearly all brand names from her household .
So long Pampers , Hefty , and Birds Eye .
Instead , the pantry is stocked with cheaper imitations of the same goods : Wal - Mart ’s diapers , BJ ’s garbage bags , and Stop & Shop ’s frozen veggies .
“ I am not loyal to any grocery store or any brand , ’’ said O’Herron , who estimates she saves at least $ 50 a month by buying generic brands .
“ I am loyal to savings . ’’
A growing number of consumers like O’Herron are ditching their beloved Kellogg ’s Raisin Bran and Wonder Bread for less expensive versions without the familiar packaging .
Unit sales of private label goods have jumped 8 percent since 2007 , while brand names have declined roughly 4 percent , according to Nielsen Co .
Many shoppers are finding that sugar , shredded cheddar , and milk peddled under store labels cost up to 40 percent less and often taste just as good as nationally known brands .
Some items are even made by the same manufacturers .
Shoppers ’ switch to store brands suits merchants just fine because they make a bigger profit from selling their own labels .
This month , Supervalu , which runs several supermarket chains , including Shaw ’s , unveiled plans to slash the number of items in various categories by as much as 25 percent so it can display store brands more prominently .
Europeans long ago began embracing private labels , realizing it involved little sacrifice and considerable savings .
The recession has nudged Americans to the same realization .
More than 40 percent of shoppers reported buying store labels instead of name brands , and 63 percent said they plan to purchase private labels after the economy rebounds , according to a survey of 50,000 grocery shoppers released last week by BrandSpark and Better Homes and Gardens .
“ Store brands used to be nothing you wanted to buy .
It was a compromise you ’d make in quality in order to get something cheaper , ’’ said Alan Klein , of the Marketing Agency Paris New York , a consultancy .
“ But the recession has been an awakening for some consumers .
They are realizing that they can get equal or superior quality . ’’
Retail analysts say the trend has made it harder and more expensive for national brands to get their products on the shelves at a time when many of these companies have reduced advertising budgets .
This month , Procter & Gamble said it is launching an online shop this spring that will sell P&G products like Oil of Olay , Pampers , and Tide .
A P&G spokesman declined to comment on the rise in store brands , but the company last fall responded to consumers ’ trading down by lowering prices , including cutting the price of Cheer detergent by 13 percent .
Like everyone , Shannon and I share in the uncertainties created by the current COVID - 19 crisis .
In response , we will be contributing 25 % of our sales from our Etsy shop to the Feeding America fund to help provide relief to those who have been severely impacted by the pandemic .
When you purchase an item from our shop anytime during the months of May or June , we will donate 25 % of the sale price directly to this fund .
When possible , your jewelry purchase will be adorned with a small metal jewelry tag with “ R ” stamped on it to acknowledge your effort in providing Response , Relief , Recovery to those most in need .

Years ago , I visited the Grand Canyon with my family .
The beauty of it was overwhelming , and everything they say about it is true .
It 's magnificent .
That grandeur is only amplified by the obvious scientific significance of it .
The layers of sedimentary rock , exposed by the eons- long patient erosion of the Colorado river , are a dramatic open textbook of the geological history of our planet , as if the Earth itself is saying " Look here , and learn of the past ! "
Learn we have .
And the Earth , as we have also learned , is not entirely unique .
From millions of kilometers away , another canyon beckons us to uncover a planet 's past .
[ Click to engrandcanyonate . ]
What you 're seeing here is a topographical model of a small part of a crater floor on Mars : Gale Crater , to be precise , a monster 150 km ( 90 miles ) wide impact located nearly on the equator of Mars .
In its center rises a mountain , a central peak common in large impact craters .
Surrounding this central peak is an enormous mound of material , rising kilometers above the crater 's floor ( see the topographic image below ; the ellipse represents an old potential landing site of the Spirit rover ) .
It 's not entirely clear how this mound formed ; however , it 's likely that the entire crater was once filled with material laid down as periodic deposits , and that most of it has eroded away , leaving just that lopsided mound .
If that sounds familiar , it may be because the Grand Canyon has a similar history ( without the crater , of course ) .
And like its terrestrial counterpart , the exposed layers tell a history of Mars 's geologic past .
Scientists studying those layers using images from the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have uncovered a startling feature : while sulfates ( deposited by salty water ) are seen throughout the layers , clays are only seen lower down , deeper into the past .
Clays are only seen where water is abundant , but sulfates alone indicate conditions where water evaporated away .
What the floor of Gale Crater appears to be telling us is that standing water , at least locally , existed long ago on Mars , but later evaporated away .
This is consistent with what we have seen in other parts of Mars , of course .
Ever since the rovers landed on Mars we 've seen one piece of evidence after another of standing water in the Red Planet 's distant past .
But there 's something about this news that appeals to me , that touches more than the scientist part of my brain .
If I had n't told you that first image was from Mars , you might very well think that it was from the Grand Canyon or some other Earthly feature .
And it really is a canyon , as you can see from this HiRISE image of the same area :
This image shows the very lower left of the oblique view shown above .
It 's upside - down , making features difficult to compare ( check out the full HiRISE image of the area to see the whole thing ) , but the crater floor is at the top of this false - color image , and the mound begins to rise toward the bottom .
You can see the canyon carved right into the floor , with sand dunes rippling across it .
Whatever carved this canyon , perhaps hundreds of millions of years ago , perhaps more , tore away the deposited material and revealed all those layers of rock .
These layers can be read like a history book written in reverse chronological order , showing us the deep past of Mars , and telling the sad tale of how an entire planet lost its water .
Mars was once more like the Earth is now , though just how much is anyone 's guess at the moment .
I doubt it was exactly like Earth ; the evidence of water we see indicates it was incredibly salty , far saltier than we have here at home .
But still , Mars is a brilliant ochre cautionary tale in our sky .

If you ’re interested in learning how to become a freelance writer so you can earn an amazing income from home , this post is for you .
Imagine being your own boss , having nearly unlimited income potential , and being able to work from home .
Instead of slaving away in a cubicle all day , you rely on your creative talents – and your rigid work ethic – to build the life of your dreams .
Without an employer to answer to , you ’re free to take as much time off as you want .
While that freedom paves the way for countless family vacations , it also makes it easy for you to be a better mom or dad – the type who shows up for parent breakfasts and waits patiently at the bus stop each day .
You ’re grateful , but you work hard .
Because , no matter what , you cannot fathom working for anyone else again .
Failure is not an option .
You will succeed , or you will die trying !
How I Became an Online Freelance Writer
I ’m a 37 - year - old mother of two , and this is my life .
But , I was n’t always so fortunate .
Before I learned how to become a freelance writer , I worked in a thankless professional job that imposed countless demands on my time and my health .
I worked long hours , weekends , and holidays , watching my life ( and my children ’s lives ) tick away while I sacrificed everything for around $ 40,000 per year .
My kids were in full - time daycare , but they only got the scraps of a parent even when I was home .
Our daily routine was pure misery .
Wake up , dress to the nines with full makeup and hair , get the kids ready , scramble to get to daycare then to work by 8:00 .
Hate my life until 5:00 , throw together a sad dinner , bath time , laundry , chores , read a few books , then melt into a pile of disgust and despair .
Eventually , my husband and I decided we wanted more our of life – more freedom , more money , and more time for ourselves .
Since we were n’t sure what to do , we started a blog – ClubThrifty.com – in 2011 as a way to document our financial lives .
We were n’t sure where it would lead , but we hoped it would lead somewhere .
In the meantime , I began leveraging my online presence ( and my scarce free time ) to pursue my passion – writing .
For a long time , my husband and I worked full - time and built our online business during our spare time .
That often meant getting up at 5:00 a.m. to write before heading to our real jobs , blogging and writing on weekends and holidays , and sacrificing all our free time .
The ordeal was absolutely draining , and I wanted to give up all the time .
Fortunately , my husband never let me give up my dreams .
I took a few weeks “ off ” here and there , but I always jumped right back in .
Fortunately , our hard work eventually paid off .
These days , my husband is a full - time blogger who finally makes a little over six figures running our website .
I write online content for a living , earning an average of $ 15,000 – $ 20,000 per month creating content for a variety of websites and individuals .
I work extremely hard , but my new life puts my old one to shame .
Instead of schlepping by with 15 PTO days per year , we now travel around 12 weeks annually .
With more money at our disposal , we max out our retirement accounts and invest in real estate .
At this very moment , we are 9 months away from paying off our primary residence and never owing anyone a single cent ever again .
Most importantly , I am the type of parent I have always wanted to be – the type who is always home and available for my kids .
While the money is great , this is the best part of our success .
How to Become a Freelance Writer
Over the years , thousands of people have asked me how I transitioned from a 9 - 5 office jockey to a freelancer who barely gets dressed and earns six figures .
With that in mind , I created a course specifically for writers who want to build online careers – EarnMoreWriting.com .
Since my course launched in October of 2016 , nearly three hundred writers have begun building online freelancing careers of their own .
While much of the advice I offer is common sense , I share a lot of the lessons I learned the hard way .
Many course participants with writing skills or even untapped talent have benefited tremendously from hearing “ what not to do ” and having a freelancing road map to build off of .
If you ’re angling to build a freelance career from home , it ’s easy to spin your wheels without ever knowing where to start .
Here are eight steps anyone can take as they start on the path toward freelance success :
Step 1 : Know who you are .
One of the biggest roadblocks new writers face is figuring out who they are and what they should write about .
If you can nail down your passion , an area of expertise , or your areas of interest , it ’s a lot easier to find writing jobs in your niche .
Roshni Gandhi is an attorney who signed up for EarnMoreWriting .com because she wanted more freedom in her life and her career .
She took the advice in my course to “ find herself ” quite literally , choosing to leverage her lawyer skills to find writing jobs that apply to her area of expertise .
Gandhi also does a ton of ghostwriting , mostly because it pays well and lets her leverage her professional knowledge .
At the moment , she is earning between $ 3,500 and $ 5,000 per month creating online content , and that ’s on top of the income she earns as an attorney .
When it comes to finding your “ passion , ” her advice is similar to mine :
“ Pay attention to the topics and niches that pique your interest , ” says Gandhi .
“ There is a good chance that your interests align with paid writing gigs , and that will be your ideal match . ”
What are you obsessed about ?
What are you already reading about ?
What skills from your day job can translate into a writing career ?
Answer these questions and you ’ll be one step closer to finding where you belong .
Step 2 : Build a “ starter ” portfolio .
When it comes to getting started as a freelance writer , many aspiring writers struggle with what steps to take first .
It ’s hard to get writing jobs when you do n’t have a portfolio , yet you cannot build a portfolio without writing jobs .
One of the most important “ first steps ” for any freelance writer is building a “ starter portfolio ” with a few online samples potential clients can read .
Most of the time , you can start building a beginner ’s portfolio by guest posting for free .
Do n’t know where to guest post ?
The easiest way to get a guest post is to reach out to bloggers in your niche .
One of my first “ big writing jobs ” was with a website called GetRichSlowly.org .
They finally hired me after I sent a handful of guest posts they could publish for free .
While you do n’t want to write for free forever , writing for free ( for a short time ) can definitely pay off !
Step 3 : Become a better writer .
Building a freelance career that stands the test of time requires decent or good writing skills .
The best way to become a better writer is to constantly hone your skills – as in , write all the time whether you ’re getting paid or not .
Eric Ridenour is a course participant who has grown his income from $ 1,000 per month to $ 1,500 per month since he got started .
His secret ?
Ridenour reads and writes all the time in an effort to improve his skills .
“ Write every day no matter what , ” says Ridenour .
“ If you have no jobs , then write pitch letters .
If you are tired of writing pitch letters .
then free - write . ”
Tired of that ?
“ Make some creative posts on Facebook or write Amazon reviews , ” he says .
When Ridenour first got started , he says he used some of his best Amazon reviews on his writing portfolio .
Apparently , it worked .
Step 4 : Invest in yourself .
Ben Luthi started blogging four years ago , landed a writing job with Nerdwallet , then took my course once he was ready to become a freelancer .
He now earns around $ 5,000 per month writing in his spare time .
Luthi’s key to success ?
“ Relentless self - improvement , ” he says .
Since he did n’t have any writing experience when he started blogging , he faced quite a large learning curve at first .
“ After a few months of that , I started getting freelancing gigs and I had some great editors who gave me candid feedback , ” says Luthi .
“ I soaked it up and implemented the feedback immediately . ”
In addition to listening intently to any feedback you receive , you can also take a course that packages everything you need to know in an easy - to - digest format .
You ’ll spend money , but it can easily pay off .
When Luthi started his blog four years ago , the initial $ 300 he spent hurt quite a bit .
But , looking back four years later , he says that initial investment launched his career as a writer , leading to tens of thousands of dollars in additional income .
“ The same goes with Holly ’s writing course and other investments , ” says Luthi .
“ It may seem like a lot up front , but if you ’re disciplined and passionate about writing , the return on investment can be amazing . ”
Step 5 : Learn the art of the pitch .
When you ’re trying to build a portfolio that pays the bills , you have to find ways to score new clients .
Most freelance writers accomplish this goal by “ pitching ” clients who might pay them for work .
For this strategy to work , however , you have to know what to say and be willing to pitch often enough to land meaningful work .
Professional writer and course participant Aja McClanahan says she spends quite a bit of time pitching and trying to get new work .
“ I try to pitch at least 3 - 4 times a week , ” says McClanahan .
“ I also have my own blog with a social media following . ”
For McClanahan , this strategy has paid off in spades .
She is currently earning $ 3,000 – $ 4,000 per month with her freelancing efforts but hopes to double that amount soon .
Step 6 : Network , network , network .
While you do n’t have to network in - person as an online freelance writer , you have a lot to gain by reaching out to other writers and website owners in your niche .
The more people you know , the more jobs you can learn about .
I always suggest creating portfolios on websites like LinkedIn and joining online freelancing groups .
Writers in EarnMoreWriting.com share tips and job leads in a dedicated Facebook group as well .
Step 7 : Track your earnings and set new goals .
In my opinion , all writers need a daily , weekly , and monthly income goal .
Without a goal in mind , your freelance income is flying blind .
With a daily goal , however , it ’s much easier to achieve your income goals .
Imagine you want to earn six figures as a freelance writer .
That sounds like a lot and , without a goal , you might be hard - pressed to earn anything close to $ 100,000 per year .
But , break it down further and you ’ll see it ’s not that crazy after all .
Earning six figures per year requires a monthly income of at least $ 8,333 .
If you can work 20 days per month , you need to earn at least $ 416 per day .
That ’s a lot , but it ’s not unattainable .
I typically earn between $ 600 and $ 1,200 per day , after all .
Step 8 : Never give up .
If you want to be successful at anything in life , being able to weather numerous storms without giving up is key .
Building a freelance career takes time and effort .
You ’ll experience a lot of setbacks and hear a lot of “ no ’s ” at first .
If you want to break through to the other side , you have to focus on your “ wins ” and ignore your losses .
Ben Luthi may be earning $ 5,000 per month ( in addition to a full - time job ) now , but his first writing client paid him $ 10 per article .
It was n’t great , he says , but he used the opportunity to improve his writing skills and process .
Over time , he found more clients that paid better and moved up the ranks .
That ’s exactly how I built my career , and how you ’ll probably build yours , too .
While I earned around $ 75 per article at first , I kept improving my skills and moving up the ranks until I was finally at the top .
I experienced a ton of setbacks and stressful moments , but I never let the struggle stand in the way of my goals .
If you want to be a freelance writer , you need to develop thick skin and decide you ’ll never give up .
Those who never give up are the ones who succeed – even if it takes a while .
The Bottom Line
Building a freelance career is n’t easy .
If it was , everyone would do it .
It takes a strong - willed personality to build a career out of thin air then keep going even when success seems out of reach .
But , the payoff is worth it for those who find the courage to pursue their goals to the very end .
Not only can you achieve the kind of job flexibility and autonomy most people only dream of , but you have nearly unlimited income potential , too .
For a mom like me , the lifestyle is addictive – so addictive that I will do whatever it takes to maintain our high standard of living .
The same can be said for Aja McClanahan , who writes for a living while homeschooling her two kids .
“ I like being able to work whenever and wherever I need to , ” she says .
“ Plus , no one can fire me or put a cap on my income . ”
Unlimited income and the freedom to live life on your own terms ?

Take three kids and a flute .
Anne says the flute should be given to her because she is the only one who knows how to play it .
Bob says the flute should be handed to him as he is so poor he has no toys to play with .
Carla says the flute is hers because it is the fruit of her own labour .
How do we decide between these three legitimate claims ?
There are no institutional arrangements that can help us resolve this dispute in a universally accepted just manner .
Conceptions of what constitutes a " just society " , argues the Nobel Prize - winning economist and philosopher Amartya Sen in this majestic book , will not help us decide who should have the flute .
A one - dimensional notion of reason is not much help either , for it does not provide us with a feasible method of arriving at a choice .
What really enables us to resolve the dispute between the three children is the value we attach to the pursuit of human fulfilment , removal of poverty , and the entitlement to enjoy the products of one 's own labour .

Who gets the flute depends on your philosophy of justice .
Bob , the poorest , will have the immediate support of the economic egalitarian .
The libertarian would opt for Carla .
The utilitarian hedonist will bicker a bit but will eventually settle for Anne because she will get the maximum pleasure , as she can actually play the instrument .
While all three decisions are based on rational arguments and correct within their own perspective , they lead to totally different resolutions .
Thus justice is not a monolithic ideal but a pluralistic notion with many dimensions .
Yet Western philosophers have seen justice largely in singular , utopian terms .
Hobbes , Locke and Kant , for example , wove their notions of justice around an imaginary " social contract " between the citizens and the state .
A " just society " is produced through perfectly just state institutions and social arrangements and the right behaviour of the citizens .
Sen identifies two serious problems with this " arrangement focussed " approach .
First , there is no reasoned agreement on the nature of a " just society " .
Second , how would we actually recognise a " just society " if we saw one ?
Without some framework of comparison it is not possible to identify the ideal we need to pursue .
Furthermore , this approach is of no help in resolving basic issues of injustice .
How would you reason , for example , that slavery was an intolerable injustice in a framework that concerned itself with right institutions and right behaviour ?
How would we ensure that well - established and cheaply producible drugs were available to the poor patients of Aids in developing countries ?
When faced with stark injustice , the contractual approach turns out to be both redundant and unfeasible .
Much of Sen 's criticism is directed towards the liberal philosopher John Rawls , whose 1971 book , A Theory of Justice , has acquired the status of a classic .
Sen 's gentle and polite deconstruction of Rawls shows him to be rather shallow and irrelevant .
Rawls 's approach , based on specific institutions that firmly anchor society , demand a single , explicit resolution to the principle of justice .
Stalin had similar ideas .
Rawls is not just authoritarian but also elitist and Eurocentric .
Just as Mill had excluded " the backward nations " , women and children from his Essay on Liberty , Rawls openly acknowledges that the world 's poor have no place in his theory of justice .
Indeed , the very " idea of global justice " is dismissed by Rawls and his cohorts as totally irrelevant .
Moreover , the kind of " reasonable person " needed to produce a just society is found only in democratic , Western societies .
Given the limitations of Rawls 's theory of justice , why has he been turned into a demi-god ?
Sen does not tackle this question .
But a viable answer is provided by the classical Muslim philosopher al - Razi , who declared that " the acquisition of knowledge and the practice of justice " go hand in hand .
Justice acquires meaning and relevance , al - Razi argued , within socially conscious epistemologies .
The opposite is equally true .
Theories of justice that exclude , by definition , the poor or issues of global injustices only perpetuate injustice .
The main function of Rawls 's theory of justice , it seems , is to maintain the status quo , where injustice is not just simply a part of the system , but the system itself .
That 's exactly why he is force - fed to students of social sciences .
Sen 's alternative is a realisation - focused approach to justice which concentrates on the real behaviour of people and its actual outcomes .
Taking a cue from " social choice theory " , he wants us to focus on removing injustices on which we can all rationally agree .
There is nothing we can do about people dying of starvation beyond anyone 's control .
But we can choose to do something about injustices that emerge from a conscious " design of those wanting to bring about that outcome " .
I see two problems with this .
The " we " who choose must include those who consciously perpetuate injustice in the first place – ruthless corporations , hedge - fund managers and the like .
Moreover , design need not be conscious .
It can , for example , be unconsciously intrinsic in the theory itself .
Indeed , theory does sometimes serve as an instrument of injustice .
Think of free - market capitalism , along with its theoretical underpinnings , including the mathematical modelling of sub - prime derivatives , where huge profits for the few are produced from the misery of others .
To do something about the injustices perpetuated by the dominant model of economy , we need to tackle the tyranny of the discipline of economics itself .
Reading The Idea of Justice is like attending a master class in practical reasoning .
You can't help noticing you are engaging with a great , deeply pluralistic , mind .
There were times , however , when I felt a bit unfulfilled .
For example , we are temptingly informed that classical Sanskrit has two words for justice : niti , organisational propriety and behavioural correctness ; and nyaya , which stands for realised justice .
In the Indian context , the role of the institutions , rules and organisations have to be assessed in the broader and more inclusive perspective of the world as it actually emerges .
We are also told of Mughal Emperor Akbar 's idea that justice should be based on rational endeavour .
But this is not elaborated .
I also wanted to see some comparatively material on Islamic , Chinese and Latin American ideas on justice .
But these quibbles apart , this is a monumental work .
" When people across the world agitate to get more global justice " , Sen writes , " they are not clamouring for some kind of ' minimal humanitarianism " ' .
They are sensible enough to know that a " perfectly just " world is a utopian dream .
All they want is " the elimination of some outrageously unjust arrangement to enhance global justice " .

The spread of information networks is forming a new nervous system for our planet .
When something happens in Haiti or Hunan , the rest of us learn about it in real time – from real people .
And we can respond in real time as well .
Americans eager to help in the aftermath of a disaster and the girl trapped in the supermarket are connected in ways that were not even imagined a year ago , even a generation ago .
That same principle applies to almost all of humanity today .
Now , in many respects , information has never been so free .
There are more ways to spread more ideas to more people than at any moment in history .
And even in authoritarian countries , information networks are helping people discover new facts and making governments more accountable .
During his visit to China in November , President Obama defended the right of people to freely access information , and said that the more freely information flows , the stronger societies become .
He spoke about how access to information helps citizens hold their own governments accountable , generates new ideas , encourages creativity and entrepreneurship .
Amid this unprecedented surge in connectivity , we must also recognise that these technologies are not an unmitigated blessing .
These tools are also being exploited to undermine human progress and political rights .
The same networks that help organise movements for freedom also enable al - Qaida to spew hatred and incite violence against the innocent .
And technologies with the potential to open up access to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by governments to crush dissent and deny human rights .
In the last year , we 've seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information .
China , Tunisia , and Uzbekistan have stepped up their censorship of the internet .
In Vietnam , access to popular social networking sites has suddenly disappeared .
And last Friday in Egypt , 30 bloggers and activists were detained .
On their own , new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress , but the United States does .
We stand for a single internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas .
We need to synchronise our technological progress with our principles .
The internet is a network that magnifies the power and potential of all others .
And that 's why we believe it 's critical that its users are assured certain basic freedoms .
Freedom of expression is first among them .
But even as networks spread to nations around the globe , virtual walls are cropping up in place of visible walls .
Some countries have erected electronic barriers that prevent their people from accessing portions of the world 's networks .
They 've expunged words , names , and phrases from search engine results .
They have violated the privacy of citizens who engage in non-violent political speech .
These actions contravene the Universal Declaration on Human Rights , which tells us that all people have the right " to seek , receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers . "
With the spread of these restrictive practices , a new information curtain is descending across much of the world .
And beyond this partition , viral videos and blogposts are becoming the samizdat of our day .
As in the dictatorships of the past , governments are targeting independent thinkers who use these tools .
We 've seen reports that when Iranians living overseas posted online criticism of their nation 's leaders , their family members in Iran were singled out for retribution .
And despite an intense campaign of government intimidation , brave citizen journalists in Iran continue using technology to show the world and their fellow citizens what is happening inside their country .
Now , all societies recognise that free expression has its limits .
We do not tolerate those who incite others to violence .
And hate speech that targets individuals on the basis of their race , religion , ethnicity , gender , or sexual orientation is reprehensible .
It is an unfortunate fact that these issues are both growing challenges that the international community must confront together .
And we must also grapple with the issue of anonymous speech .
Those who use the internet to recruit terrorists or distribute stolen intellectual property cannot divorce their online actions from their real world identities .
But these challenges must not become an excuse for governments to systematically violate the rights and privacy of those who use the internet for peaceful political purposes .
The internet can help bridge divides between people of different faiths .
As we look for ways to expand dialogue , the internet holds out such tremendous promise .
Some nations , however , have co-opted the internet as a tool to target and silence people of faith .
Last year , for example , in Saudi Arabia , a man spent months in prison for blogging about Christianity .
And a Harvard study found that the Saudi government blocked many web pages about Hinduism , Judaism , Christianity , and even Islam .
Countries including Vietnam and China employed similar tactics to restrict access to religious information .
Just as these technologies must not be used to punish peaceful political speech , they must also not be used to persecute or silence religious minorities .
Now , we have every reason to be hopeful about what people can accomplish when they leverage communication networks and connection technologies to achieve progress .
But make no mistake – some are and will continue to use global information networks for darker purposes .
Violent extremists , criminal cartels , sexual predators , and authoritarian governments all seek to exploit these global networks .
As we work to advance freedoms , we must also work against those who use communication networks as tools of disruption and fear .
States , terrorists , and those who would act as their proxies must know that the United States will protect our networks .
Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy , our government , and our civil society .
Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and international condemnation .
The freedom to connect is like the freedom of assembly , only in cyberspace .
It allows individuals to get online , come together , and hopefully cooperate .
The United States is committed to devoting the diplomatic , economic , and technological resources necessary to advance these freedoms .
And as the birthplace for so many of these technologies , including the internet itself , we have a responsibility to see them used for good .
I 'm proud that the state department is already working in more than 40 countries to help individuals silenced by oppressive governments .
We are making this issue a priority at the United Nations as well , and we 're including internet freedom as a component in the first resolution we introduced after returning to the UN Human Rights Council .
We are also supporting the development of new tools that enable citizens to exercise their rights of free expression by circumventing politically motivated censorship .
Both the American people and nations that censor the internet should understand that our government is committed to helping promote internet freedom .
We feel strongly that principles like information freedom are n't just good policy , not just somehow connected to our national values , but they are universal and they 're also good for business .
Countries that censor news and information must recognize that from an economic standpoint , there is no distinction between censoring political speech and commercial speech .
Increasingly , US companies are making the issue of internet and information freedom a greater consideration in their business decisions .
I hope that their competitors and foreign governments will pay close attention to this trend .
The most recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of interest .
And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement .
And we also look for that investigation and its results to be transparent .
The internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China , and it is fabulous .
There are so many people in China now online .
But countries that restrict free access to information or violate the basic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century .
Now , the US and China have different views on this issue , and we intend to address those differences candidly and consistently in the context of our positive , co-operative , and comprehensive relationship .
We need to work toward a world in which access to networks and information brings people closer together and expands the definition of the global community .
Given the magnitude of the challenges we 're facing , we need people around the world to pool their knowledge and creativity to help rebuild the global economy , to protect our environment , to defeat violent extremism , and build a future in which every human being can live up to and realise his or her God - given potential .
• This is an edited extract of a speech by US secretary of state Hillary Clinton on internet freedom , delivered on 21 January 2010 at the Newseum , Washington DC
Hard to know who to root for and who to hiss when you run across a stand - off between notorious Republican strategist Frank Luntz and the scare - mongering behemoth otherwise known as the National Rifle Association .
This round , let 's listen to Luntz :
Mr. Luntz queried 832 gun owners , including 401 card - carrying N.R.A. members , in a survey commissioned by Mayors Against Illegal Guns , the alliance of hundreds of executives seeking stronger gun laws .
In flat rebuttal of N.R.A. propaganda , the findings showed that 69 percent of N.R.A. members supported closing the notorious gun-show loophole that invites laissez - faire arms dealing outside registration requirements .
Even more members , 82 percent , favored banning gun purchases to suspects on terrorist watch lists who are now free to arm .
And 69 percent disagreed with Congressionally imposed rules against sharing federal gun-trace information with state and local police agencies .
So ... a majority of gun owners want the gun-show loophole closed , favor restrictions on banned gun purchases and think it 's a good idea to have gun information shared between agencies .
Makes you wonder how reasonable their views would be if they were n't being pumped up by propaganda and warned to lock and load every election by the rich gun lobby .
Mr Geraghty - Shewan said the centre staff lacked " common sense " A father was told he was not allowed take pictures of his four - year - old son at a Sunderland shopping centre because of fears he could be a paedophile .
Kevin Geraghty - Shewan , of Kent , was challenged by a security guard at The Bridges after photographing his son Ben on a children 's train ride .
He was told he could not prove Ben was his son and later quizzed by a police officer called to the centre .
Bosses at the shopping centre have apologised for the " misunderstanding " .
Mr Geraghty - Shewan , 48 , of Gillingham , said they had visited the shopping centre after Ben was given £ 10 from his grandfather to buy a toy .
Ben Geraghty - Shewan is " train obsessed "
His wife had suggested taking a picture of their son on a mobile phone camera after the " train obsessed " youngster boarded the ride .
A security guard then approached and told him it was against the centre 's policy and that he " could be a paedophile " .
Mr Geraghty - Shewan said : " He said there was no way of proving what I was doing was innocent .
" I told him Ben was my own son and that he was blowing everything out of proportion .
" Five or 10 minutes later a police officer approached and asked for my name and address .
" I raised my voice , as I was getting a little annoyed by this stage , and he threatened to arrest me for breach of the peace .
" I could have understood if I had been observed hanging about but I had walked up with my wife and son .
' Security procedures '
" Surely these people should be able to tell the difference between the two situations - common sense was missing from the start . "
In a statement The Bridges said safety was taken " very seriously " at all its shopping centres .
The statement said : " We do ask our security guards across the estate to be diligent in implementing our security measures , which includes monitoring photography in our centres .
" Unfortunately on this occasion what should have been a simple polite conversation led to a misunderstanding and we apologise for any offence caused .
" It is always our aim to implement our security procedures with the minimum of fuss and disruption to our shoppers . "

Concluding the review of submissions to DFAIT regarding the Canada - EU Trade Agreement , the submission of the Canadian Publishers ' Council is important because it highlights the hopes of those lobbying for extensive new copyright reforms .
The submission makes clear that those groups hope that CETA could force Canada into reforms such as copyright term extension and the creation of new database protection :
It would be expected that the EU will press Canada to move ahead with enabling legislation leading to quick ratification of the [ WIPO Internet ] treaties .
The Council has vigorously encouraged and continues to encourage the Canadian government to introduce required legislation and to ratify the treaties .

The Las Vegas Sun reports that a Chinese bank is prepared to fork over $ 7 billion to build the proposed maglev train that would run from Las Vegas and Anaheim .
Export - Import Bank of China is saying they 'll provide the loan on the project , which backers now are envisioning as a shuttle that 'll whip Angelenos back and forth to Vegas .
" [ Maglev spokesman Mark ]
Fierro said development of the project could be one of the most significant economic events in Las Vegas history , because the city would become a virtual suburb of Los Angeles if trains could make the trip from Anaheim to Las Vegas in just more than an hour . "
' People in Los Angeles could come to the Las Vegas Strip for dinner , ' Fierro said .
“ This could n’t be a more perfect technology for the kind of visitor we ’re going to attract . ”
As for why China is loaning the money , backers point out the extensive maglev system in that country .

Using JavaScript has become increasingly easy over the last few years .
Whereas back in the day we needed to know the quirks of every browser , now many libraries such as jQuery , YUI , Dojo and MooTools allow someone who does n’t even know JavaScript to spruce up boring HTML documents with impressive and shiny effects .
By piggy - backing on the CSS selector engine , we have moved away from the complexity and inconsistencies of the DOM and made things much easier .
If you look at some of the code that has been released , though , we do seem to have taken a step backwards .
In gaining easier access , we also became a bit sloppy with our code .
Finding clearly structured , easy - to - maintain jQuery code is quite tough , which is why many plug-ins do the same thing .
Writing one yourself is faster than trying to fathom what other developers have done .
Be sure to check out the following articles :
The rules for solid , maintainable and secure JavaScript have n’t changed , though .
So , let ’s run through the seven sins of JavaScript development that will bite you in the backside when you have to maintain the code later on or hand it over to another party .
We ’ve all had to work with code written by other people .
We have despaired over the lack of maintainability and documentation as well as weird logic .
Funny enough , as developers , we started to see this as normal and got used to ignoring other people ’s work and instead writing new code for the same problems over and over , as if we were subconsciously trying to secure our jobs by leaving behind unmaintainable code — code that only we understood , while complaining that no good solutions were out there .
Sins Of Our Fathers : Browser - Specific Code
One of the main obstacles that kept us from evolving as developers was that JavaScript was largely browser - specific .
This was mainly because browsers did not support the standards ( or were shipped before the governing bodies agreed on standards at all ) , and because we had to deliver our work before the competition and without extending the overly optimistic deadline set by our project managers .
This happens to be one reason why Internet Explorer 6 refuses to die .
Hundreds of expensive software packages that are being used in offices worldwide were built when this browser was state of the art .
This — and the monoculture that advocated using one software vendor for everything from the operating system to documents to spreadsheets to the browser — is the reason why companies now ca n’t simply discontinue support for it .
It also means that newer versions of IE will always have to support the rendering mistakes of IE6 in one way or another .
IE6 is the Frankenstein of the Internet , haunting its creators , terribly misunderstood by the townsfolk , who would sooner kill it , burn it and dance around it than make any sense of it .
The good news is that you wo n’t find many scripts these days that begin with if ( document.all ) {} and continue with else if ( document.layers ) {} .
If you do find one , please send its creator a brief email encouraging them to move on or , better yet , to redirect their website to a better script that is actually being maintained .
Libraries to the Rescue
The job of JavaScript libraries such as jQuery , YUI , MooTools , Dojo and Glow is to make JavaScript development predictable and to relieve developers of the living hell that we call browser support .
In other words , they fix random bugs in browsers and free us to adopt standards without worrying that certain browsers wo n’t recognize them .
For example , the DOM method getElement ById ( id ) should be straightforward : find the element with the ID id and return it .
But because some versions of IE and Opera also return elements that have the name attribute of id , jQuery solves the problem this way :
var elem ; elem = document.getElementById( match [ 2 ] ) ; if ( elem ) { //
Handle the case where IE and Opera return items // by name instead of ID if ( elem.id !== match [ 2 ] ) { return rootjQuery. find ( selector ) ; } //
Otherwise , we inject the element directly into the jQuery object this .
length = 1 ; this [ 0 ] = elem ; }
This is where libraries are awfully useful and is why JavaScript libraries are here to stay .
Browsers will always do things wrong , and old browsers will not be upgraded by end users , either because of the aforementioned company regulations or because people simply do n’t care to keep up with the times .
So , while the practice of building software for certain browsers is on the decline ( at least for JavaScript — with CSS , we have a whole other headache ahead of us ) , we still have to be mindful of certain sins .
Sin # 1 : Not Playing Nice With Other Scripts
Here ’s the first one , which we still see a lot of on the Web .
Sadly , it is very common in demo code for APIs and Web services : global variables , functions and DOM - 1 event handlers .
What do I mean by these ?
Consider the following :
Every script in the HTML document has the same rights as the others and can , if need be , overwrite what other scripts have done before .
If you define a variable or function name , and some other include uses the same name , the initial one will be overwritten .
The same applies to event handlers if you attach them the old - school onEvent way .
Say you have the script script_one.js :
x = 5 ; function init ( ) { alert ( ' script one init ' ) ; document.getElementsByTagName( 'h1 ' ) [ 0 ] .onclick = function ( ) { this .style .
background = ' blue ' ; } } alert ( 'x is '+x ) ; window.
onload = init ;
And immediately after this one , you include another script , script_two.js :
x = 10 ; function init ( ) { alert ( ' script two init ' ) ; document.getElementsByTagName( 'h1 ' ) [ 0 ] .onclick = function ( ) { this.style.color = ' white ' ; } } alert ( 'x is '+x ) ; window.
onload = init ;
If you open this document in a browser , you will find that x turns from 5 to 10 and that the first init ( ) is never called .
The script two init alert ( ) does not come up , nor does the h1 get a blue background when you click it .
Only the text turns to white , which renders it invisible .
The solution is not to use onEvent handlers , but rather the proper DOM level 2 event handlers ( they do n’t work in IE , but let ’s not worry about that at the moment — remember , this is what libraries are for ) .
Furthermore , wrap your functions in another with a more unique name to prevent them from overriding each other .
var scriptOne = function ( ) { var x = 5 ; function init ( ) { alert ( ' script one init ' ) ; document.getElementsByTagName( 'h1 ' ) [ 0] .addEventListener ( ' click ' , function(e ) { var t = e.target ; t.style .
background = ' blue ' ; } , false ) ; } alert ( 'x inside is '+x ) ; return {init:init} ; }( ) ; window.addEventListener(' load ', scriptOne.init , false ) ; alert ( 'x outside is '+x ) ; var scriptTwo = function ( ) { var x = 10 ; function init ( ) { alert ( ' script two init ' ) ; document.getElementsByTagName( 'h1 ' ) [ 0].addEventListener ( ' click ' , function(e ) { var t = e.target ; t.style.color = ' white ' ; } , false ) ; } alert ( 'x inside is '+x ) ; return {init:init} ; }( ) ; window.addEventListener(' load ' , scriptTwo.init , false ) ; alert ( 'x outside is '+x ) ;
If you run this in a browser ( not Internet Explorer 6 ) , everything will come up as you expect : x is first 5 , then 10 on the inside , and the heading turns blue and white when you click it .
Both init ( ) functions are called , too .
You also get an error .
Because x is not defined outside the functions , the alert ( ‘x outside is ‘ +x ) ; never works .
The reason is that by moving the x into the scriptOne and scriptTwo functions and adding the var keyword in front of them , we have made them a part of those functions but hid them from the outside world .
This is called a closure and is explained in detail here .
It is probably the most powerful feature of JavaScript .
Using closures and var keywords , you wo n’t have the problem of variables with similar names overriding each other .
This also applies in jQuery : you should namespace your functions .
This can be tough to grasp , so let ’s look at a simpler example :
var x = 4 ; var f = 3 ; var me = ' Chris ' ; function init ( ) {} function load ( ) {}
All of these are global variables and functions now .
Any other script having the same variables will override these .
You can nest them in an object to avoid this :
var longerAndMoreDistinct = { x : 4 , f : 3 , me : ' Chris ' , init : function ( ) {} , load : function ( ) {} }
That way , only the longerAndMoreDistinct is global .
If you want to run this function , you now have to call longer AndMoreDistinct.init ( ) instead of init ( ) .
You can reach me as longerAndMoreDistinct .me and so on .
I do n’t like this because I have to switch from one notation to another .
So , we can do the following :
var longerAndMoreDistinct = function ( ) { var x = 4 ; var f = 3 ; var me = ' Chris ' ; function init ( ) {} function load ( ) {} }( ) ;
You define longerAndMoreDistinct as the outcome of a function without a name that gets immediately executed ( this is the ( ) on the last line ) .
This now means that all of the variables and functions inside exist only in this world and cannot be accessed from outside at all .
If you want to make them accessible from outside , you need to return them to the outside world :
var longerAndMoreDistinct = function ( ) { var x = 4 ; var f = 3 ; var me = ' Chris ' ; function load ( ) {} return { init:function ( ) {} } }( ) ;
Now init( ) is available as longerAndMoreDistinct.init ( ) again .
This construct of wrapping things in an anonymous function and returning some of them is called the Module pattern , and it keeps your variables safe .
Personally , I still hate the shift in syntax , so I came up with the revealing module pattern .
Instead of returning the real function , all I do is return a pointer to it :
var longerAndMoreDistinct = function ( ) { var x = 4 ; var f = 3 ; var me = ' Chris ' ; function load ( ) {} function init ( ) {} return { init : init } }( ) ;
This way , I can make things either available or not available simply by adding to the object that is returned .
If you do n’t need to give anything to the world and just want to run some code and keep all of your variables and function names safe , you can dispense with the name of the function :
( function ( ) { var x = 4 ; var f = 3 ; var me = ' Chris ' ; function load ( ) {} function init ( ) {} } ) ( ) ;
Using var and wrapping code in this construct makes it inaccessible to the outside world , but still makes it execute .
You may find this to be complex stuff , but there is a good way to check your code .
JSLint is a validator for JavaScript , much like the HTML or CSS validators , and it tells you all the things that might be wrong with your code .
Sin # 2 : Believing Instead Of Testing
The next big sin related to implementing JavaScript is expecting everything to go right : every parameter being in the right format , every HTML element you try to enhance being truly available , and every end user entering information in the right format .
This will never be the case , and that last assumption is an especially bad one because it allows malicious users to inject dangerous code .
When you write JavaScript and give it to the world or integrate it in a product that will be maintained by a third party , a little paranoia is a good thing .
typeof is your friend .
Regular expressions are your friend . indexOf ( ) , split and length are your friends .
In other words , do everything you can to make sure that incoming data is the right format .
You will get a lot of errors with native JavaScript ; if you do anything wrong , you ’ll know what happened .
The annoying thing about most JavaScript libraries is that when they fail to execute some functionality , they do it silently .
The maintainer is left guessing and has to run through all the code and start debugging with stop points ( or— shudder ! — alerts ( ) ) to reverse - engineer where you entered instable code .
To avoid this , simply wrap whatever you can in a test case rather than try to access it .
Sin # 3 : Using The Wrong Technology For The Job
The biggest problem with JavaScript happens when you use the wrong tool for the job .
It makes maintenance a nightmare and deteriorates the code ’s quality .
Use tools for the jobs they were meant for .
This means :
Absolutely essential content and mark - up should be in HTML , regardless of the environment it will be displayed in .
Any “ look and feel ” elements should be maintainable through CSS .
You should not have to scour through JavaScript to change a color .
Any interaction with the user that goes beyond hover effects ( which , by definition , are an invitation to interact and not the interaction itself — because they are inaccessible to keyboard users ) should be done with JavaScript .
The main reason why this is still a valid , pragmatic and sensible approach to development is that as Web technologies get muddled ( for example , you can create content with CSS and JavaScript , animate and transform in CSS and — if you really want — paint with HTML ) , people ’s skills and interests in these different technologies vary quite a bit .
Semantic mark - up buffs are not much interested in applying closures in JavaScript .
JavaScript developers are not much interested in the order of elements in CSS .
And CSS fans are n’t keen to learn how to make a JavaScript animation run flicker - free .
This results in the same problems being solved over and over again , only with different technologies .
This is a market - wide problem : a lot of state - of - the - art Canvas tricks were done in Flash years ago , their impact debated and their problems fixed .
My favorite instance of this is when people write loops to hide a lot of elements on the page to make them available later on .
Say this is your HTML :
<h2>Section 1</h2 > < div class=" section " >
< p >Section 1 content</ p> </div > < h2>Section 2</h2 > < div class=" section " >
< p >Section 2 content</ p> </div > < h2>Section 3</h2 > < div class=" section " >
< p >Section 3 content</ p> </div > < h2>Section 4</h2 > < div class=" section " >
< p >Section 4 content</ p> </div >
The normal jQuery solution for this would be :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( '.section ' ) .hide ( ) ; $ ( 'h2 ').click ( function(e ) { $ ( this ) .next ( ) .toggle ( ) ; } ) } ) ;
And then you realize that making the style of the current section deviate from that of the other sections would be great .
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( '.section ' ) .hide ( ) ; $ ( 'h2 ').click ( function(e ) { $ ( this ) .next ( ) .toggle ( ) ; $ ( this ) .next ( ).css ( ' background ' , ' #ccc ' ) ; $ ( this ) . next ( ) .css ( ' border ' , '1px solid # 999 ' ) ; $ ( this ) . next ( ) .css ( ' padding ' , '5 px ' ) ; } ) } ) ;
A few things are wrong with this .
For starters , you ’ve made it hard to maintain this by controlling the look and feel in JavaScript , not CSS ( more on this later ) .
Secondly , performance : while jQuery is amazingly speedy , a lot of code is still hidden under the hood in $ ( ‘.section ’ ) . hide ( ) .
The last , and very painful , performance issue is the copied and pasted lines that set the CSS .
Do n’t ask jQuery to find the next sibling four times and do something to it .
You could store the next ( ) in a variable , but even that is not needed if you chain .
If you really need to set a lot of CSS in jQuery , use a map :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( '.section ' ) .hide ( ) ; $ ( 'h2 ').click ( function(e ) { $ ( this ) .next ( ) .toggle ( ).css ( { ' background ' :' # ffc ' , ' border ' : ' 1 px solid # 999 ' , ' padding ' : '5 px ' } ) ; } ) } ) ;
What if you then want to allow only one of them to be open at any time ?
Inexperienced developers would do something like this :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( '.section ' ) .hide ( ) ; $ ( 'h2').click ( function(e ) { $ ( '.section ' ) .hide ( ) ; $ ( this ) .next ( ) .toggle ( ).css ( { ' background ' :' # ffc ' , ' border ' : ' 1 px solid # 999 ' , ' padding ' : '5 px ' } ) ; } ) } ) ;
This does the job , but you ’re looping around the document and accessing the DOM a lot , which is slow .
You can alleviate this by keeping the current open section in a variable :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { var current = false ; $ ( '.section ' ) . hide ( ) ; $ ( 'h2 ' ).click ( function(e ) { if ( current ) { current.hide ( ) ; } current = $ ( this ) .next ( ) ; current.toggle ().css ({ ' background ' :' # ffc ' , ' border ' : ' 1 px solid # 999 ' , ' padding ' : '5 px ' } ) ; } ) } ) ;
Predefine the current section as false , and set it when you click the first heading .
You would then hide current only if it is true , thereby removing the need for another loop through all elements that have the class section .
But here is the interesting thing : if all you want is to show and hide sections , you do n’t need any looping at all !
CSS already goes through the document when it renders and applies classes .
You just need to give the CSS engine something to hang on to , such as a class for the body :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( ' body ' ) .addClass ( 'js ' ) ; var current = null ; $ ( 'h2 ' ).click ( function (e ) { if ( current ) { current.removeClass('current ' ) ; } current = $ ( this ) .next ( ) .addClass ( ' current ' ) ; } ) } ) ;
By adding the class js to the body of the document and toggling the class current for the current section , you maintain control of the look and feel in CSS :
< style type =" text / css " media= " screen " > . section{ border : 1 px solid # 999 ; background : #ccc ; } .js .section{ display : none ; } .js .current{ display : block ; border : 1 px solid # 999 ; background : # ffc ; } </style >
The beauty of this is that the handle will be re-usable by the CSS designer and maintainer .
Anything without the .js selector would be the non-scripting - enabled version of a part of the document , and anything with the .js selector is applied only when JavaScript is available .
And yes , you should think about the case when it is not .
Sin # 4 : Depending On JavaScript And Certain Input Devices
There is quite a discussion about the need to consider non-JavaScript environments in this day and age , but here is a fact : JavaScript can be turned off , and any JavaScript could break the page for the other scripts that are included .
Given the flakiness of code out there that may be running alongside yours and the instability of wireless and mobile connections , I for one want to build one thing : code that works .
So , making sure that the most basic usage of your product does not depend on JavaScript is not just nice to have but essential if you expect people to actually use the product .
Absolutely nothing is wrong with using JavaScript heavily .
On the contrary , it makes the Web much smoother and saves us a lot of time if done right .
But you should never promise functionality that does n’t work .
And if you rely on JavaScript , this is exactly what you ’re doing .
I ’ve already covered the effects of bad JavaScript in detail in the AJAX , JavaScript testing and security articles here on Smashing Magazine , but once again here are some simple steps you can take to make sure you do n’t break your promise to end users :
Anything vital to the functionality of your product should not require JavaScript .
Forms , links and server - side validation and re-direct scripts are your friends .
If something depends on JavaScript , build it with JavaScript and add it to the document using the DOM or the equivalent method in your library of choice .
If you add JavaScript functionality , make sure it works with the keyboard and mouse .
Click and submit handlers are bullet - proof , whereas key and mouse events are flaky and do n’t work on mobile devices .
By writing clever back - end code that recognizes when data is required by JavaScript rather than building APIs that render HTML , you avoid having to do double - maintenance , which is an argument that many of the “ Everyone enables JavaScript ” zealots bring up a lot .
For proof of this , check out the presentation on building Web applications using YQL and YUI that I gave a few weeks ago ( video in English and German ) .
When JavaScript Dependence Is Okay ( to a Degree )
A lot of misunderstanding about JavaScript dependence stems from people making blanket statements based on the environments they work in .
If you are a Google engineer working on Gmail , you would be hard pressed to think of why you would even bother working without JavaScript .
The same goes for widget developers who work on OpenSocial widgets , mobile applications , Apple widgets and Adobe Air .
In other words , if your environment already depends on JavaScript , then by all means do n’t bother with a fall - back .
But do not take these closed environments and edge - case applications as the standard by which we should be measuring JavaScript .
JavaScript ’s greatest power and greatest problem is its versatility .
Saying that all websites can stand JavaScript because Gmail needs it is like saying that all cars should have a start button because they work great in Hybrids , or that hybrid cars should have massive tanks and cow catchers because they work great on Hummers .
The technical feature set of a product depends on its implementation and target market .
Different applications have different base functionality that needs to be satisfied in order to reach the largest audience and not block people out .
Consider the Use Cases and Maintenance
One fascinating aspect of JavaScript - dependent code is that , in many cases , people have simply not considered all the use cases ( here ’s a great example ) .
Take the following HTML :
< form action= " # " id= " f " > < div > < label for = " search " > Search < / label > < input type =" text " value = " kittens " id =" search " > < input type =" submit " id= " s " value= " go " >
</div > </ form > < div id =" results " ></div >
Without JavaScript , this does nothing whatsoever .
There is no sensible action attribute , and the text field has no name attribute .
So , even when you send the form off , the server wo n’t get the information that the user has entered .
Using jQuery and a JSON data source such as YQL , you can do a pure JavaScript search with this :
$ ('#s ').click ( function ( event ) { event.preventDefault ( ) ; $ ( ' <ul / >') .appendTo( '#results ' ) ; var url = $.getJSON ( ' http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?'+
' q=select%20abstract%2Cclickurl%2Cdispurl%2Ctitle%20 '+ ' from%20search.web%20where%20query %3D%22 '+ $ ( ' # search ' ) .val ( ) + '% 22&format=json& '+ ' callback= ? ' , function ( data ) { $.each(data.query.results.result , function ( i, item ) { $ ( ' < li >< h3 > < a href= " '+item.clickurl +' " >'+ item.title +' ( ' +item.dispurl + ' )</a></h3><p>'+ ( item.abstract || ’) +'</p></li>'). appendTo ( " #results ul " ) ; } ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
This works … unless of course you are like me and prefer to send forms by hitting “ Enter ” rather than clicking the “ Submit ” button .
Unless I tab through the whole form and focus on the “ Submit ” button , I get nothing .
So , that ’s the first thing to fix .
If you create forms , never use a click handler on the button .
Instead , use the submit event of the form .
This catches both the clicking “ Submit ” and hitting “ Enter ” cases .
With one change , you now support all of the keyboard users out there , and the whole change is contained in the first line :
$ ('# f ' ) .submit( function ( event ) { event.preventDefault ( ) ; $ ( ' <ul / >') .appendTo( '#results ' ) ; var url = $.getJSON ( ' http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?'+
' q=select%20abstract%2Cclickurl%2Cdispurl%2Ctitle%20 '+ ' from%20search.web%20where%20query %3D%22 '+ $ ( ' # search ' ) .val ( ) + '% 22&format=json& '+ ' callback= ? ' , function ( data ) { $.each(data.query.results.result , function ( i, item ) { $ ( ' < li >< h3 > < a href= " '+item.clickurl +' " >'+ item.title +' ( ' +item.dispurl + ' )</a></h3><p>'+ ( item.abstract || ’) +'</p></li>'). appendTo ( " #results ul " ) ; } ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
We ’ve now covered the first case .
But without JavaScript , the form still does n’t do anything .
And another problem brings us to the next sin of writing JavaScript .
Sin # 5 : Making Maintenance Unnecessarily Hard
One thing that keeps great code off the Web is that our work environment , deadlines and hiring practices condition developers to build code for quick release , without considering how difficult maintaining that code will be later on .
I once called JavaScript the village bicycle of Web design ( slides here ) : anyone can go for a ride .
Because the code is available in the open , future maintainers will be able to mess around with it and extend it any way they like .
The sad thing is that the harder your code is to maintain , the more errors will be added to it , leading it to look more like alphabet soup than organized script .
Take the above example .
Those of you who have n’t worked with YQL and JSON - P for cross - domain AJAX undoubtedly had a “ What ? ” moment looking at the code .
Furthermore , keeping a lot of HTML in JavaScript easy to follow is hard , and guess what is the first thing to change when a new design for the page comes along ?
Exactly : the HTML and CSS .
So , to make it easier to maintain , I for one would shift all of the work to the back end , thus making the form work without JavaScript and keeping maintenance of all the HTML in the same document :
<? php if ( isset ( $ _GET [ ' search ' ] ) ) {
$ search = filter_input ( INPUT_GET , ' search ' , FILTER_SANITIZE_ENCODED ) ; $ data = getdata ( $ search ) ; if ( $ data -> query -> results ) { $ out = ' < ul > ' ; foreach ( $ data - > query - > results - > result as $ r ) { $ out .= " < li > < h3 > < a href= " {$r -> clickurl} " >{$r -> title} < span >( {$r-> dispurl} ) </ span > </ a> </h3 > < p>{$r->abstract}</p> </li > " ; } $ out .= '< /ul > ' ; } else { $ out = ' < h3 > Error : could not find any results </h3 >' ; } } if ($_SERVER [ ' HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH ' ] !=’ ) { echo $ out ; die ( ) ; } ? >
<!
DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD
HTML 4.01//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd " > < html > < head > < meta http-equiv= " Content - Type " content = " text / html ; charset=UTF - 8 " > < title > Ajax Search with PHP API </ title > < link rel=" stylesheet " href=" styles.css " type =" text/css " > </head > < body > < form action= " independent.php " id= " f " > < div > < label for = " search " > Search < / label > < input type =" text " value = " kittens " name = " search " id =" search " > < input type =" submit " id= " s " value = " Go " > </div > </ form > < div id =" results " ><?
php if ( $out !=’) {echo $ out ;} ?></div > < script src=" jquery.js " ></ script > < script src=" ajaxform.js " ></ script > </ body > </html > <? php function getdata( $ search ) { $url = ' http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?'.
' q=select%20abstract%2Cclickurl%2Cdispurl%2Ctitle%20 '.
' from%20search.web%20where%20query %3D%22 '.$ search .'% 22 '. '& format=json ' ; $ ch = curl_init ( ) ; curl_setopt( $ch , CURLOPT_URL , $url ) ; curl_setopt ( $ch , CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER , 1 ) ; $ output = curl_exec ( $ch ) ; curl_close ( $ch ) ; $ data = json_decode ( $ output ) ; return $ data ; } ?>
Someone who does n’t understand PHP at all should still be able to change the HTML display without breaking the code .
With this in place , the JavaScript boils down to a very simple script :
$ ('# f ' ) .submit( function ( event ) { event.preventDefault( ) ; $.get (' independent.php?search= ' + $ ( ' # search ' ) .val ( ) , function ( data ) { $ ( ' # results ' ) .html(data ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
The normal way to make code more maintainable is to move everything that is likely to change away from the main functional part of the script into a configuration object at the very top of the script .
You can return this as an object to the outside world to allow people to set it before they initialize the main functionality .
So , one change we can make to our earlier example — albeit a small one now , but that can change quickly when more requirements come in — is to have a configuration section right up front that defines the CSS classes in use :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) {
/*
Configuration object - change classes , IDs and string here */ var config = { /* CSS classes that get applied dynamically */ javascriptenabled : 'js ' , currentsection : ' current ' } /* functionality starts here */ $ ( ' body ' ) .addClass(config.javascriptenabled ) ; var current = null ; $ ( 'h2 ' ).click ( function(e ) { if ( current ) { current.removeClass(config.currentsection ) ; } current = $ ( this ) .next ( ).addClass(config.currentsection ) ; } ) } ) ;
For more information on configuration objects and why they rock for maintenance , check out the blog post “ Providing Script Configuration Inline and Programatically ” .
In summary , go over your code once more when you think you ’ve finished with it and the next person is about to take it over .
Sin # 6 : Not Documenting Your Code
“ Good code documents itself ” is a terribly common and misguided belief .
In my years as a developer , I ’ve found that my style of coding has changed constantly .
What was common knowledge and best practice in 2004 might be forgotten or even considered poor style these days .
<h2>Section 2</h2 > < div class=“ section ” >
< p >Section 2 content</ p> </div >
<h2>Section 3</h2 > < div class=“ section ” >
< p >Section 3 content</ p> </div >
<h2>Section 4</h2 > < div class=“ section ” >
< p >Section 4 content</ p> </div >
The normal jQuery solution for this would be :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( '.section ' ) .hide ( ) ; $ ( 'h2 ').click ( function(e ) { $ ( this ) .next ( ) .toggle ( ) ; } ) } ) ;
And then you realize that making the style of the current section deviate from that of the other sections would be great .
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( '.section ' ) .hide ( ) ; $ ( 'h2 ').click ( function(e ) { $ ( this ) .next ( ) .toggle ( ) ; $ ( this ) .next ( ).css ( ' background ' , ' #ccc ' ) ; $ ( this ) . next ( ) .css ( ' border ' , '1px solid # 999 ' ) ; $ ( this ) . next ( ) .css ( ' padding ' , '5 px ' ) ; } ) } ) ;
A few things are wrong with this .
For starters , you ’ve made it hard to maintain this by controlling the look and feel in JavaScript , not CSS ( more on this later ) .
Secondly , performance : while jQuery is amazingly speedy , a lot of code is still hidden under the hood in $ ( ‘.section ’ ) . hide ( ) .
The last , and very painful , performance issue is the copied and pasted lines that set the CSS .
Do n’t ask jQuery to find the next sibling four times and do something to it .
You could store the next ( ) in a variable , but even that is not needed if you chain .
If you really need to set a lot of CSS in jQuery , use a map :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( '.section ' ) .hide ( ) ; $ ( 'h2 ').click ( function(e ) { $ ( this ) .next ( ) .toggle ( ).css ( { ' background ' :' # ffc ' , ' border ' : ' 1 px solid # 999 ' , ' padding ' : '5 px ' } ) ; } ) } ) ;
What if you then want to allow only one of them to be open at any time ?
Inexperienced developers would do something like this :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( '.section ' ) .hide ( ) ; $ ( 'h2').click ( function(e ) { $ ( '.section ' ) .hide ( ) ; $ ( this ) .next ( ) .toggle ( ).css ( { ' background ' :' # ffc ' , ' border ' : ' 1 px solid # 999 ' , ' padding ' : '5 px ' } ) ; } ) } ) ;
This does the job , but you ’re looping around the document and accessing the DOM a lot , which is slow .
You can alleviate this by keeping the current open section in a variable :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { var current = false ; $ ( '.section ' ) . hide ( ) ; $ ( 'h2 ' ).click ( function(e ) { if ( current ) { current.hide ( ) ; } current = $ ( this ) .next ( ) ; current.toggle ().css ({ ' background ' :' # ffc ' , ' border ' : ' 1 px solid # 999 ' , ' padding ' : '5 px ' } ) ; } ) } ) ;
Predefine the current section as false , and set it when you click the first heading .
You would then hide current only if it is true , thereby removing the need for another loop through all elements that have the class section .
But here is the interesting thing : if all you want is to show and hide sections , you do n’t need any looping at all !
CSS already goes through the document when it renders and applies classes .
You just need to give the CSS engine something to hang on to , such as a class for the body :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( ' body ' ) .addClass ( 'js ' ) ; var current = null ; $ ( 'h2 ' ).click ( function (e ) { if ( current ) { current.removeClass('current ' ) ; } current = $ ( this ) .next ( ) .addClass ( ' current ' ) ; } ) } ) ;
By adding the class js to the body of the document and toggling the class current for the current section , you maintain control of the look and feel in CSS :
< style type =" text / css " media= " screen " > . section{ border : 1 px solid # 999 ; background : #ccc ; } .js .section{ display : none ; } .js .current{ display : block ; border : 1 px solid # 999 ; background : # ffc ; } </style >
The beauty of this is that the handle will be re-usable by the CSS designer and maintainer .
Anything without the .js selector would be the non-scripting - enabled version of a part of the document , and anything with the .js selector is applied only when JavaScript is available .
And yes , you should think about the case when it is not .
Sin # 4 : Depending On JavaScript And Certain Input Devices
There is quite a discussion about the need to consider non-JavaScript environments in this day and age , but here is a fact : JavaScript can be turned off , and any JavaScript could break the page for the other scripts that are included .
Given the flakiness of code out there that may be running alongside yours and the instability of wireless and mobile connections , I for one want to build one thing : code that works .
So , making sure that the most basic usage of your product does not depend on JavaScript is not just nice to have but essential if you expect people to actually use the product .
Absolutely nothing is wrong with using JavaScript heavily .
On the contrary , it makes the Web much smoother and saves us a lot of time if done right .
But you should never promise functionality that does n’t work .
And if you rely on JavaScript , this is exactly what you ’re doing .
I ’ve already covered the effects of bad JavaScript in detail in the AJAX , JavaScript testing and security articles here on Smashing Magazine , but once again here are some simple steps you can take to make sure you do n’t break your promise to end users :
Anything vital to the functionality of your product should not require JavaScript .
Forms , links and server - side validation and re-direct scripts are your friends .
If something depends on JavaScript , build it with JavaScript and add it to the document using the DOM or the equivalent method in your library of choice .
If you add JavaScript functionality , make sure it works with the keyboard and mouse .
Click and submit handlers are bullet - proof , whereas key and mouse events are flaky and do n’t work on mobile devices .
By writing clever back - end code that recognizes when data is required by JavaScript rather than building APIs that render HTML , you avoid having to do double - maintenance , which is an argument that many of the “ Everyone enables JavaScript ” zealots bring up a lot .
For proof of this , check out the presentation on building Web applications using YQL and YUI that I gave a few weeks ago ( video in English and German ) .
When JavaScript Dependence Is Okay ( to a Degree )
A lot of misunderstanding about JavaScript dependence stems from people making blanket statements based on the environments they work in .
If you are a Google engineer working on Gmail , you would be hard pressed to think of why you would even bother working without JavaScript .
The same goes for widget developers who work on OpenSocial widgets , mobile applications , Apple widgets and Adobe Air .
In other words , if your environment already depends on JavaScript , then by all means do n’t bother with a fall - back .
But do not take these closed environments and edge - case applications as the standard by which we should be measuring JavaScript .
JavaScript ’s greatest power and greatest problem is its versatility .
Saying that all websites can stand JavaScript because Gmail needs it is like saying that all cars should have a start button because they work great in Hybrids , or that hybrid cars should have massive tanks and cow catchers because they work great on Hummers .
The technical feature set of a product depends on its implementation and target market .
Different applications have different base functionality that needs to be satisfied in order to reach the largest audience and not block people out .
Consider the Use Cases and Maintenance
One fascinating aspect of JavaScript - dependent code is that , in many cases , people have simply not considered all the use cases ( here ’s a great example ) .
Take the following HTML :
< form action= " # " id= " f " > < div > < label for = " search " > Search < / label > < input type =" text " value = " kittens " id =" search " > < input type =" submit " id= " s " value= " go " >
</div > </ form > < div id =" results " ></div >
Without JavaScript , this does nothing whatsoever .
There is no sensible action attribute , and the text field has no name attribute .
So , even when you send the form off , the server wo n’t get the information that the user has entered .
Using jQuery and a JSON data source such as YQL , you can do a pure JavaScript search with this :
$ ('#s ').click ( function ( event ) { event.preventDefault ( ) ; $ ( ' <ul / >') .appendTo( '#results ' ) ; var url = $.getJSON ( ' http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?'+
' q=select%20abstract%2Cclickurl%2Cdispurl%2Ctitle%20 '+ ' from%20search.web%20where%20query %3D%22 '+ $ ( ' # search ' ) .val ( ) + '% 22&format=json& '+ ' callback= ? ' , function ( data ) { $.each(data.query.results.result , function ( i, item ) { $ ( ' < li >< h3 > < a href= " '+item.clickurl +' " >'+ item.title +' ( ' +item.dispurl + ' )</a></h3><p>'+ ( item.abstract || ’) +'</p></li>'). appendTo ( " #results ul " ) ; } ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
This works … unless of course you are like me and prefer to send forms by hitting “ Enter ” rather than clicking the “ Submit ” button .
Unless I tab through the whole form and focus on the “ Submit ” button , I get nothing .
So , that ’s the first thing to fix .
If you create forms , never use a click handler on the button .
Instead , use the submit event of the form .
This catches both the clicking “ Submit ” and hitting “ Enter ” cases .
With one change , you now support all of the keyboard users out there , and the whole change is contained in the first line :
$ ('# f ' ) .submit( function ( event ) { event.preventDefault ( ) ; $ ( ' <ul / >') .appendTo( '#results ' ) ; var url = $.getJSON ( ' http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?'+
' q=select%20abstract%2Cclickurl%2Cdispurl%2Ctitle%20 '+ ' from%20search.web%20where%20query %3D%22 '+ $ ( ' # search ' ) .val ( ) + '% 22&format=json& '+ ' callback= ? ' , function ( data ) { $.each(data.query.results.result , function ( i, item ) { $ ( ' < li >< h3 > < a href= " '+item.clickurl +' " >'+ item.title +' ( ' +item.dispurl + ' )</a></h3><p>'+ ( item.abstract || ’) +'</p></li>'). appendTo ( " #results ul " ) ; } ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
We ’ve now covered the first case .
But without JavaScript , the form still does n’t do anything .
And another problem brings us to the next sin of writing JavaScript .
Sin # 5 : Making Maintenance Unnecessarily Hard
One thing that keeps great code off the Web is that our work environment , deadlines and hiring practices condition developers to build code for quick release , without considering how difficult maintaining that code will be later on .
I once called JavaScript the village bicycle of Web design ( slides here ) : anyone can go for a ride .
Because the code is available in the open , future maintainers will be able to mess around with it and extend it any way they like .
The sad thing is that the harder your code is to maintain , the more errors will be added to it , leading it to look more like alphabet soup than organized script .
Take the above example .
Those of you who have n’t worked with YQL and JSON - P for cross - domain AJAX undoubtedly had a “ What ? ” moment looking at the code .
Furthermore , keeping a lot of HTML in JavaScript easy to follow is hard , and guess what is the first thing to change when a new design for the page comes along ?
Exactly : the HTML and CSS .
So , to make it easier to maintain , I for one would shift all of the work to the back end , thus making the form work without JavaScript and keeping maintenance of all the HTML in the same document :
<? php if ( isset ( $ _GET [ ' search ' ] ) ) {
$ search = filter_input ( INPUT_GET , ' search ' , FILTER_SANITIZE_ENCODED ) ; $ data = getdata ( $ search ) ; if ( $ data -> query -> results ) { $ out = ' < ul > ' ; foreach ( $ data - > query - > results - > result as $ r ) { $ out .= " < li > < h3 > < a href= " {$r -> clickurl} " >{$r -> title} < span >( {$r-> dispurl} ) </ span > </ a> </h3 > < p>{$r->abstract}</p> </li > " ; } $ out .= '< /ul > ' ; } else { $ out = ' < h3 > Error : could not find any results </h3 >' ; } } if ($_SERVER [ ' HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH ' ] !=’ ) { echo $ out ; die ( ) ; } ? >
<!
DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD
HTML 4.01//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd " > < html > < head > < meta http-equiv= " Content - Type " content = " text / html ; charset=UTF - 8 " > < title > Ajax Search with PHP API </ title > < link rel=" stylesheet " href=" styles.css " type =" text/css " > </head > < body > < form action= " independent.php " id= " f " > < div > < label for = " search " > Search < / label > < input type =" text " value = " kittens " name = " search " id =" search " > < input type =" submit " id= " s " value = " Go " > </div > </ form > < div id =" results " ><?
php if ( $out !=’) {echo $ out ;} ?></div > < script src=" jquery.js " ></ script > < script src=" ajaxform.js " ></ script > </ body > </html > <? php function getdata( $ search ) { $url = ' http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?'.
' q=select%20abstract%2Cclickurl%2Cdispurl%2Ctitle%20 '.
' from%20search.web%20where%20query %3D%22 '.$ search .'% 22 '. '& format=json ' ; $ ch = curl_init ( ) ; curl_setopt( $ch , CURLOPT_URL , $url ) ; curl_setopt ( $ch , CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER , 1 ) ; $ output = curl_exec ( $ch ) ; curl_close ( $ch ) ; $ data = json_decode ( $ output ) ; return $ data ; } ?>
Someone who does n’t understand PHP at all should still be able to change the HTML display without breaking the code .
With this in place , the JavaScript boils down to a very simple script :
$ ('# f ' ) .submit( function ( event ) { event.preventDefault( ) ; $.get (' independent.php?search= ' + $ ( ' # search ' ) .val ( ) , function ( data ) { $ ( ' # results ' ) .html(data ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
The normal way to make code more maintainable is to move everything that is likely to change away from the main functional part of the script into a configuration object at the very top of the script .
You can return this as an object to the outside world to allow people to set it before they initialize the main functionality .
So , one change we can make to our earlier example — albeit a small one now , but that can change quickly when more requirements come in — is to have a configuration section right up front that defines the CSS classes in use :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) {
/*
Configuration object - change classes , IDs and string here */ var config = { /* CSS classes that get applied dynamically */ javascriptenabled : 'js ' , currentsection : ' current ' } /* functionality starts here */ $ ( ' body ' ) .addClass(config.javascriptenabled ) ; var current = null ; $ ( 'h2 ' ).click ( function(e ) { if ( current ) { current.removeClass(config.currentsection ) ; } current = $ ( this ) .next ( ).addClass(config.currentsection ) ; } ) } ) ;
For more information on configuration objects and why they rock for maintenance , check out the blog post “ Providing Script Configuration Inline and Programatically ” .
In summary , go over your code once more when you think you ’ve finished with it and the next person is about to take it over .
Sin # 6 : Not Documenting Your Code
“ Good code documents itself ” is a terribly common and misguided belief .
In my years as a developer , I ’ve found that my style of coding has changed constantly .
What was common knowledge and best practice in 2004 might be forgotten or even considered poor style these days .
Documenting all of the tricks and workarounds we do to make our code work in different browsers is definitely a good idea .
This allows future maintainers to remove them when the targeted browser version becomes obsolete or a library function fixes the issue .
Commenting your code also allows the maintainer to trace it back to you should they need some piece of information , and it allows people who have stumbled across your script to include it in a larger solution or library ( which has happened to me ) .
Because JavaScripts tend replicate on the Web ( in all of those blogs and “ script collections ” ) , it is also a way to make your name known .
Do n’t go overboard with commenting , though .
Obvious things do n’t need to be spelled out .
I have found the following situations worthy of comment :
Necessary hacks .
Browser hacks ; content clean - up ; things that should be supported server - side but are not yet .
.

Sections with dependencies .
Some comment like , “ Needs the Google API with an own key — this one will not work on your server . ”
In short , comment on anything that deviates from the normal flow of coding .
I tend to use /* */ instead of // because it wo n’t create a bug if people remove the line break by accident .
One special case is commenting out sections that will be necessary in future releases or that depend on functionality not currently available .
This can be amazingly useful but also a security risk , depending on what you ’re commenting out .
For example , do n’t leave in any code that points to server - side APIs that are not available yet but could at any time be half - implemented .
I ’ve seen this before , where administrator links with the full unprotected path were commented out in the HTML .
Still , commenting out can be very useful for debugging .
One neat trick is the following :
/* myFunction ( ' do something ' ) ; // */
This is now commented out .
But by adding a single slash in front of the first comment line , you will uncomment the whole block and make it live .
//* myFunction ( ' do something ' ) ; // */
This trick makes it awfully easy to toggle whole blocks .
Sin # 7 : Optimizing For Machines , Not People
The last sin is over - optimizing JavaScript based on the scads of information about performance that are available to us .
You will find a lot of information on the Web about optimizing JavaScript for performance in the current browser environment .
Notice that “ current browser environment ” — much information is browser - and version - specific and a necessary evil for now , but not necessarily in future .
If your application is large or your website is high traffic , knowing and applying this information could make or break it .
Again , though , a lot of this applies to edge cases that would have little impact on small projects and environments .
This optimization does make it harder to maintain the code ; some of the things we need to do to make browsers run fast on high - scale websites , such as writing out script nodes with document .
write ( ) , are downright nasty .
When faced with the choice between making code cleaner and easier to amend , extend and understand on the one hand , and shaving two milliseconds off every page load on the other , I opt for the former .
A lot of JavaScript optimization can be done through scripts .
And rather than teach all developers on a project the ins and outs of JavaScript performance , an expert team ( or even a tool ) could optimize the code before it goes live .
If you can do anything with machines to make the jobs of other machines easier , do it .
The time has come for us to apply build processes as much to front - end code as we do to back - end code , instead of forcing ourselves to follow coding practices that go against the natural flow of writing code .

I hope you ’ve gotten an idea now of how to make scripts more useful , easier to extend and safer to use .

Sweeping aside a century - old understanding and overruling two important precedents , a bitterly divided Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the government may not ban political spending by corporations in candidate elections .
With its ruling today , the Supreme Court has given a green light to a new stampede of special interest money in our politics .
It is a major victory for big oil , Wall Street banks , health insurance companies and the other powerful interests that marshal their power every day in Washington to drown out the voices of everyday Americans .
This ruling gives the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washington - while undermining the influence of average Americans who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates .
That 's why I am instructing my Administration to get to work immediately with Congress on this issue .
We are going to talk with bipartisan Congressional leaders to develop a forceful response to this decision .
The public interest requires nothing less .
Presented with a relatively narrow legal issue , the Supreme Court chose to roll back laws that have limited the role of corporate money in federal elections since Teddy Roosevelt was president .
Ignoring important principles of judicial restraint and respect for precedent , the Court has given corporate money a breathtaking new role in federal campaigns .
Just six years ago , the Court said that the prohibition on corporations and unions dipping into their treasuries to influence campaigns was ‘ firmly embedded in our law . ’
Yet this Court has just upended that prohibition , and a century 's worth of campaign finance law designed to stem corruption in government .
The American people will pay dearly for this decision when , more than ever , their voices are drowned out by corporate spending in our federal elections .
In the coming weeks , I will work with my colleagues to pass legislation restoring as many of the critical restraints on corporate control of our elections as possible
That one paragraph pretty much says it all , right there .
Five people - Antonin Scalia , John Roberts , Clarence Thomas , Samuel Alito , and Anthony Kennedy - have decided ( PDF ) that corporations should be able to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence the outcome of elections .
Corporations still cannot contribute directly to candidates , but there are no longer any limits on independent expenditures .
Consider , for a moment , what that means .
Campaign finance , law as we know it , has just been destroyed .
It 's meaningless .
This ruling was not unexpected .
Nor was its dissent , led by Justice John Paul Stevens , who blasted the majority 's decision , along with his colleagues Sonia Sotomayor , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , and Stephen Breyer .
The White House was quick to respond .
In a statement to the media , emailed to NPI , President Barack Obama declared : Thank you , Mr. President .
A Supreme Court decision this awful and this mistaken certainly deserves a forceful , immediate , and sweeping response .
Here 's Senator Russ Feingold : Senator Feingold is correct .
This must not stand .
Whether by new federal statute or constitutional amendment , President Obama and Congress must move speedily to reverse this terrible decision .
Five conservative white guys have just made it legal for corporations to buy elections .
I 'll repeat that :
Five conservative white guys have just made it legal for corporations to buy elections .
To say this is an outrageous attack on democracy would be a great understatement .
A nation of corporations is not what our Founding Fathers envisioned for America .
Perhaps the next step is just to get rid of voting .
Instead , we can have big corporations bid on which candidates they dislike the most .
The candidate who is least disliked by the corporations takes office .
Such an auction would be a cheaper and more expedient way of deciding who leads us in the new order that our conservative Supreme Court evidently wants to create .
The New York Times has published a must - read editorial slamming the decision , declaring the conservative majority to be " deeply wrong on the law . "
We could n't agree more .
We 've also been posting additional reaction from public interest groups and legislators , as well as quotes from Justice Stevens ' dissent , over at In Brief under the tag " Corporations United Fallout " .

AP contributed to this report
The British Foreign Office on Wednesday evening “ invited ” IsraeliAmbassador Ron Prosor to a meeting Thursday to discuss suspicions that British passports were used in the assassination of Hamas militarycommander Mahmoud al - Mabhouh last month in Dubai .
But tounderline that the issue had not yet developed into a full - blowndiplomatic crisis with London , a spokesman at the British Embassy inTel Aviv stressed that Prosor had been “ invited , ” and not “ summoned , ” to the meeting with Permanent Undersecretary and head of the DiplomaticService Peter Ricketts .
In diplomatic parlance , summoning anambassador implies a reprimand , while inviting an envoy in for adiscussion signals looking for clarifications .
Israelidiplomatic officials said it was necessary to wait until after themeeting with Prosor to determine whether this issue was going to blowup into a major source of tension with London .
In the best - casescenario , the official said , the British may simply be calling Prosorin because of an apparent demand by the British public – at least asreflected in the British media – for some action .
In the worst - casescenario , he speculated , the British may threaten to cut offintelligence cooperation with Israel unless the Mossad gives them alist of other British nationals whose passports may have been usurped .
Dubaipolice this week released names , photos and passport numbers of 11 members of an alleged hit squad that killed Mabhouh in his luxury Dubaihotel room last month .
Dubai said all 11 carried European passports .
But most of the identities appeared to be stolen , and a number matchedup with real people in Israel who have claimed they were victims ofidentity theft .
Only the British passports , however , were believed tohave involved stolen identities .
The foreign nationals included six Britons , three Irishmen , a German and a Frenchman .
Late last night Israel ’s ambassador to Ireland , Zion Evrony , was called in to the Irish Foreign Ministry in Dublin .
BritishPrime Minister Gordon Brown said on Wednesday that he was taking themisuse of British passports in the assassination very seriously andthat he had ordered a full investigation in the matter .
“ We havegot to carry out a full investigation into this .
The British passportis an important document that has got to be held with care , ” said theprime minister .
“ The evidence has got to be assembled about what hasactually happened and how it happened and why it happened , and it isnecessary for us to conclude that before we can make statements .
” “ Thedefrauding of British passports is a very serious issue , ” a Britishgovernment spokesman added on Wednesday .
“ The government will continueto take all the action that is necessary to protect British nationalsfrom identity fraud .
The government is involved in a number of strandsof ongoing activity in relation to this specific case .
” The British government said on Wednesday that its embassy in Tel Aviv wouldbe contacting those affected by the incident and would offer them thesupport they needed in obtaining new passports .
The governmentalso announced that the Serious Organized Crime Agency ( SOCA ) wouldlead the investigation into the fraudulent use of British passports inclose cooperation with the Emirati authorities .
“ We received arequest from the Dubai authorities for assistance with theirinvestigation in relation to the fraudulent use of UK passports , ” aSOCA spokesperson said .
“ We can also confirm that we have received an ‘ Interpol diffusion ’ ( red notice ) in relation to this investigation .
” SOCA said the photographs and signatures in the passports were false .
“ Wecan confirm that the photographs and signatures on the passports usedin Dubai do not match those of the passports issued by the UK , ” aBritish government spokesperson said .
Meanwhile , ForeignMinister Avigdor Lieberman said Wednesday there was no reason to assumethe Mossad was behind the operation simply because Dubai had releasedthe information about the passports .
“ I do n’t know why we areassuming that Israel , or the Mossad , used those passports , ” Liebermantold Army Radio in Israel ’s first official comments on the affair .
ButLieberman did not deny involvement outright , saying Israel rightlymaintained a policy of ambiguity where security operations wereconcerned .
“ Israel never responds , never confirms and never denies , ” he said .
“ There is no reason for Israel to change this policy .
” Onediplomatic official said that Dubai could selectively be releasinginformation to frame Israel , and that conclusions should not be drawnfrom “ journalistic speculation .
” The Prime Minister ’s Officedeclined to discuss the matter on Wednesday evening , just as PrimeMinister Binyamin Netanyahu himself did when asked about the issue onTuesday in Moscow .
Mabhouh was one of the founders of Hamas and the point man in smuggling Iranian rockets into Gaza .
Choosing a web host is never easy .
There are just so many unknowns when it comes to finding a host .
It 's hardly ever possible to walk into a web host 's office , look around , meet the owners , and get a feel for whether or not you 'd like to do business with these people .
It 's important , though , that you bend over backwards to establish whether your prospective web host is a credible provider – or a fly by night artist .
The webmaster industry is awash with horror stories about signing up with a web hosting company , onlty to find out later that this ‘ business ' is run by a 14 year old who lives at home .
you can make your decision using whatever information you find online about the web host .
Start out with the website of the web host you are considering .
Is it professionally designed and written ?
Typo's and spelling errors may signal that this is a company ran by kids or amateurs .
Is the website easy to use ?
Is it designed with a view towards helping people ?
Are help materials available online ?
This should give you a flavor for whether the company is client oriented .
Where is the company located ?
Is there an address ?
Can you email them ?
Look at the Terms of Service .
Does your prospective web host clearly spell out what may be expected of them and what is expected of you ?
Every deal is different , but both parties should clearly know what the deal is .
Next , do a search for the company on Google .
Are you finding any negative statements ?
Try different searching techniques , like typing the company name followed by the word “ scam ” , or by the words “ poor support ” .
Now , try emailing their customer support department .
Do you get a fast reply ?
What about their sales department ?
Do they answer inquiries quickly ?
Let 's face it …if they wo n't pay any attention to you when they 're trying to get your business , how much more will you be neglected after you sign up ?
If you follow these simple suggestions , your chances of signing up with an excellent web host increase substantially
Visit one of the many forums about web hosting , ask the members for advice or search threads from those that have asked before you .
Once you ’ve located a few hosts to research , the ten questions below will take you a long way towards making an informed decision .
You may be able to find many of the answers to these questions on the hosts ’ web sites , but always feel free to call the host and quiz them about their operations .
The quality of the answers and degree of professionalism you get from a potential host often transfers to the type of support you ’ll receive once you become a customer .
Without further ado , the ten question to ask your web host : 1 . How long has the web host been in business ?
2 . Does the web host own its data center ?
3 . How many upstream Internet providers does the web host have ?
4 . Does the web host monitor its customers ’ sites twenty - four hours per day ?
How ?
5 . Does the web host provide 24/7/365 phone and email support ?
6 . What levels of redundancy does the web host ’s architecture provide ?
7 . Does the web host automatically backup customer web sites in case of data loss ?
How often ?
8 . What is the web host ’s billing policy ?
9 . Does the web host provide the features that you need for your web site ?
10 .
Does the web host have the products and services to handle your growth ?
National Academy of Sciences Panel Agrees With EPA Analysis of the Risks of PERC
PERC really is a " likely human carcinogen , " the National Academy of Sciences says .
PERC is a chemical known as perchloroethylene or tetrachloroethylene .
It 's the solvent used by about 85 % of U.S. dry cleaners , but is also used as a metal degreaser and in the production of many other chemicals .
PERC is found in the air , in drinking water , and in soil .
It can be detected in most people 's blood , as well as in breast milk .
What 's the risk ?
In 2008 , the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) suggested that PERC be classified as a " likely human carcinogen . "
Moreover , the EPA found that PERC 's most dangerous noncancer toxicity is brain and nervous system damage -- and set safe exposure levels well below levels that cause such damage .
But rather than finalize the ruling , the EPA asked the prestigious National Academy of Sciences to review it 's PERC risk analysis and to tell the EPA if it 's system for analyzing chemical risk was correct .
Now the expert panel appointed by the National Academy of Sciences says the EPA was basically correct .
The panel agreed that :
PERC is a " likely human carcinogen . "
This means that while there 's no definitive proof that the chemical causes cancer in humans , there 's strong evidence it does -- and there 's proof that the chemical causes various cancers in animals .
PERC 's most dangerous noncancer effect is nerve and brain damage .
Safe exposure levels for drinking water and air quality should be set well above levels that can cause such damage .
The EPA 's system for evaluating chemical risk is basically sound , although procedures for evaluating the strength of relevant studies need to be strengthened .
" We praised the EPA for doing a very thorough job , " panel member Ivan Rusyn , MD , PhD , a toxicologist at the University of North Carolina , tells WebMD .
" The overwhelming opinion of the committee was that the EPA was correct . "
The major complaint the committee had with the EPA was that it put too much emphasis on a single study in setting the safe concentration level .
That level is calculated by finding the highest dose that does no harm and dividing that dose by 1,000 or more to err on the side of safety .
The EPA suggested that a safe PERC concentration would be 2 parts per billion .
The National Academy of Sciences committee used several different studies to calculate a slightly higher safe level , between 6 and 50 parts per billion .

The cynical view of warnings about a mounting Chinese threat is that they are largely Pentagon budget - building ploys : if the U.S. military is “ only ” going to fight insurgents and terrorists in the future , it does n’t really need the next generation of expensive fighter planes or attack submarines .
Powerful evidence for this view — apart from familiarity with Pentagon budget debates over the years — is that many of the neoconservative thinkers who since 9/11 have concentrated on threats from Iraq , Afghanistan , and Iran were before that time writing worriedly about China .
The most powerful counterargument is that China ’s rise is so consequential and unprecedented in scale that it would be naive not to expect military ramifications .
My instincts lie with the skeptical camp : as I ’ve often written through the past three years , China has many more problems than most Americans can imagine , and its power is much less impressive up close .
But on my return to America , I asked a variety of military , governmental , business , and academic officials about how the situation looks from their perspective .
In most ways , their judgment was reassuringly soothing ; unfortunately , it left me with a new problem to worry about .
Without meaning to sound flip , I think the strictly military aspects of U.S. - China relations appear to be something Americans can rest easy about for a long time to come .
Hypercautious warnings to the contrary keep cropping up , especially in the annual reports on China ’s strategic power produced since 2000 by the Pentagon each spring and by the U.S. - China Economic and Security Review Commission each fall .
Yet when examined in detail , even these show the limits of the Chinese threat .
To summarize :
• In overall spending , the United States puts between five and 10 times as much money into the military per year as China does , depending on different estimates of China ’s budget .
Spending does not equal effectiveness , but it suggests the difference in scale .
• In sophistication of equipment , Chinese forces are only now beginning to be brought up to speed .
For instance , just one - quarter of its naval surface fleet is considered “ modern ” in electronics , engines , and weaponry .
• In certain categories of weaponry , the Chinese do n’t even compete .
For instance , the U.S. Navy has 11 nuclear - powered aircraft - carrier battle groups .
The Chinese navy is only now moving toward construction of its very first carrier .
• In the unglamorous but crucial components of military effectiveness — logistics , training , readiness , evolving doctrine — the difference between Chinese and American standards is not a gap but a chasm .
After a natural disaster anywhere in the world , the American military ’s vast airlift and sealift capacity often brings rescue supplies .
The Chinese military took days to reach survivors after the devastating Sichuan earthquake in May of 2008 , because it has so few helicopters and emergency vehicles .
Where do you stand on the Hussain - Inglis spectrum ?
The former is Munir Hussain , the householder who chased a burglar down the street and then beat him unconscious with a cricket bat – and who was released from jail this week after his sentence was reduced by the Court of Appeal .
The latter is Frances Inglis who was , on the same day , sentenced to serve a minimum of nine years behind bars for the " mercy - killing " of her teenage son who had been in a kind of coma for three years .
There is something iconic about these two cases , but something political too .
For they play upon two very different sets of prejudices and perceived rights .
On the one side is the right of the householder to protect his property .
Here the protagonist was chairman of the Asian Business Council and his victim a career criminal with more than 100 previous convictions .
But after breaking into the Hussains ' home , and threatening to murder its occupants with a knife , the burglar , Walid Salem , was pursued down the street by Mr Hussain and his brother and hit so hard that he suffered a fractured skull , ribs , jaw , and finger and brain damage .
He was so badly injured that he was deemed unfit to stand trial .
Though an Englishman 's home may be his castle he does n't have the right to pour boiling oil on those violating it .
Violence by the homeowner has to be proportionate and reasonable , and the court decided that this was n't .
To add further spice to the mix Walid Salem , whose lawyers claimed he was unfit to plead , was then alleged to have subsequently committed other offences .
There was much rejoicing in certain quarters this week when Mr Hussain 's 30 - month jail term was reduced to a suspended sentence and he was freed .
By contrast the other citizen convicted of taking the law into her own hands this week is now beginning a minimum stay behind bars of nine years .
Frances Inglis gave a lethal heroin injection to her 22 - year - old son Tom , who was so brain - damaged that he was unable to speak .
He could communicate only by blinking and had to be fed through a tube into his stomach .
Mrs Inglis , who was a community support worker for adults with learning difficulties before starting nursing training , was described by an Old Bailey judge as a " devoted mother highly regarded for [ her ] work in the community " .
But , he added : " You knew you were breaking the law , and you knew the consequences . "
Justice is political as well as principled .
That much was clear from the extensive support voiced for these two representatives of the middle classes when they appeared in the dock .
There was more support for Mr Hussain from the right of the political spectrum .
And there was more indignation about the length of Mrs Inglis 's sentence from the liberal - left .
But the faultlines are more interesting than the usual polarities .
It would be a mistake to expect the debate to be governed by logic , of course .
Those of a right - wing disposition clearly place different value on the life of the householder and that of the burglar , much as in other debates they see the " sanctity of life " as absolute for unborn children but less so for convicted murderers .
Other determinants of moral worth evidently come into play .
The implicit assumption is that a burglar , by breaking the law , forfeits his right to be protected by it .
There is a dangerous double standard in that .
Then , on the other side , no proper rationale is advanced by the pro-euthanasia camp as to why one individual 's " right to die with dignity " ought to supersede the right to life of a sick person whose relatives are simply tired of caring for them , or who see profit in their death .
There is just the utilitarian assumption that there will be more of the former than the latter , which is a very poor justification for ignoring the rights of a minority .
The real decisions in such matters are about how we balance the rights of one individual with those of others in society , particularly its more vulnerable members .
It is a debate about achieving an equilibrium between personal freedom and the common good .
Part of the point of law is that it seeks to protect us all from the judgement of self - righteous individuals , or indeed political pressure groups .
That is why it says it cannot be for the householder to decide what constitutes " reasonable force " in defending their home – and a jury decided that breaking a cricket bat in three pieces over someone 's head was not reasonable .
And it is why it insists that no parent , however loving , has the complete say over the right of their child to life .
Frances Inglis decided that her son would not want to live the life he was leading .
She said at her son's hospital bedside " all I saw was horror , pain and tragedy " .
But society is open to balance that against other judgements , like that of one of the doctors at her son 's hospital who offered a more encouraging prognosis .
" How can they know how he feels , " she wrote .
The court decided that the same question could be asked of the trainee nurse .
It was far from a clear - cut case of consensual assisted dying .
All this also goes to the question of what punishment is for .
Punishing anyone is wrong , unless they are likely to learn from the experience , one commentator opined yesterday .
That might be so were the only point of prison preventing the criminal from repeating their crime .
The chances of Frances Inglis " doing it again " are next to zero .
And Munir Hussain is hardly a danger to society , apart perhaps from those small sections of it who chose to break into his home .
But prison sentences serve another function ; they act as a deterrent to others who might be contemplating a similar crime .
The business of contemplation is an important determinant .
In both the Hussain and Inglis cases those in the dock had demonstrated a loss of control .
The Asian businessman 's attack on his assailant was wild and frenetic .
And Mrs Inglis was , a friend testified " mad and so upset – she could n't be consoled " ; after she had injected her son with the fatal dose , she barricaded herself in his hospital room and shouted to staff that she had HIV , threatening them .
But Mr Hussain was found by the Court of Appeal , even in the street after the burglary , to be " acting under the continuing influence of extreme provocation " .
By contrast Mrs Inglis had clearly premeditated the killing of her son , carefully planning it even while she was on bail for a previous attempt at injecting him with a fatal overdose .
She acknowledged this , but tried to side - step it by saying : " The definition of murder is to take someone 's life with malice in your heart .
I did it with love in my heart , for Tom , so I do n't see it as murder . "
It is not a distinction the law recognises , and nor necessarily should it .
The key point it that its not for individuals to make such judgements .
It is for society to do that , a function we delegate to a jury and a judge .
There were cries of " shame on you " at the jury in the Inglis case when they delivered their verdicts .
They came from weeping members of the dead boy 's family , watching from the public gallery .
Such a reaction is understandable but wrong .
The jury had , as the judge instructed , " put all emotion aside " and that was right .
Victims are not always best qualified to judge when justice has been done .
Though it is today fashionable to talk about the voice of the victim being heard in court , that process must have limits .
Distancing victims from the judicial process is what distinguishes a revenge culture from the civilised rule of law .
It was revealing that Michael Wolkind QC , who defended Munir Hussain , yesterday said that he does not agree with Conservative party proposals to give added rights to householders to defend themselves .
" The test at the moment is that the defendant behaved reasonably , " he stated , " and that should be good enough . "
Significantly the Court of Appeal did not overturn the verdict against Mr Hussain , Rather it determined , in the words of the Lord Chief Justice , Lord Judge , that the case was " truly exceptional " and adjudged that the original sentence passed upon him had been disproportionately severe .
Appeal judges may come to a similar conclusion in the case of Frances Inglis .
The judge in her case mitigated her sentence , on compassionate grounds , down from the 15 years which is the starting point for sentencing in a life sentence , to nine years .
Perhaps the Court of Appeal will decide he could have gone further , and reduce her sentence to three or four years .
They always say in most businesses that the client is always right .
However , what several clients do not often think about is the flip side of that .
Remember , you are hiring a skilled professional to provide you with a service that you need as well as do not actually know too much about yourself …
So because of this , you need to treat them with the same respect as they do the customer …
This goes double for heating as well as a /c equipment specialists .
There are folks who will treat heating as well as a / c equipment specialists sort of like slaves or some person in a jail .
This is not human as well as is not right !
And honestly , if you have an independent heating as well as a / c equipment specialist that you treat in such a way , do not be alarmed if they tell you off as well as refuse to complete whatever Heating plus A/C equipment service you called them for .
They are not anything like a company where they must take verbal beatings from clients or lose their jobs .
They have complete control as independent heating as well as a / c equipment specialists with who to deal with as well as who not to .
The independent heating as well as a / c equipment specialists also have the opportunity to deal with rude clients as they wish .
So if you are regularly abusing Heating plus A/C equipment workers , beware !
You may just get put in your place one of these days by an independent heating as well as a / c equipment worker as well as get blacklisted from their Heating plus A/C equipment services .
They are people too , as well as while a lot of clients do treat them with nothing but respect , there are some people that do not .
Remember , they are doing you a service , not the other way around .
So make sure to be kind to the Heating plus A/C equipment workers .

The following interview with Dr. David Graham ( senior drug safety researcher at the FDA ) was conducted by Manette Loudon , the lead investigator for Dr. Gary Null .
This interview contains jaw - dropping insights about the corruption and crimes that take place every day inside the Food and Drug Administration .
This is no outside critic , either : these are the words from a top FDA employee who has worked at the agency for two decades .
If you 've ever wondered how the drug industry could pull off the greatest con of our time -- and turn the human body into a profit - generating machine -- you 're about to learn the shocking answers in this interview .
This interview is reprinted here with permission from Dr. Gary Null .
Parts of this interview also appear in Dr. Gary Null 's Prescription For Disaster video documentary , which is available at the Gary Null website and is a must - see video for anyone who wants to know the truth about the pharmaceutical industry and the FDA .
MANETTE : Dr. Graham , it 's truly a pleasure to have the opportunity to interview you .
Let me begin by asking you how long you 've been with the FDA and what your current position is ?
DR . GRAHAM : I 've been with the FDA for 20 years .
I 'm currently the Associate Director for Science and Medicine in the Office of Drug Safety .
That 's my official job .
But when I 'm here today I 'm speaking in my private capacity on my own time , and I do not represent the FDA .
We can be pretty certain that the FDA would not agree with most of what I have to say .
So with those disclaimers you know everything is okay .
MANETTE : On November 23 , 2004 PBS Online News Hour Program you were quoted as making the following statement .
 I would argue that the FDA as currently configured is incapable of protecting America against another Vioxx .
Simply put , FDA and the Center for Drug Evaluation Research ( CDER ) are broken . 
Since you 've made that statement , has anything changed within the FDA to fix what 's broken and , if not , how serious is the problem that we 're dealing with here ?
DR .
GRAHAM : Since November , when I appeared before the Senate Finance Committee and announced to the world that the FDA was incapable of protecting America from unsafe drugs or from another Vioxx , very little has changed on the surface and substantively nothing has changed .
The structural problems that exist within the FDA , where the people who approve the drugs are also the ones who oversee the post marketing regulation of the drug , remain unchanged .
The people who approve a drug when they see that there is a safety problem with it are very reluctant to do anything about it because it will reflect badly on them .
They continue to let the damage occur .
America is just as at risk now , as it was in November , as it was two years ago , and as it was five years ago .
MANETTE :
In that same PBS program , you were also quoted saying ,  The organizational structure within the CDER is currently geared towards the review and approval of new drugs .
When a serious safety issue arises at post marketing , the immediate reaction is almost always one of denial , rejection and heat .
They approved the drugs , so there can't possibly be anything wrong with it .
This is an inherent conflict of interest .
Based on what you 're saying it appears that the FDA is responsible for protecting the interests of pharmaceutical companies and not the American people .
Do you believe the FDA can protect the public from dangerous drugs ?
DR .
GRAHAM : As currently configured , the FDA is not able to adequately protect the American public .
It 's more interested in protecting the interests of industry .
It views industry as its client , and the client is someone whose interest you represent .
Unfortunately , that is the way the FDA is currently structured .
Within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research about 80 percent of the resources are geared towards the approval of new drugs and 20 percent is for everything else .
Drug safety is about five percent .
The gorilla in the living room is new drugs and approval .
Congress has not only created that structure , they have also worsened that structure through the PDUFA , the Prescription Drug User Fee Act , by which drug companies pay money to the FDA so they will review and approve its drug .
So you have that conflict as well .
MANETTE : When did that go into effect ?
DR . GRAHAM : The Prescription Drug User Fee
Act came into play in 1992 .
It was passed by Congress as a way of providing the FDA with more funds so that it could hire more physicians and other scientists to review drug applications so that drugs would be approved more quickly .
For industry , every day a drug is held up from being marketed , represents a loss of one to two million dollars of profit .
The incentive is to review and approve the drugs as quickly as possible , and not stand in the way of profit - making .
The FDA cooperates with that mandate .
MANETTE : And what about those new drugs ?
Are they any better than what already exists on the market ?
DR .
GRAHAM : It 's a myth that is promulgated not only by industry but also by the FDA itself .
It 's a misperception that our lawmakers in Congress have as well and they 've been fed this line by industry .
Industry is saying there are all these lifesaving drugs that the FDA is slow to approve and people are dying in the streets because of it .
The fact is that probably about two - thirds to three - quarters of the drugs that the FDA reviews are already on the market and are being reviewed for another indication .
So , for example , if I 've got a drug that can treat bronchitis and now it 's going to be used to treat a urinary tract infection well , that 's a new indication .
But it 's the same drug and we already know about the safety of the drug .
There is nothing lifesaving there .
There is nothing new .
There is nothing innovative .
A very small proportion of drugs represent a new drug that has n't been marketed before .
Most of those drugs are no better than the ones that exist .
If you want to talk about breakthrough drugs  the ones that really make a difference in patients ' lives and represent a revolution in pharmacology  we 're talking about maybe one or two drugs a year .
Most of them are n't breakthroughs and most of them are n't lifesaving , but they get treated as if they were .
MANETTE :
Are you at liberty to discuss some of the problems your colleagues are finding with other drugs and if so , how widespread is the problem ?
DR . GRAHAM : I 'm really not at liberty to talk about things that pertain to my official duties at the FDA .
I can talk in my private capacity , but I can't talk about material that would be confidential .
What I can say is that there are a number of other scientists within the FDA who have also worked with drugs that they know are not safe , even though the FDA has approved or allowed them to remain on the market .
They face some of the same difficulties that I do .
The difference is that either the problem is n't as serious in terms of the numbers of people that were injured or that it 's a fatal reaction  they 're not willing to expose themselves to retaliation by the FDA - and retaliation would surely follow .
MANETTE :
Do you think we should have any confidence in the FDA and if so , can you elaborate on what they do that you feel benefits the American people ?
DR .
GRAHAM : In terms of confidence in what the FDA does , there are two things that the FDA determines when it looks at a drug : it determines whether or not a drug is safe and it determines whether or not it 's effective .
Regarding the determination of drug effectiveness , I think the FDA does a pretty good job .
If the FDA says that the drug will have a particular effect , probably for many of the patients who take the drug it will actually have that effect .
If the FDA says a given drug will lower blood pressure and you 're somebody who has high blood pressure , there 's a good chance that the drug will have an effect that lowers your blood pressure .
That has to do with the rigor with which they force the drug companies to establish that the drug actually has an effect .
On the safety side , I think that the American public can't be very confident .
They can have some confidence because it turns out that most drugs are remarkably safe .
But , when there are unsafe drugs , the FDA is very likely to err on the side of industry .
Rarely will they keep a drug from being marketed or pull a drug off the market .
A lot of this has to do with the standards that the FDA uses for safety .
When they look at efficacy , they assume that the drug does n't work and the company has to prove that the drug does work .
When they look at safety it 's entirely the opposite .
The FDA assumes the drug is safe and now it 's up to the company to prove that the drug is n't safe .
Well , that 's a no-brainer .
What company on earth is going to try to prove that the drug is n't safe ?
There 's no incentive for the companies to do things right .
The clinical trials that are done are too small , and as a result it 's very unusual to find a serious safety problem in these clinical trials .
Safety flaws are discovered after the drug gets on the market .
MANETTE : I read somewhere that a drug only has to be better than a sugar pill
DR . GRAHAM : Right .
The standard that the FDA uses to approve a drug is primarily does the drug work ? 
That 's what they call efficacy .
Most often , they 'll compare the drug against something called a placebo or a sugar pill .
It 's basically something that does n't have a medical effect .
The assumption is that the drug will be no different than the sugar pill .
The FDA puts the onus on the drug company to conduct a clinical trial to show that the drug is different from a sugar pill .
The way the FDA 's approval standards are , the drug does not necessarily have to have a very great effect in order to be approved .
The drug might lower your blood pressure by just a few millimeters of mercury , but the FDA will say we can approve it because it does lower your blood pressure .
Now , would that be a benefit or are there other drugs out there  many other drugs  that patients could take instead that would lower their blood pressure by 10 or 15 or 20 millimeters ?
The FDA does n't really care about that .
What happens is the drug gets marketed .
You 've got two drugs that are out there  one drug that effectively lowers your blood pressure a substantial degree and another drug that barely lowers your blood pressure at all .
The company that has that second drug markets it like it's this breakthrough medicine .
It lowers your blood pressure and they have all these glitzy ads , direct - to - consumer advertising .
Lots of patients and lots of doctors will use that medication .
What happens in the process is these patients are actually in a sense being denied a more effective treatment because the FDA does n't require that drugs that come on to market be at least equivalent to , or better than , the drugs that are already there .
All they have to do is be better than a sugar pill .
MANETTE :
When you consider the financial impact your whistle blowing has had on the pharmaceutical industry do you have any fears that your life may be in jeopardy ?
DR . GRAHAM : I have tried not to think about that .
In the work that I 've done I 've never really thought about what the financial impact would be on any particular company .
I put that out of my mind because my primary concern is whether or not the drug is safe .
If it 's not safe , how unsafe is it and how many people are being hurt by it ?
In terms of when I identify an unsafe drug , to me it does n't really matter what drug company it is .
I 've helped to get ten different drugs off the market , and they 're from ten different drug companies .
It 's not a vendetta against any particular drug company .
I have to hope that the drug companies do n't take it personally .
I 'm just a scientist doing my job and I have to leave the rest to God to protect me .
MANETTE : Has anyone tried to silence you and stop you from becoming a whistleblower ?
DR .
GRAHAM : Prior to my Senate testimony in mid-November of 2004 , there was an orchestrated campaign by senior level FDA managers to intimidate me so that I would not testify before Congress .
This intimidation took several forms .
One attack came from our acting Center Director who contacted the editor of the Lancet , the prestigious medical journal in the United Kingdom , and intimated to the editor that I had committed scientific misconduct and that they should n't publish a paper that I had written showing that Vioxx increases the risks of heart attack .
This high - level FDA official never talked to me about this allegation .
He just went directly to the Lancet .
The second attack was from other high level FDA officials who contacted Senator Grassley 's office and attempted to prevent Senator Grassley and his staff from supporting me and calling me as a witness .
They knew that if they could disarm Senator Grassley that would neutralize me .
The third attack came from senior FDA officials who contacted Tom Devine , my attorney at the Government Accountability Project , and attempted to convince him that he should not represent me because I was guilty of scientific misconduct ; I was a bully ; a demigod ; and a terrible person that could n't be trusted .
These people were posing as whistleblowers themselves ratting on another whistleblower .
Some of these senior level FDA officials were in my supervisory chain and are people I work for .
They were involved in a coordinated attempt to discredit me and to smear my name and to prevent me from giving testimony .
There 's one other thing that happened the week before I testified .
The Acting Commissioner of the FDA invited me to his office and offered me a job in the Commissioner 's Office to oversee the revitalization of drug safety for the FDA if I would just leave the Office of Drug Safety and come to the Commissioner 's Office .
Obviously he had been tipped off by people in the Senate Finance Committee who are sympathetic to the FDA 's status quo that I was going to be called as a witness .
To preempt that , he offers me this job , which basically would have been exile to a fancy title with no real ability to have an impact .
This was a conspiracy and it was coordinated and there was collaboration among senior level FDA officials .
What a mess !
MANETTE : All of these attacks backfired on them .
Tell us a little bit about that .
DR .
GRAHAM : Well , Senator Grassley and his staff quickly realized that what they were saying about me was fabricated .
The editor of The Lancet also realized that what the high level FDA officials were saying to him was a pack of lies .
He sent emails to them saying it looked to him as if they were trying to interfere with his editorial process .
He was very savvy to what these people were doing .
Tom Devine , as he said publicly , was very interested in doing the right thing .
He said ,  We do n't want to protect somebody who 's a lawbreaker and who really is n't representing the truth so produce your evidence .
They had no evidence because there is no evidence .
But I produced my evidence .
I showed him all the documentation , all the emails , and the reports that I 've written .
They flunked every test and I passed every test .
In all of the criticism I have received relating to Vioxx and drug safety , they 've never attacked the work or the science that I 've done or the results that I 've come to .
What they 've done is call me names .
The ad hominem attack is the last refuge of the indefensible .
They do n't have an argument that 's substantial .
They know that they 're vulnerable .
They know that they 've disserved the American people .
The FDA is responsible for 140,000 heart attacks and 60,000 dead Americans .
That 's as many people as were killed in the Vietnam War .
Yet the FDA points the finger at me and says ,  Well , this guy 's a rat , you can't trust him ,  but nobody is calling them to account .
Congress is n't calling them to account .
For the American people , it 's dropped off the radar screen .
They should be screaming because this can happen again .
MANETTE : On CNN with Lou Dobbs you said that there was a certain culture that exists at the FDA .
Can you explain what you meant by that ?
DR . GRAHAM : The FDA has a very peculiar culture .
It runs like the army so it 's very hierarchal .
You have to go through the chain of command and if somebody up above you says that they want things done in a particular way well , they want it done in a particular way .
The culture also views industry as the client .
They 're serving industry rather than the public .
In fact , when a former office director for the Office of Drug Safety criticized me and tried to get me to change a report I 'd written on another drug 
Arava  he said to me and to a colleague who was a coauthor on this report that industry is our client . 
I begged to differ with him .
I said ,  No , industry is not the client , it 's the American people , the people who pay our taxes .
That 's who we 're here to serve . 
He said ,  No !
Industry is our client .
I ended the conversation by saying ,  Well , industry may be your client , but it will never be my client . 
Another aspect to the culture at the FDA is that it overvalues the benefits of drugs and undervalues the risks of drugs .
And so the FDA will always say to you ,  Well , we 're leaving this drug on the market because the benefits exceed the risks . 
Well , the FDA has never assessed the benefit of any drug that it 's ever approved .
It works on what 's called efficacy .
Does the drug work or not ?
Does it lower your blood pressure or does it lower your blood sugar ?
Not : Does it prolong your life ?
Does it prevent you from having a heart attack ?
Those are benefits .
All they focus on is efficacy .
For example , ask the FDA why on earth they did n't ban high dose Vioxx after the VIGOR Study showed in early 2000 that it increased the risk of heart attack by 500 percent ?
High dose Vioxx was approved for the short - term treatment of acute pain .
What earthly benefit was there that exceeds a 500 percent increase in heart attack risk ?
Ask the FDA to produce its benefit analysis that shows that the benefits exceed the risks .
It does n't exist .
The FDA has never looked at benefit .
The FDA just says to the American people ,  The benefits exceed the risks .
Trust me .
Believe me .
If you held the FDA to its proof the American people would see how badly served they 've been by the FDA and its culture that belittles safety in the drug companies ' interest .
If the FDA were to pull a drug due to safety issues , it would hurt the marketing of the drug .
It might also call into question why they approved the drug in the first place .
Therefore , you get this culture of cover - up , this culture of suppression , this culture of denial , and this culture that demonstrates above all else that industry is the client and not the American people .
MANETTE : Have your peers turned against you ?
DR . GRAHAM : No .
I 've been very fortunate .
Tom Devine at GAP has told me that the experience of a typical whistleblower is that they 'll have the support of their peers but the peers will be so afraid of retaliation that they wo n't express that support in public .
I 've had a very different experience .
I 've been basically embraced by my peers as someone who has said what they want to say and what they wished they had been able to say and that they recognize as the truth .
They 're really proud of the fact that I 've said it and they 're not afraid to be seen with me .
They 're not afraid to work with me .
I 've been pretty fortunate in that way .
Now with management it 's been another story .
Upper management avoids me and does n't talk to me .
I could be walking down the hall and I 'll say hello , and they 'll act like I 'm not there .
They do n't give me interesting work assignments .
They do n't call me in to consult on things that I should be consulted on even though I am the senior epidemiologist in the Office of Drug Safety with more experience than any of the other people there .
I 'm looked up to by the scientific staff because of that expertise .
Basically , I feel like I 'm in the Gulag .
MANETTE : How do you cope with that going to work each day ?
DR . GRAHAM : It 's difficult .
It 's a mind game .
They 're hoping that I 'll just become very frustrated and disillusioned and leave or that I 'll slip up in some way so that they can take some sort of action against me .
As Tom Devine at GAP has said , I have to be Saint David .
I can't afford to make any mistakes .
That 's very difficult and it is a little bit discouraging .
But I 've been a target of retaliation in the past .
You take ten drugs off the market well , no good deed goes unpunished at the FDA .
I 've experienced retaliation with many of those other episodes but not as severe as what I 've experienced with Vioxx .
This is the first time that my job was actually in jeopardy and where the FDA actually intended to fire me .
That was stopped only because Senator Grassley intervened .
He put the heat on the FDA and told them ,  Lay off .
This guy has told the truth .
He 's helped America .
Whose side are you on ?
MANETTE :
Were there any warnings that Vioxx was a problem ?
Did you see the disaster coming ?
DR . GRAHAM : I think that I was afraid that there would be a disaster , but I only became aware of this with the publication of the VIGOR Study , which was this large clinical trial that was done that showed that Vioxx increased the risk of heart attack five fold .
That study was published in November of 2000 .
It was written , performed , and paid for by industry .
What industry concluded was not that Vioxx increases the risks of heart attack , but that the drug they were comparing it against  Naproxen  decreased the risk of heart attack .
I knew that was not a sustainable argument .
There was no way that Naproxen was that protective against heart attacks .
Clearly Vioxx was the problem .
I knew that Vioxx was on the road to becoming a blockbuster drug ( 20 million users ) .
All the ingredients were there for a disaster .
The FDA is responsible in so far as it could have prevented much of the damage , heart attacks , and deaths simply by banning the high dose Vioxx back in mid 2000 when they knew the results of the VIGOR Study .
But the FDA did nothing for almost two years .
They were negotiating  with the company over a label .
What did the label accomplish ?
Nothing !
Before the label 17 or 18 percent of people who took Vioxx took the high dose .
After the label change 17 or 18 percent were still taking the high dose .
High dose use did n't change at all .
People did n't read the label , and if they read the label they would n't know what to do anyway because it was very confusing .
The right thing to do would have been to pull the high dose off the market because there is no benefit for short - term relief of acute pain that exceeds this risk .
The FDA made bad decisions based on its culture and its institutionalized biases that favor industry , and as a result thousands of Americans died .
Americans and Congress should be screaming bloody murder .
They should be beating on the doors of the FDA demanding change .
MANETTE :
It 's estimated that over 200,000 people a year die from prescription drugs .
Do you see this as a serious problem and do you think many of these treatments are more dangerous than the disease itself ?
DR .
GRAHAM : Death from adverse drug reactions is one of the leading causes of death in the United States .
It turns out that most of these adverse reactions are actually what are expected in the sense that they are an extension of the drug 's action .
For example , we know that drugs for diabetes can lower your blood sugar .
If you 're more sensitive to the drug than the normal person and it lowers your blood sugar too much , causing you to have a seizure while driving your car and you get killed , well , you died from an adverse drug reaction , but it was n't something unexpected .
The blood thinner Coumadin is another example .
That drug provides a benefit , but it is also responsible for probably more deaths than any single drug currently marketed .
But it has a recognized benefit and there are n't other drugs to do what it does or to do what it does well .
So physicians accept that there are patients who are in a serious situation and who might die without the drug , so they take it .
Yes , drugs cause a lot of harm .
Unfortunately , we have n't quantified the benefits .
For most of these drugs it 's more belief .
It 's faith .
We have faith that they 'll confer a benefit , but the FDA has n't demonstrated that they confer a benefit .
We 're getting much better at quantitating the risks .
In the future what we need to do is just take the risks and look hard and dispassionately at what the real benefits are .
If the benefits are n't there we should n't be having discussions about labeling the drug .
You need to weed the garden patch of drugs that are n't doing what they 're supposed to do .
The FDA has not been very good about that ; it likes to cultivate all these weeds .
MANETTE :
In a perfect world what role do you see the FDA playing in our nation 's health ?
DR .
GRAHAM : In a perfect world , I think the FDA would need to be restructured .
If it were restructured properly , I think that it could actually provide a great benefit to the public health .
I would recommend several changes .
First , I would separate safety and post - marketing from the pre-marketing .
I would create a separate center for product safety .
Actually , Senator Grassley and Dodd have recently introduced legislation to create an independent center for post - marketing safety that would serve to protect the American people from unsafe drugs .
This is n't happening now .
On the pre-marketing side , the FDA needs to pay greater attention to safety .
They need to have larger clinical trials .
They need to compare drug products against other drugs that treat the same indication rather than comparing a drug against a sugar pill .
What we want in the end are drugs that actually have better benefit .
The FDA also needs to determine the post - marketing benefits of a drug .
I 've done that for several drugs .
How many people are actually benefiting ?
How many people are living longer versus those who are having their lives shortened ?
Only when you have that kind of information can you make rational decisions about a medication .
The times when I 've done the benefit analysis , I 've been chastised , criticized and suppressed by the FDA .
These benefit analyses should be done as a matter of routine .
There is a lot that the FDA could do to improve , but the changes are n't going to happen on their own .
Congress is going to have to make them happen .
There 's an expression ,  the zebra does n't change its stripes nor the leopard its spots . 
The FDA is n't going to change the way it does business ; changes will have to be imposed from outside .
MANETTE : How you do feel about direct - to - consumer advertising ?
DR .
GRAHAM : Direct - to - consumer advertising in general is a great disservice to the American people .
We see wonderful ads of people demonstrating their health , whether they 're skating across the ice or doing their Tai chi .
Madison Avenue knows that a picture is worth a thousand words , so they convey an image , a message , and it makes an impression on patients and on physicians .
It creates needs or desires where there really is n't a need or a desire .
There was a recent study in The Journal of The American Medical Association that showed that if patients mentioned a drug that they 've seen on television to their physician they were much more likely to be prescribed that drug by the doctor .
Drug companies know this .
That 's why they do it .
Would the Vioxx disaster have been as great and as large in the absence of direct - to - consumer advertising ?
I submit that the numbers would have been far lower than what they were .
Direct - to - consumer advertising is part of what made Vioxx a blockbuster drug .
It helped to rev the market up to get people to want to use the drug .
Clearly , direct - to - consumer advertising does not serve the American people well .
Madison Avenue is smarter than the most intelligent American .
That 's why they make so much money and that 's why the drug companies go to them to sell their products .
We 're not living in a neutral world where the information we 're getting is objective and unbiased .
It might be that the average American , given all the data , all the facts , and all the information in an objective way could make an intelligent , rational decision .
But we do n't live in that kind of world .
We live in a world where what we 're seeing is a visual image of these people being vital and healthy and cured of their illnesses .
And it 's all because of this little pill that they 're taking .
A patient with that condition says ,  I want to be just like that person . 
So they go to the doctor and say ,  I want that pill . 
Are their lives changed ?
Maybe some people 's lives are changed , but I think most are n't .
MANETTE :
What do you think people hear when they 're watching the ad and after the ad they list all the possible side effects ?
DR . GRAHAM : I do n't think it registers .
You have the visual image that conveys one message .
Then you have the voice that 's speaking over this pictorial being shown telling you what this drug is good for .
Then at the end the auctioneer gets on and says ,  You know this drug could cause ,  and they rattle off 25 different things in three seconds .
You 're lucky if you hear anything .
I do n't think that people come away with it and they certainly do n't come away with any sense of how likely it is to happen because the visual image overpowers anything that gets said .
It 's the same with the ads that appear in magazines .
Companies are required to put some of the labeling in the ad .
You have the ad on the one side  that 's the picture .
It shows this person being healthy because they take this pill .
The fine print is all on the next page .
People are n't going to read the fine print .
It 's the same thing with labeling for physicians .
Physicians do n't read product labels .
Where do they learn about drugs ?
They learn about drugs from the detail person from the drug company or from other colleagues who have used the drug .
They 're not learning it from the labeling .
MANETTE :
Do you think there is a criminal cover - up going on between the FDA and Big Pharma to approve dangerous drugs that sicken and kill Americans ?
DR . GRAHAM : I have no knowledge of criminal activity and I 'm sure there are legal standards for what 's criminal and what 's not .
I do think that there is an institutional bias at the FDA that says we will look for a way to say yes to the approval of any drug that comes down the pipe .
If a drug is so bad that they can't find a reason to approve it , they wo n't .
But , if there is any way that they can approve the drug , they will .
The way this is done is by what 's called the indication . 
Why is it that you 're going to take the drug ?
Maybe you 're going to take it because you have high blood pressure .
Maybe you 'll take it because you have high cholesterol .
That 's the indication .
A company may come in with a drug and want to get it approved for five different indications .
One of them is a really insignificant indication that affects a very small number of people .
The main indication might affect millions of people .
The drug does n't show efficacy for that major indication , but they 're able to somehow or another approve the small indication .
So the drug gets approved for this narrow indication , but the FDA and the drug company both know that it 's going to be used for that other indication .
It 's going to be used off - label . 
Then , the FDA turns around and says that they do n't regulate the off - label use of drugs .
No .
But , they aid and abet it .
They allow it to happen and in many instances off - label use of a drug product is a public health threat .
The FDA has a responsibility to protect the public health .
The FDA should be intervening , but they do n't .
In my own experience I have seen multiple examples where I 've heard people say ,  We can't ask a company to put that in the labeling because the company will say no . 
Or ,  We can't do that because that will decrease their marketing .
We 've got to try to approve this drug .
Let 's see if we can give them this small indication .
At least it 's giving them something .
You 've got to find a way to say yes . 
That is the typical attitude of the FDA culture .
I think Congress is partially responsible for that because when they issued the PDUFA , the Prescription Drug User Fee Act , what they were really saying was ,  We want you to review these drug applications more quickly because you 're keeping lifesaving medicines from the American people .
That 's the line they were fed by Big Pharma .
So they pressure the FDA and the FDA gets the message .
It 's a really pernicious system .
I think it 's unfortunate .
There are many people from the FDA who have examples that they unfortunately can't talk about .
They 'd lose their job and maybe get thrown in prison because you can't discuss confidential and trade secret information .
But the fact is these things happen at the FDA and there have been multiple examples in the past where one could see evidence of that .
MANETTE : Did your faith as a devout Roman Catholic play any role in the decisions you made to put your career on the line to report the truth ?
DR .
GRAHAM : It did in so far as my faith forms my conscience .
It 's sort of my sense of what 's right and what 's wrong and what I am and am not responsible for .
I was in a situation here with Vioxx where I was invited by Senator Grassley 's office to testify .
I could have told them no , but then they would have subpoenaed me .
So of course I went peaceably .
I was faced with this dilemma .
Should I lay it on the line and tell them the way it really is or do I kind of downplay it ?
There are ways of doing that .
What I concluded was that I 'm now being given the opportunity to tell the truth to the people who are in a position to actually make a difference .
I can't make a difference .
I can't change the FDA , but Congress can .
If I do n't tell them the truth , then I 'm now responsible , in part , for future deaths .
I do n't want to become a co-conspirator with the FDA in what happens with Vioxx because tens of thousands of people were injured or killed because of the FDA 's disregard for safety .
If I keep quiet about that , now I 'm part of the problem .
I 'm one of them , and at that point then my conscience asks me ,  You know what the truth is , are you going to speak it or are n't you ? 
So I went ahead and did that and prayed that it all works out well for me personally .
That I have a job and I 'll be able to support my family , that I 'm protected from retaliation , that maybe some good will come out of that .
My faith plays a role , but it was n't a direct teaching of the church .
You have to do x , y and z , but it 's the faith as I 've internalized it .
My conscience is formed by the voice of Christ speaking internally to me .
That 's what the conscience is ; it 's the voice of God speaking to each and every one of us about what 's right and what 's wrong .
I knew what was right .
If I walked away from that nobody else would have to do anything .
I 'd be beating myself up because my conscience would condemn me .
So yes , faith plays a part in every thing that I do .
It 's not saying I 'm a saint , because I 'm not .
But I can't separate who I am from my religious faith .
It 's all part of the same person .
MANETTE : Do you think Congress genuinely wants to fix the problems at the FDA or are too many politicians influenced by the pharmaceutical industry ?
DR . GRAHAM : I do n't know what Congress will do in the end .
My hope is that they will act decisively to reform the FDA and make the American people safer by having strong post - marketing .
Will that happen or not ?
I do n't know .
I think there are many people in Congress who see this as a serious problem and who very much want to see a change .
I think at the same time there are other people who do n't think it 's such a bad problem , and many of those people honestly believe that .
For those people I 'd say they have n't seen the evidence so they do n't really understand how bad the problem is .
There are undoubtedly some people who are influenced by industry .
Does that influence their judgment in the end ?
I do n't know .
They 'd probably say no , it does n't .
Maybe at a conscious level it does n't .
But we have the same phenomenon in the scientific world where we look at research studies that are funded by industry and studies that are funded by government , by National Institutes of Health or the Medical Research Council in the United Kingdom .
Multiple studies have been done that have shown that if your study is funded by industry you are much likelier  about five times more likely  to come up with the result that 's favorable to the drug company than if your study on the same subject is funded by an independent body unrelated to the company .
Now , are the researchers who did this study biased ?
Are they consciously cheating and manipulating the data and everything else ?
No .
I do n't think that 's happening at all , but the fact is if the study is funded by industry it 's much more likely to be favorable to industry .
Without attributing bad motivations to the scientists doing those studies all I can do is point to a strong correlation .
With Congress
I would be concerned that there could be a strong correlation there because Pharma is very bright .
They fund as many politicians as they can .
They get to the Republicans and the Democrats .
Look at the funding on the major committees , the Health , Education , Labor and Pension Committee in the Senate or the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee in the House .
The Wall Street Journal reported recently that many people on these committees are funded by industry to a substantial degree .
Industry knows how to exercise influence .
What we have to do is overcome that influence with evidence , and then rely on the fact that at the end of the day the Congress will do what 's best for the American people .
Will that happen ?
I do n't know because then it gets embroiled in politics .
You know , Republicans versus Democrats , the left versus the right , conservatives versus liberals .
Yet , what we 're talking about is public health and public health is nonpartisan .
I can say this with certainty .
For every member of the House of Representatives somebody in their district died because of Vioxx .
Somebody in their district had a heart attack because of Vioxx .
For every Senator in the Senate , many more people in their state died because of Vioxx or had a heart attack because of Vioxx .
It does n't matter whether it 's a red state or a blue state .
Those are human beings and what we 're talking about is public health .
What I 'm hoping is that Congress will respond .
There is a problem and the evidence is overwhelming , but we 'll just have to wait and see .
MANETTE :
What are you thoughts on President Bush 's attempt to pass tort reform , which would protect most pharmaceutical companies from lawsuits except in the most egregious cases ?
DR . GRAHAM : I think it 's dangerous and wrong for the following reasons .
We already have an FDA that 's been neutralized by industry and sees industry as its client .
The Center for Drug Evaluation and The Office of New Drugs dominates drug safety so that the drug safety is not independent .
Drug safety can't protect the American people .
So government now is n't going to protect the average citizen from the consequences of unsafe drugs .
The only alternative they have left is the legal system  the tort system .
It 's not a wonderful system .
It would be much better if we had effective post - marketing regulation so that we could get bad drugs off the market before they hurt more people , but that 's been neutralized .
All that 's left to people now is the courts .
That 's the only way we have of getting companies to change their behavior .
What tort reform will do is remove that threat as well .
It 's basically giving companies immunity because now the people who are injured by the drugs can't recover damages that might actually mean something to industry .
I mean $ 250,000 for damages ; they blow that in one ad campaign .
To them that 's nothing .
But a lawsuit for multiple millions of dollars has more of an impact .
Now , is that optimal ?
No .
But the fact is that since we have a regulatory agency that does n't regulate and we have a public health agency that does n't protect the public , we have thousands of people who are being injured by products that the FDA knows are unsafe .
The FDA knew there was a problem with Vioxx .
They knew it was a big problem back in mid 2000 yet did nothing about it .
There has to be a system in place that reins companies in .
If the FDA is n't going to exercise control over companies , then who will ?
How will it happen ?
I do n't think that working through the courts and lawsuits is a particularly effective way of doing it ; but it 's the only recourse we have now , and that will be removed as well .
You can demonize the trial lawyers but I think that there are patients who are severely injured by drugs .
The defense is ,  It 's on the labels so we 're protected . 
The problem is that nobody reads the labels so how do they protect anyone ?
The FDA should be making those decisions .
MANETTE :
What can you tell us about all the antidepressants on the market that millions of children are taking ?
DR .
GRAHAM : In early 2004 , SSRI antidepressants and suicidal behavior was a big safety issue .
The FDA had suppressed a report written by a colleague of mine in drug safety and had prevented him from presenting this information in an advisory committee meeting .
That information leaked to the media , embarrassing the FDA because it had been caught suppressing very important information  that most of the antidepressants do n't work for treating children .
Someone in my supervisory chain initiated a criminal investigation to identify the person who had leaked this information to the media .
It turns out that the investigation ordered by these FDA officials was illegal .
They broke federal laws  at least two or three federal laws  in ordering this investigation .
I think it 's well established that depression is very common in adolescence .
With the antidepressants that we have on the market right now only one of them has been shown to work in children and that 's Fluoxetine or Prozac .
All the other SSRI antidepressants are no better than sugar pills .
However , if you were to read the labeling for these drugs it does n't point that fact out so patients think one SSRI is as good as another .
This is another way that the FDA has betrayed the American public and has betrayed the public health .
With the SSRI and antidepressants what the FDA should have insisted on was a signed informed consent at the time a child was going to be treated .
That informed consent would say three things .
One , these are the antidepressants that are available .
Only Fluoxetine has been shown to work for depression in children .
All the other drugs are no better than placebo .
That 's point two .
No better than placebos .
No better than sugar pills .
Third , all of these drugs appear to have the ability to increase the risk of suicidal behavior .
As a parent , if I see that in writing and the psychiatrist or GP is going to write the prescription and put my child on some drug other than Fluoxetine , I can say ,  Doc , why are you putting my child on a drug that does n't work in kids . 
The FDA did n't want patients to have that information so they refused to have signed informed consent .
The companies did n't want the patients to have that information because all of a sudden the off - label use of these drugs would dry up .
So whose interest was being served there ?
MANETTE : How do you feel about taking the approval process out of the hands of the FDA ?
DR .
GRAHAM : Well , where would you put it ?
If you put it somewhere else they 're going to eventually become co-opted the way the FDA has been co-opted .
I think the most that we could probably hope for is to try to disassociate the industry pressures from the approval decision .
You have to change the culture of the organization , and you have to change the incentives in the organization .
The culture and the incentives that the FDA operates by would have to be changed , and Congress can do that through legislation and by establishing different standards for how a drug gets approved .
Not only do you have to show that the drug is effective , but you 've got to show that it works as well or better than other drugs that treat that indication .
You 've got to prove to me that the drug is safe , not that the drug is harmful because you 're never going to prove to me that the drug is harmful .
You set up stringent standards of evidence that might lead to the approval of safe drugs that actually have benefits to the population .
Then pair that up with an independent post marketing regulation .
Currently , the pre-market people who approve the drug decide what happens after it's on the market .
If the drug needs to come off the market , they 're the ones who have to say yes at the end of the day .
The people at the FDA who approved the drug , the Office of New Drugs , they are the single greatest obstacle when it comes to removing unsafe drugs from the market .
I can vouch for that from personal experience .
What you have to do is you have to take that responsibility and power away from them and put it with the group who sees their mission as serving the public and protecting the public health from unsafe drugs .
I think if you do those two things you'd be a long way towards getting the FDA on the right footing .
Also , it would probably be beneficial not to have the FDA 's funding come from industry .
He who pays the piper calls the tune , and we now have a captured agency .
Industry underwrites more than 50 percent of the Center for Drug Evaluation 's budget .
When industry yanks the chain whose neck is going to get tugged ?
The Center for Drug Evaluation !
If industry is n't happy with them and the funding dries up what are we going to do ?
We 're going to have to let half our people go .
The program is going to shrink .
Congress is going to be jumping up and down on our back .
So it 's a captured agency and America is not well served when industry is calling all the shots .
Yes , industry has a right to make a legitimate profit from marketing products that help the American people .
But you should n't have a situation that just basically leaves the American public defenseless .
And that 's what we have right now .
We 're virtually defenseless .
MANETTE : Are there other Vioxx 's out there ?
Do you think this will repeat itself at this high profile level ?
DR .
GRAHAM : At this current moment I do n't think there are other drugs out there that are as bad as Vioxx in terms of the enormous numbers of people that were hurt .
During my Senate testimony I did mention that there were five other drugs that I thought the FDA really needed to reevaluate because in my estimation the benefit to risk was misjudged .
After I named those five drugs the FDA was in the media saying that I did junk science and that these drugs were safe and effective and that I was a crackpot .
However , recently the FDA announced that they were going to take Bextra off the market .
Well , Bextra was one of the five I mentioned .
They announced that with Acutane they were going to impose a restricted distribution system .
Well , I had recommended a restricted distribution system 15 years ago .
The major problem with Acutane is that it 's just so widely overused that it causes an enormous amount of potential harm to pregnancy exposure .
If we restricted the use of the drug to the small number of women who really need it each year , the problem would be pretty much resolved .
But the FDA did n't want to do that because it would interfere with company profits .
If you restrict the distribution and only one - tenth of the people who are getting it now are getting it tomorrow , profit will drop 90 percent .
Of course companies are n't going to go along with that and the FDA is n't going to do anything that 's going to harm corporate profit .
After my Senate testimony the FDA announced that they can look at other drugs  not only the other three of the five that I mentioned .
There are other drugs on the market that I prefer not to talk about that the FDA knows are killing people .
Ten or 100 people a year are dying because of the use of a particular drug or being hospitalized .
Hundreds or maybe thousands of people are being hospitalized each year .
For some of those drugs the benefits do exceed the risks .
For others , it 's clear that more could and should be done and maybe that means restricting the distribution of the drug 's use or maybe it means banning an indication for the drug saying the drug should not be used for particular indications .
Maybe it would be something like with the SSRI 's where I believe there should be signed informed consent so that parents will know that the drug the doctor is prescribing for their son or daughter actually does n't work in children .
I think that there are many things that can be done that have n't been done .
There are other unsafe drugs out there , and the nature of our business is that a drug could be approved tomorrow that turns out to be the next Vioxx and we wo n't know until it happens .
Then the question is , how quickly do we identify the problem and how quickly do we take effective action against it ?
We 're pretty good at identifying these problems quickly .
Where the FDA falls flat on its face is that there is a long period of time in which it does nothing .
Then what it normally does is woefully inadequate and ineffective and as a result the body count mounts and that needs to be changed .
Maybe Congress will change that .
MANETTE : Let 's talk about incentives .
When you say incentives what do you mean ?
For example , working at the FDA , is their pay somehow based on how many drugs they approve ?
DR .
GRAHAM : Currently , the performance evaluations for managers at the FDA are built around the drug review .
How many reviews did they get done ?
Did they meet their PDUFA deadlines ?
It looks bad if you miss your PDUFA deadlines .
The unspoken mores  what 's the expected  is that you 're going to approve as many of these drugs as you can .
There has to be an overwhelming reason for you not to approve .
Frequently what will happen is that these medical officers in their review will recommend that a drug not be approved and they get overruled by the higher ups because the higher ups are answering to a different set of incentives .
You have to change that .
A lot of that comes from the leaders .
What I want to see is does the drug really make a difference ?
Is it beneficial ?
There are many classes of drugs where we 've got 10 or 15 members of that class .
They all lower your blood pressure .
They all lower your cholesterol .
Another one comes along and the FDA feels its obligation to approve it .
Why ?
Maybe the standard should be that for the drugs that come later in a class , they 've got to show that they 're actually better than the drugs on the market because we 've already got these other drugs that work .
That would create incentives maybe within industry to develop drugs that are better than the ones that are already there .
Currently , the way the incentives are for industry , it 's safer to do a me too drug , another drug in the same class .
MANETTE :
Do you think that the FDA should not be partially funded by industry ?
DR . GRAHAM : I think that PDUFA funding for the FDA is a mistake .
MANETTE : Can you explain that a little more clearly because most people do n't know what PDUFA funding is ?
DR .
GRAHAM : The drug companies pay a substantial amount of money to the FDA at the time that they bring a drug application for approval in order for the FDA to review the drug .
Basically it 's a tax .
It 's a fee .
Industry pays the fee , and the FDA will review the drug application .
But the real expectation is from the company :  We 've paid our money , now approve our drug . 
That 's basically how the FDA reacts as well .
I think that the funding for the FDA should be independent of the industry that it 's regulating and I think in the scientific field there 's good evidence to support this notion .
Industry money is influencing the decisions that get made , and it creates this incentive structure .
You have this culture , you have these expectations , you have pressure from Congress .
All of them come to a head at the FDA and all of those incentives are in the direction of approve the drug . 
That 's what happens so I believe that the FDA is unduly influenced by industry and that undue influence is in part the result of industry money funding the FDA operations .
MANETTE : Dr. Graham , thank you for your commitment to your convictions and for sharing insights that drove you to save many lives .
DR . GRAHAM : You 're welcome .
I hope I 've helped .
One Idea .
If the Battery in these things are empty , youll have to throw it away , I guess .
How about adding a Supercapacitor and an inductive charger to it ?
So youll have to shake it if you want it to Light up .
I thought that would be kinda cool and youll wont have to worry about empty Batteries !
The Trust said Radio 2 must do more to attract older listeners BBC Radio 2 must do more to attract ethnic minority listeners and those over 65 , the BBC Trust has said .
In a major review , the trust also said the station needed to find ways to be more " distinctive " during peak time .
And it added the BBC should risk losing some of its audience by adopting " a more ambitious approach to non-music content in peak time " .
The review , by the BBC 's governing body , looked at the station 's quality and value for money .
It recommended Radio 2 should provide peak - time audiences with more content they could not hear elsewhere , suggesting a refresh of its comedy and arts programmes .
The station 's remit is to appeal to all ages over 35 .
However , the trust noted its under - 35 audience had grown significantly over the past 10 years .
Although 82 % of Radio 2's listeners are over 35 , the trust said it needed to ensure the average audience age of 50 did not fall any further and " protect the interest of its older audiences " .
Furthermore , it said the station should " seek to address variances in reach between audience groups - for example the Trust 's research showed that ethnic minorities in particular were less likely to listen " .
' Musical credibility '
The review also looked at Radio 2's digital sister station , 6 Music .
There had been fears in some quarters that the trust would recommend the station should be closed , but trustees merely said the BBC should " strengthen " its appeal .
However , they concluded that , although 6 Music was " distinctive and well - liked by its listeners " , it " needed to reach a bigger audience " .
We remain committed to our target demographic of over - 35s and will work hard to keep our older listeners entertained and informed .
Bob Shennan , controller , Radio 2 and 6 Music
It found that while the station 's listening figures had grown faster over the past four years than any other BBC digital radio - only service , it only reached 1 % of the adult population - with only 20 % of the population aware the station existed .
The trust recommended the BBC should seek older listeners and ensure presenters " were not only popular , but also had musical credibility " .
BBC trustee David Liddiment , who led the review , said : " Radio 2 has a large audience who clearly love its output , but the review showed it must break out of the routine with its programming , in particular to be more distinctive during peak time .
" In contrast , 6 Music has a distinctive approach , but the review concluded that it needed to grow its audience base without losing its unique selling point .
" We 're aware of concerns about Radio 2 targeting a younger audience .
The current average audience age of 50 is well within the station 's target audience , but the trust is clear that this must not fall any further , and we would like to see Radio 2 work on its appeal to over 65 year olds . "
' Loyal audience '
In response to the review , the BBC said it would revamp its arts coverage , " aiming to thread arts , documentaries and comedy into the peak time schedule " .
Bob Shennan , controller of both Radio 2 and 6 Music , added : " We will be building further bridges between our peak time and evening schedules to ensure that our audience is aware of the wide variety of offerings from Radio 2 .
Former singer and Culture Show presenter Laverne hosts on 6 Music " We also remain committed to our target demographic of over - 35s and will work hard to keep our older listeners entertained and informed . "
He continued : " I 'm pleased that the trust has recognised that 6 Music is a distinctive service with a loyal audience , but we understand that the network needs to increase its reach .
" The network is attracting new listeners and I hope that by offering a rich mix of presenting talent , including Lauren Laverne and Jarvis Cocker , and leading radio coverage of musical events such as Glastonbury , the station will broaden its appeal . "
Andrew Harrison , chief executive of commercial radio body RadioCentre , said : " It is now down to the BBC to demonstrate that it can raise the bar and start to offer a more genuinely diverse and distinctive service across all parts of the schedule .
" Comedy , arts , documentaries and specialist music are essential elements of Radio 2's required output , but for too long it has been able to tuck these away at the margins of the schedule in its inexorable pursuit of popularity over public service . "

When President Obama made his first post-election visit to San Francisco , two groups of protesters met him in Union Square .
About 500 activists ( the “ Left ” ) carried signs , sang songs and chanted for an end to the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan , for environmental action and Medicare for all .
Sharing space with us were about 250 “ tea - baggers ” ( the “ Right ” ) carrying anti-Obama signs .
Their main issues were lower taxes and opposition to “ government intervention ” in health care .
Despite sharp disagreement on health care and the “ stimulus ” , we agreed on much .
Everyone I spoke to was against the wars ( although they “ supported the troops ” ) and against the corporate bailouts , and for civil liberties .
Why must we see each other as opponents rather than potential allies ?
In a society run by corporate elites who trample the values of both progressives and traditional conservatives , could n’t we align Left and Right against the national security state and bankster capitalism ?
Scott Horton thinks we can and should .
Horton is host of Antiwar Radio , a show heard on KAOS Radio in Austin , Texas and streaming on Antiwar.com .
“ The left - right political spectrum is the name of our dilemma , ” he says .
“ To end the wars and restore our Bill of Rights we have to find common grounds , not get distracted and tear each other ’s eyes out over less important cultural and economic differences . ”
It seems clear the left - right divide is serving the rulers .
In response to the question , “ Where is all the protest , ” a Common Dreams reader posted : “ There are plenty of folks objecting .
They are simply being dismissed by the left as “ mobs ” and “ Nazi’s ” , with the right dismissing the others as communists , socialists and liberals . ”
Started by libertarians , Antiwar.com features news from around the world on foreign policy , with antiwar views from all political positions .
“ We ’re making people realize that what ’s most important is what we have in common , ” says Horton .
“ Our troops should be brought home yesterday .
Stop the torture ; stop the empire . ”
Horton is far from alone in this crusade .
Progressive talk radio host Thom Hartmann approvingly quotes Ross Perot and Ron Paul .
Paul and liberal Democrat Alan Grayson co-sponsored an amendment to audit the Federal Reserve .
Socialist Senator Bernie Sanders and Republican Jim DeMint are spearheading a similar measure in the Senate .
Firedog Lake ’s Jane Hamsher and various rightists have co-authored several letters protesting insurance and bankster giveaways .
Libertarians and leftists are also joining forces in the street .
Libertarians in Monterey , California joined the local Peace Coalition and organized a demonstration against the occupation of Afghanistan .
We have n’t seen any tea - baggers at these protests yet , but why not reach out to them ?
The empire is the antithesis of the small government they claim to believe in .
In the electoral arena , a group of libertarians and progressives has formed a PAC called Strange Bedfellows to support candidates running against Blue Dog Democrats and other war supporters .
Diverse American forces have allied against empire before .
In 1898 , leaders from Andrew Carnegie to Jane Addams and Samuel Gompers joined Mark Twain in forming the American Anti-Imperialist League to oppose the annexation of the Philippines .
According to the Alliance of the Libertarian Left , we should perhaps stop looking at the battle against gangster capitalism as being solely a “ Left ” project .
One can oppose modern corporate capitalism from a socialist perspective , but also from a free market perspective , because corporations wielding government power destroy free markets .
Citing Ralph Nader , Horton says , “ Our problem in the U.S. is a combination of elite private power and the public power of the state .
It ’s not business in and of itself ; it ’s business ’ control of government , as in the bailout .
Libertarians and leftists agreed that banks should n’t be allowed to socialize their costs onto the working people and middle - class people .
A lot of conservatives see this clearly also . ”
In fact , street demonstrations against the Fed have included Ron Paul libertarians , Greens , and New Way Forward progressives .
Seeing Things Differently , Fighting Together
Historically , the Left ’s prime values are justice , equality , and cooperation .
The honest ( non-corporate ) Right ’s prime values are freedom and independence .
Our differences in values explain the conflict about universal health care .
The Left sees it as promoting equality and supporting those who need help .
The Right sees it as an infringement on people ’s independence .
I do n’t share their values , but it ’s important to recognize that they truly held .
The corporate oligarchs destroy the values of both Left and Right .
The oligarchs are against justice , equality , and social security , and also against freedom , independence , and peace .
So a left / right coalition at least starts with a common enemy .
How can Leftists ally with libertarians and honest conservatives ?
Horton says , “ Approach the Right from the right .
How can a conservative be for unlimited nationalism and abandoning the rule of law and unlimited budgets ?
Show them they are being inconsistent with their own beliefs . ”
A reader on antiwar.com commented , “ Approach [ grass - roots conservatives ] in the language of freedom . ”
The empire is taking away American freedoms and the freedoms of those it attacks .
The war on drugs is an assault on freedom ; the war on terror is an assault on freedom .
Handing the keys to the Treasury to Goldman Sachs is an assault on economic freedom .
Yes , there are differences between Left and Right .
But they do n’t include some of the most important issues – stopping the empire , restoring civil liberties , and breaking the mega - banks ’ hold on the economy .
We all agree on those .
Can we get off the left / right continuum ?
As Horton asks , “ Instead of liberals vs. conservatives , would n’t it be better to have it be torturers , imperialists and liars vs. the peace and freedom party ? ”
If we ’re willing to reach out to conservatives and ally with libertarians , they are not hard to find .
If we focus on the issues that unite us , maybe we can build a movement against the empire .
From John Byrne at Raw Story :
If no health care overhaul passes Congress , health insurers may be in for a windfall — and one far larger that most Americans probably realize .
According to a study by a pro-health reform group published Thursday , the nation ’s largest five health insurance companies posted a 56 percent gain in 2009 profits over 2008 .
The insurers including Wellpoint , UnitedHealth , Cigna , Aetna and Humana , which cover the majority of Americans with insurance .
The insurers ’ hefty profit gains came even as 2.7 million more Americans lost their insurance coverage due to the declining economy .
Background
A growing body of research has provided evidence that dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate ( DHEAS ) are involved in an organism 's response to stress and that it may provide beneficial behavioral and neurotrophic effects .
Methods
This study investigated plasma DHEA and DHEAS , cortisol , psychological symptoms of dissociation , and military performance in 41 healthy active duty subjects enrolled in the military Combat Diver Qualification Course ( CDQC ) .
Results
Baseline values of DHEA and DHEAS were significantly and positively predictive of superior performance in the underwater navigation exam ; in addition , DHEA and DHEAS were significantly and negatively related to stress - induced symptoms of dissociation during performance of the task .
Similarly , participants who reported fewer symptoms of dissociation exhibited superior military performance and increased levels of DHEA after the test .
Conclusions
These data provide prospective , empiric evidence that DHEA and DHEAS are associated with superior stress tolerance , fewer symptoms of dissociation , and superior , objectively assessed , military performance .
Depression is in the news these days .
We love to read and write about it and yet , whenever we discuss it , we offer the same routine disclaimer .
Sufferers from depression , we are told , are too ashamed or embarrassed to admit to their condition .
They are reluctant to seek help , although we all piously agree there is nothing to be ashamed of in mental illness .
And we keep on repeating this to ourselves , despite the glaring examples of distinguished depressives who have been far from reticent about their state .
These include Alastair Campbell , Stephen Fry , Professor Lewis Wolpert and , most recently , the highly successful novelist Marian Keyes , whose outburst of near - despair last week has provoked a good deal of commentary , both sympathetic and snide .
She says she can't eat , sleep , write , read or talk to people and that she does n't know when she will ever emerge from this darkness .
She has told the world about this on her website , so she wo n't mind my repeating it .
So , is depression fashionable or is it unmentionable ?
Is it a taboo or a mark of distinction ?
Is a confession an act of exhibitionistic self - indulgence ?
It 's not clear whether we think we run risks by ignoring it or whether we talk about it too much .
It is obviously unwise for politicians to admit openly to depression , at least while they are in or seeking office , and dentists and doctors do n't often own up to it , although many suffer from it .
I was told by a reliable source that the suicide rate for dentists in the United States is higher than that in any other profession , yet most dentists appear to be quite jolly .
It 's all right for actors , performers , writers , artists and women to admit to weakness , because they are n't responsible and they do n't count .
Fashions in illness come and go .
Appendixes , adenoids and tonsils are no longer as smart or as suspect as they were and it appears that the vogue for ulcers has given way to the label of acid reflux .
There are fashions in mental health , too , and the recent proliferation of dramatic eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia begins to make depression look seriously old - fashioned .
Feminist scholars Elaine Showalter and Lisa Appignanesi have written about the changing history of women 's afflictions , noting that the 19th - century diagnosis of hysteria ( etymologically , a womb - related disorder ) more or less disappeared and was overtaken by a blanket diagnosis of depression .
And it would appear , from such inevitably unreliable statistics as we have , that women are more liable to depression than men , despite the exceptions cited above .
More women take anti-depressants and more women are succumbing to depression year by year , or so recent surveys suggest .
In the old days , the days of my mother and grandmother , female depression was often linked to the menopause and took the form of low spirits , mood swings , a sense of worthlessness and redundancy and odd acts of eccentricity ( kleptomania was often excused as menopausal ) .
These states were very different from the florid hysteria from which some of Freud 's patients suffered .
Hormonal changes were blamed for what was seen as a not very welcome but inevitable rite of passage : you expected this kind of thing to happen to you at a certain age .
The woman , no longer fertile and made uncomfortably aware of her diminishing biological attractions , sank into a period of gloom from which she would emerge when the hormones settled and she meekly accepted her reduced role .
The word " menopausal " was flung around as a routine insult , but I suspect that , like the words " cretin " and " spastic " , it may be less acceptable now .
Men did n't have to go through this middle - aged valley , because they remained potent and did n't have to confront bodily change so bleakly .
They went under later , at retirement .
Female expectations changed dramatically with the availability of hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) , which delayed the menopause and some of its associated ills .
My generation eagerly swallowed those little reddish brown pellets of mare 's urine , or whatever they were made of , as though they were the elixir of life , just as we had swallowed the contraceptive pills that had given us our freedom .
We did n't care about the long - term effects , we just wanted to stay young a bit longer .
We did n't want to go down into the vale just yet .
I remember having serious doubts about all of this when I met a 68 - year - old woman at a charity luncheon , who confided to me over the soup that she was still menstruating and proud of it .
I was taken aback .
I think it occurred to me then , with justified foreboding , that the depression traditionally associated with the menopause might not have been avoided by HRT , it might just have been postponed , and that it would kick in later , with all the more force because the body and spirit would be older and weaker and future prospects less bright .
The chronological curve of women 's expectations has changed spectacularly during Marian Keyes 's writing life .
She is 46 years old , but nowadays a 46 - year - old is not even seen as middle - aged .
She is in the prime of life and is more likely to be accused of suffering from the hangover of celebrity and success than from the once - inevitable " change of life " .
I read one or two of her novels 10 years ago when I was writing an essay about chick lit and the courtship novel , inspired by the emergence of Bridget Jones .
The heroines of chick lit are 10 years older than the heroines of Jane Austen , in their thirties rather than their early twenties .
They are financially independent and enjoy unlimited freedom of speech and movement ; Bridget Jones is noticeably more confident about sexual intercourse than she is about fancy cooking .
This is a very different social world from Austen and even from early Drabble .
Women 's lives have in one generation changed almost out of recognition .
Keyes 's Sushi for Beginners ( 2000 ) , set largely in the offices of a women 's magazine , is a characteristic example of high - spirited chick lit with a subplot of mum lit and contrasts the fates of three women , one ambitious and separated from her husband , one single and caring and one married to her " dream man " , but hampered and exhausted by small children .
These are pioneer lives , in a rapidly changing society , and they clearly mirror the aspirations and experiences of millions of readers , who made their creator a bestseller .
Some mental health experts argue that women are unhappier now than they used to be because their expectations are too high .
They fail to achieve eternal youth and beauty , but are forced to live in a consumer culture that celebrates youth .
This , these experts suggest , may be even more painful than the fear that , at the age of 46 , they would be sinking into menopausal gloom and thence descending rapidly into old age .
I doubt it .
All change brings risks .
Women are less passive than they used to be , live longer and have more resilience , even though they encounter new hazards as they age .
They are still at work on the shape of the future .
Marian Keyes , in speaking out about her current desperate state , is already moving on .
She is a writer and she will probably write her way out of it .
That 's what writers do .
It started as a dance party in the streets .
Within hours , trash bins were burning , windows were smashed and riot police were swinging their batons .
It was an ugly scene , even for a university best known for its fever - pitched politics .
Late Friday night and early Saturday morning , the streets of Southside became a battleground as tensions over budget cuts , tuition hikes and the recent discovery of a noose hung in the UC San Diego library boiled over .

After the discovery of the noose , students organized by several Web sites , including Reclaim UC , occupied UC Berkeley ’s Durant hall as a show of solidarity to San Diego students facing escalated racial tensions over the noose incident .
The next step in the protests was to be a series of dance parties in the streets , which resulted in several occupied buildings at UC Santa Cruz , according to the blog Occupy California .
The overall goal of the dance parties was to raise support for the March 4 statewide protests over the state of public education , The Daily Californian reported .
Tensions on all UC campuses have been on the rise since some students staged a “ Compton Cookout ” on President ’s Day , as a mockery of Black History Month .
The paper noted that UC Berkeley ’s Durant Hall was vandalized during the occupation , with locks cut and windows smashed .
The Californian added that protesters also smashed the windows of a Subway sandwich shop on Bancroft Way .
Officers from six different departments responded to the crowd , which had grown to approximately 250 in size according to organizers .
“ The tone of the gathering changed at about 1:55 a.m. when a dumpster was pushed into the center of the intersection and set on fire by members of the crowd , ” the Californian continued .
“ The Berkeley Fire Department responded as people danced on top of the dumpster and shouted , ‘ Whose street ?
Our street ! ' ”

Dear readers ,
So , I ’ve been looking into buying a Nokia N900 .
However , what it provides regarding freedom is still not completely clear to me .
And given that it is significantly more expensive than other smartphones , I ’d like to make sure that it ’s not a loss of money :-)
– Can I download the full source , recompile it , build a firmware from it and re-install my Nokia N900 from scratch ?
Is the process documented ?
It seems that you need to accept a EULA to download updated firmwares , and I could n’t find the source for them .
What exactly is available from firmware that is not available through normal repositories ?
( Are normal repositories only for “ extras ” apps , or is the base system also installable / upgradable from them ?
– What ’s the content of /etc/apt/sources.list ?
What exactly is http://repository.maemo.org/pool/maemo5.0/nokia-binaries/?
What does Nokia need to hide ? :-)
– Would it be possible to develop a Centos - like distribution , installing the Maemo firmware , but then upgrading everything to rebuilt versions using an unofficial repository ?
Are there some applications that are not packaged , or that would break if re-installed that way ?
– Could I install Debian or Ubuntu on the N900 ?
Is the process documented ?
Is it possible to dual - boot between , say , Maemo5 and Debian ?
( I ’m not talking about setting up a chroot , of course )
– Besides the non-free telephony stack , are there any other “ antifeatures ” I should be aware of ?
Thanks .
The UK economy has come out of recession , after figures showed it had grown by a weaker - than - expected 0.1 % in the last three months of 2009 .
The economy had previously contracted for six consecutive quarters - the longest period since quarterly figures were first recorded in 1955 .
There have been recent recovery signs - last week , UK unemployment fell for the first time in 18 months .
The UK's had been the last major economy still in recession .
Europe 's two biggest economies - Germany and France - came out of recession last summer .
Japan and the US also emerged from recession last year .
The weak level of growth took its toll on the value of the pound , which fell against both the dollar and the euro on the money markets .
' Below expectations '
" We can say that Britain has just crossed the line in coming out of recession , " said BBC chief economics correspondent Hugh Pym .
" It [ the growth figure ] was below analysts ' expectations .
The figure could be moved down , or indeed upwards . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Our correspondent said the move out of recession had been greatly boosted by the government car scrappage scheme .
Joe Grice , from the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) , said the UK 's production and service sectors each grew by 0.1 % during the quarter .
The ONS figures also showed that GDP fell by a record 4.8 % in 2009 .
" The Q4 GDP figures are a major blow to hopes that the UK economy had emerged decisively from recession in Q4 , " said analyst Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics .
" No doubt some commentators will claim that the figures are under - estimating the true strength of the recovery and will be revised up in time .
" That is certainly possible .
But it wo n't change the big picture of an economy still operating way below both its pre-recession and trend levels of output . "
' Frail ' recovery
The UK recession began in the April - to - June quarter of 2008 , and was the longest UK recession on record .
During 18 months of recession , public borrowing increased to an estimated £ 178bn , while output slumped by 6 % .
After the GDP figures were published , John Wright , chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses , said that the recovery remained " frail " .
Even with some revision ... we are still talking about an extremely lacklustre recovery
Stephanie Flanders , BBC economics editor
Read Stephanie 's blog in full Hard times persist in Barnsley Fragile recovery for Welsh firms Q&A : What is GDP ?
" In order to strengthen the recovery it is important that we boost consumer confidence and demand and that interest rates are held steady as continued investment in the economy will be the key to ensuring a sustainable recovery , " he said .
Meanwhile , Lee Hopley , chief economist at manufacturers organisation EEF , said : " Whilst today 's data confirm that manufacturing is now out of recession , they also continue to raise questions over the health of the wider economy .
" The trajectory for the recovery , particularly in the next six months , is an uncertain one and the best prospects remain an export - driven turnaround . "
First estimates of how the economy has performed are made with about 40 % of the data available , and Investec economist David Page has warned there is " plenty of room for surprises " in the figures .
But the BBC's Economics Editor Stephanie Flanders said : " Even with some revision - in fact , even if it turns out that the economy actually started to grow in the third quarter , given that the first estimate of a decline 0.4 % has already been revised up to - 0.2 % - we are still talking about an extremely lacklustre recovery . "
' Staggering ' Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling said he was now sure that " we are on a path to recovery .
" I 'm confident but I 'll always remain cautious " .
But shadow chancellor George Osborne told the BBC that the UK needed a " new model of economic growth " under a Conservative Government .
He added : " Let 's be clear - this is about as weak growth as you can get . "
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman , Vince Cable said the markets would be surprised that growth had been markedly slower than expected .
" Far from the quick recovery the chancellor has been praying for , the economy is only just staggering back into growth , " he said .

The Law that Nobody Wanted New Internet Legislation Embarrasses German Government
A new bill to fight child pornography has been signed into law by Germany 's president .
There 's only one problem :
The government has decided it no longer wants it .
They are now in the awkward position of relying on opposition help to repeal the legislation .
CREATURES FROM PRIMORDIAL SILICON ----- Begin NetScrap ( TM ) ----- CREATURES FROM PRIMORDIAL SILICON
Let Darwinism loose in an electronics lab and just watch what it creates .
A lean , mean machine that nobody understands .
Clive Davidson reports " GO ! " barks the researcher into the microphone .
The oscilloscope in front of him displays a steady green line across the top of its screen .
" Stop ! " he says and the line immediately drops to the bottom .
Between the microphone and the oscilloscope is an electronic circuit that discriminates between the two words .
It puts out 5 volts when it hears " go " and cuts off the signal when it hears " stop " .
It is unremarkable that a microprocessor can perform such a task -- except in this case .
Even though the circuit consists of only a small number of basic components , the researcher , Adrian Thompson , does not know how it works .
He ca n't ask the designer because there was n't one .
Instead , the circuit evolved from a " primordial soup " of silicon components guided by the principles of genetic variation and survival of the fittest .
Thompson 's work is not aimless tinkering .
His brand of evolution managed to construct a working circuit with fewer than one - tenth of the components that a human designer would have used .
His experiments -- which began four years ago and earned him his PhD - - are already making waves .
Chip manufacturers , robot makers and satellite builders are interested because the technique could produce smaller , more efficient devices than those designed today using traditional methods .
Thompson 's experiments have also inspired other research projects and some serious speculation about whether technology is poised to evolve in ways that will take it well beyond human understanding .
Looking for inspiration Computer scientists have long looked to biology for inspiration .
From simplified models of the brain they developed neural networks that have proved particularly good at recognising patterns such as signatures on credit cards and fingerprints .
They have also worked out ways to mate and mutate programs and allow the resulting programs to compete with one another to generate the " fittest " software for a task .
These " genetic algorithms " have been used to evolve software that does everything from creating works of art to selecting high - performing shares on the stock market .
To Thompson , who works with Phil Husbands at the Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics at the University of Sussex , all these techniques leave something to be desired .
They are too tightly constrained by the rules of chip designers and software engineers .
The behaviour of living neurons , for example , is inseparable from the biochemicals from which they are made .
But it does n't matter what material the circuits of a neural network chip are etched in , so long as they operate in a digital fashion .
Digital computers break down all data into strings of 1s and 0s , which the hardware stores as " ons " and " offs " in its memory .
This forces the transistors inside computer chips to work as switches -- they 're either on or off .
But transistors are not intrinsically digital .
Between on and off they pass through a smooth series of values , and in these regions they can behave as amplifiers , for example .
Computer designers , however , make little or no use of these properties .
Likewise , programmers are constrained by the digital nature of computers .
A program is a sequence of logic instructions that the computer applies to the 1s and 0s as they pass through its circuitry .
So the evolution that is driven by genetic algorithms happens only in the virtual world of a programming language .
What would happen , Thompson asked , if it were possible to strip away the digital constraints and apply evolution directly to the hardware ?
Would evolution be able to exploit all the electronic properties of silicon components in the same way that it has exploited the biochemical structures of the organic world ?
" I wanted to see what happens if you let evolution break out of the constraints that humans have , " says Thompson .
" If you give it some hardware , does it do new things ? "
These questions could only be answered if a way were found to combine the " wet " processes of biological evolution with the " dry " world of silicon chips .
Thompson found the solution in a field - programmable gate array ( FPGA ) .
The transistors in a conventional microprocessor are hardwired into logic gates , which carry out the processing .
By contrast , the logic gates in an FPGA and their interconnections can be changed at will .
The transistors are arranged into an array of " logic cells " and simply by loading a special program into the chip 's configuration memory , circuit designers can turn each cell into any one of a number of logic gates , and connect it to any other cell .
So by loading first one program , then another , the chip can be changed at a stroke from , say , an amplifier to a modem ( " Software , who needs it ? " , New Scientist , 2 November 1996 , p 41 ) .
Mission impossible Thompson realised that he could use a standard genetic algorithm to evolve a configuration program for an FPGA and then test each new circuit design immediately on the chip .
He set the system a task that appeared impossible for a human designer .
Using only 100 logic cells , evolution had to come up with a circuit that could discriminate between two tones , one at 1 kilohertz and the other at 10 kilohertz .
To kick off the experiment , Thompson created a population of 50 configuration programs on a computer , each consisting of a random string of 1s and 0s .
The computer downloaded each program in turn to the FPGA to create its circuit and then played it the test tones ( see Diagram , below ) .
The genetic algorithm tested the fitness of each circuit by checking how well it discriminated between the tones .
It looked for some characteristic that might prove useful in evolving a solution .
At first , this was just an indication that the circuit 's output was not completely random .
In the first generation , the fittest individual was one with a steady 5 - volt output no matter which audio tone it heard .
After testing the initial population , the genetic algorithm killed off the least fit individuals by deleting them and let the most fit produce copies of themselves -- offspring .
It mated some individuals , swapping sections of their code .
Finally , the algorithm introduced a small number of mutations by randomly switching 1s and 0s within individual programs .
It then downloaded the new population one at a time onto the FPGA and ran the fitness tests once more .
By generation 220 , the fittest individual produced outputs almost identical to the inputs -- two waveforms corresponding to 1 kilohertz and 10 kilohertz -- but not yet the required steady output at 0 volts or 5 volts ( see Diagram , below right ) .
By generation 650 , the output stayed mostly high for the 1 kilohertz input , although the 10 kilohertz input still produced a waveform .
By generation 1400 , the output was mostly high for the first signal and mostly low for the second .
By generation 2800 , the fittest circuit was discriminating accurately between the two inputs , but there were still glitches in its output .
These only disappeared completely at generation 4100 .
After this , there were no further changes .
Once the FPGA could discriminate between the two tones , it was fairly easy to continue the evolutionary process until the circuit could detect the more finely modulated differences between the spoken words " go " and " stop " .
So how did evolution do it ?
If a human designer , steeped in digital lore , were to tackle the same problem , one component would have been essential - - a clock .
The transistors inside a chip need time to flip between on and off , so the clock is set to keep everything marching in step , ensuring that no transistor produces an output between 0 and 1 .
A human designer would also use the clock to count the number of ticks between the peaks of the waves of the input tones .
There would be 10 times as many ticks between the wave peaks of the 1 kilohertz tone as those of the 10 kilohertz tone .
In order to ensure that his circuit came up with a unique result , Thompson deliberately left a clock out of the primordial soup of components from which the circuit evolved .
Of course , a clock could have evolved .
The simplest would probably be a " ring oscillator " - - a circle of cells that change their output every time a signal passes through .
It generates a sequence of 1s and 0s rather like the ticks of a clock .
But Thompson reckoned that a ring oscillator was unlikely to evolve because it would need far more than the 100 cells available .
So how did evolution do it -- and without a clock ?
When he looked at the final circuit , Thompson found the input signal routed through a complex assortment of feedback loops .
He believes that these probably create modified and time - delayed versions of the signal that interfere with the original signal in a way that enables the circuit to discriminate between the two tones .
" But really , I do n't have the faintest idea how it works , " he says .
One thing is certain : the FPGA is working in an analogue manner .
Up until the final version , the circuits were producing analogue waveforms , not the neat digital outputs of 0 volts and 5 volts .
Thompson says the feedback loops in the final circuit are unlikely to sustain the 0 and 1 logic levels of a digital circuit .
" Evolution has been free to explore the full repertoire of behaviours available from the silicon resources , " says Thompson .
That repertoire turns out to be more intriguing than Thompson could have imagined .
Although the configuration program specified tasks for all 100 cells , it transpired that only 32 were essential to the circuit 's operation .
Thompson could bypass the other cells without affecting it .
A further five cells appeared to serve no logical purpose at all -- there was no route of connections by which they could influence the output .
And yet if he disconnected them , the circuit stopped working .
It appears that evolution made use of some physical property of these cells -- possibly a capacitive effect or electromagnetic inductance -- to influence a signal passing nearby .
Somehow , it seized on this subtle effect and incorporated it into the solution .
To solve this mystery , Thompson needs to measure the input and output values of each cell when the circuit is operating .
But the FPGA allows only digital access to these points , so he can't measure the analogue values .
Thompson 's colleague , Paul Layzell , is building a circuit board that will allow all the components to be measured with analogue instruments .
However it works , Thompson 's device is tailor - made for a single 10 by 10 array of logic cells .
But how well would that design travel ?
To test this , Thompson downloaded the fittest configuration program onto another 10 by 10 array on the FPGA .
The resulting circuit was unreliable .
Another individual from the final generation of circuits did work , however .
Thompson thinks it will be possible to evolve a circuit that uses the general characteristics of a brand of chip rather than relying on the quirks of a particular chip .
He is now planning to see what happens when he evolves a circuit design that works on five different FPGAs .
Another challenge is to make the circuit work over a wide temperature range .
On this score , the human digital scheme proves its worth .
Conventional microprocessors typically work between - 20 0C and 80 0C .
Human designers set the clock so that chip components have enough time to settle into a digital value .
As many computer hackers know , they can turn up the clock speed if they keep the temperature of the microprocessor low because the transistors settle into their on or off states more quickly when cold .
Thompson 's evolved circuit only works over a 10 0C range -- the temperature range in the laboratory during the experiment .
This is probably because the temperature changes the capacitance , resistance or some other property of the circuit 's components .
Whatever the cause , this is a serious drawback .
If the circuit needs a temperature controller to enable it to operate , then it is no longer a cheap , low - power device .
But evolution could come to the rescue here as well .
In a future genetic algorithm , Thompson plans to score circuits not only on how well they perform an electronic task , but also on how well they cope with temperature variation .
Evolution might , for example , create a design that includes a set of subcircuits each of which operates over a different temperature range .
If this fails to solve the problem , Thompson will try giving the FPGA a clock .
But he wo n't tell the circuit what to do with it .
" It will be a resource - - we 'll see what use evolution makes of it , " he says .
Thompson 's circuits have so far solved only simple problems .
If they succeed at more complex tasks , they could prove useful for all kinds of applications .
Thompson has evolved controllers for miniature robots for Xilinx , the Edinburgh firm that makes FPGAs .
And the American company Motorola is showing interest in his ideas because they may mesh well with a new analogue FPGA the company has produced .
British Telecom , which has an obvious interest in the sort of signal - processing problem that Thompson started with , is sponsoring work by Layzell , who is extending Thompson 's ideas .
Suspicious minds Already , at Napier University in Edinburgh , Julian Miller and Peter Thomson have picked up on Thompson 's concept and are evolving their own digital circuits .
They do this at a slightly higher level than Thompson , by creating lists of logic gates and connections , and putting evolution to work on these lists .
They 've evolved simple arithmetic units such as a multiplier .
" It uses a lot fewer resources than a human would design , " says Thomson .
If evolutionary design fulfils its promise , we could soon be using circuits that work in ways we do n't understand .
And some see this as a drawback .
" I can see engineers in industry who wo n't trust these devices , " says Thomson .
" Because they can't explain how these things work , they might be suspicious of them . "
If the chips ever make their way into engine control systems or medical equipment we could well face an ethical dilemma , says Inman Harvey , head of the Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics .
" How acceptable is a safety - critical component of a system if it has been artificially evolved and nobody knows how it works ? " he asks .
" Will an expert in a white coat give a guarantee ?
And who can be sued if it fails ? "
This is only a problem for people who do n't understand how today 's microprocessors are tested , says Pierre Marchal , who leads research into new computer architectures at the Swiss Centre for Electronics and Microtechnology in Neuchbtel .
" I have no problem with this , " he says .
" You never test every possibility inside a microprocessor . "
That is why the bug in Intel 's Pentium chip was found only a year after the first one was made .
Harvey and Marchal agree that the safety of future chips will have to be assured through exhaustive testing .
If the chip operates properly under all the likely combinations of inputs and environmental conditions , then it does n't matter how the chip works internally .
The great thing about Thompson 's idea , says Marchal , is that if you find a problem you add another constraint to the fitness test and evolve a better solution .
" You can adapt it , just as the immune system adapts to new diseases , " he says .
Marchal believes there is a " real possibility " that machines will evolve in ways that will be beyond human reasoning .
To some , this prospect is frightening .
But not to Marchal .
" I 'm not sure this is a real problem .
The risk from a bomb is higher , " he says .
" Humanity can destroy itself far easier than these alien technologies . "
For the moment , though , the thinking is more down to earth .
At Napier , Thomson and Miller hope that evolution will teach them new design tricks .
" It gives us a new way of looking at things , " says Thomson .
And at Sussex , Adrian Thompson has his own goal .
" I 'm just trying to explore what evolution will do . "
Perhaps this is where the real value of his work lies .
Whether or not his approach produces useful devices , it may help us to understand more about how the evolutionary process itself works .
But that 's another story .

Let Darwinism loose in an electronics lab and just watch what it creates .
A lean , mean machine that nobody understands .
Clive Davidson reports " GO ! " barks the researcher into the microphone .
The oscilloscope in front of him displays a steady green line across the top of its screen .
" Stop ! " he says and the line immediately drops to the bottom .
Between the microphone and the oscilloscope is an electronic circuit that discriminates between the two words .
It puts out 5 volts when it hears " go " and cuts off the signal when it hears " stop " .
It is unremarkable that a microprocessor can perform such a task -- except in this case .
Even though the circuit consists of only a small number of basic components , the researcher , Adrian Thompson , does not know how it works .
He ca n't ask the designer because there was n't one .
Instead , the circuit evolved from a " primordial soup " of silicon components guided by the principles of genetic variation and survival of the fittest .
Thompson 's work is not aimless tinkering .
His brand of evolution managed to construct a working circuit with fewer than one - tenth of the components that a human designer would have used .
His experiments -- which began four years ago and earned him his PhD - - are already making waves .
Chip manufacturers , robot makers and satellite builders are interested because the technique could produce smaller , more efficient devices than those designed today using traditional methods .
Thompson 's experiments have also inspired other research projects and some serious speculation about whether technology is poised to evolve in ways that will take it well beyond human understanding .
Looking for inspiration Computer scientists have long looked to biology for inspiration .
From simplified models of the brain they developed neural networks that have proved particularly good at recognising patterns such as signatures on credit cards and fingerprints .
They have also worked out ways to mate and mutate programs and allow the resulting programs to compete with one another to generate the " fittest " software for a task .
These " genetic algorithms " have been used to evolve software that does everything from creating works of art to selecting high - performing shares on the stock market .
To Thompson , who works with Phil Husbands at the Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics at the University of Sussex , all these techniques leave something to be desired .
They are too tightly constrained by the rules of chip designers and software engineers .
The behaviour of living neurons , for example , is inseparable from the biochemicals from which they are made .
But it does n't matter what material the circuits of a neural network chip are etched in , so long as they operate in a digital fashion .
Digital computers break down all data into strings of 1s and 0s , which the hardware stores as " ons " and " offs " in its memory .
This forces the transistors inside computer chips to work as switches -- they 're either on or off .
But transistors are not intrinsically digital .
Between on and off they pass through a smooth series of values , and in these regions they can behave as amplifiers , for example .
Computer designers , however , make little or no use of these properties .
Likewise , programmers are constrained by the digital nature of computers .
A program is a sequence of logic instructions that the computer applies to the 1s and 0s as they pass through its circuitry .
So the evolution that is driven by genetic algorithms happens only in the virtual world of a programming language .
What would happen , Thompson asked , if it were possible to strip away the digital constraints and apply evolution directly to the hardware ?
Would evolution be able to exploit all the electronic properties of silicon components in the same way that it has exploited the biochemical structures of the organic world ?
" I wanted to see what happens if you let evolution break out of the constraints that humans have , " says Thompson .
" If you give it some hardware , does it do new things ? "
These questions could only be answered if a way were found to combine the " wet " processes of biological evolution with the " dry " world of silicon chips .
Thompson found the solution in a field - programmable gate array ( FPGA ) .
The transistors in a conventional microprocessor are hardwired into logic gates , which carry out the processing .
By contrast , the logic gates in an FPGA and their interconnections can be changed at will .
The transistors are arranged into an array of " logic cells " and simply by loading a special program into the chip 's configuration memory , circuit designers can turn each cell into any one of a number of logic gates , and connect it to any other cell .
So by loading first one program , then another , the chip can be changed at a stroke from , say , an amplifier to a modem ( " Software , who needs it ? " , New Scientist , 2 November 1996 , p 41 ) .
Mission impossible Thompson realised that he could use a standard genetic algorithm to evolve a configuration program for an FPGA and then test each new circuit design immediately on the chip .
He set the system a task that appeared impossible for a human designer .
Using only 100 logic cells , evolution had to come up with a circuit that could discriminate between two tones , one at 1 kilohertz and the other at 10 kilohertz .
To kick off the experiment , Thompson created a population of 50 configuration programs on a computer , each consisting of a random string of 1s and 0s .
The computer downloaded each program in turn to the FPGA to create its circuit and then played it the test tones ( see Diagram , below ) .
The genetic algorithm tested the fitness of each circuit by checking how well it discriminated between the tones .
It looked for some characteristic that might prove useful in evolving a solution .
At first , this was just an indication that the circuit 's output was not completely random .
In the first generation , the fittest individual was one with a steady 5 - volt output no matter which audio tone it heard .
After testing the initial population , the genetic algorithm killed off the least fit individuals by deleting them and let the most fit produce copies of themselves -- offspring .
It mated some individuals , swapping sections of their code .
Finally , the algorithm introduced a small number of mutations by randomly switching 1s and 0s within individual programs .
It then downloaded the new population one at a time onto the FPGA and ran the fitness tests once more .
By generation 220 , the fittest individual produced outputs almost identical to the inputs -- two waveforms corresponding to 1 kilohertz and 10 kilohertz -- but not yet the required steady output at 0 volts or 5 volts ( see Diagram , below right ) .
By generation 650 , the output stayed mostly high for the 1 kilohertz input , although the 10 kilohertz input still produced a waveform .
By generation 1400 , the output was mostly high for the first signal and mostly low for the second .
By generation 2800 , the fittest circuit was discriminating accurately between the two inputs , but there were still glitches in its output .
These only disappeared completely at generation 4100 .
After this , there were no further changes .
Once the FPGA could discriminate between the two tones , it was fairly easy to continue the evolutionary process until the circuit could detect the more finely modulated differences between the spoken words " go " and " stop " .
So how did evolution do it ?
If a human designer , steeped in digital lore , were to tackle the same problem , one component would have been essential - - a clock .
The transistors inside a chip need time to flip between on and off , so the clock is set to keep everything marching in step , ensuring that no transistor produces an output between 0 and 1 .
A human designer would also use the clock to count the number of ticks between the peaks of the waves of the input tones .

Cleveland is playing host to an exciting experiment in employee - owned business , The Nation reports .
The city ’s Evergreen network debuted last fall with the LEED - certified Evergreen Cooperative Laundry in Cleveland ’s Glenville neighborhood , where , The Nation notes , residents ’ median income is around $ 18,000 .
“ After a six - month initial ‘ probationary ’ period , employees begin to buy into the company through payroll deductions of 50 cents an hour over three years ( for a total of $ 3,000 ) , ” The Nation explains .
“ Employee - owners are likely to build up a $ 65,000 equity stake in the business over eight to nine years — a substantial amount of money in one of the hardest - hit urban neighborhoods in the nation . ”
Evergreen is also operating a solar - panel installation enterprise , Ohio Cooperative Solar , and hopes to open at least two more cooperatives in the near future : Green City Growers , a massive urban - food operation to be housed in a 230,000 - square - foot hydroponic greenhouse , and the Neighborhood Voice , a community newspaper .
All in all , The Nation reports , Evergreen hopes to launch 10 integrated companies , and create about 500 jobs , in the next five years .
The overall strategy is not only to go green but to design and position all the worker - owned co-ops as the greenest firms within their sectors .
This is important in itself , but even more crucial is that the new green companies are aiming for a competitive advantage in getting the business of hospitals and other anchor institutions trying to shrink their carbon footprint .
Far fewer green - collar jobs have been identified nationwide than had been hoped ; and there is a danger that people are being trained and certified for work that does n't exist .
The Evergreen strategy represents another approach — first build the green business and jobs and then recruit and train the workforce for these new positions ( and give them an ownership stake to boot ) .
Community - development specialists in Baltimore , Detroit , and other cities are discussing the possibilities of adopting “ the Cleveland model ” elsewhere , and the story ’s authors — Gar Alperovitz , Ted Howard , and Thad Williamson — dedicate some serious column space to imagining what that might look like .

On AVATAR and the Return of the Feminine - A Jungian Perspective | December 26 , 2009
Much has been written about the film Avatar since its release .
Critical voices abound .
Some see it as a “ white person ’s fantasy on racial identity ” .
This thought would have never occurred to me .
Others see it as a “ mythic expose ” of Western militarism & colonialism .
That reasoning I can appreciate .
It is what one might see when the eye is focused on the history of Western civilization .
To that I will add some thoughts from psyche ’s perspective .
I will focus on the intra-psychic angle , which means we will attempt to see from “ the inside out ” .
Imagine that there is indeed a World Soul , as the ancient philosphers and alchemists believed and captured in the image of the Anima Mundi ( Soul of the world ) .
It is the spirit in nature that animates all matter .
It is the spirit that creates an interconnected , sentient and intelligent web of life of which humanity is part of .
An ancient symbol of this unity of life is the world tree .
This image shows up in most world mythologies .
From Yggrasil , the world tree in Nordic mytholgy to the Tree of Life in the Genesis .
It is part of the mythology of the San people of the Kalahari desert , the oldest existing culture on earth and the world tree also figures prominently in the cosmology of the Mayans .
That so many seemingly unrelated cultures revere the world tree points towards a synchronistic event reflecting a much larger cosmic reality .
As above so below .
The biologist Carl Calleman postulates ( in “ The Purposeful Universe ” ) , a central axis , a cosmic Tree of Life which creates organizations of life on a microcosmic level , that is on the level of our lived life .
The soul knows , and has always known , that the image of the tree holds a deep mystery and a connection to a transpersonal reality .
The tree , deeply rooted in the ground below , opens its branches towards the heavens .
It needs the water from below and the light from above to live and grow .
In Jungian thought , the tree , has a bridging function and is an integral part of nature .
The tree image is an exquisite image of the archetypal feminine .
Such a tree is the source of strength , knowledge and inspiration of the Na’vi , the native inhabitants of Pandora .
I suggest that the Na’vi can be seen as personifications of our disowned and split off connection to nature , our own nature as well as Nature in the world .
The Na’vi may represent our repressed connection to the mysteries and wonders of life and cosmic reality .
This seems true on an individual as well collective level .
On the individual level , this is what happens when cynicism wins out over a tender feeling .
In that moment a bulldozer killing machine steamrolls our soul and consciousness .
Not unlike the military commander , who is cut off from nature ’s suffering and her plight .
The abuse of the natural world and her resources on a collective level are so blatantly obvious that there is no need to go into further detail now .
Avatar can be seen as a constructive countervision to the catastrophy mongering of 2012 mania .
It shows us what needs to be done .
Individually and collectively .
The archetypal feminine is returning .
Whether we like or not , the Goddess is on her way back .
Symbolically , not literally , but the forces involved are VERY REAL .
Whether this will be a smooth process or a catastrophic event depends largely on us .
Can we make this shift , as individuals and as a culture , to make room for Yin , the archetypal feminine and expand our linear , mechanistic and overly rational frame of what we think consciousness is ?
One intriguing fact is that the Na’vi are blue .
I have no doubt the makers of Avatar were aware of the blue god in Hindu mythology , Krishna .
Krishna was the eighth reincarnation ( avatar ) of the Hindu God Vishnu .
Significant similarities exist between Krishna and the Christ figure .
Both were sent by a father god to challenge the tyranny of the ruling class .
Both were considered divine and human .
Krishna is often depicted with a flute , which people found irresistable .
Krishna was a rebel , a poet and a lover of many women in Hindu lore .
This earthy behavior and the flute connect him to the Greek Pan and they are all aspects of the connection to the archetypal feminine that needed to be split off , denied and repressed in the Christ of the dogmatic church .
( Only the Gnostics allowed for a different image of Christ to surface ) .
The 2012 hype aside , many sense that a major shift is demanded from us .
We may need to , as shown in AVATAR , emerge into our Na’vi nature , which is living in harmony with the feminine of which the soul is part of .
This is not a simplistic return to nature or to a previous evolutionary stage .
It may be the next leap in the evolution of consciousness , and the only one that may hold the promise of survival .

The Canonical List of TWL2 Anamonics
This list is maintained by John J. Chew , III < jjchew@math.utoronto.ca > and was last revised 2011 - 12 - 19 10:41:22 .
If you like it , please take the time to compose a few anamonics yourself and e-mail them to me .
Check the lists of highest - frequency stems that still need anamonics , if you need inspiration .
See also the SOWPODS edition .
Contents
In crossword game parlance , a `hook ' is a letter that can be added to a word to form another word .
( `S ' is a hook for ` HOOK ' because ` SHOOK ' is a word . )
An `anahook ' is a letter that can be added to a word ( or more generally any set of letters ) to make an anagram of a word .
( `W ' is an anahook for ` RETAINS ' because ` TINWARES ' is a word . )
A set of letters that has a useful set of anahooks is often called a `stem ' .
An anamonic is a mnemonic phrase made up of the anahooks for a particular stem .
If we can remember the phrase `RELAXING BY HIS CELL DOOR ' for the stem ` INMATE ' , we will never waste time trying to find a seven - letter word in `AEIMNTU ' ( `INMATE '+`U ' ) , because there are no `U 's in that phrase .
On the other hand , if we have `AEIMNT ? ' on our rack and the only possible hook on the board is a ` C ' , we will know that it is worth thinking a bit to find ` NEMATIC ' .
In the lists that follow , stems are listed in anagram - alphabetical order , and stems that are not acceptable words are marked with a `*' .
Stems that are words that are acceptable only in OSW are marked with a `# ' .
Sometimes , when a stem has no vowel anahooks , one needs to add vowels to the list of anahooks to make a pronounceable mnemonic .
Mnemonics where vowels are to be ignored are marked with a `*' .
Mnemonics where consonants are to be ignored are marked with a '@ ' .
The usefulness of an anamonic depends on how often the stem is likely to be seen and how many words can be made from the stem .
To help you tell how probable a stem is , each line begins with a number that will be lower , the more probable that stem is .
( To be precise , if a line starts with `n ' , then there is a 1/ n chance of drawing tiles that can be used to spell the stem when drawing the number of tiles that there are in the stem , from a standard tile bag , as calculated by wordprob.c. )
Where known , the author(s ) of an anamonic is shown in [ ] at the end of the line .
There is some question concerning the copyright status of some anamonics .
If you can help attribute the original sources of unidentified anamonics , please send me e-mail .
It is my understanding that we are all indebted to Nick Ballard for organizing the first drive to coin anamonics for high - probability stems , and for publishing collections of them in his now defunct journal Medleys and elsewhere .

Hello again vinyl fence blogger (s ) !
( I 'm hoping there are actually more than two of you ! )
I 'm back with a fun little factoid for all you fence lovers !
Did you know that in Southern Australia they built a 5,614 KM fence ( that 's 3,488 miles ) from Jimbour in Queensland to the Great Australian Bight , separating them from Northern Australia ???
They must really hate dingos ... or Northern Australians !!!
Whichever it is , that 's a mother fence !!!
They call it the Wild Dog Fence or Dingo Fence .
It 's 6 feet high and goes 1 foot underground , that way them dingos would n't be able to jump over it or dig under it .
Too bad we did n't get contracted to build that fence !
With our vinyl fence , it would have been the prettiest outback fence around !
Oh well !
Check out the 4 pictures below :
1. Map of the Dingo Fence :
2. Picture of the Dingo Fence - goes as far as the eye can see :
3. Another pic of the Dingo Fence :
4 . This Fence not only blocks out the Dingos but has poison bait and traps set all along it :
This is the first time I have ever even heard of this fence .
Does anyone else here have some other great facts about the Dingo Fence ?
' Til next time bloggers !
What would you do if you went to a cash machine to get £ 20 and got the below two bank notes ?
This is what I got when I used a cash machines in London recently .
One of the £ 10 notes is fine , the other is only about 3/4 complete .
This obviously is n’t good as no shop will accept a note like this ( unless they do n’t spot it ) .
You wo n’t be able to use it in a machine – they check that you feed them a complete note .
The easiest option is to take the note to the bank whose cash machine it is and ask for a replacement .
As it is their fault you have a dud note they should give you a replacement – unless they feel like being awkward .
If is very hard to prove that this bank note came from their machine so if they feel like being awkward there ’s not much you can do .
Failing that you could take the bank note into another bank and ask for a replacement .
Just be polite and hopefully you ’ll get what you want .
Your chance of success probably depends on how complete the note is .
If the note has both serial numbers , the silver thread , and is over half complete then you ’ll probably be ok .
If you have less than half a note then you wo n’t get anything – if it was possible to get a full £ 10 from just half a £ 10 then everyone would be ripping their banknotes in half to double their money !
If you really ca n’t get any luck from your bank or another bank then you can send your note to the Bank of England .
You can fill in a Mutilated Notes claim form and post your note to them .
Of course there is a risk that it will get lost / stolen in the post , and it will cost you an envelope , a stamp and some time , but if you have exhausted all other options then give this a go .
The currently replace about £ 40 million worth of bank notes each year .
Update
I had to wait until the weekend before I was able to visit my local NatWest branch but when I did they exchanged the incomplete banknote for a complete one with no fuss .
I just told them that one of their cash machine had given me a £ 10 note with a bit missing from the end , and asked them to swap it for a complete one .

In order to crawl from beneath crushing debt and reach fiscal solvency , Illinois legislators must choose from a series of options that range from bad to worse , according to a prominent watchdog group .
The Civic Federation wants to launch an intervention that includes significant budget cuts and the largest tax increase package in Illinois history , all in an effort to save the state from a $ 12.8 billion budget deficit .
“ Doomsday is here for the state of Illinois , ” said Laurence Msall , Civic Federation President , to the Sun -Times .
The group says it would support a state income tax increase from 3 percent to 5 percent .
It also recommends the state tax retirees ’ pension and Social Security checks be taxed for the first time at the same rate as workers ’ paychecks .
They want another $ 1 increase on a pack of cigarettes and to eliminate $ 181 million in corporate tax breaks .
If implemented , the Federation 's recommendations could shave off $ 8 billion , but there is a catch .
In order to implement those increases , the Civic Federation says unions should pay more toward their pensions and health care -- but the unions are n't interested .
“ Illinois ’ fiscal crisis has been many years in the making .
It was caused by more than 30 years of pension underfunding and many years of spending unfettered by the state ’s shrinking revenue resources , ” said Msall .
The group ’s plan would help alleviate the deficit by 2012 , they say .
The state ’s red ink has already caused a backlog of unpaid bills to public universities and schools , transit systems and social services .
“ The Civic Federation does not enjoy advocating a significant tax increase in the middle of a difficult recession .
However , continuing to do nothing would be by far a worse option , ” said the Civic Federation in a statement on the group ’s website .

A massive 7.0 - magnitude earthquake has struck the Caribbean nation of Haiti .
The extent of the devastation is still unclear but there are fears thousands of people may have died .
Haiti's worst quake in two centuries hit south of the capital Port - au - Prince on Tuesday , wrecking the presidential palace , UN HQ and other buildings .
A " large number " of UN personnel were reported missing by the organisation .
Many people have spent the night outside amid fears of more aftershocks .
The Red Cross says up to three million people have been affected .
Describing the earthquake as a " catastrophe " , Haiti's envoy to the US said the cost of the damage could run into billions .
A number of nations , including the US , UK and Venezuela , are gearing up to send aid .

The quake , which struck about 15 km ( 10 miles ) south - west of Port - au - Prince , was quickly followed by two strong aftershocks of 5.9 and 5.5 magnitude .
The tremor hit at 1653 ( 2153 GMT ) on Tuesday , the US Geological Survey said .
Phone lines to the country failed shortly afterwards .
There is still no official word on casualties and the extent of the devastation is only now becoming clearer with dawn breaking .
China has already indicated in reports in state media that eight of its peacekeepers are buried and feared dead , with another 10 unaccounted for .
I think hundreds of casualties would be a serious understatement

The AFP news agency quoted the Jordanian army as saying three of its peacekeepers had been killed and 21 wounded .
The Brazilian army said four of its peacekeepers were killed and a large number were missing .
A French official told AFP about 200 people were missing in the collapsed Hotel Montana , which is popular with tourists .
There have also been some reports of looting overnight .
Rachmani Domersant , an operations manager with the Food for the Poor charity , told Reuters that overnight the capital was in total darkness .
" You have thousands of people sitting in the streets with nowhere to go .
There are people running , crying , screaming .
" People are trying to dig victims out with flashlights .
I think hundreds of casualties would be a serious understatement . "
Earlier , bodies white with dust could be seen piled on the back of a pick - up truck as vehicles tried to ferry the injured to hospital .
Haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere and has suffered a number of recent disasters , including four hurricanes and storms in 2008 that killed hundreds .
' Thoughts and prayers '
In a statement issued in New York , the UN said that its local HQ in Haiti had " sustained serious damage along with other UN installations " and " a large number " of personnel were missing .
EYEWITNESS Carel Pedre , TV and radio presenter , Port - au - Prince I saw a lot of people crying for help , a lot of buildings collapsed , a lot of car damage , a lot of people without help , people bleeding .
I saw a movie theatre , a supermarket , a cybercafe , an apartment building which collapsed .
Now it 's dark outside , there is no electricity , all the phone networks are down , so there 's no way that people can get in touch with their family and friends .
There are aftershocks every 15 to 20 minutes .
They last from three to five seconds .
The first shock was really strong , people were falling in the streets and buildings collapsed .
I did n't see any emergency services , the people at the neighbourhood were trying to help each other .
The streets are narrow and there is lot of traffic and everyone is trying to reach family and friends .
Traffic now is really difficult .
People do n't know where to go or where to start .
Eyewitness : ' Blood all over them ' UN peacekeeping chief Alain Le Roy said it was unclear how many people were in the building .
The head of the UN mission in Haiti , Hedi Annabi , was reported to have been inside and is unaccounted for .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said he was believed to be dead .
The UN 's stabilisation mission plays a vital role in ensuring security in Haiti .
Raymond Joseph , Haiti's ambassador to the US , said the presidential palace , the tax office , the ministry of commerce and the foreign ministry had all been damaged , but the airport was intact .
He and Haiti's ambassador to Mexico , Robert Manuel , both said that President Rene Preval and his wife had survived the quake .
The World Bank said its local offices were destroyed but most of the staff were accounted for , Reuters reported .
US President Barack Obama said his " thoughts and prayers " were with the people of Haiti and that he expected " an aggressive , coordinated [ aid ] effort by the US government " .
Venezuela says it will send a 50 - strong " humanitarian assistance team " .
HAITI COUNTRY PROFILE
Half of Caribbean island of Hispaniola History of violence , instability and dictatorship Population of 10 million people Most live on less than $ 2 a day Democratic rule restored in 2006 Economy in ruins and unemployment is chronic UN peacekeepers deployed - foreign aid seen as vital Massive deforestation has left just 2 % forest Storms and hurricanes in 2008 left almost 800 dead
Country profile : Haiti World 's Haiti aid effort
The Red Cross is dispatching a relief team from Geneva and the UN's World Food Programme is flying in two planes with emergency food aid .
The Inter - American Development Bank said it was immediately approving a $ 200,000 grant for emergency aid .
The UK said it was mobilising help and was " ready to provide whatever humanitarian assistance may be required " .
Canada , Australia , France and a number of Latin American nations have also said they are mobilising their aid response .
Pope Benedict XVI has called for a generous response to the " tragic situation " in Haiti .
' Shouting and screaming '
In the minutes after the quake , Henry Bahn , a visiting official from the US Department of Agriculture , said he had seen houses which had tumbled into a ravine .
" Everybody is just totally , totally freaked out and shaken , " said Mr Bahn , who described the sky as " just grey with dust " .
He said he had been walking to his hotel room when the ground began to shake .
" I just held on and bounced across the wall , " he said .
" I just heard a tremendous amount of noise and shouting and screaming in the distance . "
Reports on the Twitter message site , which cannot yet be verified by the BBC , expressed the chaos in the wake of the quake .
Tweets from troylivesay spoke of the worst damage being in the Carrefour district , where " many two and three storey buildings did not make it " .
In the immediate aftermath of the quake , a tsunami watch was put out for Haiti , Cuba and the Bahamas , but this was later lifted .

Japanese designers Nendo have completed the interior of a mental health clinic in Akasaka , Tokyo , where none of the doors open and patients and staff instead move around the building by opening sections of the walls .
Called MD.net Clinic Akasaka , the project includes sliding bookcases behind which the consultation rooms can be found and a single opening door at the end of the corridor that reveals a window to the outside .
See all our stories about Nendo in our special category .
Here are some more details from Nendo :
--
Nendo ’s new interior design project in Tokyo
“ MD.net Clinic AKASAKA ” , a new mental health clinic
The interior design for a mental health clinic in Akasaka , Tokyo .
The clinic specializes in total mental health care : in addition to standard consultations with a psychiatrist , it offers such services as corporate consulting and support for patients returning to the workplace .
Rather than getting patients back to a ' zero ' , a neutral starting place , the traditional model for mental health care , the clinic aims to provide patients with something extra : a further richness in their daily lives that they did not have before starting treatment .
The interior design is an attempt to express this philosophy in space .
The ' doors ' that line the walls of the clinic do not open , and ' ordinary ' parts of the walls open up into new spaces .
The consultation rooms are entered by sliding the bookshelves sideways .
The door at the end of the hallway opens onto a window ; the amount of light in the hallway is controlled by opening and closing the door .
By providing alternate perspectives for viewing the world , and avoiding being trapped by pre-existing perceptions , the interior allows visitors -- and staff members -- to experience opening new doors in their hearts , one after the other .

* Dodd a major player on regulation , healthcare
* News underscores fragility of Democratic majority
* “ My moment to step aside ” ( Updates with more quotes , details )
WASHINGTON , Jan 6 ( Reuters ) - Veteran Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday he will not seek re-election in November in recognition that he faced an uphill battle and underscoring upheaval facing President Barack Obama ’s Democrats .
Dodd , 65 , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and leader of a financial regulations overhaul in the Senate , has been dogged by questions over his financial industry connections and was trailing badly in polls in his home state of Connecticut .
Wall Street was looking for clues as to how hard Dodd , in his remaining year in office , would push for a financial regulation revamp that banking lobbyists and Republicans are fighting .
The White House said Obama spoke to Dodd and believes he will continue efforts to pass the overhaul .
[ ID :nN06140551 ]
“ Knowing Senator Dodd and the passionate advocate that he is , I think he will continue to work hard and want to get this done by the end of the year , as the president does too , ” said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs .
Benny Lorenzo , CEO of Kaufman Bros. , a boutique investment bank and advisory firm in New York , said Dodd ’s move could “ free him to be more assertive ” in seeking regulatory changes .
Dodd ’s announcement followed by one day the surprise announcement by Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan that he would not seek re-election in North Dakota .
Dodd , speaking at his home in East Haddam , Connecticut , said he found himself in the “ toughest political shape of my career . ”
While insisting it was “ absurd ” to write him off in November , “ Ultimately , I came to the conclusion that in the long sweep of American history , there are moments for each elected public official to step aside and let someone else step up . ”
“ This is my moment to step aside , ” he said .
Dodd is giving way to an expected bid for his seat by Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal .
Republicans conceded that Democratic chances will improve with Blumenthal in the race .
[ ID :nN06143310 ] [ ID :nN06140195 ]
Two Senate Democratic sources indicated that South Dakota Senator Tim Johnson is in a strong position to take Dodd ’s place next year as chairman of the Banking Committee .
[ ID :nN06146739 ]
Johnson has been on the mend from a brain hemorrhage three years ago and won a third six - year term in 2008 with 63 percent of the vote .
PERSONAL DECISION
A Senate Democratic leadership aide said Dodd ’s decision not to seek re-election was a personal one that he reached without prodding from other party members .
Dodd thanked voters for their confidence over the years and acknowledged their doubts , noting “ there have been times when my positions and actions have caused some of you to question that confidence . ”
Dodd ’s departure will leave a large hole .
Besides financial regulations , he has had a lead role in pushing Obama ’s healthcare agenda and has backed an uphill battle to win passage of legislation to stem global warming .
“ While his work in the Senate is not yet finished , his leadership in that institution will be missed , ” Obama said in a statement .
The party that holds the White House usually loses congressional seats in the first election after a new president takes power , and public opinion polls indicate this could happen again as Americans express frustration at the weak U.S. economy .
Democrats are trying to hang on to strong majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives in 2010 congressional elections and many pundits predict Republican gains .
Jennifer Duffy , who tracks Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report , said having two veteran Democratic senators announce they will not seek new terms within 24 hours of each other “ dealt a psychological blow ” to their party .
But Duffy said the dual actions may prove to be somewhat of a wash on Election Day -- Democrats hanging on to the Connecticut seat while dropping the North Dakota one .
UPHILL FIGHT
Dorgan announced on Tuesday that he would not seek re-election .
Polls showed that like Dodd he also faced an uphill fight in November , when voters will elect 38 of the 100 senators and all 435 House members .
Republicans are facing their own struggles , led by a conservative rebellion against moderates , which could limit their ability to mount an electoral earthquake as they did in 1994 in the first election after Bill Clinton took office .
Dodd has been at the pinnacle of his power , but has been buffeted by charges that he benefited from a low - interest mortgage loan at a time when many Americans were facing home foreclosures .
Rivals have hammered the white - haired Dodd , a 35 - year veteran of U.S. politics , over his connections to the financial industry and two mortgages he got in 2003 from Countrywide Financial Corp , once the country ’s largest home lender that was acquired by Bank of America in 2008 .
Modern manufacturing is n’t based on human labor , it ’s based on the robot .
Still , most people cannot grasp the breadth of automation in factories .
We still picture plants full of human workers toiling to make our cars and furniture , just as we imagine our meat comes from animals in a barn .
The truth is much more awe - inspiring , perhaps even frightening .
The factories of today have some human workers , but huge portions of assembly lines are 100 % mechanized .
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics expects automotive jobs to decline 18 % by 2018 despite expected increases in production .
Robots eliminate the need for more workers .
Before you lament the loss of jobs , take a moment and watch how robots earn their role every day in the workplace .
Incredible !
You probably know that most cars are made with less than 24 hours worth of human labor .
The rest is all done by automation .
Machines building machines .
It sounds simple , but you have to watch it to really understand what it means .
It goes way beyond cars , though .
Pick an industry with a repetitive task , and you ’ll find a robot .
Here are some stacking wood :
Sorting and packaging is almost completely mechanized :
And you ca n’t discuss sorting and stacking without mentioning the Flexpicker .
Look at this thing fly .
No humans needed , just raw robotic speed and accuracy .
Even those who understand the scope of the robotic workforce may not understand its versatility .
Here we see a FANUC machine with a huge array of embedded tools used for a complex assembly process .
Automation is n’t a far off possibility any more than it ’s a disastrous end to human labor .
It is a natural part of our industrial world , and without it we would be unable to support our modern lifestyle .
As robots continue to step in and increase factory productivity , new and cheaper goods will become available .
If we plan it right , that will mean we can spend more time being creative , relaxing , and enjoying the fruits of our mechanized labor .
In order to realize that potential , we ’ll have to plan for the future , and that means accepting the present .
If it helps , you can always imagine that factory robots are more human than they appear :
I think it 's missing Scotty on the drums , Bones on the Key - tar , and Chekhov on the regular guitar .
Not entirely sure what to do with Sulu and Uhura , though ...
Okay , I know , " Geekiest Comic Ever " is a big claim to make , considering there are other comics like " When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth . "
But I had to get your attention somehow , right ?
And Erfworld is incredibly geeky in a fantastic way .
( As opposed to geeky in a sci - fi way . )
Here 's the plot : in the magical realm of Erfworld , the Overlord Stanley the Plaid has basically killed off all his warlords in battle due to poor strategy .
His spell - caster Wanda suggests they buy a spell which will summon the perfect warlord from anywhere in the universe , a military genius who will save them from certain defeat .
So they cast the spell and who should appear but Parson , an overweight strategy gamer from Columbus , Ohio .
Parson reminds me a little of the character Eli Wallace on SGU .
Here 's a man-child who is obsessed with spaceships and science fiction , and he finds himself on a starship hurtling through space .
Yes , it 's a bit worrying and , yes , they could all die .
But he 's on a frikkin ' spaceship !
Parson is a bit like that , only with a gaming obsession : he finds himself inside a world similar to his strategy games .
And while it takes him a while to accept that it 's actually happening to him , he quickly warms to the task and starts plotting strategy .
( And this even after he realizes that Stanley the Plaid is , to put it bluntly , the bad guy .
Parson does n't mind . )

( I will warn you : when I first went to check out Erfworld to see what it was about , I wound up reading the entirety of Book One in one sitting , staying up until about 2 a .m. )
There are all sorts of tongue - in - cheek allusions : from Charlie 's Angels to the Eyebooks , magic books which the characters use to communicate with each other via a system which is , well , instant messaging , complete with a " Quack " noise when a new message is received .
The sound effects are absurd and hilarious : from the " Fer - Durrrp ! " of the bugles to random words reinterpreted as onomatopoeia : " Golem ! " for the appearance of , well , Golems , and " Decrypt ! " as the sound of somebody being raised from the dead .
The names of things are cutesy : " dwagons " and " gwiffins , " and they all look cute , too , even the giant vicious teddy bears .
But then , in the midst of all the adorable stuff a warlord gets an arrow through his head , or a giant marshmallow peep gets bitten in half by a dwagon .
The artwork is a good match for the writing , with its own mixture of bitter and sweet .
It 's hard to describe the breadth of geekiness contained in Erfworld ; I 'm not even a strategy gamer but it sucked me in .

Councils are advised to have six days supplies of salt Up to 30 councils spurned an offer last year of thousands of tonnes of de-icing salt at a reduced price , to use on the roads this winter , the BBC has learned .
British Salt Director David Stephen made the offer from its 60,000 tonnes stockpile in April but had no takers .
The Local Government Association said every council had six days ' supply - the officially minimum recommended level of salt needed to meet demand .
However the LGA 's David Sparks said the six - day advice may have to be revised .
Earlier this week Transport Secretary Lord Adonis warned that councils might have to ration their supplies of salt to cope with continuing cold weather .
' No response ' But BBC Radio 4's
The Report has been told that 20 to 30 councils were offered thousands of tonnes of salt twice last year to prepare for any winter problems .

" Following last year 's winter , we knew we had 60,000 tonnes available and felt we should enter the de-icing sector permanently , " said Mr Stephen .
" We went to the markets and offered them this same product at a discounted price , " he added .
None of the councils contacted responded .
He said British Salt is nearing the stage where orders will exceed supply at its factory in Middlewich , Cheshire .
" Once the panic has died down we will go back to the councils and see if we can secure a supply position with them , " Mr Stephen added .
Saving cash
With the government looking to buy salt from abroad , Mr Stephen said councils could have stocked up last year and saved money if they had ordered earlier .
David Sparks , a member of the transport board of the Local Government Association said he was not aware of British Salt 's offer .
But he added : " That would n't have altered anything because everybody did have six days of salt which was the consensus view of the level of salt that was adequate to meet the demands that we would face .
" The consensus may have been wrong but I do n't know that , I would much prefer us to systematically review it so we can come to a figure in the light of our experience that is more able to deal with the problems we face .
" If it is decided that we need to plan for [ and ] spend more money for rarer events then so be it , but it needs to be something that 's studied systematically . "
Supply advice Mr Sparks added : " The problem we face is that we do not know what the weather is going to be like .
We must first ensure there is an adequate supply of salt and that is defined and there are adequate methods of increasing that supply should the need arise .
" Equally we need to look at whether there are alternative methods of dealing with the problems of extremely cold weather on the roads network . "
Transport minister Sadiq Khan admitted that the six day advice may be altered in the future .
" Once we get out of these freezing conditions we 'll need to look at the lessons and one is asking if the national resilience programme is adequate if there may be more frequent periods of bad weather , " he said .

China does n't want our big , fat Hummers , apparently .
GM had originally planned to sell the company and brand to China 's Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Co .
Executives familiar with the matter say GM will now wind down the brand , according to Bloomberg .
Fox News talk show host Glenn Beck has seized on a claim circulating on the Internet to argue that the Obama administration has little understanding of American business and is too focused on expanding government .
" History has proven over and over again — and so has the post office , for that matter — that government is not the answer , " Beck said on his Nov. 30 , 2009 , show .
" You need to unleash the people .
The entrepreneurs .
And if you are wondering how it is that the government can't see that — how they can be pondering even bigger stimulus packages as they stare the failure of the first one right in the face — I 'll show you .
Here are the past presidents and the number of appointees in their Cabinets with private sector experience — folks that have done more than write on the chalkboard ; they 've been out there , in the real world .
Let 's compare President Nixon — he 's over 50 percent — with President Obama : Under 10 percent of his appointees have any experience in the private sector . "
We did a little digging and found that the claim is based on a study by Michael Cembalest , the chief investment officer for J.P. Morgan Private Bank .
In a Nov. 24 , 2009 , column titled " Obama 's Business Blind Spot " and published on Forbes.com , Cembalest wrote , " In a quest to see what frame of reference the administration might have on this issue , I looked back at the history of the presidential Cabinet .
Starting with the creation of the secretary of commerce back in 1900 , I compiled the prior private - sector experience of all 432 Cabinet members , focusing on those positions one would expect to participate in this discussion : secretaries of State ; Commerce ; Treasury ; Agriculture ; Interior ; Labor ; Transportation ; Energy ; and Housing & Urban Development . "
He continued , " Many of these individuals started a company or ran one , with first - hand experience in hiring and firing , domestic and international competition , red tape , recessions , wars and technological change .
Their industries included agribusiness , chemicals , finance , construction , communications , energy , insurance , mining , publishing , pharmaceuticals , railroads and steel ; a cross-section of the American experience .
( I even gave [ one - third ] credit to attorneys focused on private - sector issues , although one could argue this is a completely different kettle of fish . )
One thing is clear :
The current administration , compared with past Democratic and Republican ones , marks a departure from the traditional reliance on a balance of public - and private - sector experiences . "
In an accompanying chart , Cembalest reported that in the Obama administration , fewer than 10 percent of the Cabinet appointees counted under those rules had private sector experience .
According to the chart , all other administrations going back to Theodore Roosevelt 's had rates in at least the high 20s , with the Eisenhower and Reagan administrations approaching 60 percent .
( He wrote in a footnote that the data came from a number of sources , including capsule biographies of Cabinet members posted on the Web site of the University of Virginia 's Miller Center for Public Affairs . )
The chart — typically reprinted by itself , without Cembalest 's accompanying narrative — circulated in the conservative blogosphere for a couple of days before eventually being picked up by Beck .
We wondered if the claim was right , so we did some math of our own .
In Obama 's Cabinet , at least three of the nine posts that Cembalest and Beck cite — a full one - third — are occupied by appointees who , by our reading of their bios , had significant corporate or business experience .
Shaun Donovan , Obama 's secretary of Housing and Urban Development , served as managing director of Prudential Mortgage Capital Co. , where he oversaw its investments in affordable housing loans .
Energy Secretary Steven
Chu headed the electronics research lab at one of America 's storied corporate research - and - development facilities , AT&T Bell Laboratories , where his work won a Nobel Prize for physics .
And Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , in addition to serving as Colorado attorney general and a U.S. senator , has been a partner in his family 's farm for decades and , with his wife , owned and operated a Dairy Queen and radio stations in his home state of Colorado .
Three other Obama appointees had legal experience in the private sector .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke spent part of their careers working as lawyers in private practice .
Clinton and Vilsack worked as private - sector lawyers at the beginning of their careers , while Locke joined an international law firm , Davis Wright Tremaine LLP , after serving as governor of Washington state .
At the firm , Locke " co-chaired the firm 's China practice " and " helped U.S. companies break into international markets , " according to his official biography .
That sounds like real private sector experience to us .
Finally , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner worked for Kissinger Associates , a consulting firm that advises international corporations on political and economic conditions overseas .
The occupants of the two remaining Cabinet posts cited in the chart do not appear to have had significant private - sector experience : Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood .
Obama 's Cabinet has even more private - sector experience if you go beyond the nine .
Two of the Obama appointees could be considered entrepreneurs — the very people Beck would " unleash . "
Vice President Joe Biden , officially a Cabinet member , founded his own law firm , Biden and Walsh , early in his career , and it still exists in a later incarnation , Monzack Mersky McLaughlin and Browder , P.A .
( The future vice president also supplemented his income by managing properties , including a neighborhood swimming pool . )
And Office of Management and Budget director Peter Orszag founded an economic consulting firm called Sebago Associates that was later bought out by a larger firm .
It 's also worth noting that if you examine a larger group of senior Obama administration appointees , you 'll find that more than one in four have experience as business executives , according to a June study by National Journal .
That compared with the 38 percent the magazine found eight years earlier at the start of George W. Bush 's administration .
That 's at least three times higher than the level claimed by Beck .
We tracked down Cembalest to ask about his methodology .
He said any effort to address the topic is heavily subjective , and he expressed regret that his work had been used for political ends , saying that it was not his intention to provide fodder for bloggers and talk show hosts .
Cembalest said that he did discount the corporate experience of the three lawyers we identified — Clinton , Vilsack and Locke — and added that he awarded nothing for Donovan , Chu or Salazar , even though we found they had a fair amount private sector experience .
Cembalest acknowledged fault in missing Salazar 's business background , saying he would have given him a full point if he had it to do over again .
But he added that the kind of private - sector experiences Chu and Donovan had ( managing scientific research and handling community development lending , respectively ) did not represent the kind of private - sector business experience he was looking for when doing his study .
" What I was really trying to get at was some kind of completely , 100 percent subjective assessment of whether or not a person had had enough control of payroll , dealing with shareholders , hiring , firing and risk - taking that they'd be in a position to have had a meaningful seat at the table when the issue being discussed is job creation , " Cembalest said .
Cembalest said he has " written 250,000 words in research over the last decade , and every single thing I 've ever done — except this one chart — was empirically based on data from the Federal Reserve " or another official source .
" This is the one time I stepped out into making judgment calls , and I assure you I wo n't do it again .
...
The frightening thing about the Internet is that people copy one chart from what you write and then it goes viral .
So I 've learned a lesson here that these kinds of issues are best left addressed by the people who practice them day in and day out . "
Which brings us back to how Beck used Cembalest 's data .
We 'll acknowledge that rating someone 's degree of private - sector experience is an inexact science , and it's true that Beck accurately relayed the information contained in Cembalest 's chart .
But at PolitiFact we hold people accountable for their own words .
So we rate Beck 's claim False .
I 'm hardly naive about the willingness of politicians to twist the English language to suit their ends , so that tax hikes become " revenue enhancement " and cutting Medicare turns into " preserve , protect , and improve . "
But the thoroughly relativistic approach to truth employed by Frank Luntz never fails to take my breath away .
Luntz 's latest memo advising Republicans on how to fight financial reform , obtained by Sam Stein , is a classic of the genre .
The unstated argument of the memo is that , being determined to oppose legislation that most Americans support , Republicans should simply pretend they are arguing against something completely different .
Luntz makes it clear that the public demands reform .
" You must be on the side on change , " he writes .
" Always . "
( There is no pretense anywhere in Luntz 's paper that Republicans do , or even should , have a reform plan of their own . )
He likewise insists Republicans never call the reform bill " reform " : " It 's not ' reform . '
This is not a reform bill .
It is the ' Stop the Big Bank Bailout bill . "
Of course , Luntz does not try to explain why the reform bill is not reform .
Indeed , his paper is entitled , " The Language of Financial Reform . "
It calls to mind the French absurdist Rene Magritte 's painting of a pipe , labeled , " This is not a pipe . "
That painting , incidentally , was apparently a favorite of the postmodernist philosopher Michel Foucault , who would probably appreciate Luntz 's postmodern approach to truth .
Luntz 's implicit advice is , if you 're caught defending an unpopular position , simply pretend it 's the opposite .
Here is a sample of the argument Luntz urges :
An astronomer at Lowell Observatory studies how stars form in tiny , " dwarf " galaxies , which may provide insight into the birth of the first starts after the Big Bang .
Here , a color - enhanced optical image of the galaxy DDO 87 in the constellation Ursa Major that shows the stars .
This Behind the Scenes article was provided to LiveScience in partnership with the National Science Foundation .
When you picture a galaxy in your mind 's eye , it 's often a spiral with magnificent structure — long , swirling , milky - white arms of stars and gas .
Lowell Observatory astronomer Deidre Hunter has spent most the last 17 years methodically studying unfamiliar galaxies that you might not expect — small , diffuse galaxies : the dwarf irregulars — to learn all she can about star formation and what it can tell her and her colleagues about the birth of the first stars after the Big Bang .
In an NSF - funded project called LITTLE THINGS — for Local Irregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes ( LITTLE ) and The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey ( THINGS ) —
Hunter 's team is mapping the gasses in these diffuse , enigmatic galaxies to discern the many processes of star formation .
" Star formation in dwarfs today is similar to star formation right after the Big Bang , " Hunter said .
" Stars form out of clouds of gas .
Our quest is to figure out what the molecular clouds in these irregular galaxies are , and the processes that form stars . "
The LITTLE THINGS team is closely studying 41 dwarf - irregular galaxies through the lens of numerous data sets .
And the galaxies are small , relatively speaking .
One , DDO 75 , has 1/3500 the mass of the Milky Way .
Another , Leo T , was recently discovered in the Local Group of galaxies , the closest neighbors to our own Milky Way .
" Leo T is comparable in brightness to a large star cluster that contains several million stars ; in contrast , the Milky Way contains about 300 billion stars , " Hunter said .
Some of the galaxies in our sample area are not much brighter than a large star cluster . "
The process of star formation is very inefficient .
Some 50 to 90 percent of the gas present in star - forming molecular clouds , including the gas in the tiny irregular galaxies , remains after stars form .
" This produces the nebulae , " Hunter said .
" They are like signposts that say , ' massive stars are found here . '
In a general sense it 's like weather clouds on Earth .
You need these molecular clouds that form out of the ubiquitous atomic hydrogen gas to precipitate stars . "
Hunter added that there are probably multiple processes going on , which adds to the complexity and time - intensive nature of the LITTLE THINGS study .
In the dwarf galaxies , there 's star - induced star formation .
There 's also turbulence .
" It 's not just density , but also the motions of the gas , " Hunter says .
The data sets Hunter and her colleagues are using include optical - wavelength data Hunter already collected and analyzed using research telescopes at Lowell ’s Anderson Mesa facility near Flagstaff .
But some of the new , key data is in radio wavelengths , and they come from NSF 's Very Large Array ( VLA ) located west of Socorro , New Mexico .
In May of 2007 , Hunter was invited to give a talk at the VLA .
Afterwards , a scientist with the facility suggested she put in a large proposal , that is , a proposal for a large amount of VLA telescope time .
She and her team had been unsuccessful in previous smaller requests for the needed hours , but this time , the team was rewarded : about 400 hours to study a subsample of dwarf galaxies that represent a range of characteristics .
One of Hunter 's collaborators , Lowell predoctoral student Megan Jackson , is looking at the motions of the stars , their velocities , and their rotation .
Fellow Lowell predoc Hongxin
Zhang is looking closely at existing ultraviolet and optical data sets from the galaxies , helping define their star - formation histories .
Zhang has been limited with his current sets of infrared data , so he is embarking on an observing program using a special instrument called Mimir attached to the 1.8 - meter Perkins Telescope at Anderson Mesa , also at Lowell .
The Perkins is operated through a partnership with Boston University , and Mimir is a powerful , $ 2.5 - millon infrared instrument built by a team led by Dan Clemens of Boston University .
As for the massive amount of VLA radio data , much has to be collected , sorted , and analyzed .
Kim Herrmann , a Lowell Observatory postdoctoral fellow , is part of the LITTLE THINGS team and she is reducing the VLA data .
" When Kim came to Flagstaff , she had never dealt with radio interferometric data , " Hunter said .
" But she quickly came up to speed and has now become a local expert .
She has calibrated more LITTLE THINGS data than any other person on the team , and she is exactly the kind of person we need on the team .
Right now , we 're in this grunge phase of the project ; it is very tedious .
If all goes well , and I 'm not distracted by other tasks , it takes me one month per galaxy to reduce the VLA data . "
The extensive data are poised to re-shape astronomers ' understanding of star formation .
" The crux of the problem is that the standard models for galaxies do n't work for dwarfs .
Dwarfs should not be forming stars at all . "
But indeed they are .
They are forming stars even at their outer edges .
The little - understood portions of dwarf irregular galaxies are what intrigue Hunter most of all .
" It 's the outer disks — because they are so extreme , " she said .
" These are such extreme environments that they are very stringent tests for star formation . "

The advertising watchdog has banned a radio ad for implying that all Germans are " tyrannical " .
The radio campaign , for recruitment firm Reed Online , featured a man speaking to his boss , who responded in German in loud , staccato bursts evocative of the speeches of Adolf Hitler .
At the end of the 30 - second ad a voiceover ran : " Boss a bit of a tyrant ?
Find your perfect boss on the UK 's biggest job site . "
The Advertising Standards Authority received 13 complaints that the ad was offensive to Germans because it used an outdated stereotype and implied that all Germans were tyrants .
Reed Online did not comment on the complaints when asked to do so by the ASA .
The Radio Advertising Clearance Centre , which clears ads before they are aired , believed most listeners would regard the scenario as humorous and inoffensive .
Although the RACC did not refer to Hitler by name , it said that the character was a generic " German - sounding orator " .
The ASA said that stereotypes were inevitable in a short radio ad , but that these should not perpetuate damaging misconceptions .
It said that the humour in the ad , by agency Contagious , was " derived from a stereotype at the expense of German people " .
" We considered that the portrayal suggested that German people were more likely to be unreasonable or aggressive to others , " the ASA added .
" We concluded that , given the extreme reaction and aggressive tone of the German - speaking boss , the ad reinforced a negative and outdated cultural stereotype of German people as overpowering and tyrannical and therefore the ad had the potential to cause serious offence to some listeners " .
The ASA banned the ad .

Nearly a year ago , Zero Hedge first brought broad public attention to the nebulous aspects of the dark and dirty underworld of the market , exposing the " second - tier " of privileged market participants , consisting of quant traders , high frequency trading , flash trading , sponsored access , co-location , latency arbitrage , Morgan Stanley 's discussed - below PDT operation , and many other topics ( check our Glossary for much more ) .
In April , Zero Hedge wrote an open letter to the quant community , pleading for more transparency absent which the eventual result would be " larger , systematic problems at the largest , most sophisticated quant managers . "
Since April , the impact of market neutral quants has progressively declined , as factors , one after another , have failed , and market neutral indexes are probing multiyear lows ( HSKAX ) .
The question of who has stepped in to replace the whales ' liquidity provisioning is still unanswered , although the explosion of small , inexperienced 3 man quant shops consisting of a math Ph.D. and two programmers , may be part of the answer .
The integration of Goldman within the structure of the NYSE and other exchanges , may be another : at last check , Goldman is still a key component of the NYSE 's SLP program , regarding which there is still barely any information , despite promises by NYSE representatives to the contrary ( and with Goldman 's prop operation potentially terminally crippled , the question of how extensively intertwined prop trading is with liquidity provisioning , will be a major topic going forward ) .
Today , the WSJ's Scott Patterson takes advantage of the recent furor over quants and in extensive article promotes his new book " The Quants " in which " he suggests how this new breed of mathematicians and computer scientists took over much of the financial system — and the damage they inflicted in the 2007 meltdown . "
We are glad that , after nearly a year of writing about it , the topic of the market systemic threat presented by a small subcommunity of quantitative traders is finally emerging on the mainstream scene .
We present Scott 's article in totality .
We expect nothing less than the traditional choir of defenders of this increasingly more dangerous and stigmatized practice to emerge in full force .
We , as always , welcome their conflicted perspectives .
The Minds Behing the Meltdown
How a swashbuckling breed of mathematicians and computer scientists nearly destroyed Wall Street
By SCOTT PATTERSON
On Thursday , President Barack Obama proposed new rules to curb a number of Wall Street 's risky — and highly profitable — trading activities .
One target :
The secretive trading operations within banks that use large doses of leverage , or borrowed money , to make huge bets on the market .
Wall Street says the regulations are unnecessary , and since the financial crisis struck , most banks have cut back on these trading outfits .
But when the downturn first hit in the summer of 2007 , several of them were among the first to suffer , and collectively they lost billions over a matter of days .
A small group of brainy math whizzes are emerging as the unlikely group who nearly brought down the finance industry .
As WSJ's Scott Patterson reports , a group called " The Quants " developed complex systems to trade securities such as mortgage derivatives , which were at the heart of the crisis .
In his new book , " The Quants , " Wall Street Journal reporter Scott Patterson suggests how this new breed of mathematicians and computer scientists took over much of the financial system — and the damage they inflicted in the 2007 meltdown .
At Morgan Stanley 's investing powerhouse Process Driven Trading on Monday , Aug. 6 , founder Peter Muller was AWOL , visiting a friend near Boston .
Mike Reed and Amy Wong manned the helm , PDT veterans from the days when the group was nothing more than a thought experiment , its traders a small band of young math whizzes tinkering with computers like brainy teenagers in a cluttered garage .
On Wall Street , they were all known as " quants , " traders and financial engineers who used brain - twisting math and superpowered computers to pluck billions in fleeting dollars out of the market .
Instead of looking at individual companies and their performance , management and competitors , they use math formulas to make bets on which stocks were going up or down .
By the early 2000s , such tech - savvy investors had come to dominate Wall Street , helped by theoretical breakthroughs in the application of mathematics to financial markets , advances that had earned their discoverers several shelves of Nobel Prizes .
PDT , one of the most secretive quant funds around , was now a global powerhouse , with offices in London and Tokyo and about $ 6 billion in assets ( the amount could change daily depending on how much money Morgan funneled its way ) .
It was a well - oiled machine that did little but print money , day after day .
That week , however , PDT would n't print money — it would destroy it like an industrial shredder .
The unusual behavior of stocks that PDT tracked had begun sometime in mid-July and had gotten worse in the first days of August .
The previous Friday , about half a dozen of the biggest gainers on the Nasdaq were stocks that PDT had sold short , expecting them to decline , and several of the biggest losers were stocks PDT had bought , expecting them to rise .
It was Bizarro World for quants .
Up was down , down was up .
The models were operating in reverse .
The market moves PDT and other quant funds started to see early that week defied logic .
The fine - tuned models , the bell curves and random walks , the calibrated correlations — all the math and science that had propelled the quants to the pinnacle of Wall Street — could n't capture what was happening .
At the time , few quants realized what was happening , but over the next few days a theory would emerge :
The U.S. housing market was unraveling , leading to big losses in the mortgage portfolios of banks and hedge funds .
One or more of those hedge funds needed to raise cash quickly to make up for the losses , and needed to sell assets quickly to do so .
And the easiest - to - sell assets of all were stocks , those held in portfolios highly similar to quant funds across Wall Street .
The Quants
The result was a catastrophic domino effect .
The rapid selling scrambled the models that quants used to buy and sell stocks , forcing them to unload their own holdings .
By early August , the selling had taken on a life of its own , leading to billions in losses .
The meltdown also revealed dangerous links in the financial system few had previously realized — that losses in the U.S. housing market could trigger losses in huge stock portfolios that had nothing to do with housing .
It was utter chaos driven by pure fear .
Nothing like it had ever been seen before .
This was n't supposed to happen !
The quants did their best to contain the damage , but they were like firefighters trying to douse a raging inferno with gasoline — the more they tried to fight the flames by selling , the worse the selling became .
Quant funds everywhere were scrambling to figure out what was going on .
Tuesday , the downturn accelerated .
Applied Quantitative Research , the Greenwich , Conn . - based quant fund giant run by former Goldman Sachs Group whiz Cliff Asness , booked rooms at the nearby Delamar on Greenwich Harbor , a luxury hotel , so they could be available around the clock for stressed - out , sleep - deprived quants .
Authorities , meanwhile , had little idea about the massive losses taking place across Wall Street .
That Tuesday afternoon , the Federal Reserve said it had decided to leave short - term interest rates alone at 5.25 % .
Investors on Main Street had little idea that a historic blowup was occurring on Wall Street .
AQR risk - management guru Aaron Brown had to laugh watching commentators on CNBC discuss in bewilderment the strange moves stocks were making , with no idea about what was behind the volatility .
Truth was , Mr. Brown realized , the quants themselves were still trying to figure it out .
Mr. Brown , who had joined AQR earlier that year , had been trying to get up to speed on the fund 's systems to help manage its risk .
He 'd decided to stay in the office that Tuesday night and sleep on a small couch near his desk .
He was n't the only one .
Near midnight , he stepped out of his office , eyes bloodshot from peering at numbers on a computer screen for the past 20 hours .
The office was buzzing with activity , dozens of haggard quants chugging coffee , iPods plugged into their ears as they punched frantically on keyboards , unwinding the fund 's positions in markets around the globe .
It was a strange sight .
The office was nearly as busy as it was during the day , but it was pitch black outside .
The carnage revealed a dangerous lack of transparency in the market .
No one knew which fund was behind the meltdown .
Nervous managers traded rumors by email and phone in a frantic hunt for patient zero , the sickly hedge fund that had triggered the contagion .
Many were fingering Goldman Sachs 's Global Alpha , the quant fund founded by Mr. Asness in the 1990s that had grown to massive proportions .
But no one knew for sure .
At PDT on Tuesday , Mr. Muller kept ringing up managers , trying to gauge who was selling and who was n't .
But few were talking .
In ways , Mr. Muller thought , it was like poker .
No one knew who was holding what .
Some might be bluffing , putting on a brave face while massively dumping positions .
Some might be holding out , hoping to ride through the storm .
And the decision facing Mr. Muller was the same one he confronted all the time at the poker table , but on a much larger order of magnitude : whether to throw in more chips and hope for the best or to fold his hand and walk away .
As conditions spun out of control , Mr. Muller was updating Morgan 's top brass .
He wanted to know how much damage was acceptable .
But his chiefs would n't give him a number .
They did n't understand all of the nuts and bolts of how PDT worked .
Mr. Muller had kept its positions and strategy so secret over the years that few people in the firm had any inkling about how PDT made money .
They knew it was profitable almost all the time .
That was all that mattered .
That meant it was Mr. Muller 's call .
By Wednesday morning , he 'd already decided .
It was time to sell .
Walking downtown on Broadway that morning to Morgan Stanley 's office through thick , sweaty crowds , Mr. Muller was growing impatient .
Traffic in midtown Manhattan was jammed up like he'd never seen before .
People swarmed the sidewalks , not just the usual tourists but businessmen in suits , nearly everyone jabbering frantically on their cell phones .
He 'd just left his spacious apartment , located at the southwest corner of Central Park and 14 blocks north of Morgan 's headquarters .
There was no time to waste .
The market would be opening soon .
And he was worried the meltdown would continue .
Even nature seemed to be conspiring against him .
Earlier that morning , a tornado had struck the city , hitting land shortly before the morning commute in New York City began in earnest .
As quickly as the storm had rushed in , it cleared away , swirling into the Atlantic .
At Morgan 's headquarters , Mr. Muller flew into the trading room .
He flicked on his rank of computers with access to data on nearly every tradable security in the world .
After a quick check of the market action , he checked PDT 's internal gauge of gains and losses .
It was bad .
This was the most brutal market Mr. Muller had ever seen .
The U.S. housing market was melting down , causing huge losses at banks and hedge funds around the world .
Stock markets were in turmoil .
Panic was spreading .
The entire system started to seize up as the delicate , finely wrought creations of the quants spun out of control .
PDT executed Mr. Muller 's command that morning , dumping positions aggressively .
And it kept getting killed .
Every other quant fund was selling in a panicked rush for the exits .
That Wednesday , what had started as a series of bizarre , unexplainable glitches in quant models turned into a catastrophic meltdown the likes of which had never been seen before in the history of financial markets .
Nearly every single quantitative strategy , thought to be the most sophisticated investing ideas in the world , was shredded to pieces , leading to billions in losses .
It was deleveraging gone supernova .
Oddly , the Bizarro World of quant trading largely masked the losses to the outside world at first .
Since the stocks they 'd shorted were rising rapidly , leading to the appearance of gains on the broader market , that balanced out the diving stocks the quants had expected to rise .
Monday , the Dow industrials actually gained 287 points .
It gained 36 more points Tuesday , and another 154 points Wednesday .
Everyday investors had no insight into the carnage taking place beneath the surface , the billions in hedge fund money evaporating .
Of course , there was plenty of evidence that something was seriously amiss .
Heavily shorted stocks were zooming higher for no logical reason .
Vonage Holdings , a telecom stock that had dropped 85 % in the previous year , shot up 10 % in a single day on zero news .
Online retailer Overstock.com ; Taser International , maker of stun guns ; the home building giant Beazer Homes USA ; and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts — all favorites among short sellers — rose sharply even as the rest of the market tanked .
From a fundamentals perspective , it made no sense .
In an economic downturn , risky stocks such as Taser and Krispy Kreme would surely suffer .
Beazer was obviously on the ropes due to the housing downturn .
But a vicious market - wide short squeeze was causing the stocks to surge .
The huge gains in those shorted stocks created an optical illusion : the market seemed to be rising , even as its pillars were crumbling beneath it .
There was a deceptive lull soon after lunchtime .
But as the closing bell neared in the afternoon , the carnage resumed .
Mom - and - pop investors watching the market make wild swings wondered what was going on .
They had no way of knowing about the massive computer power and decades of quant strategies that were behind the chaos making a hash of their 401 ( k ) s and mutual funds .
A source of the extreme damage Wednesday and the following day was the absence of some high - frequency statistical arbitrage traders , firms that use high - powered computers to trade rapidly in and out of stocks and can act as liquidity providers for the market .
As investors tried to unload their positions , the high - frequency funds were n't there to buy them — they were selling , too .
The result was a black hole of no liquidity whatsoever .
Prices collapsed .
By the end of the day on Wednesday , PDT had lost nearly $ 300 million — just that day .
PDT , it seemed , was going up in smoke .
Other funds were seeing even bigger losses .
Goldman 's Global Alpha was down nearly 16 % for the month , a loss of about $ 1.5 billion .
AQR had lost about $ 500 million that Wednesday alone , its biggest one - day loss ever .
It was the fastest money meltdown Mr. Asness had ever seen .
He was well aware that if it continued for much longer , AQR would be roadkill .
And there was nothing he could do to stop it .
Or so it seemed .
SPRINGFIELD – Smith & Wesson 's vice president of sales and 21 other executives from various arms and military products suppliers are accused of offering bribes to an African government in hopes of getting portions of a total of $ 15 million in business , according to the U.S. Department of Justice .
Only the " officials " that Amaro Goncalves , 49 , is accused of meeting with at a bar in Washington 's Ritz - Carlton Hotel on two occasions were really undercover FBI agents , the justice department said Tuesday .
It was a government sting operation , the largest in the history of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , according to the department .
Federal agents were working on the investigation for more than two years .
The investigation also involved the sale of other police and military equipment including machine guns and bulletproof vests .
Smith & Wesson was not named in the indictment .
Smith & Wesson also did not return calls and e-mails for comment Tuesday .
Most of the 21 defendants , including Goncalves , were arrested Monday in Las Vegas while attending the firearms industry ’s annual Shooting , Hunting , Outdoor Trade Show and Conference .
They are all charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act and conspiracy to launder money .
The maximum sentence for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act is five years in federal prison .
The maximum sentences for conspiracy to launder money is 20 years .
Arraignments are expected to be in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas .
According to the indictment , the 22 defendants created two price quotations for the unnamed African country that was supposedly looking to outfit its presidential guard .
One price quotation had the real price of the goods and one had an illegal 20 percent “ commission ” added , 10 percent for the purchasing agent ( FBI agent ) and 10 percent for the country ’s minister of defense .
Goncalves arranged the test sale of 25 handguns to the African country for $ 12,495 in June and paid the 20 percent “ commission , ” the indictment stated .
Meanwhile , the government paid Smith & Wesson for the guns and stored them in Virginia .
In October , Goncalves met again with an FBI agent who was pretending to represent the minister of defense , prosecutors said .
The undercover agent told Goncalves that the minister was happy with the pistols and with his bribe .
Goncalves is accused of striking a deal at that time for another 1,800 pistols , according to the indictment .
Federal indictments in the case were unsealed Tuesday in Washington .
Also charged are executives and employees at companies in Arkansas , Virginia , Florida , California , Georgia , Pennsylvania and Kentucky .
Executives at companies in the United Kingdom and Israel also were indicted , according to The Associated Press .
So you thought the advertising industry had reached its lowest low with last month ’s Super Bowl Misogynfest ?
Yeah , us too , but it turns out it ’s not over yet .
Advertising ’s latest trend ?
Blow jobs .
Exhibit A : Durex
Where to start ?
Well , first of all , the word choice here tips us off to a few things :
Men are controlled by their erections , and women are made up of fruits and contentment and everything nice ( oh , and we love giving head ) .
Now , there ’s absolutely nothing wrong with some good ol ’ fashioned consensual oral sex , but this ad is taking a consensual act and de-leveling ( un- leveling ? ) the playing field by attempting to provide us with the subjects ’ innermost thoughts .
Now we can see , even if things look pretty equal , that the woman ’s “ luscious and dainty ” brain is inferior to the man ’s “ judgment and knowledge ” ( located in his crotch ) .
Um , at least they ’re using a condom ?
Exhibit B : France ’s Anti-Smoking Ad
As Melissa at Shakesville points out , this ad is more than just a misguided attempt to equate smoking with oral sex – it is also a depiction of blatant sexual assault .
The models ( clearly quite young , so we ’re looking at statutory rape here at best ) are being told by the text that smoking turns you into a slave .
Presumably in the same way that they are depicted as “ sex slaves ” in this image ?
Gérard Audureau , the president of Droits des Non-fumeurs ( creator of the campaign ) , defends the ad by saying , “ Using sex is a way to get [ young people ’s ] attention .
And if it ’s necessary to shock , let ’s shock . ”
This image goes way beyond “ shock , ” and when it comes to young people ( or any people ) , forced oral sex should not be used as a scare tactic .
Exhibit C : Canadian Council for for Israel and Jewish Advocacy
Girl : Uhhh …
Boy : What ?
G : Do n’t be mad …
It ’s just that it ’s small …
B : Small ?!
G : I do n’t know if I can go there .
B : I consider this a spot of worship .
It may be small , but it ’s brought the driest places to life .
Baby , this is paradise .
[ camera pans to show map of Israel and tourist guidebooks covering boy ’s crotch ] .
G : OK , but if I go down there for you , you have to promise you ’ll down south for me next winter .
Hey potential male tourists !
Traveling to Israel is just as good as getting a blow job !
And you wo n’t even have to go down on your girlfriend until next winter !
Jokes about oral sex on small penises are always hilarious , especially when they ’re used to promote potentially life - changing spiritual pilgrimages .
Blow Job Wrap Up :
OK , so we might not be looking at a future where all advertising will feature blow jobs .
But !
Three recent campaigns are choosing to take the blow - jobs - are - edgy - and - will - get - us - attention route , and that is three to many judging from the ways in which they ’ve gone about it .
Sexism ?
Check .
Grotesque depiction of sexual assault ?
Check .
Schlocky jokes about small penises and the horrors of cunnilingus ?
Check .
Focusing on male sexual satisfaction only ?
Check .
( Although , to be fair , the Durex campaign includes an image of the couple having penetrative sex where the woman is having an orgasm , but the focus is still on the guy ’s junk . )
Let ’s keep our fingers crossed that these ads all coming to our attention at the same time is just a coincidence , and not evidence of a new and unwelcome trend in “ sexy ” advertising .
Because that would really suck .
Tony Blair was so depressed after the Iraq war that the then - British prime minister told Gordon Brown he would quit the following summer , only to renege on his pledge , a British newspaper report says .
The physical and mental stress on Mr Blair was so profound that he confided to friends he " spaced out " several times during his weekly session of parliamentary questions , according to a new book serialised in The Observer .
The End of the Party , by political journalist Andrew Rawnsley , claims Mr Blair was haunted by the chaos and bloodshed in Iraq , coupled with the constant pressure from Mr Brown , the - then finance minister , to step aside .
Mr Rawnsley claims
Mr Blair was able to hide his depression from the public and most of his staff , but privately he decided to bow to Mr Brown 's wishes and hand over to him midway through his second term .
But Mr Blair , who was former US president George W Bush 's staunchest ally in the 2003 US - led invasion of Iraq , went on to lead his Labour Party to victory in the 2005 general election and only stood down as prime minister two years later .
The book says Mr Blair , in his darkest days , made clear at a dinner with both Mr Brown and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott in November 2003 , as well as later in a telephone call to Mr Prescott in spring 2004 , that he would step aside .
Sally Morgan , Mr Blair 's director of government relations , told Mr Rawnsley : " Iraq was a quicksand swallowing him up .
The atrocities .
Those terrible photos [ of abuse of prisoners at the US - run Abu Ghraib jail ] . "
" And he started losing people who had supported him throughout .
He was stuck in this long dark tunnel and could see no way out of it . "
The book relates how Mr Blair 's special envoy in Iraq , the former UN ambassador Jeremy Greenstock , briefed Mr Blair at the end of his service in Baghdad .
Mr Rawnsley says Mr Greenstock knew that his " very gloomy assessment " had made him highly unpopular in Mr Blair 's offices and some officials had tried to keep him away , fearing the impact on the prime minister 's already depressed morale .
The book claims that when Mr Greenstock warned Mr Blair that the situation looked " unbelievably bad " and would become more desperate in the months to come , Mr Blair pleaded : " What can we do ? "
He is also said to have asked : " We have told them [ the Americans ] again and again what we think is necessary .
If it does n't happen , what can we do ? "
Mr Greenstock was left with the image of the prime minister " tearing his hair " over Iraq and " throwing his hands in the air " , Mr Rawnsley writes .
But Mr Blair then apparently regained his self belief and , encouraged by his wife Cherie , decided to fight on , to the immense anger of Mr Brown .
Rawnsley claims Mr Brown went to Mr Blair 's Downing Street office to confront his rival .
One of Mr Blair 's inner circle who witnessed the showdown told Mr Rawnsley : " Gordon was just losing it .
He was behaving like a belligerent teenager .
Just standing in the office shouting : ' When are you going to f*** ing go ? ' "
In last week 's excerpts from the book , Mr Rawnsley claimed that once Mr Brown became prime minister he had to be warned by the top civil servant about his intimidating behaviour towards staff .

With the exception of James Dean , who made only three films , there might be no pop-culture icon who has done more with less than the late Jimi Hendrix .
The ultimate guitar hero released just three studio albums before his death in 1970 , but new generations of music fans keep plugging into his amplified legacy .
The volume of Hendrix ’s music is about to get turned up .
Today , the Hendrix estate and Sony Music Entertainment will announce the March 9 release of a “ new ” Hendrix album , “ Valleys of Neptune , ” which will feature a dozen unreleased recordings .
The late star ’s sister , Janie Hendrix , calls the material a “ major revelation ” about her brother ’s musical directions at the time of his death , but the project and Sony ’s intense interest in it also reveal plenty about the modern music marketplace -- namely that proven stars of the past , even the dead ones , are growing more important to an industry facing an uncertain future .
At last week ’s massive 2010 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , Sony chairman and chief executive Howard Stringer opened his company ’s presentation by talking about Sony ’s Legacy Recordings and its licensing agreement with Experience Hendrix , the Seattle - based company that acts as steward of the estate .
That partnership was first announced last summer , but today marks the real rollout of Sony ’s venture into the Hendrix vault .
The company also will re-release familiar Hendrix albums bundled with new DVD documentaries , take the star into the online sector aggressively and look for synergy opportunities with the biennial Hendrix all - star tribute tour that begins its national run March 4 in Santa Barbara .
“ It ’s an auspicious start in fulfilling a shared vision for the Jimi Hendrix catalog going forward , ” Legacy general manager Adam Block said .
Perhaps , but it also offers insight into the mind set at the major record labels .
There was a major scramble among Sony ’s rivals to land the Hendrix deal for the simple reason that icons of the past are viewed as a particularly good investment at a time when CD sales of new music are in continued decline and up - and - coming acts represent limited upside amid the shifting profit realities of the digital - download era .
In other words , the rewind button looks like a safer bet these days .
Nostalgia sells
Warner Music Group has undertaken a major Frank Sinatra revival that is both archival -- with the release of vintage recordings -- and entrepreneurial with new ventures in advertising , film and perhaps a Las Vegas casino .
Michael Jackson was the bestselling artist of last year ( 8.2 million albums sold in the U.S. alone ) , and the Beatles came in third ( 3.3 million ) ; country crossover singer Taylor Swift finished between the two with music that was actually recorded in this century .
The Fab Four also hit the video game market with their Rock Band game , the latest of their seemingly seasonal encores as a pop-culture force .
And now , Hendrix is warming up as a 21st century enterprise .
Born in Seattle in 1942 , Johnny Allen Hendrix would take on a persona that matched his trippy guitar feedback .
His persona -- part gypsy mystic / part cosmic visitor -- made him seem somehow both earthy and otherworldly , a combination that made him a touchstone figure for a tie - dyed generation .
When he set his guitar on fire on stage in 1967 at the Monterey International Pop Festival he truly ignited his career .
The Jimi Hendrix Experience recorded signature 1960s tracks such as “ Purple Haze ” and “ Foxey Lady , ” but their frontman ’s fashion influence and guitar innovations made him greater than the sum of those hits .
Hendrix died in London after a night of barbiturate use in September 1970 .
He was 27 and had no will .
His estate , which is now valued somewhere north of $ 80 million , was caught up in legal battles for years ; initially , control went to his father , Al Hendrix , but over the next decade he ceded it to others with results that left Hendrix devotees grumbling .
Power struggle
Eventually , Al Hendrix wrested control back , leading to the 1995 creation of Experience Hendrix , but his 2002 death led to more court conflicts .
Janie , the half - sister of Jimi , emerged as the victor when the dust settled in 2008 .
She says that now , finally , the obstacles have been cleared and “ Valleys of Neptune ” is part of a major cache of material that will be tapped .
“ There are things that were acquired through the years , both music and film footage and home recordings , or things that were left behind by the old administration not taking care of things , ” she said .
“ We have material for a decade ’s worth [ of new releases ] . ”
Janie Hendrix added that “ Neptune ” has some familiar songs -- die - hard fans might have heard some of these tracks on various bootleg recordings that have turned up over the years -- but these versions are startling .
“ It sounds , ” she said , “ like Jimi could have recorded them yesterday . ”
Any new release will face withering inspection from Hendrix scholars .
One of them , Charles R. Cross , author of the acclaimed 2005 Hendrix biography “ Room Full of Mirrors ” and an occasional critic of the Hendrix estate , said the track listing comes with the promise of pristine presentations of long - muddied material .
“ With so many different ‘ official ’ albums so far and hundreds of bootlegs , very little Hendrix is truly ‘ unheard ’ or ‘ unreleased ’ these days , ” Cross said Sunday .
“ But to listen to some of Jimi ’s final Experience recordings in their original versions , with quality remastering , is enough to get any Hendrix fan excited , particularly when the songs are as good as ‘ Hear My Train , ’ one of Jimi ’s best - ever tracks . ”
South African native Eddie Kramer was the lead producer on the album , and he was also the engineer in the studio with Hendrix during the original sessions .
Kramer spent months using vintage analog approaches and the latest digital tools to excavate the material .
“ I felt like an archaeologist using a brush who finds , underneath the dust , this marvelous gold artifact , ” he said .
‘ A new direction ’
Kramer said the music of “ Neptune ” comes primarily from 1969 , a time of “ both frustration and real excitement ” for Hendrix as he pushed his way toward “ a new direction . ”
The guitarist had brought in an old friend , bassist Billy Cox , to play on some of the tracks ; on Friday , Cox , now living in Nashville , said he is giddy at the prospect of hearing the results of his work with Hendrix .
“ I can tell you that Jimi was on his way to a powerful new thing , a new direction completely , he was going back to his roots and he wanted a sound with more soul , ” said Cox , later in Hendrix ’s Band of Gypsys .
“ Who can say where it would have led him if he had n’t died ? ”
Cox chuckled when asked about the sway Hendrix has on young rock fans and new generations of artists .
People who were born after Hendrix was buried seem to view him as a wizard who was n’t quite real .
“ Jimi was a complete original and a visionary , ” Cox said .
“ Every 10 years a new generation finds him .
There are only two kinds of guitarists in the world .
The ones who talk about how they were influenced by Jimi Hendrix and those who were influenced by Jimi Hendrix but wo n’t admit it . ”

Washington ( CNN ) --
The Obama administration raised the stakes in the health care debate Monday , releasing a new blueprint that seeks to bridge the gap between measures passed by the Senate and House of Representatives last year .
If enacted , the president 's sweeping compromise plan would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid more than four decades ago .
The White House said it would extend coverage to 31 million Americans .
Among other things , the White House said it would expand Medicare prescription drug coverage , increase federal subsidies to help people buy insurance and give the federal government new authority to block excessive rate hikes by health insurance companies .
It increases the threshold -- relative to the Senate bill -- under which a tax on high - end health insurance plans would kick in .
As with both the House and Senate plans , it includes significant reductions in Medicare spending in part through changes in payments made under the Medicare Advantage program .
President Obama 's plan does not include a government - run public health insurance option , an idea strongly backed by liberal Democrats but fiercely opposed by both Republicans and key Democratic moderates .
It also eliminates a deeply unpopular provision in the Senate bill worked in by Sen.
Ben Nelson , D - Nebraska , that would exempt his Midwestern state from paying increased Medicaid expenses .
Administration officials said Obama 's measure would cut the deficit by $ 100 billion over the next 10 years .
They estimate the total cost of the bill to be $ 950 billion in the next decade .
The Senate bill would cost an estimated $ 871 billion , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , while the more expansive House plan has been estimated to cost more than $ 1 trillion .
The release of Obama 's plan sets the stage for a critical televised health care summit Thursday with top congressional Republicans .
The White House is trying to pressure GOP leaders to present a detailed alternative proposal in advance of the meeting .
" We view this as the opening bid for the health meeting " on Thursday , White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer told reporters .
" We took our best shot at bridging the differences " between the House and Senate bills .
" It is our hope the Republicans will come together around [ their ] plan and post it online " before the meeting .
President 's health care blueprint
Pfeiffer said Obama will come to Thursday 's meeting " with an open mind . "
The president 's willing to back decent Republican ideas if the two sides can have an " honest , open , substantive discussion " in which " both parties can get off their talking points , " he said .
GOP leaders have indicated they will attend the meeting but have urged Democrats to scrap the Senate and House bills completely .
They characterized Obama 's proposal Monday as setting the stage for a meeting that will amount to little more than political posturing .
" The president has crippled the credibility of this week 's summit by proposing the same massive government takeover of health care based on a partisan bill the American people have already rejected , " said House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio .
" This new Democrats - only backroom deal doubles down on the same failed approach that will drive up premiums , destroy jobs , raise taxes and slash Medicare benefits .
This week 's summit clearly has all the makings of a Democratic infomercial . "
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Kentucky , released a statement calling the plan " disappointing that Democrats in Washington either are n't listening or are completely ignoring what Americans across the country have been saying . "
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs dismissed the GOP criticisms , arguing that Republican leaders had asked for this week 's meeting for months .
" If they 're not the party of no , Thursday 's the perfect venue to be the party of yes , " Gibbs said .
Highlights of Obama 's proposal
Under Obama 's plan :
• The health and human services secretary would work with a seven - member board of doctors , economists and consumer and insurance representatives to review premium hikes .
This Health Insurance Rate Authority would provide an annual report to recommend to states whether certain rate increases should be approved , although the secretary could overrule state insurance regulators .
• New health insurance subsidies would be provided to families of four making up to $ 88,000 annually , or 400 percent of the federal poverty level .
Compared with the Senate bill , Obama 's proposal lowers premiums for families making between $ 44,000 and $ 66,000 , according to the White House .
Compared with the House legislation , it lowers premiums for families making between $ 55,000 and $ 88,000 .
• The Medicare prescription drug " doughnut hole " would be closed by 2020 .
Under current law , Medicare stops covering drug costs after a plan and beneficiary have spent more than $ 2,830 on prescription drugs .
It starts paying again after an individual 's out - of - pocket expenses exceed $ 4,550 .
• A 40 percent tax would be imposed on insurance companies providing so - called " Cadillac " health plans valued at more than $ 27,000 for families .
The tax would kick in starting in 2018 for all plans .
In contrast , the Senate bill would apply the tax to plans valued at more than $ 23,000 for families .
The House bill does not include the tax , which labor unions vehemently oppose .
• The federal government would assist states by picking up 100 percent of the costs of expanded Medicaid coverage through 2017 .
The federal government would cover 95 percent of costs for 2018 and 2019 , and 90 percent in the following years .
• Health insurance exchanges would be created to make it easier for small businesses , the self - employed and unemployed to pool resources and purchase less expensive coverage .
• Total out - of - pocket expenses would be limited , and insurance companies would be prevented from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions .
Insurers would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person 's gender or medical history .
• Individuals under Obama 's plan would be required to purchase coverage or face a fine of up to $ 695 or 2.5 percent of income starting in 2016 , whichever is greater .
The House bill , in contrast , would have imposed a fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual 's income .
The Senate plan would have required a person to buy coverage or face a fine of up to $ 750 or 2 percent of his or her income .
All three plans include a hardship exemption for poorer Americans .
• Companies with more than 50 employees under Obama 's plan would be required to pay a fee of $ 2,000 per worker if the company does not provide coverage and any of that company 's workers receives federal health care subsidies .
The first 30 workers would be subtracted from the payment calculation .
As with the individual requirement , this represents a compromise between the House and Senate plans .
• Some $ 40 billion in tax credits would be established for small businesses to help them provide health care options for their employees .
• States could choose whether to ban abortion coverage in plans offered in the health insurance exchanges .
Individuals purchasing plans through the exchanges would have to pay for abortion coverage out of their own funds .
The White House is following the Senate 's lead .
The stricter House version banned abortion coverage in private policies available in the exchange to people receiving federal subsidies .
• Illegal immigrants would not be allowed to buy health insurance in the health insurance exchanges .
They would be exempted from the individual insurance mandate .
As with abortion , the White House is adopting the Senate 's language .
CNN's Dana Bash , Lisa Desjardins , Kristi Keck , Suzanne Malveaux , Alan Silverleib and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .
Israelis Debate Fallout From Hit Squad Killing of Hamas Leader Israeli security anlaysts surprised by the efficiency of the Dubai authorities .
Feb. 17 , 2010  --
The assassination of Hamas leader Mahmoud al Mabhouh in a Dubai hotel by a well - choreographed team of assassins dominated the Israeli press today .
The revelations that came out of the Dubai police press conference Monday night , particularly the publication of the 11 foreign passports and the surveillance video , has led many Israelis to suspect their own Mossad secret service is behind the killing .
This mounting speculation of Mossad involvement led Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman to , unusually , comment on the reports today .
" There is no reason to think that it was the Israeli Mossad , and not some other intelligence service or country up to some mischief , " Lieberman , asked about the operation and alleged passport subterfuge , told Army Radio .
He brushed aside the concern that the use of British , Irish , French and German passports may damage relations with those countries .
" I think Britain recognises that Israel is a responsible country and that our security activity is conducted according to very clear , cautious and responsible rules of the game .
Therefore we have no cause for concern , " he said speaking about Great Britain in particular where 6 of the 11 forged passports came from .
The Israelis have used foreign passports on operations before and it has got them into trouble .
When Mossad tried to kill Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal in Jordan in 1997 the two assassins used Canadian passports .
Canada was n't happy about that .
In the 1980s British authorities shut down the Mossad station in London when stolen British passports were found in a public telephone booth , and several years ago Mossad agents were arrested in New Zealand trying to steal the identity of New Zealand citizens .
Absolute and Total Shock
The latest operation has also upset the people living in Israel who claim their identities were stolen in the process .
Up to seven Israeli residents have said their identities and names were used in the operation .
Their names and birth details exactly match the passports revealed by the Dubai police .
" I am in absolute and total shock , " said Paul John Kealy , a British and Israeli passport holder living in Kibbutz Nahsholim .
" Since I realized they used my identity and my name , I 've been walking around like a zombie .
I hope that I 'll get answers from somebody ..... one thing is clear to me , I never left the country . "
Steven Hodes , another British passport holder living in Beit Shemesh , was similarly surprised at his purported new career as an assassin .
" It started like a story that made us laugh , but now we do n't know how to take it . "
The Israeli papers share a certain satisfaction with the killing of a leading member of Hamas but it is laced with concern about the apparent exposure of the 11 assassins .
" A tactical operational success , but a strategic failure , " is the evaluation of leading columnist Ben Caspit writing in Wednesday 's edition of the Israeli newspaper Maariv .
Caspit adds : " The publication of their photos and their inclusion in face recognition systems that are already operating in a number of airports may make the bold assassins prisoners in their homeland . "
Correspondents with background in intelligence matters say they have been surprised by the efficiency and competence of the Dubai authorities in tracking the movements of the team .
Ronen Bergman writing in the tabloid Yedioth Aharanot asks , " how did the Dubai police succeed in tying up the loose ends and creating what they describe as a coherent and full picture identifying the assassins in their mode of operation ? "
The ability to process hours of closed - circuit television footage with the movements of the 11 alleged assassins from different locations has impressed Israeli observers .
New Technology Needed
The suspects ' movements and assumed disguises indicate they were aware of Dubai 's extensive surveillance network and the need to take precautions .
But they and their handlers may have underestimated Dubai 's determination and ability to track them and link them to the passports they entered the country with .
The papers have speculated about how it might be possible to defeat the increasingly sophisticated technology available to track and expose Mossad operatives in foreign countries .
The widening introduction of biometric passports with individual face recognition may make it impossible to use stolen documents .
Some correspondents say agents may also need technology to disrupt and block surveillance cameras for future operations , of which few doubt there will be more .
One correspondent , after detailing all the implications of the latest revelations and their serious implications , wonders whether the killing of Mahmoud al Mabhouh was worth it .
testing captions
In Elton John ’s recent interview with Parade , he spoke about his past relationships , fame and drugs .
But it was the statement he made regarding Christianity that has sparked a strong reaction from William Donohue , president of the Catholic League , among others .
Donohue does n’t agree with John , who said “ Jesus was a compassionate , super - intelligent gay man . ”
In a statement to Showbiz Tonight and CNN Donohue says , “ Jesus was certainly compassionate , but to say he was ' super - intelligent ' is to compare the son of God to a successful game - show contestant , ” Donohue added .
“ More seriously , to call Jesus gay is to label him a sexual deviant .
But what else would we expect from a man who previously said , ' From my point of view , I would ban religion completely . ' ”

In October , Iran 's foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , complained to the United Nations that the United States had kidnapped or tried to seize four Iranians , including a man identified only by the last name Ardebili .
Those reports focused on reports that some of the men were nuclear scientists .
Ardebili is believed to be an engineer and arms dealer ; there is no indication that he bought or tried to buy any nuclear - related items , a U.S. official said .
Skeptics United in Time of Need
In times of crisis , organization is needed to provide aid and relief to those in need .
As skeptics , we are often likened to a " herd of cats , " resisting all efforts to gather us into one organized effort .
Some of the time , this may be to our advantage , but when a force needs to be mobilized to render assistance , something more is required .
Haiti is in need of such assistance .
We do n't need to remind you of the ongoing horror that the recent earthquake has brought about , but We do want to tell you about how you can help directly through secular organizations that will provide 100 % of donated money to the Haitian crisis .
The JREF , in association with the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science and other secular and skeptic organizations , is soliciting your help .
James Randi has this to say :
We at the JREF are very proud to be part of the concerted effort to aid Haiti to recover from this catastrophic event .
To my mind , there is nothing more disturbing than hearing the distressed cries of children who are subjected to grief and / or injury , and my personal contribution has already been added to the encouraging total that mounts hour by hour .
Please be generous and help us to reach out to Haitians of all ages , of any and all philosophical orientations . "
JREF President D.J. Grothe adds the following :
We often hear from social commentators and religious leaders that one 's morality must be grounded in belief in the supernatural .
The James Randi Educational Foundation , which promotes critical thinking about the supernatural ( among other topics ) challenges this view .
Responding generously to the need in Haiti is responding to the moral impulse we all feel , regardless our views about the supernatural , and I hope our friends and supporters will come together with us and contribute .
Our groups together have already raised over $ 120,000 at the time of this announcement , and while this is an impressive sum , it is only a fraction of what 's needed .
Please consider donating right now , as the need is urgent . "
Secular people and skeptics are often accused of not being charitable , and this campaign is fine way to demonstrate that nothing could be further from the truth .
Donate to help the people of Haiti here .
Mérida , December 1st 2009 ( Venezuelanalysis.com ) – On Monday , Russia ’s Ambassador to Venezuela , Vladimir Zaemskiy , confirmed that Russia will assist Venezuela with the construction of a factory to produce Kalashnikov AK - 103 assault rifles and will sell fifty - three Mi-17 military helicopters to Venezuela .
The deal is part of an accord that was signed and announced publicly on August 15th of this year .
The ambassador said Venezuela ’s replacement of obsolete military equipment is a “ natural process of any country , ” and assured that “ the military cooperation between Russia and Venezuela is carried out according to the same rules that govern other cases . ”
Moreover , “ the government of Venezuela is being guided by a new concept of national defense ” that “ requires different technologies , and that is what [ Russia ] is offering Venezuela , ” said the ambassador .
The United States , which was Venezuela ’s top military supplier before Russia , stopped selling military equipment and replacement parts to the government of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , which openly opposes U.S. imperialism and advocates the replacement of capitalism with “ 21st Century Socialism . ”
This year , Venezuela stepped up its efforts to prepare for the defense of its territory and natural resources , in response to Colombia ’s attack on a guerrilla encampment in Ecuador in March and its October 30th military pact with the United States , which will allow U.S. military personnel to act with legal immunity on seven Colombian bases and expand military and spy operations across the continent .
Venezuela has purchased $ 4.4 billion worth of Russian military equipment since 2005 , and last September Russia approved a $ 1 billion loan to Venezuela for future arms purchases .
In addition to military cooperation , Venezuela and Russia have created joint companies to exploit oil and build transportation infrastructure in Venezuela ’s Orinoco Oil Belt , and to explore natural gas off the Venezuelan coast .
In June , the two countries created a binational development bank with $ 4 billion at its disposal .
They also discussed the construction of a civilian nuclear power facility in Venezuela with Russian assistance and signed accords to increase Venezuela ’s exports of coffee , cacao , rice , fruit , and other agricultural products to Russia .
On Monday , Zaemskiy also confirmed Russia ’s intention to construct a Russian Lada brand automobile factory in Venezuela sometime next year .

On the Scott Brown US Senate web site - Front page - VOTE ABSENTEE ... " Absentee voting ” also called in the west " Vote by mail " , is a disease moving from West to East .
I too am concerned about the election next Tuesday .
Excerpt from LA TIMES - June 25 , 2006 article on the GOP Voter Vault system
The GOP knows you do n't like anchovies
Unpopular Republicans still own the art of politicking .
By Peter Wallsten and Tom Hamburger FOUR DAYS before this month 's special election in San Diego County to replace imprisoned former Rep. Randy " Duke " Cunningham , Republican strategists back in Washington were worried .
In addition to voter discontent with GOP leadership and the looming shadow of scandal dominating the campaign , Democrats appeared to enjoy yet another advantage : More absentee ballots were being submitted by Democratic voters than by Republicans .
The advantage did not last long .
Jolted to life , the GOP machinery revved into high gear as activists poured into the district .
They scoured the party 's computer database for sympathetic voters who had requested absentee ballots but had not yet submitted them , knocked on their doors and called them on the phone .
Suddenly , thousands of additional votes had been secured , and by election day , the GOP had turned around a costly deficit — with 10,000 more Republicans than Democrats voting absentee .
That final flurry of absentees , along with other forms of voter targeting , contributed to a surprising GOP victory that cut through the heart of the Democrats ' broader 2006 election strategy .
Rather than using Cunningham 's criminal role in a lobbying scandal to turn the special election into a preview of how they could translate a " culture of corruption " into a national revolution in November , Democrats watched in disappointment as a Republican lobbyist won the race — and as the Democratic candidate performed barely better than presidential nominee John Kerry had in that same district two years before .

For those who do n't know , Mitch Trachtenberg ( at Comment # 1 above ) is the guy who developed the system which discovered that Humboldt County 's Diebold system had dropped hundreds of ballots without notice to anybody .
( As I mention in my full article over at Gouverneur Times ) .
Folks in MA would be wise to get Mitch 's butt out there ASAP , frankly .
No matter which party they happen to support !

Its those convenient " too close to call " elections that always seem to get decided by the machines .
We are the decider .
Time for serious election justice activists in MA to find your problem precincts then have them drawn from a hat before everyone , demand an immediate 10 % hand count audit ( get your hand - counters and volunteers together ! ) of the entire state .
LHS has a criminal record for God 's sake .
Why are they anywhere near our ballots ??????
This company truly represents the shady underbelly of the election hardware / software business .

Regarding vote by mail .
Here in Oregon , there are no absentee ballots , so there 's no database to access to find out who requested one and had n't yet voted , which brings up this question :
How is it possible for it to be discovered if someone had requested an absentee ballot but not yet voted since those votes have n't been counted yet ( are n't ballots only supposed to be counted AFTER the polls close ) ?!?!?!

Is it possible for an accompanied honest , knowledgable hacker to track the computer readings realtime to correct any funny business prior to decision making time ?
Or to note odd calculations for investigation asap ?
Also , are there no watchdogs at the precincts ?
Would exit polls help in disputing the outcome if it appears funny when compared to voter registrations ?
Let the cameras roll !
Personally , I think we should play their game better then they do .

Bad situation for sure .
In the Pima County public records fight John Brakey and I were involved in , Pima did n't want to give up the raw data files behind a wonky - looking election .
So as a key argument against giving up the data , they outright admitted that the security behind the system stank .
Yeah , I 'm quite serious .
They admitted in open court that the Diebold system was so " fatally flawed " that it was too easy for outside tampering to allow any " outsiders " additional knowledge about how the process worked .
Thus turning the entire concept of a democratic process on it's head .
In the end the judge did n't buy it , and John was able to dig through the internals of the data files and spot patterns of weirdness .
In the latest go - round , we 're now trying to get to the original poll tapes in that 2006 election with a $ 2 bil ( yeah , that * billion * ) bond measure in play .
The patterns of strangeness found by John indicate that once party observers left for the night , numerous precinct 's worth of electronic uploads were re-done for reasons we still do n't understand .
That 's why we want to go back to the original polltapes , to see if the signed output sheets match the numbers of voters at each precinct and the official final tallies .
We suspect they wo n't .
The good news is , we now have a lot of experience in cross- referencing this stuff - the electronic records against the paper in particular .
We think that needs doing out in Mass ...

Should concerned citizens start putting pressure on NY Secretary of State Lorraine A. Cortés - Vázquez to ensure that the balloting and vote counting is done properly ?
Obviously the Secretaries of State for Ohio and Florida were very effective in helping ensure the vote was NOT fair in those states .

The Al Franken election convinced me many close elections are totally rigged .
You had absentee ballots just showing up mysteriously --- some reportedly found in abandoned cars .
A man who has literally failed at everything he 's ever done is now sitting in my Senate making laws that affect my future .
I can't take it anymore .
Vermont is fielding several candidates in state elections that are pushing to seceed , and other states are going to follow .
Yes , state govs can be corrupt , but nothing like what has happened in DC --- a government that actively works against the will of the people like the unelected EU High Commission .
Our federal government is bankrupt fiscally and morally and our democracy is in tatters with ACORN and Diebold running amock to win elections by any means necessary .
We 're going to have to drain DC of a lot of it's power and give it back to the states or they 're going to force the issue by leaving this corrupt system .

Good comedy , Brook .
Minnesota has one of the most transparent and secure electoral systems in the country .
Sure , there 's more they could do , but the Franken election is about as successful a one as you 're likely to find in this country .
If you want a man who 's failed at everything he 's done getting into office through a failed election , look eight years earlier and a little higher on the official food chain .
Incidentally , in our arrangement , failed elections are as much the states ' fault as the federal government's .
Thus , I 'm really not sure how you 've flown from one topic to the other .
I do get some amusement from the thought of Vermont - - a landlocked state with a legendarily stagnant economy -- fighting a war for independence and then persisting as a sovereign nation .
And as for ACORN . . . apart from registering voters , what have they done to win elections " by any means necessary " ?

Brook @ 16 : The Al Franken election convinced me many close elections are totally rigged .

No .
You did n't , Brook .
You 've been conned .
I hope you 'll consider using better news resources , instead of the ones who have apparently lied to you .
A man who has literally failed at everything he 's ever done is now sitting in my Senate making laws that affect my future .
Yes .
Failed by be an award winning comedy writer for two decades , having a number of a Best - Selling books , a daily radio show for years until he quit to run ( sucessfully ) for the U.S. Senate .
You should hope that you 're as much of a failure , Brook .
I can't take it anymore .
Well , that may be true .
But , as I said , try reading news sources who do n't lie to you .
It may ( or may not ) make things easier to take .
Vermont is fielding several candidates in state elections that are pushing to seceed , and other states are going to follow .
Yes , state govs can be corrupt , but nothing like what has happened in DC --- a government that actively works against the will of the people like the unelected EU High Commission .
Why ?
How is DC government more corrupt than it 's been for the last decade ?
And do you want scones with your tea party ?
Our federal government is bankrupt fiscally and morally and our democracy is in tatters with ACORN and Diebold running amock to win elections by any means necessary .
What does ACORN have to do with anything ?
( And have I mentioned you need better news sources ?
Glad you found us . )
We 're going to have to drain DC of a lot of it's power and give it back to the states or they 're going to force the issue by leaving this corrupt system .
Well , that sounds fine to me .
Good luck !

All jurisdictions are different , but many states / counties allow counting to occur BEFORE polls are closed ( and some , even before they are open ! ) , though the results are not supposed to be checked until after polls closed .
As Jim March notes @ 8 above , of course , that 's not what happened in Pima County , AZ , where officials printed out results , several times , before Election Day !
BTW , Jim March , hope you got enough gas in your motorcycle ( and a sidecar for John Brakey ) to get to Massachusetts !

Is it possible for an accompanied honest , knowledgable hacker to track the computer readings realtime to correct any funny business prior to decision making time ?
Well ... not really .
I suppose they could illegally break into a scanner , set a remote device , and then follow it from outside .
But they'd then have to do that in every polling place , and break a lot of laws in the bargain .
And even then , might not be able to notice funny business .
In other words , no .
That plan wo n't work , as I see it .
Or to note odd calculations for investigation asap ?
Again , for a hacker , not that I can figure .
But for a citizen , to demand access to Memory Cards in a court of law , under the premise that they are public records and should be available to the public and should be retained for 22 months following a federal election ( as per federal law , which everyone ignores ) --- well , with all of that , you might be able to get somewhere .
Quicker route : get rid of the damn machines , and count the damn ballots in front of everyone and be done with it .
Also , are there no watchdogs at the precincts ?
Yes .
You !
Please ?
Would exit polls help in disputing the outcome if it appears funny when compared to voter registrations ?
Only in the Ukraine .
Or in the event that an exit poll says the Republican should have won , but the Democrat ends up winning according to the machines ( the reverse does n't work , trust me . )
Let the cameras roll !
Personally , I think we should play their game better then they do Sounds good to me !

If the Massachusetts election is stolen by the GOP , the Dems will be getting EXACTLY what they deserve for ignoring election protection .

KARLOF @ 6 :
I 'm an election activist from Oregon .
Even Oregon has absentee voters --- Overseas Military and others living / working abroad .
Their ballots go out well in advance of the rest of us .
Also anyone who will be out of the state during an election period can still request an absentee ballot .

Thanks for the reply Brad and all the work you 're doing on so many issues .
We can never be a democracy until everyone is allowed to vote and all the votes get counted .
Unfortunately , there 's the problem of who is getting elected with those votes and the agenda they 're hiding from the voters that elected them .

Citizens Can Salvage Single Payer from Health Care Mess
The health insurance industry , Big Pharma and other special interests have overplayed a pat hand .
They have bribed every official in sight to the point the so - called health reform has the public by the short hairs .
The bill promotes extortion with fines and punishments for those who do n't comply with government dictates .
This illustrates the disease of corporate communism , which has infested the entire nation .
If the citizen has a brain , he realizes he has no say in health care delivery .
The situation has come to a head in Massachusetts .
If Coakley loses , the health care bills now before the Congress collapse without the 60th vote in the Senate .
Horrified by this eventuality , the special interests have moved their funds and support to the Coakley campaign .
They have ordered their lick - spittle President to rush to Massachusetts to pull their fat from the fire .
Win or lose in Massachusetts , the citizens have an excellent window of opportunity .
With both parties totally discredited and shamed beyond belief , any bill worth passing deserves a reconciliation effort to overcome a filibuster .
Fifty - one votes should be enough to make H.R. 676 single payer the law of the land .
Let every incumbent learn the 2010 election could unseat him and send him to prison .
Such a realization is good for the character .

Ron is correct .
Both parties are discredited at this point , and this is really what the tea party rallies are about .
However , i do not agree that a third party would make a difference .
Look at Britain .
Dismantling a few failed federal departments like education and relinquishing that responsiblity to the states is a much better solution .
Washington has been trying to micromanage education since the 60's .
How many more chances are we going to give them and flush more money down the drain , until we just shut them down ?

I do n't believe I said he never spoke at a black church .
I said I was unaware of it , and would happily apologize if you were able to demonstrate differently ( all of this is a different thread , which has little to do with the topic of this article , btw ) .
Have been working on deadlines today , and not able to reply to , much less read , all comments .
So , thanks for posting those three clips in that other thread .
I looked at them .
Obama speaking at the church in Selma , Alabama in March 2007 --- the very church where the " Bloody Sunday " marchers gathered --- at an event held to commemorate the Civil Rights movement on the anniversary of the " Bloody Sunday " march is what you were referring to when you said : have n't i seen Obama appear to campaign at black churches all over the country --- on a Sunday ?
Or in 2005 when he appeared to support a candidate in New Jersey , and marked the anniversary of Rosa Parks , that 's what you were referring to ?
Or in January 2008 when he spoke at DR .
MARTIN LUTHER KING'S church , and was introduced by the pastor saying " Regardless of whether you are Republican or Democratic , Barack Obama makes us proud " , that 's what you were referring to ?!
( You gave three clips , and that 's what they were ) .
So yes , you did see " Obama appear to campaign at black churches " even if " all over the country " is a bit of an exaggeration ( and even " appear to campaign " is up for grabs ) and at each event speaking to crowds commemorating historic landmarks in civil rights moments in this country .
If that 's what you 're offended by , then yes , I 'm happy to apologize for having indicated that I was unfamiliar with those .
I was n't .
But now I am .
Thanks for sharing them .
And I 'll presume , if you are condemning him for having done so , that you 're also condemning all of the " churches " and tax - exempt religious organizations who routinely proselytize and / or campaign for and / or send out materials in support of and / or fund ballot initiatives for Republican candidates and wingnut initiatives and George W. Bush , etc. , right ?
( Eg. the Mormon church which spent MILLIONS in support of defeating Constitutinal equal protection in CA for example ?
Or Rick Warren and his church where Obama / McCain had their " debate " ? )
If so , then I 'm right there with ya , and all for revoking ALL of their tax exempt status when those organizations fund campaigns and instruct voters how to vote .

Thanks to Brad for being a stand - up guy and admitting that both the right and left , ( especially the Obamas --- witness openly using a black church to campaign for Jon Corzine ) , misuse religious organizations for political purposes .
It is shameful , but it is ironic the ACLU only seems to sue the right - wing organizations .
We are , however , looking forward to Brad 's next blog on Black Liberation Theology and the danger it poses to America .

A bit off - topic , but a word of warning to those hoping that reconciliation will somehow magically result in a better HCR bill .
Reconciliation will not result in a measurably better HCR bill because the Republicans did not make Obama craft this bill .
This corporate - mandated shit sandwich is the bill Obama wanted in the first place .
Again : this is the bill Obama wanted from the start .
I ’ve seen a lot of wishful thinking over at FDL articles , diaries and comments about reconciliation and I keep having to respond with these simple facts :
Reconciliation is not going to happen because it wo n't be allowed to happen ... but if it were used it would be used solely to impose the corporate will .
( The oligarchic will , actually … )
There ’d be a lot of sweet nothings added in order to obscure that fact , possibly even that fig leaf of a public option after it had been safely watered down into uselessness , but the corporate shit sandwich would still lie at the core of a reconciliation vote .
But that would mean a little too much exposure for comfort for even these leeches so reconciliation simply wo n’t happen .
But if events were somehow forced to reconciliation then they ’d still pass the corporate version regardless of how bad it would look .

Most likely the healthcare and bigpharm powers that be are willing to pay big bucks to produce public polls showing that Brown is ahead , and willing to pay the big bugs to LHS Associates who will ultimately count the votes .
The tighter the race they can make it appear in the media , the less payola they 'll have to pay to rig the election in Brown 's favor .
Democracy in the US is no longer democracy by majority rule , but by the golden rule : he / she / corporations who have the gold , decide .
The MA Senate seat will be bought and sold by the highest bidder .
For Brown to be even ahead 4 % in the late Sen Kennedy 's backyard is absolutely insane .
For the public to go along with the perception that Brown stands a chance of winning and is in turn influenced by the media is also insane .
I bet Brown will win , and nothing will be done about the how this election was purchased .
Business as usual , move along folks , nothing to see here , just a few computer glitches .

Er... errrrr ... hmmm ...
I 'm afraid you seem to be somewhat out of date ...
I believe that Coakley is the favored of the oligarch 's corporate footstools .
It 's Coakley has said that she will vote for the corporate - mandated shit sandwich .
It was Coakley whose campaign was flooded with healthcare corporate lobbyists and healthcare corporate cash when the polls showed her losing .
( The vast majority of her fundraising " hosts " are now big pharma and insurance gangsters . )
Brown has said he 'll vote no on the bill and as I said above that would make the corporate leeches have to move a bit more overtly than they are comfortable with ... so it wo n't be allowed to happen .
At all .
It 's Brown who does n't stand a chance .
As for what happened to Coakley that she needs to be bailed out by the oligarchs ?... a commenter named kafka over at FDL said it best :
It took Carter and his big Dem Congressional majorities 4 years to piss off the country .
It took Clinton and his big majorities 2 years .
It ’s taken Obama and his big majorities less than 1 year .
The Democrats are getting better at this .

Dear Zapkitty - I 'm mostly completely with you here .
Except for this -- I do n't think anyone can know who 's going to " win " because there 's too much stuff we just do n't know about how the " counting " will go down .
Yes , all that you say about the corporate world wanting , wining , and dining Coakley I think is probably accurate .
But since the " counting " will be handled by the wild card that is LHS Associates and we do n't know what they might want or get paid to want or by whom , I think it 's difficult to predict the outcome .
And the machines fucking up all by their lonesomes can't be ruled out as a possible determining factor in any outcome .
This is one of the problems of our current multi-faceted dysfunction .
You can't make up shit crazier than what might be going down but on the other hand it might also for multiple reasons not be going down whichever way any of us is imagining ( or hallucinating ) .
So we 're all busy making up our different possibilities of reality .
Some of it 's right .
Some of it 's not .
Some of it 's crazy .
Some of it 's partly right .
Some of it will eventually be discovered and validated .
Some not .
Some never .
And on and on .
And that , as we all know , is why we need a transparent and honest election and voting system .
And the return of transparency in government .
And we 're going to have to push and pull like crazy and forever to make these things happen .
And even then they may not .
And we gotta keep trying anyway .
love ,
Dave

David , I said that the fate of HCR had been decided .

There 's no " conspiracy theory " about it and they have n't exactly been subtle ... that 's why voters are so damned pissed although they 're mostly unaware of the slimey details or just how bad it 's going to be .
Your mistake is in thinking that this election will somehow affect the outcome of Obama 's bill , the senate bill , the corporate - mandated shit sandwich we 're all destined to eat ... and the simple fact is the election will have no effect on that outcome .
As for the rest ... the mindset of " election fraud must equal a Republican win " , something which Brad has warned against time and again , is in for a hell of an shock come Tuesday .
Hint for the slow - to - wake - up ... the corporations found Republicans useful as direct access to the levers of government but they 've always worked both parties and now that they 're in the drivers seat THEY DON'T GIVE A FUCK IF THE WINNER IS A REPUBLICAN OR A DEMOCRAT AS LONG AS THE WINNER TAKES THE MONEY AND DOES AS THEY ARE TOLD .
And Coakley is taking the money and she will do as she is told .

Brook at any number of comments :
The tea parties are not all about free and fair elections .
The tea parties are about taking a group of people who are just barely informed enough to not be able to ignore the corruption and crime at current levels , and to systematically mislead , twist truths and flat out lie to them to make it impossible to figure the truth .
And then take advantage of their anger by pointing it at anyone remotely involved in uncovering and understanding the truth .
As Bill Gates did in the early software industry , spread Fear Uncertainty and Doubt to such a level that no one does anything to fix anything so the rabid wolves can keep on eating the sheeple without the sheeple having a clue .
Brad ,
thank you again .
I 'm lookin and I still can't find a mistake in your research .
Everyone ,
here 's the pattern that keeps emerging .
Just like Brooke 's tea partying friends , the powers that be over elections ( Dem AND Rep ) seem consistently to do one thing well : obscure results and deny access to accuracy .
We gotta face it .
It 's not just part of the system now , it is the system .
The proof is in how much simpler and easier the cure is than the disease .
For these voting systems to be used , it takes so much more effort than just simple paper hand counted ballots and the results are so much less accurate by machine that we all know consciously or not that huge efforts are being made to hurt us .
It 's not incidental nor accidental nor a result of some ongoing struggle between good politicians and evil politicians .
For this kind of adulteration to persist for more than a day , let alone years , it takes concerted , cooperative effort at all levels from all sides .
Ok so I 'm blaming OBusha again ?
What motive ?
Hmmm , what would happen to the OBusha agenda if the Dems had their magic 60 ?
Why not 70 ?
What policies would Dems have to accept responsibility if they had 70 ?
Corporate rape throughout our system as we 've had in the financial bailouts , the criminal military / torture / industrial / mercenary / bigbrother complex , the medical / pharma / insurance complex , the complete loss of civil rights , .... these can't all be blamed on those dang blue dogs and reps who keep throwing sand in the gears of congress .
Yep it 's all screwing the folks making less than $ 1 M / yr all the time and it's all done by , for and with the Dems as well as Repubs .
Again , thank you Brad and Mitch and Al Franken and all for the incredible research and efforts over the last decade at least .
More and more now , I 'm starting to see Dmitry Orlov 's point that as the system collapses , the corruption becomes more and more plain to see and less and less correctable .
Who among us believes anything short of paper ballots counted by hand is going to resolve any of this ?
Did n't Franken ( as well as Thom Hartmann ) talk and write at length about Germany 's hand counted ballots and their tenth of a percent accuracy when compared to comprehensive exit polls ?
So for me at least , the question becomes what are the odds that we 'll get and what do we need to do to get paper hand counted ballots ?

You can't " recount " something that has n't been counted , Lora .
And since there is neither an automatic " audit " law in MA nor a full hand - count in the case of very close reported results ( as I understand ) , it seems that NONE of the ballots voted by voters will actually be counted at all when the " results " are announced .
If you 're hoping to get folks interested in a manual count of all ballots , however , that 's a different matter and no , I do n't believe an Internet petition for same would have any legal weight ( though perhaps moral weight ) .

I would add to Brad 's piece that the Hursti hack , depicted in Hacking Democracy was verified by the 02/06/2006 UC
Berkley Security Analysis of the Diebold AccuBasic Interpreter [ PDF ] , which noted : Harri Hursti's attack does work … .
He was indeed able to change the election results by doing nothing more than modifying the contents of a memory card .
He needed no passwords , no cryptographic keys , and no access to any other part of the voting system , including the GEMS election management server .
The report adds that there is an even greater vulnerability in some 16 " bugs " in the interpreter code that permit malicious tampering that " would not be discovered by any amount of functionality testing . " they could allow an attacker to completely control the behavior of the AV - OS .
An attacker could change vote totals , modify reports , change the names of candidates , change the races being voted on , or insert his own code ...

I feel it 's important to point out here that the Tea - whatever movement is , in fact , a much more complex break - down of demographic than we might have been led to believe .
The national Ron Paul movement was hi-jacked .
So ... what happened to the Ron Paul people ?
As one who was very much involved with the Ron Paul " movement " , but dropped out when he did .
( JAN .
08 / fter he showed no interest whatsoever in our New Hampshire Primary Recount Investigation which showed that the Diebold voting machines had a failure rate 163 times greater than allowed by Federal Law . ) **
Since then , I have watched the Tea Party Express / Tea Party Grass Roots evolution / dissolution with interest ( and consternation ) - always wondering how many of my smart , revolutionary , techno - saavy , hyper - aware , super - organized former RP people could be involved in this ... stupid fest .
So I made some phone calls to my former Ron Paul pals in Sarasota , Florida this past weekend - and just as I suspected , they were forced out of the local chapter Republican Party in 2009 after being VOTED IN as reps due the swelling of RP numbers in 2008 .
( Of interest to Bradblog readers , these folks were very aware of the wonky ' election ' of Vern Buchanan in 2006 , after the ES&S machines disappeared 18,412 votes for his opponent in our county .**)
Since their ousting from local politics , they have quietly slipped back into the woodwork , now just trying to make ends meet .
My point is , Brook and Damail may be completely different creatures ( clearly are ) , with wide ranging IQ differentials ( as Brook him / herself mentions ) .
I think we 're seeing many different shades of Tea- party gray all parading ( and pandering ) under the banner of the TeaParty - Whatevs , which is why their recent bi-fercation is way note - worthy .

You see the core problem , Jeannie ?
They 're still reflexively jerking off to the attack memes implanted in them by the right wing ... and are spending their time preparing to fight an artfully crafted " enemy " that does n't actually exist , and never did .
I know the left can be just as bad and the center was bought straight off the clearance rack , but these people are still trying to wage their long - lost war against a " left " and an " Obama " that never really existed in the first place .
Coordination will be difficult when reality is just now catching up to them and slamming their heads to and fro with a constant stream of facts that just do n't fit their preconceived worldview ... as they were basically indoctrinated to ignore such facts .

Brad @ 49 : You can't " recount " something that has n't been counted , Lora .
Well , I thought there was a 6 - day time limit after the election to file a petition for a recount , and you had to have a separate petition for each ward , and you had to have 10 signatures for each petition .
Even if the chance of a recount is slim to none , better to have your ducks in a row , just in case , I was thinking .
Once the 6 days are up , you could not even ask for a recount , right ?
Am I missing something here ?
I 'd appreciate clarification - TIA .

Lora asked :

I 'd appreciate clarification Sorry , I may have typed too fast .
Point was , what you 'd want after such an election is a manual hand count .
A " recount " would n't be the right word , since the ballots will never have been counted in the first place .
They will have been run through some computer gizmo which says --- accurately or not --- what might be on those ballots .
I was largely making a semantical correction , not a legal one .
On that score , you are correct .
Sorry for the confusion .

The tea party will be co-opted or infiltrated by the elites eventually , which is why a third party is doomed to fail .
This is why the folks i am working with are avoiding any formal structure .
It 's true some state governments are riddled with corruption , but imo they are far more responsive and accountable to the voters .

It already was , Brook .
Long ago .
It was coopted when the corporate Republicans lost the election and took over Ron Paul 's real Tea Party which had been going on for years , as you guys called him crazy .

No , i disagree , because there is no formal structure in the tea party movement , and on the local level it is housewives , white - collar , blue - collar --- anyone who wants to be a part of it .
We do n't collect money to pay salaries and open offices all over the country like ACORN .

Brook said @ 69 : there is no formal structure in the tea party movement Yes , I know .
That 's what you believe , because the largest media machine in the world , which has structured it , organized it and publicized it , keeps telling you as much .
In the meantime , much larger grassroots groups , who really * did n't * have anybody structuring them have gone ( and continue to go ) ignored by that same media .
( Eg. See the Iraq War demonstrations which dwarfed the Tea Bagger protests , but were n't covered at all in the corporate media ) .
You 've been conned , Brook .
And you 've fallen for it hook , line and tea bag .
We do n't collect money to pay salaries and open offices all over the country like ACORN .
YOU do n't .
But the corporations who are running the scam do , and they 've invested MILLIONS into your " grass roots " movement .
Pay attention .
As to ACORN , are you suggesting there is something wrong with citizens organizing themselves to help other citizens in need ?
Do you have something against " we , the people " ?!
Communication is mostly through email , and we wo n't be doing any protests until tax day
Why would you protest on " tax day " ?
Obama has lowered taxes for 85 % of America .
( Guessing you did n't know that . )
While Dubya raised the debt to an historic level and you guys did n't raise a peep .
or unless this monstrous health care bill is about to be passed .
But you forgot to protest when Bush 's " monstrous health care bill " ( Medicare Part D ) was passed to the tune of $ 800 billion and , unlike what the Dems are doing , he did n't bother to actually pay for it ?
Starting to see how you 've been conned yet , Brook ?

_____________________________
Sorry to tell you this , Brook , but you have been misled by a well - funded group of snake - oil salesmen .
Here 's a tidbit from one article , out of many , on the subject :
If you suspected Rick Santelli ’s “ spontaneous ” tea party rant was actually a fake , you may be on to something .
It ’s starting to look like it was part of a conservative astroturfing campaign put together by FreedomWorks , Dick Armey ’s right - wing propaganda operation .
The article quotes another : Within hours of Santelli 's rant , a website called ChicagoTeaParty.com sprang to life .
Essentially inactive until that day , it now featured a YouTube video of Santelli ’s “ tea party ” rant and billed itself as the official home of the Chicago Tea Party .
The domain was registered in August , 2008 by Zack Christenson , a dweeby Twitter Republican and producer for a popular Chicago rightwing radio host Milt Rosenberg — a familiar name to Obama campaign people .
On the same day as Santelli 's rant , February 19 , another site called Officialchicagoteaparty.com went live .
This site was registered to Eric Odom , who turned out to be a veteran Republican new media operative specializing in imitation - grassroots PR campaigns .
Astroturfing is by no means new to those in the election integrity movement .
The same technique was used to blunt investigations of the massive , computerized theft of the 2004 election in Ohio .
Countering efforts made by Democrats and others in the election integrity movement to get to the bottom of the weird shift of Ohio from the Kerry to the Bush column , Rep. Bob Ney ( R - OH ) conducted separate hearings in which he called as an expert witness Mark F. ( Thor ) Hearne , II of the " American Center for Voting Rights " ( ACVR ) to testify at a Monday hearing .
Turns out , ACVR had only been formed the preceding Thursday .
Mark F. ( Thor ) Hearne , II --- the National General Counsel for Bush / Cheney ' 04 Inc. --- gave testimony for the group and is listed on the U.S. House Administrative Committee website as simply " National Counsel , American Center for Voting Rights " .
No mention of his current high - level connections to Bush / Cheney and his long history of working with other powerful Republican officials all the way back to his time working for the Reagan Administration .
One could go on and on about the use of phony think tanks and astroturf groups who challenge the science of global warming , etc .
While the uninformed followers are indeed , as Brook describes them , simply " housewives , white - collar , blue - collar ... " at the core of these astroturf organizations one will always find massive corporate wealth used to pay utterly corrupt and dishonest organizers whose propaganda is amplified by the hard - right echo chamber .

I 'm lmao at you guys .
Let 's see should we believe a liberal blogger or an active member of the movement on the inside who is privy to and involved in trying to steer what is going on ?
This movement would not have happened at all without talk radio .
In my city 12,000 people came out for a rally and the overwhelming majority were persuaded to be there by local talk radio hosts who spoke at the rallies .
These personalities were not paid to be there --- they were there because they actually believe their own rhetoric .
They 've also been instrumental in rallying folks to kill bad local legislation and pork projects , which proves they are not tools of nat'l corporations .
Corporate profits are not affected at all by reducing federal government spending , which is the core demand of the movement .
We want some sort of blueprint for how we are going to get out from under $ 12 trillion of debt and $ 50 trillion in unfunded mandates .
Again , I can't see where any American would oppose making that demand of Congress , and Brad still has not indicated where he stands on the issue .

You continue to amuse , Brook .
" Let 's see should we believe a liberal blogger or an active member of the movement on the inside who is privy to and involved in trying to steer what is going on ? "
Argument from disbelief is by itself a logical fallacy , and you 've shown very little evidentiary support that Brad , Ernest and the sources they point to are dishonest .
The tea parties ' astroturfing underpinning is well documented .
You 're suggesting that you 'd believe whichever somebody down the line , who 's financially motivated to push a profitable position , rather than believe someone whose opinions you generally disagree with .
About the talk - radio hosts , would you mind pointing us to a bit of documentation stating that they promoted and attended the rallies pro bono ?
It 's not that I think it 's out of the realm of possibility -- lord knows talk - radio hosts can be duped , too -- but I do n't want to see anyone spinning assumptions into reality .
Regardless , it 's not difficult to see the connection between rallying a fan base and creating ratings .
" Corporate profits are not affected at all by reducing federal government spending .
. . . " So . . . you 're not out to cut the oil - company subsidies and exorbitant military contracts and big - farm handouts and price - inflating medication controls ?
Instead you 're after the rare bits of legislation that actually help the people ?
In trying to pin Brad to a position , you 're first engaging in a " no true Scotsman " fallacy , where anyone who disagrees with you is n't an American , and then you 're trying to catch Brad middling .
Either he agrees with you , and you 're right , neener - neener - neener , or he disagrees and defaults into what you 've set up as the unpopular and unthinkable opinion .
What you 're neglecting to consider , of course , is that Brad is n't a politician , and his opinion has no bearing on his validity as a press organ .
In fact , in that regard , it may be in his best interest not to express his opinion .
Brook , it 's not that we doubt your sincerity and good intentions , but the tea parties are not what you claim them to be ; they did n't start -- or at least did n't come to prominence -- the way you say , and you have greatly idealized their integrity as a populist movement .
I 'm only a sporadic poster around these parts , but I know that your opinions are welcome here ; just please can the " gotcha ! " traps and derogative assumptions .
That 's not constructive discourse , and if you 'll stop your cynical positioning of yourself as the victim opposition , you may find that a number of us share libertarian leanings with you .

His opinion on any given issue -- especially an overly generalized cheerleader issue -- is irrelevant , unless you 're deliberately creating a rhetorical dilemma .

With the Super Bowl just concluded and baseball 's spring training only weeks away , a question occurred to us : whatever happened to the push for copyright holders to tone down their copyright notices ?
We hear and see the warnings whenever a football or baseball game is televised , whenever we read books , whenever we watch a movie .
These are the sort of warnings that make claims like , " Any other use of this telecast or any pictures , descriptions , or accounts of the game without the NFL 's consent is prohibited , " despite the apparent wrongheadedness of the statement .
Should copyright holders be held more accountable for inaccurate warnings ?
In 2007 , two different efforts to provoke change on the issue tried to force the issue .
Both ended without success , even as courts have cracked down on some of the worst copyright overreaching by the leagues .
Asking the government to act
In 2007 , the Computer and Communications Industry Association decided to stir the pot a bit on such copyright notices .
CCIA 's in - house lawyer Matt Schruers drafted a complaint and sent it along to the Federal Trade Commission , arguing that over - broad copyright warnings violated Section 5 of the FTC Act by " misrepresenting consumers ' rights to use copyrighted works and by threatening sanctions for lawful uses of those copyrighted works . "
Groups representing 139,000 US libraries soon supported the complaint .
Those paid by big copyright holders to argue for their positions found CCIA 's complaint unfounded .
Patrick Ross , who heads the Copyright Alliance , went to the CCIA press conference announcing the complaint .
His response : " CCIA President Ed Black ridiculed a number of copyright warnings — you know the type , they say unauthorized use could result in fines or jail .
Ed says the warnings do n’t stipulate fair use .
Well , using the word ' unauthorized ' would seem to address that , because fair use under Sec. 107 of the Copyright Act would be authorized . "
This argument is true only in the broadest sense : that fair use is indeed written into copyright law .
But fair use does not " authorize " particular uses of works and can only be decided on an after - the - fact basis by a judge .
No permission in advance is even possible on fair use ; the best one can get is good advice from a lawyer .
As the Copyright Office itself states , " the distinction between fair use and infringement may be unclear and not easily defined .
There is no specific number of words , lines , or notes that may safely be taken without permission ...
The Copyright Office can neither determine if a certain use may be considered fair nor advise on possible copyright violations .
If there is any doubt , it is advisable to consult an attorney . "
A common movie warning
More important , however , this argument does n't even apply to some of the most common copyright notices .
It applies to the " FBI warning " found on many movies , but the NFL's own notice is unambiguous : " This telecast is copyrighted by the NFL for the private use of our audience .
Any other use of this telecast or any pictures , descriptions , or accounts of the game without the NFL 's consent is prohibited . "
Baseball is just as clear : " This copyrighted telecast is presented by authority of the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball .
It may not be reproduced or retransmitted in any form , and the accounts and descriptions of this game may not be disseminated , without express written consent . "
Both are quite obviously ridiculous — descriptions of baseball and football games may in fact be disseminated without written consent ( and are every day around the water cooler and in newspapers and in Wikipedia ) .
And the less said about books , the better ; many say things like , " no part of this publication may be reproduced or transmitted in any form or in any means ... without permission in writing from the publisher . "
Again , not true .
One book 's copyright notice
While plenty of sites , including Ars , covered the CCIA complaint , it never went anywhere .
What happened to it ?
We checked in with Schruers , who still works for CCIA , and he passed along the FTC 's response from December 6 , 2007 .
In a six - page letter , the FTC declined to move forward on an investigation because it determined that the omissions in such warnings were not " material to consumers . "
( In comparison , Sony BMG 's misguided decision to slap rootkit - style DRM on audio CDs and then not tell consumers was material , and it did result in an FTC consent order . )
In the agency 's view , no one would see such warnings and actually believe them as complete statements of their own rights .
" We do not have a sufficient basis to conclude that consumers would view those brief warnings as complete statements of their rights with respect to the works , " the letter said .
Still , there was some comfort to CCIA .
While FTC declined to act , they did " encourage " copyright owners to " be accurate in their characterizations of their rights . "
If they post misleading information for too long , Bad Things could happen :
" If consumers routinely confront exaggerated and inaccurate copyright warnings they may tend to disregard them altogether , to the detriment of consumers and copyright owners alike . "
Our copyright notice is copyrighted
After watching the 2007 Super Bowl , legal professor Wendy Seltzer uploaded to YouTube a 33 - second clip of the game 's copyright notice , followed by a few moments of onscreen action .
( Well , not " action , " really ; the Colts were preparing to kick off . )
Super Bowl copyright notice
It was Seltzer 's first YouTube posting ever , and she did it to make a point .
" I snipped the copyright warning out of the weekend ’s Super Bowl broadcast as an example for my copyright class of how far copyright claimants exaggerate their rights , " she wrote on her blog at the time .
Would the NFL order the clip taken down ?
Yes , it would — twice .
Five days later , YouTube notified Seltzer that the video had been targeted by a Digital Millenium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) takedown notice from the NFL .
If she did nothing , the video would remain down , though she could also choose to file a " counter - notice " swearing a " good faith belief " that the takedown was in error .
Seltzer filed the counter - notice , and YouTube put the video up within the 10 - 14 day " putback " period in the law .
At this point , YouTube had done its legal duty and was now immunized in the dispute .
If the NFL wanted to continue the matter , it could take Seltzer to court , but it could not hold YouTube liable for the video .
Instead , on March 18 , the NFL sent another takedown notice to YouTube .
Seltzer said that " sending a second notification that fails to acknowledge the fair use claims [ made in her first counter - notice ] instead puts NFL into the 512 ( f ) ( 1 ) category of ' knowingly materially misrepresent[ing ] that material or activity is infringing . ' "
And that would open the door for Seltzer to sue the NFL for filing improper DMCA takedowns .
Instead , Seltzer just filed a second counter - notice .
A couple weeks later , YouTube restored the video and no more was heard of the incident .
I checked in with Seltzer this week to see what , if anything , had happened .
She tells me that after the second counter - notice , the NFL never sued her and never sent another takedown notice ; the clip remains available on YouTube today .
As for her own implicit threat to sue the NFL , Seltzer did n't act on it .
" I probably would have if they had pulled the video again , " she adds .
Seltzer says that the incident was an educational one , and it led her to post similar copyright notices from Major League Baseball games ; no takedown letters were forthcoming from MLB , however .
Changes on the ground
Attempts to alter these copyright claims have yet to produce real change , but the sports leagues have been forced to alter some of their behavior relating to copyright .
Major League Baseball , for instance , has long claimed that fantasy sports leagues must take out a license in order to use real player names and stats — despite the " fact " that facts are n't copyrightable .
A St. Louis company , CBC Distribution and Marketing , refused to do so and ran some Internet fantasy sports games using real MLB data .
Baseball sued , and lost in 2006 at the District Court level .
In 2007 , baseball lost at the Appeals Court level .
In 2008 , the Supreme Court refused to hear a further appeal , and CBC was vindicated .
The news was big enough to inspire a New York Times op - ed , in which the paper said , " In recent years , corporations have been aggressively pushing the bounds of intellectual property — extending the length of copyrights to unreasonable lengths , for example , and patenting seeds .
In the case of fantasy baseball , the courts have rightly cried foul .
The biggest fantasy in this case was Major League Baseball ’s claim that its fans should pay to talk about the game . "
That decision was bolstered by a 2009 ruling in which broadcaster CBS brought a similar lawsuit against the NFL Players ' Association .
The judge in that case agreed with the earlier CBC ruling and concluded that such facts were in the public domain .
And the NFL 's decision to go after churches for offering Super Bowl broadcasts on big- screen TVs generated so much bad press that Congress even threatened to step in .
Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA , now D - PA ) introduced S. 2591 , a bill which singled out " professional football contests " and allowed nonprofit groups to show the games on any size screen .
The bill went nowhere , but the NFL did call an audible .
In late 2008 , the league announced that it was changing its ways and would no longer go after churches simply for using a 55 + inch screen .
Baseball and football both remain tenacious about defending their copyrights and trademarks , but they have to do so within an increasingly IP - savvy environment .
People care about such issues more than they did a decade ago , and when they think the NFL is overreaching , the public outcry can be deafening .
When the NFL cracked down on sales of " Who Dat " merchandise before the most recent Super Bowl , fans could n't believe that the league was trying to horn in on their catchphrase .
But , in this new media environment , the NFL also has some tools at its disposal .
In this case , the league took to its own blog to explain that the NFL only cared about the phrase when it was used in conjunction with official Saints logos or other NFL trademarks .

If you are suffering from bad credit history , surely you would like to find an easier way to regain your good credit standing .
The good news is , it does not have to be a difficult task .
There are several options that you can do to raise your credit score at the soonest time possible .
One option is to get a secured credit card .
Can a secured credit card really lead you to good credit ?
Read on to find out .
What is a secured credit card ?
As the name implies , a secured credit card requires its cardholder to submit security or cash deposit .
Thus , despite having a poor credit score , the credit card company is given the guarantee that funds will be readily at hand in case of payment defaults .
Secured cards grant quick and instant approval regardless of the status of your credit history .
Whether you have bad credit or no credit , you can surely open a secured credit card account in your name .
This type of credit card is indeed a wonderful tool for establishing and rebuilding credit .
Will other people know that you are using a secured card ?
Secured cards look exactly like regular credit cards so no one has to know that you are using a secured account because you have bad credit .
It can used for purchasing or paying bills anywhere where standard credit cards are accepted .
The Difference of Getting Secured Credit Card
The main difference with a secured account is the submission of cash security deposit .
Usually , the amount of your deposit will determine the value of your credit limit .
Some secured card issuers do offer a slightly higher credit line than the amount of cash deposited .
In time , you may request your issuer to raise your limit as you prove your credit worthiness by submitting your payments on time .
There are credit card companies that will automatically give an upgrade to an unsecured account after a year of consistent payments .
Before signing up , see to it that your chosen issuer provides credit reporting to the major credit bureaus so you can improve your credit history as you make your payments .
After improving your credit , switching to a non-secured account will enable you to enjoy lower rates and more privileges .
Be a Wise Secured Cardholder
Yes , secured credit cards can be used to rebuild bad credit .
However , that will depend on how you use your card and how you keep up with your payments .
The safest way to manage your account is to keep your charges minimal and to pay off your monthly balances in full at all times .
Avoid carrying over your balance for the next billing cycle so you wo n’t have to pay the interest rates .
Be conscious about your due dates .
If for a really good reason , you will not be able to make your payment on time , do not hesitate to call up your bank and explain your situation .
Request for an extension of your deadline and ask your issuer not to report your late payment if you can submit on the extended date .
" It is well that war is so terrible ; we should grow too fond of it ! "
– Gen. Robert E. Lee
In the Star Trek episode " A Taste of Armageddon , " Capt .
James T. Kirk and crew beam down to planet Eminiar VII against the wishes of its government to find what appears to be a peaceful , highly advanced civilization .
In reality , however , the planet has been at war with a nearby planet for over 500 years , suffering the loss of up to 3 million inhabitants annually .
They have managed to continue functioning as a society by conducting their war entirely by computer .
The computer on one planet fires virtual salvos at the other planet , whose computer in turn selects individuals who have been deemed casualties of the war .
Those individuals are then ordered to report to disintegration chambers , whereupon they are vaporized .
The citizens of both planets seem to accept this as their patriotic duty , for they do indeed report to the disintegration chambers when so ordered .
In this way the bloodlust of both planets ’ governments is satisfied while their civilizations are spared the destruction caused by bombs and bullets and are therefore able to maintain the veneer of civil society .
Kirk and crew – even the highly logical Mr. Spock – immediately recognize the situation ’s moral repugnance .
Senselessly and bloodlessly killing people on the orders of a machine , making possible a war lasting half a millennium , is no way for a supposedly civilized people to act .
Says Kirk to Anan 7 , the leader of the Eminiar council :
" Death , destruction , disease , horror : that ’s what war is all about , Anan .
That ’s what makes it a thing to be avoided .
But you ’ve made it neat and painless – so neat and painless you ’ve had no reason to stop it , and you ’ve had it for 500 years .
Since it seems to be the only way I can save my crew [ declared dead by the war computer and slated for annihilation ] and my ship , I ’m going to end it for you – one way or another . "
Kirk ’s way of ending the war is to destroy the war computers , thus forcing the two planets either to begin fighting a real war or to sue for peace .
Wisely , they choose the latter .
This episode , first telecast in 1967 , during a very real war in Vietnam , likely seemed farfetched at the time .
While we have n’t yet arrived at the stage of conducting wars completely by computer , at least from an American perspective we are far closer to it today than we were back when William Shatner was thin and Leonard Nimoy did n’t have arthritis .
I well recall the sense of pride I felt back during the first Gulf War in 1991 as I sat in front of my TV set , watching bombs fall from U.S. fighter jets onto buildings in Baghdad , not from cameras positioned at a distance from the bombing but from those right inside the planes !
The visiting team was clobbering the home team on the home team ’s own turf !
As a conservative Republican at the time , deaths of Iraqis did n’t concern me in the least – they deserved it for not ousting Saddam Hussein , after all – and besides , I never saw any bodies , so I could simply pretend they did n’t exist .
Hardly any Americans – the only ones who really counted , anyway – were killed , and I never saw those bodies either .
Anyone who bothered to point out the death and destruction being wrought upon Iraq was , as far as I was concerned , an anti-American leftist who could be safely ignored .
Apparently a large majority of Americans shared my opinion : President George H.W. Bush ’s approval ratings shot to a record high of 89 percent .
Not for nothing is that war sometimes called the " computer war . "
Computers guided many of the missiles and bombs rained down upon innocent Iraqis .
Meanwhile , for those of us keeping score at home , the technology employed by the military and the broadcast media allowed us to watch the Big Game live from the comfort of our couches , cheering on our team while not having our mental images of glorious victory stained with the blood of its victims .
Today we are even more detached from the horrors of war than we were in 1991 .
Fighter jets can be dispatched from military installations inside the U.S. to bomb distant countries .
Unmanned drones kill people , regardless of their guilt or innocence , in Afghanistan and Pakistan while those controlling them enjoy the balmy climate of Florida , in danger of little more than sunburn .
Few photographs of bombed - out neighborhoods or war - ravaged bodies appear in mainstream media outlets .
President George W. Bush prohibits pictures of the flag - draped coffins of dead U.S. servicemen , and then , when President Barack Obama lifts the ban , the media ca n’t be bothered even to take the pictures because they ’re so enamored of Obama and desperately trying to spin the ongoing wars in his favor .
At the same time , the culture at large encourages this uninterested approach .
Movies and TV shows continually up the ante on how much violence can safely be depicted .
Video games in which virtual humans are murdered in the goriest ways possible enthrall our youth .
Having become so desensitized to violence when it ’s employed against the " right " people as defined by our culture and political system – after all , deaths in movies and video games are n’t real , so what harm is there ?
– we find it easy to accept the long - distance homicide of blips on a monitor , especially when we do n’t even have to see those blips , let alone consider that they are living , breathing humans with the same right to life that our soldiers are allegedly defending on our behalf .
Why do you think the U.S. military uses violent video games as a recruitment tool ?
The U.S. has been at war with Iraq to one degree or another for nearly two decades now .
We ’ve been fighting in Afghanistan for over eight years .
We ’ve conducted military incursions into Grenada , Panama , Somalia , the former Yugoslavia , and many other countries in the past 30 years .
We have had troops engaged in a standoff in Korea since I Love Lucy was the number - one program on television .
Have you noticed any of this ?
Has it genuinely affected the way you go about your daily life ?
If you ’re like most Americans , your answer is no .
Unless you ’ve known someone in the military who was deployed to one of these conflicts ( particularly if that person was wounded or killed ) , you ’ve most likely gone on about your business with little awareness of the horrors being visited by and upon American soldiers and sailors .
Occasionally , if something really spectacular – or horrible , depending on your point of view – hits the news wires , you may be reminded that there ’s a war going on , but you will quickly be returned to your regularly scheduled ignorance .
Like the people of the two warring planets on Star Trek , as long as your way of life is not impinged upon by the war , you are perfectly happy to let it continue for decades , if not centuries .
In fact , the only thing that may prevent the U.S. from being at war until the year 2525 is economic reality .
Even if we could put our own version of Kirk ’s plan into action , forcing our servicemen to engage the enemy in person , our government chooses to fight such tenth - rate powers that the harm they could inflict on our soldiers and our own territory is so minuscule as to have little effect on Americans ’ attitudes toward war .
On the other hand , a collapse of our economy , which is quite foreseeable even now , will force an end to our seemingly eternal war with Eurasia , Eastasia , and every other enemy our government has dreamed up for us .
The cost of empire has brought down every other great power .
What makes us think it will not be our undoing ?
Tiger Woods has won an injunction banning the English media from publishing new details about his personal life , after instructing London - based lawyers to take legal action .
The move , described by lawyers as " unbelievable " , prevents the media from publishing material that the US media would be able to publish , prompting further anger about the ability of foreign litigants to take advantage of repressive English laws .
" This injunction would never have been granted in America " , the media lawyer Mark Stephens said .
" It 's unbelievable that Tiger Woods ' lawyers have been able to injunct the UK press from reporting information here " .
The injunction , granted by high court judge Mr Justice David Eady , comes amid intense press speculation about the golfer 's alleged extra-marital affairs .
US media are reporting that the high court has blocked the publication of nude photos of Woods .
The golfer 's British lawyers , Schillings , deny that the nude photos exist and suggest that any images in circulation have been doctored .
" I am dealing with my behaviour and personal failings behind closed doors with my family , " Woods said on his website last Wednesday .
" Those feelings should be shared by us alone … no matter how intense curiosity about public figures can be , there is an important and deep principle at stake , which is the right to some simple , human measure of privacy . "
But there were concerns today that the ability of Americans to invoke the UK 's privacy law makes a mockery of the English courts , as one US website ran a headline " Do n't look for nude photos of Woods in Britain " .
Woods , would not have been able to take such action in the US , lawyers said .
" Woods would not have got an injunction like this in America , " Gavin Millar QC , a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers , said .
" Privacy law is weaker in America than it is here .
It is not articulated as a constitutional right and it's subject to much stronger rights to publish on the internet .
The material may already be available in America , but in this country what Mr Justice Eady and others say is that unless it is in the public domain here , by virtue of having been published by the " national media " , they do n't acknowledge that it is already in the public domain .
" The entire universe could be looking at it and it does n't matter " , Millar added .
" But clearly there is no point maintaining an injunction that is completely pointless . "
The case is the latest high profile privacy case involving Eady , who has been at the centre of complaints that the law protects celebrities unfairly , after he awarded £ 60,000 damages to the Formula 1 president Max Mosley last year .
The decision , which said that the News of the World had correctly reported that Mosley had taken part in a sado - masochistic sex session , but had falsely claimed that it had a Nazi theme , reignited debate about the extent to which alleged " immoral " behaviour should be protected by privacy .
" Obviously there is an argument to say that many of the matters that have been reported are private and have absolutely no public interest aspect to them other than salacious interest in someone else 's private life " , said Dominic Crossley , a partner at the law firm Collyer Bristow .
" But the fact that these reports are so hugely in the public domain , one wonders how effective and wise it is to try to prevent further publications .
" These images are beyond the scope of an effective privacy remedy .
The way in which the material has sensationally been disseminated across the world makes it now very difficult to keep control upon the media , " Crossley added .
But the injunction obtained by Woods , although it prevents publishing details of the photographs , marks a move away from the most repressive injunctions , experts say .
The emergence of so - called super injunctions , which prevent the media reporting that an injunction exists , was revealed by the Guardian in October after the oil trading firm Trafigura obtained an order prevented any reporting of proceedings such as the one brought by Woods .
" I suspect the Trafigura case has had something to do with this , " said Millar .
" The whole question of whether they and judges are using their power in private hearings is very important , and they are now much warier of making super injunctions . "
Lawyers said it was unlikely that any American media organisations , if they published the images , would be bound by the English high court order .
“ My girls wo n’t go anywhere unless someone ’s with them , ” Ms. Benoit said .
At Tina ’s , a one - room bar where some of the victims used to come , rumors and theories abound .
Law enforcement officials are treating the deaths as if they were murders committed by a “ common offender ”  a serial killer  but emphasize that is not a sure thing .
It is not clear if the deaths are related or  because of decomposition  if they are all even murders .
Four people have been arrested or have had arrest warrants issued in connection with the deaths .
Two were even held on murder charges for months before being freed because of evidence problems ; the other two were never charged .
Frankie Richard was one of those two .
A onetime owner of local strip joints , Mr. Richard ( pronounced REE - shar ) has a history of assault arrests .
He admits to being a crack addict and claims to have had sex with most of the victims .
He was among those last seen with Kristen G. Lopez , whose body was found floating in a canal on March 18 , 2007 .
A woman who was with Mr. Richard and Ms. Lopez at a cheap hotel just before Ms. Lopez disappeared told the police that Mr. Richard and his niece had killed Ms. Lopez .
Soon after , the woman recanted her statement .
“ I have my suspicion about who done it , ” Mr. Richard , 54 , said , sitting on the front porch of his childhood home on a chilly Sunday afternoon , still reeling from what his mother said was a three - day binge .
“ But I do n’t want to pin the tail on no donkey because I do n’t want false allegations to cause a family to go through what mine did . ”
Mr. Richard was in rehab when one of the victims died , Sheriff Ricky Edwards said .
The pace of the investigation , and the apparent mistakes along the way , have tested the town ’s patience .
In 2007 , the chief of detectives in the parish sheriff ’s office made a deal to buy a pickup truck from an inmate in the parish jail , a woman he knew to be an acquaintance of one of the victims .
A witness later said she saw Ms. Lopez in that same truck on the day of her disappearance , but by then the detective had washed and resold the truck .
The detective was fined and taken off the investigation .
He now supervises the evidence room at the sheriff ’s office .
We ’ve already broken the bank , so to speak , in our effort to renovate Sheep Dog Hollow in a green and economical manner .
We did that when we decided to install a geothermal heating system that cost about $ 20,000 more than a top - of - the - line oil or gas heating system .
The trade - off : big upfront costs versus long - term savings and a clean conscience .
But now , as I mentioned in my most - recent post , it turns out we could have installed a solar system for zero money upfront – just the cost of our monthly electric bill .
Hmmm .
Think that was a bit of poor planning on my part ?
Connecticut is one of the few states that offer a solar leasing program that allows consumers to install solar panels and pay for them as they would their regular electric bill .
( Others include California , Arizona , and Massachusetts , according to the site Tech.Blorge.com .
There are also about 200 local municipalities that offer similar solar leases , according to Monique Hanis of the Solar Energy Industries Association , a nonprofit trade group in Washington .
( You can find out which ones at www.SEIA.org or www.dsireusa.org.)
The Connecticut Clean Energy Fund , which is financed by a small surcharge on the state ’s electric utility users , got together with local financial institutions and developed the lease program .
The goal is to “ … mainstream solar in CT .
It is intended to make the ability to install a solar electric system affordable to everyone who owns a home . ”
The way it works is simple , and I 'll use my current home as an example : A local solar installer from BeFree Solar dropped by one afternoon last week .
He looked at my current electric bills and then checked out our barn , where I ’d propose installing the panels because it faces directly due south .
( The power would be used for both the house and the barn .
But the barn 's roof is better situated for solar . )
A few days later , I got the analysis .
I currently use 7500 kilowatt hours ( kWh ) a year .
As a result , he proposed I install a 6600 watt solar panel system , which should produce , based on my barn ’s angle toward the sun , about 8,000 kWh a year .
The cash cost of such system : $ 46,200.00 .
With state rebate of $ 10,000 and federal tax credit ( about $ 10,000 as well ) , that would bring the upfront cost down to $ 26,000 and that does n’t include sales tax .
That ’s still pretty high for most homeowners .
With the lease program , the upfront costs are zero .
The federal and state incentives go to the leasing company , which essentially gives me a fixed rate loan for the remaining $ 26,000 .
I pay for that loan with a fixed monthly payment of $ 99 for the next 15 years .
After that , the company reappraises the solar system , and offers me another five - year lease , which , because of depreciation of the system , is estimated to be around $ 30 a month .
It does sound too good to be true : no upfront costs , fixed monthly costs that are lower than my current electric bills , and there ’s no sales tax on the lease .
Tthere are some drawbacks .
First and foremost is that the lease is “ non-cancelable , which means you ’re not allowed to pay off the lease for any reason .
You have to make all payments as scheduled , ” according to the Connecticut Solar Lease Advisor .
There are also income limits to the program , but since it ’s designed to encourage middle - class people to get into solar .
they ’re relatively high .
A couple living in my county , without children , have to make less than $ 150,000 in combined income .
( The more children you have , the higher the limit . )
Finally , at the end of the lease , you either have to remove the system or buy it from the leasing company .
( By then it will probably be worth only a few thousand dollars , according to my BeFree adviser Kapil Luthra . )
Over the next 30 years , if I continued to buy electricity from the local utility – which has a history of raising rates about 6 percent a year – my total costs would be almost $ 70,000 , according to my BeFree analysis .
With a leased system , my total outlay over those same 30y years would be around $ 20,000 , if I include money earned annually from the utility company .
That ’s because when my solar panels are producing more electricity that I ’m using , it gets fed back into the power grid and my electric meter essentially runs backward .
Would n’t it be nice to get a check from the local utility company , rather than keep sending them out ?
So , all of this begs the question : Did I make the wrong call on installing geothermal at Sheep Dog ?
I do n’t think so , because I can still install solar panels on our barn there , and that will be the subject of my next blog .

Google AI Challenge and Haskell list performance
Published on February 8 , 2010 under the tag A post about a typical issue with Haskell listsPublished on February 8 , 2010 under the tag haskell
What is this about
This blogpost is about the Google AI Challenge , which allows Haskell as a possible language one can write a bot in .
Unfortunately , the code they provide for Haskell is very inefficient .
Because the contest requires you to do all your calculations in one second , this is quite a setback .
This post is literate Haskell , so you should basically be able to paste it into a .lhs file and run it .
module Main where
First , we need some imports .
You can safely ignore these , but unfortunately the compiler cannot .
import Control .
Monad ( replicateM , forever ) ( replicateM , forever ) import qualified Data .
Array .
Unboxed as UA import Data .
Array .
Unboxed ( (! ) ) ( (! ) ) import Data .
List ( transpose ) ( transpose ) import System .
IO ( hSetBuffering , BufferMode ( LineBuffering ) , stdin , stdout ) ( hSetBuffering , ) , stdin , stdout )
We start by defining a Tile type .
Tiles are our points on the 2D map , so we can easily represent them as tuples :
type Tile = ( Int , Int )
This allows to write , for example , the code to determine the adjacent tiles in a very clear and concise way .
adjacentTiles :: Tile -> [ Tile ] = [ ( x , y - 1 ) adjacentTiles ( x , y ) [ ( x , y + 1 , y ) , ( x , y ) + 1 ) , ( x , y - 1 , y ) , ( x , y ) ]
But that is not what this article is about .
The thing is that in the code they provided as a starter package , they stored the information about the map in a [ [ Spot ] ] type – a matrix of Spot s , where a Spot would be either a wall , an empty tile , the player …
The problem with this is that Haskell ’s default lists are linked lists .
Imagine we have a m * n map – so m tiles wide and n tiles high .
In most other languages , you would expect you can access the elements in constant time – so O ( 1 ) .
But because we ’re using linked lists , this is not the case .
Worst case scenario , you would access the bottom right element .
This would take O( m + n ) time – and that is not acceptable .
So I ’ll abuse this blogpost to ramble about Haskell arrays .
data Board = Board { boardWidth :: Int , boardHeight :: Int , boardWalls :: UA .
UArray ( Int , Int ) Bool , boardBotPosition :: ( Int , Int ) , boardEnemyPosition :: ( Int , Int ) }
We use an “ Unboxed Immutable Array ” to store or walls .
A bit of context :
Unboxed : this is basically a counter - measure against Haskell ’s laziness .
While that can be very useful in certain situations , it is not here .
By using an unboxed array , we force the contents to be fully evaluated .
This means the array will not take up much more room than the corresponding array in C would .
: this is basically a counter - measure against Haskell ’s laziness .
While that can be very useful in certain situations , it is not here .
By using an unboxed array , we force the contents to be fully evaluated .
This means the array will not take up much more room than the corresponding array in C would .
Immutable : because we read the Board again every time – that ’s the way the engine works – we do n’t have to change the board at all .
This means we can simply write nice , purely functional code here .
The code to load this Board follows later – let ’s first see how we lookup a certain Tile in the Board :
isWall :: Board -> ( Int , Int ) ->
Bool = x < 0 || x >= boardWidth board isWall board ( x , y ) board Width board || y < 0 || y >= board Height board boardHeight board || boardWalls board !
( x , y ) boardWalls board( x , y )
Yep , we now have a function that runs in O ( 1 ) and that is quite efficient ( of course we have to do some basic boundary checks ) .
The code to read the Board is a little more complicated ( but also more interesting ) :
readBoard :: Int -> Int -> [ String ] ->
Board lines =
Board readBoard width height = width { boardWidthwidth = height , boardHeightheight = walls , boardWallswalls = find ' 1 ' , boardBotPositionfind = find ' 2 ' , boardEnemyPositionfind }
The width and height are passed to the function , along with a number of lines .
The real code happens in the where block :
where = concat $ transpose $ map ( take width ) lines stringtransposewidth ) = UA.listArray (( 0 , 0 ) , ( width - 1 , height - 1 ) ) string matrixUA.listArray ( ( ) , ( width , height ) ) string = UA.amap ( /= ' ' ) matrix wallsUA.amap ( ) matrix = head [ i | i <- UA.indices matrix , matrix !
i == c ] find c[ iUA.indices matrix , matrixc ]
What might not be obvious to see , is why we use transpose here .
transpose transposes a matrix – why would we want that ?
The answer is that I find it easier ( if you will , more “ natural ” ) to use ( x , y ) notation instead of ( row , column ) notation .
You can safely remove the transpose function and switch to ( row , column ) if you want , but I think the ( x , y ) notation is a little easier .
We also consider everything that is not a space character a wall – that includes the player and the enemy .
I do this because this makes my code easier ( and it makes sense in a way , you do n’t want to steer through yourself or the enemy ) .
Then we use a small find function to locate the player and the enemy in the array .
This find functions should run very fast , since looking up in arrays is , well , very fast .
We call this readBoard function more or less in the following way :
takeTurn :: IO ( ) ( ) = do takeTurn <- getLine line let [ width , height ] = map read $ words line [ width , height ] line lines <- replicateM height getLine replicateM height let board = readBoard width height lines boardreadBoard width height -- Select tile to go next .
--
Print out new direction to stdout .
putStrLn " 1 "
So we can make our main very short :
main :: IO ( ) ( ) = do hSetBuffering stdin LineBuffering mainhSetBuffering stdin LineBuffering hSetBuffering stdout forever takeTurn
Back in 2008 , Glenn Martin , an inventor based in New Zealand , took the wraps off " the world 's first practical jetpack , " a device memorably described by Monitor staffer Chris Gaylord as " two massive tea cups " that roar " louder than a pack of angry leafblowers . "
At the time , the contraption seemed more pipe dream than practical transportation platform .
But this week , Martin said he would begin mass producing the Martin Jetpack at a rate of 500 pairs of " massive tea cups " a year .
Martin Aircraft Company exec Richard Lauder told the Daily Mail that he envisioned the jetpack serving a variety of roles , from private use to emergency rescue .
" This could be life - saving stuff .
For us this is an excellent commercial step . "
For us , the jetpack sounds less like a rescue tool and more something that folks will need to be rescued from .
Close your eyes and imagine a sky full of part - time Rocketeers , zipping from home and to the mall , and then to pick up little Johnny from school .
And you thought rush hour traffic was bad now .
No word on how regulators will control use of the Martin jetpack , although the Daily Mail reports that the device is so light that consumers wo n't need a pilot 's license .
Let 's run down a few of the pertinent stats :
The Martin Jetpack weighs measures 5 - ft. by 5.5 - ft. , and weighs just over 500 pounds .
The Jetpack is built out of carbon fiber composite .
Fuel capacity is 5 US gallons .
Range is 31.5 miles , and the Jetpack can speed at 60 m.p.h. to an estimated altitude of 8,000 - ft .
The Jetpack comes equipped with flight and engine displays , a " ballistic parachute , " and an energy absorbing undercarriage , in case you bump into the neighbor 's garage .
The Daily Mail estimates that the Martin Jetpack will cost about $ 76,000 – the price of a very nice sports car .
The question is this :
How many folks with some extra pocket change are likely to choose an untested commodity such as a jetpack over a tried - and - true standby such as a bright red Porsche ?
( Or , maybe a water - power jetpack is your thing . )
We at the office are split , so we 'll leave that discussion up to you .

One year after the deadly airline crash of Continental 3407 in Buffalo , NY , FRONTLINE investigates the accident and discovers a dramatically changed airline industry , where regional carriers now account for half of the nation ’s daily departures .
The rise of the regionals and arrival of low - cost carriers have been a huge boon to consumers , and the industry insists that the skies remain safe .
But many insiders are worried that now , 30 years after airline deregulation , the aviation system is being stretched beyond its capacity to deliver service that is both cheap and safe .

Well this is something to look forward to … not .
Heinous Ugandan pastor Martin Ssempa ( who is , incidentally , Pastor Rick Warren 's man in Uganda ) is planning a " million man march " in support of the " " kill the gays " bill .
Reuters :
" The east African nation has faced intense pressure from Western governments and human rights groups over anti-homosexuality legislation tabled in parliament as a private members ' bill last year .
Museveni seemed to distance himself and the government from the proposed law on Tuesday , saying it was a foreign policy issue and calling for more talks .
The ex-rebel leader said he had been under pressure from Western leaders .
' We want to show how many people support the bill , ' Pastor Martin Ssempa told journalists in the Ugandan capital .
' We want to give a postcard that ( Museveni ) can send to his friend ( U.S. President ) Barack Obama , ' Ssempa said in front of posters saying ' Africans Unite Against Sodomy ' and ' Barack Obama Back Off ' .
He said the march was planned for February 17 .
Ssempa , one of Uganda 's most prominent anti-gay campaigners , criticised Western nations as ' failed states ' for supporting gay rights . "
From Max Blumenthal 's article on Rick Warren and Uganda published a year ago :
MUMBAI , India — Cristiana Peruzzo , 35 , describes herself as a short , slim , relatively plain looking Italian woman .
“ I like myself , ” she says , “ but I do n’t consider myself a sex bomb . ”
She would date in Italy , but she never got a tremendous amount of attention .
Then she moved to Mumbai .
Peruzzo joined a social networking site to meet people and was suddenly bombarded with interest from men .
Over the course of a few months , she met 16 of the almost 50 men who contacted her .
Peruzzo says that during the first encounter , the men would act like they , too , were interested in friendship .
But the mood would quickly change .
Many would assume she wanted to have an affair with them even though she expressed no interest , she says .
And they would not back off .
Some would send a barrage of text messages and call day and night .
One phoned 10 times a day for months , she says , even though she told him she was not interested and stopped answering her phone .
Peruzzo is not alone .
While many — if not most —
Indian men do not act this way , the behavior is common enough that plenty of foreign women living in Mumbai jumped at the chance to tell stories about experiences they have had with men who just do not get the hint .
Some foreign women here consider the behavior , which can be characterized as an extreme amount of one - sided communication , as innocent flirting .
Others find the barrage of messages and phone calls to be nothing short of harassment or even virtual stalking .
Peruzzo received so many texts that she began transcribing them in a diary .
It filled 68 pages , she says .
A shipping company executive who she had just met wrote : “ sleeping … alone ... do you want to come over ? ? ”
A multinational executive , married with two kids , wrote : “ my name means Cobra in Hindi n my cobra is a darling !
u hv 2 make him dance according 2 ur tunes !
he can dance as long as u want him to .
Will u make him dance ? ”
Australian journalist Virginia Moncrieff , who has worked across Asia , Africa and the Middle East , remembers being in India and having a long chat with a university student .
She gave him her phone number , and he proceeded to call and text countless times a day .
“ I still can't figure out why , when I was so obviously displeased and bothered by the endless , endless calls that my new ‘ friend ’ just could not , and would not , stop contacting me , ” she wrote in an email .
According to cross-culture and gender specialists , this behavior in " new India " is a result of shifting social norms , a low level of interaction between opposite sexes , influences of pop culture and differing interpretations of power dynamics between men and women .
As Mumbai changes and modernizes , there is confusion over what type of behavior is acceptable in personal as well as work environments , says Jerry Pinto , author of " Surviving Women , " a manual of gender politics in India .
“ We are going through a period in which no one is quite sure what the rules are , ” he says .
While harassment of women happens all over the world , the behavior may be more crude in India because there is a lack of understanding of sexual and political correctness , says Sameera Khan , a journalist and writer who covers gender issues .
In the West , more workplaces and universities have clear policies instructing people what is acceptable behavior .
In places like Mumbai , she says , there is often no understanding where the line is drawn and people freely mock those with less power .
At workplaces , for example , some employees send around mass emails blatantly making fun of women and lower caste people , she says .
Many Indian men grow up having very little contact with women outside their family , cross-cultural and management consultant Rajeshwar Balasundaram wrote in an email .
Men sit separately from women on public transportation and at schools and do not develop platonic friendships .
When they meet foreign women , they rely on the stereotypes they have acquired through Hollywood and Bollywood movies of foreign women as free and loose .
These men think they can communicate freely with these foreign women , but sometimes they get carried away .
“ They think the Western woman is fair game , ” says Times of India columnist Bachi Karkaria .
A foreigner might be trying to make friends , but if she gives a man her phone number , he assumes she wants to take the relationship further , Karkaria says .
Bollywood films also convey that a man will succeed at seducing a woman by continuing to pursue her .
Indrajit Chattopadhyay says he flirts with women by sending them five to 10 text messages a day .
If she does not respond to the initial messages , he continues sending them .
“ If I find the water is cold , I try and make it warm before taking it forward , ” he says .
Chattopadhyay , who lives near New Delhi , says that he listens to women ’s signals and only continues when she shows interest .
He just continues a bit longer than men do in the West .
“ If I send five [ text messages ] today and no response , and five tomorrow and no response , obviously I will trickle down to two and then one and then zero , ” he says .
Foreign women here say they have learned to tame their usual friendliness to avoid being the objects of incessant attention .
When Maddie Gressel , 22 , first moved to Rajasthan in northwestern India , she was eager to make friends and would freely give away her phone number , she says .
But she quickly learned that men assumed she was interested in more .
She started receiving text messages 10 times a day with poems like , “ Love is the flower you hold in your hand . ”
Gressel says she no longer gives away her number easily .
Other women block numbers on their phone , avoid making eye contact with men at bars or on the street , and stop being so friendly .
Peruzzo says she turns her phone off every night to avoid text messages from men she thought were just friends .
She has also stopped meeting men through the social networking site .
“ At the beginning you do it because it ’s nice and it really raises your self esteem .
At 35 to have so much attention ! ” she says with a laugh .
“ But then you have to pay for it , and I was n’t willing to pay for it . ”
Dylan Rattigan on MSNBC recently gave Rep. Wassersman - Schulz ( D - Fl ) a hard time about the health care package .
He disputed her contention the bill was a big win for consumers .
He wanted to know why the stock prices for Big Insurers ( e.g. , Aetna , Cigna , Wellpoint , United Health ) shot up if this was such a big loss for them .
Unfortunately , he was so exercised on the point , he did n't give her a chance to address the question .
It 's an important question .
Asked another way , the question is " Why are stocks in this sector at a 52 - week high if this legislation is such a blow to their profits ? "
That 's worth investigating .
Follow the money and things get real clear real fast .

The validity of Rattigan 's point is clear even with this thumbnail of a stock chart .
A lot of stocks are up over the last 52 weeks .
This chart covers the last three months .
It compares the S&P 500 to stock prices for some large health insurance companies .
Each one is represented by a different color as follows :
S&P 500 ( brown ) , Cigna ( red ) , Aetna ( blue ) , Wellpoint ( gold ) , and United Health ( green ) .
TheS&P 500 , a broad indicator of the market , fluctuates but is largely unchanged .
However , all the health insurers fell towards the end of September , for an average loss of about 12 % .
They stayed down throughout October .
However , they started rising in November to reverse their losses .
Last week they all moved again .
This time to gain over the S&P .
In sum , over the last three months , these stocks have posted an average 10 % gain , after making up their losses .
That 's about a 20 % swing in value .
That 's a big move compared to the overall market .
It 's true these stocks are more volatile than the overall index .
That 's the point of the index , to smooth out volatility .
The fact these stocks all move in concert shows they are being affected by the same forces .
That 's not surprising .
Stocks in the same sector should be responding in roughly similar ways to the same news .
The interesting point is when they made their moves .
That reflects the conversation of the time .
Where were we in mid-September ?
On September 9 , Obama had made a clear pitch for the public option in his speech on health care .
This resonated with the public .
A CBS poll from that time showed growing public suport for a public option .
The reason people argue for a public option is to provide a competitive break on run away prices .
That would not be good for profits .
The stocks fell .
Where were we in early November ?
Lieberman had become the center of attention .
He made it clear he was n't supporting a public option .
Of course , it was not just Joe blowing smoke that moved the stocks .
Even if he did support it , the public option was so diluted it would n't matter .
As Ezra Klien noted , the public option at that point would n't be available to 90 % of the people in states that allowed it .
Nor would it have any pricing leverage over private competitors .
Basically it was going to be hollow .
Safe in the knowledge their profits were n't going to get hammered , the stocks started to rise .
What happened in early December ?
On December 10th , Pelosi caved on the public option .
That followed the death of expanded Medicare .
That killed any hope the House would force this back on track .
In other words , the profits of these companies are going to be just fine .
Once again , stock values jumped .
The bottom line : During those different time points a lot of ink got spilled , pixels got burned , and bytes bit it .
But for all the noise , one thing is clear .
If you want to know how the insurance companies are viewing the legislation , just follow their stock prices .
The second image is a comparison for the same stocks over the last year .
See the cliff they all fell off towards the end of February ?
That was their response to Obama 's February 24 speech in front of a joint session of congress where he announced health care reform was a central pillar of his recovery strategy .
It did n't take the folks at Cigna long to figure out that was just noise .
You do n't need to believe in conspiracy theories to see that people who buy stocks in this sector are responding to the political kabuki by betting insurers will do just fine .
Immortalized in ' Charlie Wilson 's War , ' former Texas Rep. Charlie Wilson helped arm Afghans to defeat the Soviets .
Charlie Wilson dies
Former Rep. Charlie Wilson , a colorful 12 - term congressman who pushed the covert action that helped Afghanistan rebels defeat the mighty Soviet Union , died Wednesday afternoon at a hospital in Lufkin , Texas .
Wilson , 76 , was pronounced dead at 12:16 p.m. of cardiopulmonary arrest when he arrived in the emergency room of the Memorial Health System of East Texas , a hospital spokeswoman said .

Wilson , a Democrat , became a national celebrity in old age after Tom Hanks played him in a 2007 movie called “ Charlie Wilson ’s War , ” a dramatic retelling of his push from Congress for the Reagan administration to support anti-Soviet forces in the country .
His nickname on Capitol Hill was " Good Time Charlie " because he loved his liquor and populated his staff ranks with young , attractive women .
The 6 - foot - 4 , cowboy - boot - wearing Texan was largely considered a political lightweight until he got serious about using covert funds to arm the Afghan resistance in the early 1980s .
His position on the powerful foreign operations subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee gave him the platform he needed to covertly funnel more than $ 1 billion to the Afghan cause .
That money helped buy the Stinger missiles and other weapons the Afghans needed to challenge the Soviets .
Former Rep. Martin Frost ( D - Texas ) , who served in the House with Wilson for two decades , called him " an extraordinary public servant " who changed American foreign policy with his push to support the Afghan mujahedeen , who were fighting the Soviet Union ’s massive army .
Frost told POLITICO that the stories about Wilson ’s involvement " were completely true . "
In a 2003 book , which the movie was based on , author George Crile called the effort “ the biggest and most successful CIA campaign in history . ”
He said the two central figures behind the operation were Wilson and Gust Avrakotos , a CIA officer whom he worked with closely .
“ Wilson so easily crossed the line into this covert arena that no one stopped to question his right to be there or worry about the precedent he might be setting , ” Crile wrote .
What was perhaps most remarkable about the Afghanistan operation is that it stayed quiet for as long as it did .
At a time when Congress was holding hearings on the Reagan administration ’s support for the Contras in Nicaragua , a massive infusion of money was going to anti-communist Afghan rebels without any public notice .
Frost , the former congressman , also said that the portrayal of Wilson as a hard - drinking womanizer in the movie " Charlie Wilson 's War " was , if anything , subdued .
Wilson 's partying often got him into trouble .
He was investigated in the 1980s by the House ethics committee and Rudy Giuliani , then a federal prosecutor , for marijuana and cocaine use , but no charges were ever brought against him .
At one point , Wilson owned part of dance club called Elan on K Street .
In 1983 , Wilson was suspected of drunken driving when he lost control of his Lincoln and crashed into a Mazda on the Key Bridge .
" Tom Hanks underplayed him in the movie , " Frost said .
" Charlie was actually far more colorful than that . "
Charlie Nesbitt Wilson was born on June 1 , 1933 .
He graduated from the Naval Academy in Annapolis and served as a lieutenant before returning to the part of east Texas where he grew up .
Legend has it that Wilson first got involved in politics when an incumbent on the City Council poisoned his dog .
He served in the Texas House from 1960 to 1966 and then in the state Senate from 1967 to 1973 .
He won his first House race in 1972 , the same year Richard Nixon won reelection in a landslide .
His positions were n’t always popular with voters in his conservative district , especially on abortion and civil rights , but he put a great deal of energy into constituent services .
“ While his personal lifestyle might not have been in sync with a majority of Lufkinites , his constituents saw that he was one of them , represented them and their interests and did a whole lot of other good stuff , ” Norm Ornstein said Wednesday .
In an interview with the Dallas Morning News , Wilson described himself as " a liberal Democrat . ”
“ I believe in being a dove , but a heavily armed dove , ” Wilson said .
“ I believe the Soviet Union did not mean us well .
I despised the tyranny . "
Wilson was disheartened when the administration of President George H.W. Bush did not support continuing increases in aid for Afghanistan when the Cold War had ended .
He decided to retire in 1996 , resigning before his term ended , when Newt Gingrich was House speaker .
For the first time , Wilson was n’t part of the majority .
He then worked as a registered lobbyist — his clients included the government of Pakistan — for about a decade after he left Congress .
Wilson stopped drinking in 1998 and got married in 1999 .
Poor health and a desire to retire led him to move back to the district he had represented .
In 2007 , he underwent a heart transplant .
He is survived by his wife , Barbara , and a sister , Sharon Allison .
Said Frost , the former Texas congressman : " There will be no more Charlie Wilsons . "

TOKYO ( MarketWatch ) --
A group led by Tishman Speyer Properties will give up the Manhattan - based Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town apartment complex to its creditors , according to published reports Monday .
Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty bought the complexes four years ago for $ 5.4 billion in the most expensive real estate deal for a single residential property in U.S. history .
By Kiraz Janicke , Caracas
December 16 , 2009 – Venezuelanalysis.com – During his speech to the 15th United Nations Climate Change Summit ( COP15 ) in Copenhagen , Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez slammed the “ lack of political will ” of the most powerful nations to take serious action to avert climate change , and called for systemic change to save the planet .
Chavez , who received a standing ovation for his speech , said the process in Copenhagen is “ not democratic ; it is not inclusive ” .
In particular , he criticised an attempt by rich countries to overturn the Kyoto Protocol .
Doing so would eliminate differentiation between the obligations of rich and poor countries , treating countries from the global North and South as equally responsible for climate change .
“ There is a group of countries that believe they are superior to those of us from the South , to those of us from the Third Word … this does not surprise us … we are again faced with powerful evidence of global imperial dictatorship ” , Chavez said .
The Venezuelan president also applauded the initiative of the protesters outside the summit who were calling for serious measures to stop catastrophic climate change .
“ There are many people outside ...
I 've read in the news that there were some arrests , some intense protests there in the streets of Copenhagen , and I salute all those people out there , the majority of them youth …
They are young people concerned for the world ’s future , ” he said .
“ I have been reading some of the slogans painted in the streets …
One said , ‘ Do n’t Change the Climate , Change the System ! ’
And I bring that on board for us .
Let ’s not change the climate .
Let ’s change the system !
And as a consequence , we will begin to save the planet .
Capitalism is a destructive development model that is putting an end to life , that threatens to put a definitive end to the human species . ”
Another notable slogan is , “ If the climate were a bank , they would have bailed it out already ” , Chavez said during his speech .
“ It ’s true ; the rich governments have saved the capitalist banks ” , he said , but they lack the “ political will ” to make the necessary reductions to greenhouse emissions .
“ One could say there is a spectre at Copenhagen , to paraphrase Karl Marx … almost no - one wants to mention it : the spectre of capitalism " , he declared .
History requires all people to struggle against capitalism , and if we do n’t , life on the planet “ will disappear ” .
“ Do the rich think they can go to another planet when they ’ve destroyed this one ? ” he asked as he recommended a copy of a book by Hervé Kampf , How the Rich are Destroying the Planet .
“ Climate change is undoubtedly the most devastating environmental problem of this century .
Floods , droughts , severe storms , hurricanes , melting ice caps , rise in average sea levels , ocean acidification , and heat waves , all of that sharpens the impact of global crisis besetting us ” , he continued .
Human activity is exceeding the limits of sustainability and endangering life on the planet , but the impacts of climate change are also being felt disproportionately by the world ’s poor , Chavez explained .

Chavez called for the summit to change direction .
“ We can not continue like this .
Let ’s change course , but without cynicism , without lies , without double agendas , no documents out of the blue , with the truth out in the open ” , he said .
“ From Venezuela we ask :
How much longer are we going to allow such injustices and inequalities ?
How much longer are we going to tolerate the current international economic order and prevailing market mechanisms ? ” , Chavez questioned .
Outside in the streets of Copenhagen mass demonstrations calling for “ climate justice ” have been repressed by police using pepper spray and batons .
More than 1000 people have been arrested .
According to various reports , poor nations argue that rich countries should reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
The European Union has pledged a 20 per cent reduction .
The US however , has only offered only a 3 - 4 per cent cut .
The behind - the - scenes negotiations at the summit have been marked by sharp disputes between the US and China , and between rich and poor nations .
Poor countries have criticised rich countries for attempting to set inadequate emissions targets for industrialised countries and for pledging insufficient funding for poor countries to alleviate the impacts of climate change .
Using this analysis , Chave argued that it was not feasible to call for countries such as the US and China to sit at the summit on an equal footing , insisting that the same obligations cannot be imposed on both nations .
The US , with a population of 300 million , consumes more than 20 million barrels of oil a day , while China , whose population is almost five times greater than that of the US , consumes around 5 - 6 million barrels a day , he pointed out .

Copenhagen , Kingdom of Denmark
December 16 , 2009
President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela , Hugo Chávez :
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , Excellencies , friends , I promise that I will not talk more than most have spoken this afternoon .
Allow me an initial comment which I would have liked to make as part of the previous point which was expressed by the delegations of Brazil , China , India , and Bolivia .
We were there asking to speak but it was not possible .
Bolivia 's representative said , my salute of course to Comrade President Evo Morales , who is there , President of the Republic of Bolivia .
[ Audience applause ]
She said among other things the following , I noted it here , she said the text presented is not democratic , it is not inclusive .
I had hardly arrived and we were just sitting down when we heard the president of the previous session , the minister , saying that a document came about , but nobody knows , I 've asked for the document , but we still do n’t have it , I think nobody knows of that top secret document .
Now certainly , as the Bolivian comrade said , that is not democratic , it is not inclusive .
Now , ladies and gentlemen , is n’t that just the reality of the world ?
Are we in a democratic world ?
Is the global system inclusive ?
Can we hope for something democratic , inclusive from the current global system ?
What we are experiencing on this planet is an imperial dictatorship , and from here we continue denouncing it .
Down with imperial dictatorship !
And long live the people and democracy and equality on this planet !
[ Audience applause ]
And what we see here is a reflection of this : Exclusion .
There is a group of countries that consider themselves superior to us in the South , to us in the Third World , to us , the underdeveloped countries , or as a great friend Eduardo Galeano says , we , the crushed countries , as if a train ran over us in history .
In light of this , it ’s no surprise that there is no democracy in the world and here we are again faced with powerful evidence of global imperial dictatorship .
Then two youths got up here , fortunately the enforcement officials were decent , some push around , and they collaborated right ?
There are many people outside , you know ?
Of course , they do not fit in this room , they are too many people .
I 've read in the news that there were some arrests , some intense protests , there in the streets of Copenhagen , and I salute all those people out there , most of them youth .
[ Audience applause ]
Of course young people are concerned , I think rightly much more than we are , for the future of the world .
We have -- most of us here - the sun on our backs , and they have to face the sun and are very worried .
One could say , Mr. President , that a spectre is haunting Copenhagen , to paraphrase Karl Marx , the great Karl Marx , a spectre is haunting the streets of Copenhagen , and I think that spectre walks silently through this room , walking around among us , through the halls , out below , it rises , this spectre is a terrible spectre almost nobody wants to mention it : Capitalism is the spectre , almost nobody wants to mention it .
[ Audience applause ]
It ’s capitalism , the people roar , out there , hear them .
I have been reading some of the slogans painted on the streets , and I think those slogans of these youngsters , some of which I heard when I was young , and of the young woman there , two of which I noted .
You can hear among others , two powerful slogans .
One :
Do n’t change the climate , change the system .
[ Audience applause ]
And I take it onboard for us .
Let ’s not change the climate , let ’s change the system !
And consequently we will begin to save the planet .
Capitalism is a destructive development model that is putting an end to life ; it threatens to put a definitive end to the human species .
And another slogan calls for reflection .
It is very in tune with the banking crisis that swept the world and still affects it , and of how the rich northern countries gave aid to bankers and the big banks .
The U.S. alone gave , well , I lost the figure , but it is astronomical , to save the banks .
They say in the streets the following :
If the climate were a bank it would have been saved already .
[ Audience applause ]
And I think that 's true .
If the climate were one of the biggest capitalist banks , the rich governments would have saved it .
I think Obama has not arrived .
He received the Nobel Peace Prize almost the same day that he sent 30 thousand soldiers to kill more innocents in Afghanistan , and now he comes to stand here with the Nobel Peace Prize , the president of the United States .
But the United States has the machinery to make money , to make dollars , and has saved , well , they believe they have saved the banks and the capitalist system .
Well , this is a side comment that I wanted to make previously .
We were raising our hand to accompany Brazil , India , Bolivia , China , in their interesting position that Venezuela and the countries of the Bolivarian Alliance firmly share .
But hey , they did n’t let us speak , so do not count these minutes please , Mr. President .
[ Audience applause ]
Look , over there I met , I had the pleasure of meeting this French author Hervé Kempf .
Recommending this book , I recommend it , it is available in Spanish – there is Hervé - its also in French , and surely in English , How the Rich are Destroying the Planet .
Hervé Kempf : How the Rich are Destroying the Planet .
This is what Christ said : it would be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven .
This is what our lord Christ said .
[ Audience applause ]
The rich are destroying the planet .
Do they think the can go to another when they destroy this one ?
Do they have plans to go to another planet ?
So far there is none on the horizon of the galaxy .
This book has just reached me , Ignacio Ramonet gave it to me , and he is also around somewhere in this room .
Finishing the prologue or the preamble this phrase is very important , Kempf says the following , I ’ll read it :
“ We can not reduce global material consumption if we do n’t make the powerful go down several levels , and if we do n’t combat inequality .
It is necessary that to the ecological principle that is so useful at the time of becoming conscious , ‘ think globally and act locally , ’ we add the principle that the situation imposes : ‘ Consume less and share better . ’ ”
I think it is good advice that this French author Hervé Kempf gives us .
[ Audience applause ]
Well then , Mr. President , climate change is undoubtedly the most devastating environmental problem of this century .
Floods , droughts , severe storms , hurricanes , melting ice caps , rise in mean sea levels , ocean acidification and heat waves , all of that sharpens the impact of global crisis besetting us .
Current human activity exceeds the threshold of sustainability , endangering life on the planet , but also in this we are profoundly unequal .
I want to recall : the 500 million richest people , 500 million , this is seven percent , seven percent , seven percent of the world ’s population .
This seven percent is responsible , these 500 million richest people are responsible for 50 percent of emissions , while the poorest 50 percent accounts for only seven percent of emissions .
So it strikes me as a bit strange to put the United States and China at the same level .
The United States has just , well ; it will soon reach 300 million people .
China has nearly five times the U.S. population .
The United Status consumes more than 20 million barrels of oil a day , China only reaches 5 - 6 million barrels a day , you ca n’t ask the same of the United States and China .
There are issues to discuss , hopefully we the heads of states and governments can sit down and discuss the truth , the truth about these issues .
So , Mr. President , 60 percent of the planet ’s ecosystems are damaged , 20 percent of the earth 's crust is degraded , we have been impassive witnesses to deforestation , land conversion , desertification , deterioration of fresh water systems , overexploitation of marine resources , pollution and loss of biodiversity .
The overuse of the land exceeds by 30 percent the capacity to regenerate it .
The planet is losing what the technicians call the ability to regulate itself ; the planet is losing this .
Every day more waste than can be processed is released .
The survival of our species hammers in the consciousness of humanity .
Despite the urgency , it has taken two years of negotiations for a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol , and we attend this event without any real and meaningful agreement .
And indeed , on the text that comes from out of the blue , as some have called it , Venezuela says , and the ALBA countries , the Bolivarian Alliance say that we will not accept , since then we ’ve said it , any other texts that do not come from working groups under the Kyoto Protocol and the Convention .
They are the legitimate texts that we have been discussing so intensely over the years .
[ Audience applause ]
And in these last few hours , I believe you have not slept , plus you have not eaten , you have not slept .
It does not seem logical to me to come out now with a document from scratch , as you say .
The scientifically substantiated objective of reducing the emission of polluting gases and achieving an agreement on long - term cooperation clearly , today at this time , has apparently failed , for now .
What is the reason ?
We have no doubt .
The reason is the irresponsible attitude and lack of political will from the most powerful nations on the planet .
No one should feel offended , I recall the great José Gervasio Artigas when he said : “ With the truth , I neither offend nor fear . ”
But it is actually an irresponsible attitude of positions , of reversals , of exclusions , of elitist management of a problem that belongs to everyone and that we can only solve together .
The political conservatism and selfishness of the largest consumers , of the richest countries shows high insensitivity and lack of solidarity with the poor , the hungry , and the most vulnerable to disease , to natural disasters .
Mr. President , a new and single agreement is essential , applicable to absolutely unequal parties , according to the magnitude of their contributions and economic , financial and technological capabilities and based on unconditional respect for the principles contained in the Convention .
Developed countries should set binding , clear and concrete commitments for the substantial reduction of their emissions and assume obligations of financial and technological assistance to poor countries to cope with the destructive dangers of climate change .
In this respect , the uniqueness of island states and least developed countries should be fully recognized .
Mr. President , climate change is not the only problem facing humanity today .
Other scourges and injustices beset us , the gap between rich and poor countries has continued to grow , despite all the millennium goals , the Monterrey financing summit , at all these summits as the President of Senegal said here , revealing a great truth , there are promises and unfulfilled promises and the world continues its destructive march .
The total income of the 500 richest individuals in the world is greater than the income of the 416 million poorest people .
The 2.8 billion people living in poverty on less than $ 2 per day , representing 40 per percent of the global population , receive only 5 percent of world income .
Today each year about 9.2 million children die before reaching their fifth year and 99.9 percent of these deaths occur in poorer countries .
Infant mortality is 47 deaths per thousand live births , but is only 5 per thousand in rich countries .
Life expectancy on the planet is 67 years , in rich countries it is 79 , while in some poor nations is only 40 years .
Additionally , there are 1.1 billion people without access to drinking water , 2.6 billion without sanitation services , over 800 million illiterate and 1.02 billion hungry people , that ’s the global scenario .
Now the cause , what is the cause ?
Let ’s talk about the cause , let ’s not evade responsibilities , and let ’s not evade the depth of this problem .
The cause , undoubtedly , I return to the theme of this whole disastrous panorama , is the destructive metabolic system of capital and its embodied model : Capitalism .
Here ’s a quote that I want to read briefly , from that great liberation theologian Leonardo Boff , as we know a Brazilian , our American .
Leonardo
Boff says on this subject as follows :
“ What is the cause ?
Ah , the cause is the dream of seeking happiness through material accumulation and of endless progress , using for this science and technology with which they can exploit without limits all the resources of the earth . ”
And he cites here Charles Darwin and his “ natural selection ” , the survival of the fittest , but we know that the strongest survive over the ashes of the weakest .
Jean Jacques Rousseau , we must always remember , said that between the strong and the weak , freedom is oppressed .
That ’s why the Empire speaks of freedom ; it ’s the freedom to oppress , to invade , to kill , to annihilate , and to exploit .
That is their freedom , and Rousseau adds this saving phrase : “ Only the law liberates . ”
There are countries that are hoping that no document comes out of here precisely because they do not want a law , do not want a standard , because the absence of these norms allows them to play at their exploitative freedom , their crushing freedom .
We must make an effort and pressure here and in the streets , so that a commitment comes out of here , a document that commits the most powerful countries on earth .
[ Audience applause ]
Well , Mr. President , Leonardo Boff asks ...
Have you met Boff ?
I do not know whether Leonardo might come , I met him recently in Paraguay , we ’ve always read him .
Can a finite earth support an infinite project ?
The thesis of capitalism , infinite development , is a destructive pattern , let ’s face it .
Then Boff asks us , what might we expect from Copenhagen ?
At least this simple confession :
We can not continue like this .
And a simple proposition : Let ’s change course .
Let 's do it , but without cynicism , without lies , without double agendas , no documents out of the blue , with the truth out in the open .
How long , we ask from Venezuela , Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , how long are we going to allow such injustices and inequalities ?
How long are we going to tolerate the current international economic order and prevailing market mechanisms ?
How long are we going to allow huge epidemics like HIV / AIDS to ravage entire populations ?
How long are we going to allow the hungry to not eat or to be able to feed their own children ?
How long are we going to allow millions of children to die from curable diseases ?
How long will we allow armed conflicts to massacre millions of innocent human beings in order for the powerful to seize the resources of other peoples ?
Cease the aggressions and the wars !
We the peoples of the world ask of the empires , to those who try to continue dominating the world and exploiting us .
No more imperial military bases or military coups !
Let ’s build a more just and equitable economic and social order , let ’s eradicate poverty , let ’s immediately stop the high emission levels , let ’s stop environmental degradation and avoid the great catastrophe of climate change , let ’s integrate ourselves into the noble goal of everyone being more free and united .
Mr. President , almost two centuries ago , a universal Venezuelan , a liberator of nations and precursor of consciences left to posterity a full - willed maxim : “ If nature opposes us , let ’s fight against it and make it obey us . ”
That was Simón Bolívar , the Liberator .
From Bolivarian Venezuela , where a day like today some ten years ago , ten years exactly , we experienced the biggest climate tragedy in our history ( the Vargas tragedy it is called ) , from this Venezuela whose revolution tries to win justice for all people , we say it is only possible through the path of socialism !
Socialism , the other spectre Karl Marx spoke about , which walks here too , rather it is like a counter - spectre .
Socialism , this is the direction , this is the path to save the planet , I do n’t have the least doubt .
Capitalism is the road to hell , to the destruction of the world .
We say this from Venezuela , which because of socialism faces threats from the U.S. Empire .
From the countries that comprise ALBA , the Bolivarian Alliance , we call , and I want to , with respect , but from my soul , call in the name of many on this planet , we say to governments and peoples of the Earth , to paraphrase Simón Bolívar , the Liberator :
If the destructive nature of capitalism opposes us , let ’s fight against it and make it obey us , let ’s not wait idly by for the death of humanity .
History calls on us to unite and to fight .
If capitalism resists , we are obliged to take up a battle against capitalism and open the way for the salvation of the human species .
It ’s up to us , raising the banners of Christ , Mohammed , equality , love , justice , humanity , the true and most profound humanism .
If we do n’t do it , the most wonderful creation of the universe , the human being , will disappear , it will disappear .
This planet is billions of years old , and this planet existed for billions of years without us , the human species , i.e. it does n’t need us to exist .
Now , without the Earth we will not exist , and we are destroying Pachamama as Evo says , as our indigenous brothers from South America say .
Finally , Mr. President , and to finish , let ’s listen to Fidel Castro when he said : “ One species is in danger of extinction : Humanity . ”
Let ’s listen to Rosa Luxemburg when she said : “ Socialism or barbarism . ”
Let us listen to Christ the Redeemer when he said : “ Blessed are the poor for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . ”
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , we are capable of not making this Earth the tomb of humanity .
Let us make this earth a heaven , a heaven of life , of peace , peace and brotherhood for all humanity , for the human species .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much and enjoy your meal .

“ Asked in an interview with Alex Jones , the far - right conspiracy theorist , what Trump should do against Democrats who “ think they can steal ” the election , Roger Stone — a close confidant of the president whose 40 - month prison sentence for witness tampering and lying to Congress was commuted by Trump earlier this year — said that “ the ballots in Nevada on election night should be seized by federal marshals and taken from the state ” because “ they are completely corrupted . ”
He also urged the president to declare “ martial law ” and invoke the Insurrection Act to arrest political opponents . ”

“ In case you did n’t notice , we ’re being governed by armed thugs , criminals and traitors , who would as readily shoot you as spare you if it serves their purposes .

Already Trump supporters are outside at the polls harassing voters .
Like their president , they must know that without violence , intimidation , and voter suppression on their part , their candidate does n’t have a chance .
We ’re more than a month out from the election but already the mob rule we ’ve been expecting has begun .
Trump says he may issue an executive order preventing Biden from being elected .
And he is making a big issue about voter fraud ( which is almost nonexistent ) while at the same time suggesting people vote twice , no doubt in order to create voter fraud so he can blame that if he loses .
The despotism and desperation of this administration is very much out in the open , and his followers either approve of it or do n’t care .
An increasingly likely outcome to this election is that most Democrats , sanely not wanting to expose themselves to Covid - 19 and harassment at the polls , will vote by mail , while Republicans will go in person to the polls .
The mail - in ballots wo n’t be counted by election eve by states unaccustomed to mail - in voting ( and could possibly be sabotaged by state officials who want a delay ) .
Trump will declare victory that night , will be backed by the courts , and the actual result will not matter .

" To present such a proposal as a serious attempt at restraining spending is to reveal a low opinion of the intelligence of ordinary Americans , " - Karl Rove .
In the end , all you can do is marvel at the vileness of such people , their total lack of any shame , sense of accountability , responsibility or honesty .
Rove will advise Republicans to oppose any tax increases and to blame all spending cuts on Democrats if the debt commission comes through .
What we saw last night was a president , defending his campaign pledges , against a Washington that has abandoned almost any pretense of tackling any of the actual problems faced by this country , in favor of talk radio grandstanding , FNC propaganda , Democratic cowardice , and Republican cynicism .
And in his eight years of destroying this country 's fiscal balance , moral standing and national security , it takes a man of Rove 's deep cynicism to stand up and lambaste the one man prepared to do something .

Monopoly is about to get a makeover .
The 75 year old game will be relaunched with a circular board , and no cash .
Other than the lack of corners and currency , the game remains unchanged , which should mean that the inevitably marathon sessions will be just as boring as ever .
Apparently , when the game was first designed by fun-haters all those years ago , one of the original concepts was circular .
We like this new , more compact version , and the modern design is a lot cleaner .
But what about the money ?
Spoil - sports at Hasbro have taken the only bit of fun from the game : stealing money from the bank .
Each player now has a credit - card , which is slotted into a computerized console in the center of the board .
Or should that read " bored " ?
This stops you sneaking cash from your brother 's pile when he is distracted by your cunning dice - tossed - accidentally - under - the - sofa move .
New , circular Monopoly will be available as an insomnia cure later this year .

The Dutch troops were to have returned in 2008 A day after his cabinet collapsed , the Dutch prime minister says he expects Dutch troops to end their mission in Afghanistan in August as expected .
" If nothing else will take its place , then it ends , " Jan Peter Balkenende told Dutch television .
The cabinet fell after the two largest parties failed to agree on a Nato request to extend the tour of the almost 2,000 - strong Dutch contingent .
A Nato spokesman said it would provide support to Afghans whatever happened .
The uncertainty over their deployment comes as Nato , US and Afghan forces are engaged in a large military offensive against the Taliban in neighbouring Helmand .
The governor of Uruzgan province said peace and reconstruction efforts would suffer a setback if the Dutch left .
Asadullah Hamdam told the BBC they were playing a vital role building roads , training the Afghan police and providing security for civilians .
" If they withdraw and leave these projects incomplete , then they will leave a big vacuum , " he added .
Dutch troops have been stationed in Afghanistan since 2006 .
They should have returned home in 2008 , but their deployment was extended by two years because no other Nato member state offered replacements .
In October , the Dutch parliament voted that the deployment must definitely end by August 2010 .
Mr Balkenende 's government had not endorsed that vote , and the finance minister and leader of the Labour Party , Wouter Bos , demanded an immediate ruling from the prime minister .
When they failed to reach a compromise during marathon talks that continued into the early hours of Saturday , Labour said it was pulling out of the coalition .
Later , Mr Balkenende said there was no common ground and offered his cabinet 's resignation to Queen Beatrix by telephone .
Deadly place
The launch in 2001 of Nato 's International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) for Afghanistan was the organisation 's first and largest ground operation outside Europe .
As of October 2009 , Isaf had more than 71,000 personnel from 42 different countries including the US , Canada , European countries , Australia , Jordan and New Zealand .
The US provides the bulk of foreign forces in Afghanistan , and President Barack Obama has announced an extra 30,000 American troops for Afghanistan .
The Pentagon has said the next 18 months could prove crucial for the international mission in Afghanistan , after more than eight years of efforts to stabilise the country .
Afghanistan remains a deadly place for foreign forces .
Suicide attacks on Afghan civilians and roadside bomb strikes on international troops are common , with the Taliban strongly resurgent in many areas of the country .

The picture that follows this post was taken in Rome in 2007 .
It was an extraordinarily lovely evening in late May , and I had taken my two dear friends , Fr. Mankowski and Catholic author Mary Jo Anderson , out to dinner at my favorite restaurant , the dearly departed Il Passetto , of happy memory .
( The waiter in the picture was named Romeo .
I had eaten there enough to get to know and love him .
He had a wonderful explanation of why a good waiter is like a priest , which I wish I could remember .
And a deep devotion to St. Rita , whom he was convinced would someday help him come into a lot of money . )
At the end of the dinner , I had a plan .
I was going to get someone to take our picture , so I 'd have a remembrance of the evening .
I knew I had to act fast and with stealth , because I knew that Fr. Mankowski would object to having his picture taken .
As I handed the camera to a waiter , Fr. Mankowski initiated his move to exit stage left by scooting his chair out of frame .
I gave him my best executive producer " you WILL do what I say " look and said , " Shut up , you 're in this . "
I must have convinced him that I had some leverage ( I certainly did not ) because he scooted his chair back over , put on his best " I 'm not thrilled about this " face , and this picture has been in my office ever since .
As I wrote the title of this post , it occurred to me that " Shut up , you 're in this " was pretty much the Jesuits ' attitude about Fr. Mankowski .
Definitely the " shut up " part , as they officially silenced him years ago and , in my opinion , thus robbed the world of the God - given treasure of his voice .
As for the " you 're in this , " part , their attitude was " we 're stuck with you . "
They tried every way they could think of to make him miserable enough to leave .
It was a waste of time , resources , and energy .
I have never met a human who took a vow more seriously .
St. Thomas Moore would have caved first .
I have many stories to tell about my friendship with Fr. Mankowski , but I am not going to tell them here .
( Well , maybe one or two of minor note . )
I 'm writing like a fiend .
When I know where these words will emerge , I will let you know .
In the meantime , I am going to maintain and update this site , so you will have access to everything written by Fr. Mankowski that has been published , and everything that has been written about him .
( And also several videos , for those of you who have not had the pleasure of hearing him speak . )
The link to that post will remain in the upper right hand corner .
If he had not been silenced , the things that are coming to light now would have been known all along .
There would , in my opinion , be far fewer " Catholic " Democrats , and far more people who know and love Holy Mother Church and the 2000 + year magisterium .
The modernists knew that , and that is why had to keep him quiet .
That , and the fact that he knew where the bodies were buried .
I am going to do everything I can to un-silence Fr. Mankowski .
It has long been my plan , should he die first .
it 's the only thing consoling me right now : the thought that I can help undo the evil that was done to him .
I am in this .
And I will not shut up .
After weeks of complaints from ticket holders , the producers of the Broadway musical “ Spider - Man , Turn Off the Dark ” announced on Tuesday morning that they will refund tickets through Ticketmaster for preview performances that had been scheduled to start Feb. 25 but are now , as expected , canceled .
In a statement made on Tuesday morning , the producers confirmed that previews will not begin on that date next month , as the actor Alan Cumming — who is set to play the Green Goblin — told the Times on Saturday .
The producers did not provide new dates for previews or an opening night , saying only that a revised schedule will be announced shortly and that the plan is still to open the show in 2010 .
Asked on Tuesday morning about rumors that the show would now begin in the fall , a spokesman for the show repeated that no dates have been confirmed .
Another executive involved with the musical said on Tuesday morning that , contrary to another rumor , the producers have been able to capitalize the show without receiving any money from Disney , which recently acquired Marvel Entertainment , which holds the rights to the “ Spider - Man ” story .
A spokesman for Disney Theatrical Group on Tuesday referred questions about the musical to the production team .
With music by U2’s Bono and the Edge and direction by Julie Taymor ( “ The Lion King ” ) , “ Spider - Man ” has been marred by delays because an earlier group of producers were unable to raise the capital to produce the show , which is now expected to cost about $ 50 million , which would make it the most expensive in Broadway history .
The musical ’s troubles have unfolded at the same time that the next “ Spider - Man ” movie has been descending into disarray , with the news on Monday that director Sam Raimi and star Tobey Maguire have been dropped and that the movie franchise will be reworked .
Theater - goers , meanwhile , have been raising concerns on blogs and Twitter and in e-mail messages to Ticketmaster about false advertising on the part of the “ Spider - Man ” producers , who continued to advertise and sell tickets — with interest compounding on the ticket revenue — long after it was clear that the show would not start in February .
The lead producer , Michael Cohl , said in early November that the musical would open sometime in 2010 but would not provide details .
Because rehearsals were not underway in November or December , the Feb. 25 preview performance start has not been possible for many weeks .
According to the producers ’ statement , Ticketmaster will contact ticket holders affected by the delay , and anyone who purchased tickets can request a refund or wait to exchange tickets once a new performance schedule is announced .
Ticket holders will receive a full refund , including booking fees , and the producers will pick up the cost of the processing fee ( which would not normally be refunded ) .
Jonathan Ross has announced he is leaving the BBC , after 13 years working for the corporation .
Ross , 49 , who is one of the BBC 's highest paid stars , said in a statement he had decided not to renegotiate his contract when it ends in July .
The star added that his decision to leave was not " financially motivated " .
In 2008 , the controversial host was suspended for making a series of phone calls to actor Andrew Sachs on Russell Brand 's Radio 2 show .
One of the biggest stars at the BBC , Ross currently hosts his own Friday night chat show , Radio 2 show and a film review programme .
UPDATE IV : Sen .
Arlen Specter ( D - PA ) is the latest senator to sign on to the public option reconciliation letter , his spokesperson told Raw Story on Friday .
The total number of signatories is now 19 .
The move comes on the same day Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) announced in an important breakthrough that he ’s willing to use the procedure to pass the provision .
ADVERTISEMENT
UPDATE III : Sen . Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) has become the first member of the Democratic leadership to sign the public option letter , indicating its growing momentum .
In an email to supporters , reproduced by The Plum Line ‘s Greg Sargent , Schumer said victory on the provision is “ far from a done deal , but it ’s an opportunity to break through the obstructionism Republicans have pushed for the past year . ”
UPDATE II : Sixteen senators have now signed the letter .
The latest additions are Sens. Frank Lautenberg ( D - NJ ) , Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) and Barbara Mikulski ( D - MD ) .
UPDATE : By Thursday morning there were 13 senators officially calling for a reconciliation vote on the public option , and two additional Democrats that have expressed support for the idea .
The new signatories are Sens. Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) , Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) and Jack Reed ( D - RI ) .
Sens. Amy Klobuchar ( D - MN ) and Ben Cardin ( D - MD ) have also indicated their support .

Feinstein became the 11th senator to officially sign the letter on Wednesday night .
In explaining her decision , Feinstein pointed to the insurer Blue Cross ’s projected 39 percent rate hike for Californians .
“ I can think of no better example of why we need health insurance reform , ” she said , according to the Huffington Post .
“ And this kind of behavior is a stark reminder of why any reform plan should establish a rate authority to keep insurance rates affordable . ”
Boxer and Reed followed , bringing the total to 13 .
The other two have announced they ’ll back reconciliation to pass a public option , but left unclear whether they would sign the letter .

Klobuchar said she supports “ using reconciliation to pass the health reform bill with changes , ” in a statement to the Minnesota Independent .
“ I support the House bill version of the public option which is based on negotiated rates , ” she said .
But she hedged her bets and added that she ’s “ also supportive of the President ’s efforts to forge a bipartisan agreement . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Cardin also appears on board .
“ Senator Cardin has always been for a strong public option , ” said Cardin ’s spokeswoman Susan Sullam , Huffington Post reports .
He also has long thought reconciliation was a viable option for passing strong health care reform . ”
This brings the total to 13 Democrats who have backed reconciliation to pass the hotly - debated public option , which was pronounced dead in December .
Raw Story ’s original article unfolds .

WASHINGTON — As of Wednesday early afternoon , nine senators had signed a letter urging passage of the public health insurance option through reconciliation .
Make it ten .
Sen. Bernie Sanders ’s ( I - VT ) spokesman Michael Briggs confirmed to Raw Story that he will join Democratic Sens. Michael Bennett ( CO ) , Kirsten Gillibrand ( NY ) , Jeff Merkley ( OR ) , Sherrod Brown ( OH ) , Al Franken ( MN ) , Pat Leahy , John Kerry ( MA ) , Sheldon Whitehouse ( RI ) and Roland Burris ( IL ) in a last - ditch push for the provision .
The first four co-sponsored the letter and released it Tuesday , and The Plum Line ’s Greg Sargent confirmed Wednesday morning that the latter four will sign , just before Burris joined the list .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The American people have made it clear that they want the option to buy their insurance through a Medicare - type , government - run public insurance plan , ” Sanders explained in a statement e-mailed to Raw Story .
“ The public option is not just important for the individual consumer , it is an important mechanism to provide competition for the private , for - profit health insurance industry , to keep them honest , and to lower the overall cost of health care in our country , ” he said .
The signatories urge Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( NV ) to “ bring for a vote before the full Senate a public health insurance option under budget reconciliation rules . ”
The public option , which has been the topic of explosive controversy throughout the health care deliberations , was passed in the House legislation but eliminated from the Senate version that was later approved .
ADVERTISEMENT
The whole process hit a gridlock in January after the election of Republican Scott Brown to the senate , which gave the party the votes it needed to filibuster the final motion .
The letter continues , “ There are four fundamental reasons why we support this approach – its potential for billions of dollars in cost savings ; the growing need to increase competition and lower costs for the consumer ; the history of using reconciliation for significant pieces of health care legislation ; and the continued public support for a public option . ”
With Republicans poised to block another senate motion , Democrats have discussed using reconciliation — which would require a simple majority of 51 senators — to amend the bill before the House holds a final vote .
A December poll found that six in ten Americans support the provision .
The liberal advocacy groups Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Democracy For America have endorsed the letter , which also encourages citizens to sign in the support of the idea .
One hundred and nineteen members of Congress have also signed it .
Next Thursday President Obama will convene a bipartisan summit with Republican leaders to discuss the two parties ’ differences on the legislation .
After initially equivocating , Republicans have confirmed they will attend .

What 's the life of Bioshock 2's Creative Director like now that the game is finished ?
" I 'm mostly doing stuff like this , " Jordan Thomas tells me over the phone , referring to the interview .
" It 's stuff that 's not necessarily natural to my character , such as looking at action figure designs , promotional materials ... it 's not the main thrust of game development . "
He assures us that there has been a short break , but the game is due out on February 9 , just a few short weeks away .
This gives us an excellent chance to look back not only to the first game , but to the entirety of the development of Bioshock 2 , and why the team decided to make the decisions that lead to this game .
Hold your breath : we 're going deep .
Would you kindly start from the beginning ?
Where Bioshock enjoyed a now - iconic introduction featuring a plane crash and then a short lesson in the philosophy of objectivism before we first laid eyes on Rapture , the second game has the handicap of taking place in a world we may feel like we know well .
Was there fear about losing the lasting impact that the first game 's introduction had on players ?
" Yes , is the most honest answer , " Thomas tells Ars .
Some people will play the sequel , but many already know about Rapture .
The answer ?
Create a character that has some known qualities , and build from there .
As a Big Daddy in Bioshock 2 , your existence and history is a mystery that the player has to solve .
In the first game , the world of Rapture is a complete unknown , whereas in the Bioshock 2 you 're trying to discover your past and deal with what has happened since the ending of the last game , roughly ten years ago .
The second game also does n't track your saved game from the previous title , and that seems to have been for practical reasons .
" People like to switch platforms and things , we did n't want to force you into a dependency with the previous game . "
Do n't worry though , this game will reference the first experience in many ways .
Ten years have passed since the events in the first Bioshock , and they have had a lasting impact on the world .
" [ The first game 's protagonist 's actions ] have been mythologized by the splicers that have been stuck down there for ten years , going crazier and crazier . "
Your story from the first game has become something of a twisted religion in the last decade .
" You will see paintings where your chain tattoos are turned into religious iconography .
The plane crash is on a mural . "
Thomas says that moving forward is the only way they could have explored Rapture while keeping the feeling of Bioshock .
" To be perfectly honest , my feeling on the true prequel , if it were to be honest at all in trying to portray a living city , would be a very different game than Bioshock . "
We will get a glimpse of a pre-Bioshock Rapture , however , via the game 's multiplayer modes .
" With the multiplayer we have gone in an honest prequel direction : in the year between 1959 to 1960 , it precedes the events of Bioshock , and is the real year where the civil war of Rapture began in earnest . "
You 'll see things from the first game , but before they have been torn apart , giving you a sense of the grandeur of Andrew Ryan 's grand experiment .
" You take the role of a splicer whose life has been torn apart by that war , and see what it was like to be there when dozens and dozens of clever , self - interested mutants are competing over this miraculous resource — ADAM — and I feel like multiplayer is the best way to experience that part of Rapture 's history .
If you go back further than that , you 're dealing with a very different interactive model that we did n't feel like played to the strengths of Bioshock , something that makes you feel alone , paranoid , and hunted . "
There is no master plan for Rapture , no concrete idea of the space it inhabits .
We ask if , somewhere deep in the bowels of 2 K Marin , there is a map of the entirety of the undersea heaven / hell .
Carlos Cuello , the Lead Programmer on the title , thinks about it for a moment .
" Not that I can think of , Rapture is very fluid , the way it was developed . "
Thomas agrees , noting that Rapture itself is almost a matter of perception .
" Our attitude is a bit more subjective than that .
Giving it a strict layout keeps you from being creatively agile . "
He points to the feeling of exploration and sense of isolation that Rapture gives the player .
" Your mind is like a flashlight , only seeing glimpses of things , and you never have a perfect picture .
It 's very creatively liberating . "
The moral choices may become a little grayer
The first game gave you a binary choice as the player : you could either " harvest " the Little Sisters for their ADAM , or liberate them and get the " good " ending .
The problem is that this decision only determines what ending the game shows you ; the actual amount of ADAM given to the player for upgrades throughout the game is almost even .
The choice , from a gameplay standpoint , is meaningless .
Cuello defends the disconnect between the moral choices and impact on gameplay .
" I like the fact I can play the game I want to play , and not have a disadvantage compared to someone else who played a different way , " he explains .
Thomas points out that there are two types of players who will pick up the game .
" You absolutely will get people who are n't involved in the fiction , and wo n't allow moral or aesthetic skinning to affect what they consider to be the optimal gameplay decision . "
There is a flipside , however .
" Others called me up after seeing the sisters they rescued [ at the end of the game ] after having a daughter themselves , and they wept .
We have a large and highly gradiated spectrum of players . "
The choice in Bioshock 2 is not nearly as clear .
" Because the player has the ability to adopt Little Sisters , and carry them around regardless of what he plans to do with them , you have opportunities to gain ADAM as a rescuer and a harvester . "
After you create the symbiotic relationship with Little Sisters you encounter and take a cut of the ADAM they find , you can then either harvest or rescue them .
" Once you do resolve a certain number of Little Sisters , there are rewards which affect the amount of ADAM , and other non-ADAM quantities that you unlock .
Those kind of make the strictly optimal path more of a judgment call , and people will disagree with which one was optimal . "
You 're not alone
Even now , with the game around the corner , some gamers are upset at the idea of a Bioshock title that incorporates multiplayer .
Cuello downplays the criticism .
" Fan concerns stemmed from the fear that the single - player game would get hurt from working on multiplayer at the same time .
We were able to focus on the single - player , and Digital Extremes was able to focus on multiplayer . "
Thomas agrees that the final product will be cohesive .
" We had an internal representative who is a multiplayer specialist .
She took broad creative direction from me , and became a liasion to the Digital Extremes team , and those guys took the high - level direction and made the game their baby .
They layered as much love on that as we did the single player .
Because of that person walking between worlds , there was n't much lost creatively . "
He notes there was some " gentle guidance " when dealing with the tone of Rapture .
Concept art for the Big Daddy
" On the technical side , we always felt the game was in good hands ... we knew we were working with professionals with experience with the engine . "
The two teams talked daily , and there was a lot of sharing of assets and expertise .
" Their game is a little different , in terms of weapons and plasmids , so it did n't make sense to share everything , but where we did it helped out a lot . "
Since its fiction takes place before the events of the first game , there is a hook to get players to at least sample the multiplayer .
" The response has been positive , consistently so , among people who have actually played it .
We 're not going to convert every single person who is coming for the single - player , but those who try it are going to be pleasantly surprised , " Thomas assures us .
" From there , if they decide to devote themselves to it , that 's up to them . "
In single - player , many of those tricks and emergent strategies found by combining weapons and plasmids are " for style " and not strictly required .
Now , to survive in multiplayer , " you need to be a master of the systems . "
Will it all work ?
Bioshock seemed to work as a standalone game , which makes the quick turnaround on the sequel — with multiplayer , no less — something of a worry for gamers .
The team behind the game has strong ideas about what does and does n't work in the world of Rapture , however , and hopefully that will be enough to see it through .
We 'll have to wait until the game is in our hands for our final thoughts .
Bioshock 2 launches on the PC , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 on February 9 .
Convergence has always been a big theme in tech , and its focus at MWC this year seems to have landed firmly on procuring an application platform that is OS - agnostic .
Earlier today , we heard of the big carrier cabal intent on slaying the beast that is multi-platform development through cooperation , but if you ask Adobe the answer is much simpler : just slap AIR on your phone .

( Corrects to say 1.4 million farmers in paragraph 20 and 1.4 billion population in paragraph 24 )
MUMBAI , Feb 16 ( Reuters ) -
The purple eggplant that Indian shopper Tanuja Krishnan picks out at a Mumbai market stall every week is an unlikely protagonist in a raging debate about whether genetically modified foods should be introduced into India .
A genetically modified version of eggplant , a staple in fiery curries , was slated to be the first GM food introduced into India in a bid to stabilise food prices and mitigate some of the effects of climate change on Indian food crop yields .
Yet , Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh blocked the release of the vegetable until further notice following an outcry by environmentalists and some farmers .
The opposition to GM foods was so heated that some protesters burnt effigies .
Ramesh said there was not enough public trust to support the introduction of such crops into India ’s food supply until more research was done to remove all doubts that GM foods were safe for consumption .
But while those from the camp that opposed GM foods are celebrating , there are concerns that rising food prices will be a major problem for Indian policymakers in the future unless the country starts embracing genetically - modified food crops .
“ This is bad for the country ’s agricultural and biotechnology future .
Our scientists have lost their credibility , companies will be unwilling to invest more money , and it will take us a long time to pick up the pieces again , ” said C. Kameshwar Rao , an official at the Foundation for Biotechnology Awareness & Education , a GM advocacy institute .
“ Scientists ca n’t win a shouting match with politicians . ”
India ’s farm sector has changed very little since the advent of the Green Revolution with crop yields failing to keep up with soaring population growth and rising incomes .
At the same time , damage to crops from pests and disease have worsened due to rising temperatures from climate change .
HYBRIDS
Known as
Bt brinjal , the Indian word for aubergine , the GM vegetable is able to resist some pests responsible for devastating crops across India thanks to a gene from soil bacteria called ‘ bacillus thuringniensis ’ ( Bt ) .
The thought of eating a genetic hybrid has made consumers such as Krishnan wary .
“ I would try it to see if it tastes any different , if it has fewer pests , but I think I would prefer organic brinjal just to be safe , ” she said .
The moratorium against the release of the GM eggplant followed harsh criticism by environmentalists and farmers who demanded rigorous testing and labelling standards before
Bt brinjal was cultivated .
“ Stringent monitoring measures should be immediately put in place to ensure that no releases of GM crops happens , ” said Rajesh Krishnan , a manager for sustainable agriculture at Greenpeace India .
India ’s Genetic Engineering Approval Committee ( GEAC ) opened the way for the commercial cultivation of Bt brinjal last October , seven years after approving
Bt cotton , which is now grown on more than 80 percent of total cotton area .
Thanks to genetically modified cotton , India has become the world ’s second largest cotton producer and exporter after China , with about 5 million farmers growing Bt cotton .
“ Our experience with Bt cotton has showed the technology has benefited the farmer , the consumer and the states ’ economies , ” said Bhagirath Choudhary , head of the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications ( ISAAA ) in Delhi .
“ We have a solid case in Bt cotton , with higher yields , double the output and less use of insecticide .
But the technology is so sophisticated , the general public is ignorant about it . ”
India is among the top biotech crop growing countries , trailing only Argentina , Brazil and the United States .
NO OTHER OPTION
India is the world ’s second largest producer of eggplant after China and the vegetable is also used in traditional medicine to treat diabetes and hypertension .
About 1.4 million farmers grow eggplant , which is very susceptible to pest attacks .
Farmers tend to spray the crop with pesticides 30 - 50 times during a crop cycle .
“ The brinjal we eat now is more harmful because of the pesticide residue , ” said Raju Shetty , a farmer leader in western Maharashtra state and a member of parliament .
He supported Bt brinjal because he said “ it will cut the cost of pesticide and boost yields .
That ’s what farmers are seeking ” .
Even though the GM seeds for the vegetable would likely cost three times the price and farmers would need to purchase seeds for every sowing rather than reusing crop seeds , proponents say the extra expenses would be compensated by lower pesticide costs and less devastating crop loses .
Expanding India ’s food supply is crucial in a country of one billion people , with predictions the population might reach 1.4 billion by 2025 .
The United Nations ’ Food and Agricultural Organisation has said food production will need to double by mid-century to meet demand from a growing world population , prompting calls for a second Green Revolution .
But Greenpeace maintains GM crops are a costly distraction from tackling hunger through fighting poverty and helping small holders in developing countries sell their products .
A combination of changing diets , a growing population , demand for farmland for industrialisation and high energy prices have stoked food prices globally , including in India , where the food price index rose 17.56 percent in the 12 months to Jan. 23 .
India is also battling with lower crop yields and more pests and plant disease because of higher temperatures , raising concerns that India ’s farm output could lag demand and the world ’s second most populous country will become a large food importer unless crop yields jump .
Some economists and scientists in India favour a raft of policy initiatives , including genetic engineering , to improve yields and increase resistance to pests , disease and drought .
“ You have a large population that ’s growing in affluence , but our resources -- land , water , cheap labour -- are all shrinking , so we have to increase output quickly and efficiently , ” said Gyanendra Shukla , director of Monsanto India Ltd .
“ I do n’t see any other option but GM crops . ”
Since Monsanto launched the world ’s first GM crop in 1996 , more than 25 countries have taken to biotech crops including soybean , corn , tomato , squash , papaya and sugarbeet .
Bt brinjal was developed by Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Co ( Mahyco ) under licence from Monsanto , and estimates show economic benefits from higher yields could top $ 400 million a year .
GEAC has also approved studies of GM okra , tomato and rice , but opponents say GM should be a last resort .
“ You ca n’t simply abandon all other solutions , including organic farming , to focus just on biotechnology when the testing , labelling and enforcement standards are so inadequate , ” said Kushal Yadav , an official at the Centre for Science and Environment .
NO PANACEA
Aside from health and safety concerns , critics worry that the widespread use of GM crops will put India ’s food supply largely in the hands of a few giant corporations that make the seeds .
There is also the possibility of genetic contamination if the Bt genes cross pollinate with other varieties .
A recent report by U.S. health and environment protection groups said that rather than reduce the use of pesticides , genetically engineered crops had actually prompted increased use of these chemicals , caused an epidemic of herbicide - resistant weeds and resulted in more chemical residues in foods .
A backlash against the technology also appears to be growing globally , with consumer resistance to what British tabloids have dubbed “ Frankenfood ” taking root .
Even advocates in India admit genetically modified crops are no magic bullet .
“ Bt ca n’t be the panacea for all the problems in Indian agriculture .
But if we miss this , we miss the chance to usher in a new technology , see how it can help us , ” Choudhary said .

The early reaction to the formation of the American Third Position Party is all too tediously predictable :
The Democratic Underground :
* Dropping Academic Veneer , Cal State Prof Starts His Own Hate Group
Orange County Weekly :
Problem is , it ’s just another Freedom 14 production of the Golden State Party .
The American TP website also has the same registrant as Freedom 14 and the GSP , and nearly the exact layout as the two .
Its treasurer is Freedom 14 member , former GSP volunteer , and current fugitive Sean Vaxmonsky .
The GSP website is no longer up ( and Freedom 14 now has its website behind a password - protected wall ) , but cached versions show that the home page for its position essays uses the same pictures and captions as the American TP .
More embarrassingly , the American TP and GPS position essays not only advocate the same issues , but are almost the same essay word for word — compare the GSP economy position here with the American TP here , and mix and match with the others — with GSP changed to American TP .

There is one exception though in a surprisingly objective article from Long Beach Press Telegram :
The truth :
You 're really not that far behind 95 % of the poker players in the world .
And you do n't need to be the foremost expert on the game to become a winning poker player .
In fact , a relatively small amount of basic poker principles can produce massive improvements in your results almost immediately .
The first step to becoming a good poker player : simply figuring out how to stop sucking at it .
One of the ways to do so is to start playing fewer hands .
Here ' what we mean and how to put it into practice .
Play Fewer Hands
Learn how to play like Phil Ivey
In Texas Hold 'em there are 169 different possible starting hands you can be dealt ( this is ignoring specific suits ) .
Out of all these possible hands , there are only five hands that are considered " premium . "
AA KK QQ AK ( Suited ) JJ
Regardless of your position at the table , a premium hand should always be played if there is no raise ahead of you .
If there is a raise ahead of you - especially if there are callers or re-raises - sometimes it can even be a mistake to play anything below Aces or Kings .
When you think about Texas Hold 'em starting hands this way , you 'll realize you should be folding around 80 % more hands .
Naturally , the hands you play , and how you play them , will change depending on thousands of different variables at the table .
But at the very core of the game there are very few hands that are considered playable .
If there has been no player to open the pot ( meaning no one has raised , or even limped ahead of you ) you can play almost any hand with any sort of potential value .
Once someone has raised ahead of you , your hand selection should be narrowed down to only the hands that can give you the nuts , and help keep you out of any situation which has you dominated .
For example : you should never play KQ into a raise , as AA , KK , QQ , AK , and AQ all have you dominated .
Unless you have a very good reason to do so , as a beginner poker player you should stick to playing only the top 10 to 15 hands , period .
The more you play , and the better you become at the game , the more hands you can add to your playlist .
Until then , keep it simple , and always head to the flop with the best of it .
Top 15 Hold 'em Starting Hands
AA KK QQ AK ( suited ) JJ 1010 AQ ( suited ) AJ ( suited ) AK ( off suit ) KQ ( suited ) A10 ( suited ) KJ ( suited ) AQ ( off suit ) 99 JQ ( suited )

Vauxhall 's car plant at Ellesmere Port on Merseyside and British Sugar 's refineries at Bury St Edmunds and Newark are among nearly 100 factories that have had their gas cut as Britain 's energy infrastructure creaks under the strain of the great freeze .
The National Grid has told British Gas and other power firms to cut the supply to major corporate customers , in an attempt to preserve gas supply for households as the weather causes a surge in demand .
However , the Grid said this morning that pressure on their large industrial users had eased as temperatures rose from below freezing .
" The weather is getting slightly warmer , which does have an effect on demand for heating , so we do n't have to invoke the interruptible contracts to so many businesses " a National Grid spokeswoman said .
The situation had also been eased by the return of supplies from some gas fields and imports from liquefied natural gas tankers .
Opposition MPs said inadequate planning by the government in previous years had left the country heading towards an " energy crisis " that could only dent the UK 's fragile economic recovery .
But the government maintained last night that gas cuts were now only affecting 27 factories , and that all these had signed up to discount contracts allowing suppliers to interrupt their supplies in periods of high demand .
Energy minister Lord Hunt said : " This is a period of exceptionally high demand .
The system is coping as it should .
These sort of arrangements have been commercially entered into . "
Factories in the north - west of England and east Midlands are worst hit out of the 94 customers who have had gas supplies axed for the first time in up to 20 years , in some cases in a response to severe weather and creaking power infrastructure .
In the first tangible sign that fears over energy shortages are translating into supply disruption , the grid has demanded cuts to those customers who signed " interruptible " contracts .
In addition the grid issued a second " gas balancing alert " in four days – the first time it has had to issue two such warnings in quick succession .
The call to customers to voluntarily reduce usage wherever possible came as the supply squeeze was made worse by production problems at Troll , a Norwegian North Sea gas field .
" There are some customers in the north - west and east Midlands who have had supplies interrupted because they are on interruptible contracts and we are facing high demand , " said a grid spokeswoman .
Well - known manufacturers at locations around the country , including the south and east of England , confirmed they were experiencing power supply problems but most asked for their names to be kept private to avoid panicking shareholders .
Vauxhall and British Sugar both confirmed gas had been cut off but said production was being kept up by use of stand - by generators fired by oil .
" From 6 pm on Monday British Gas asked us to stop using gas , so ever since we have used oil ; and we will do that until they tell us we can start using gas , " said a spokesman for Vauxhall .
British Gas could not immediately confirm it had cut off some customers in line with grid demands , but said the problems were caused by transmission overload rather than supply shortages .
" If anything there is an oversupply of gas and certainly no shortage at this time .
This [ the current problem ] is about moving it around the country , " said a spokesman .
The Major Energy Users Council said power interruptions were the last thing that struggling industry needed at this time and the EEF , which represents manufacturers , said ministers had repeatedly ignored warnings the system was close to breaking point .
The EEF 's energy adviser , Roger Salomone , said : " While it is easy to say ' I told you so ' , the fact is we have been warning of such interruptions for a long time and of the need for urgent investment in our infrastructure to avoid them . "
Opposition MPs were also scathing .
John Hemming , the Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley , who follows energy issues , said he had tabled a motion in the Commons calling for immediate government action to safeguard the power system .
Greg Clark , the shadow energy secretary , said it tarnished the image of Britain at the worst possible moment when the country was trying to drag itself out of the economic slump .
Ministers have repeatedly said that the annual fears of power blackouts are alarmist , and point out Britain has two new pipeline links to Norway and the continent plus a liquefied natural gas import system at Milford Haven in south Wales .
The Department of Energy and Climate Change dismissed accusations that it had not done enough .
" We now have more diverse gas supplies than ever , and the market mechanisms are performing as would be expected , " said a DECC spokesman .
" There is no risk of consumers being cut off – that 's scaremongering . "

The St. Petersburg Times has done some in - depth reporting about the Church of Scientology that has n’t always cast the organization in the best light , let ’s say .
The Times ’ top brass must ’ve known what they were getting into in opening that particular Pandora ’s box , though , as the CoS is not known for taking criticism lying down .
In this case , the church hired three seasoned — and in a couple cases , award - winning — journalists to investigate the paper right back .
This strategy did n’t go over well at the Times , but the reporters involved say they used the same objective journalistic standards they ’ve always used to do their job , according to The Washington Post ’s Howard Kurtz .
Fast - food restaurants are in on the act , and over the last two years have begun to introduce their own mini-meals , like the McDonald ’s Snack Wrap .
According to the Agriculture Department , American children get 40 percent of their calories from food of poor nutritional quality .
What is especially baffling where I live , in Los Angeles , is how often the kind of parental paranoia that obsesses about school ratings , vaccines and myriad imagined plagues is matched by utter disregard for the nutritional downsides of mowing down Fruit by the Foot every afternoon at 4 .
Rarely do I see a parent show up on the soccer field with a homemade snack , or even a bag of carrots .
Oreos are the post - game snack of choice , even in sports leagues dominated by upper - income parents .
“ There is definitely a big disconnect , ” said Dr. Howard Taras , a pediatrics professor at the University of California , San Diego , who specializes in community and school health policies .
“ I think there is this natural tendency among parents to not want their child to go hungry .
It is more difficult for them to think about the long - term outlook for the child . ”
Ellyn Satter , a dietitian and family therapist , thinks there is little point in worrying too much about what children are eating  unless it is “ pure sugar , ” like juice , she said  or how much , because children self - regulate portions .
The key , she said , is to end grazing .
“ The parents ’ job is to do the what , when and where of feeding , ” she said , “ and it is up to the children to do the how much and whether of eating .
In order to have successful family meals , you have to structure the snacks . ”
Carolynne Dyner sees the purpose of snacks for her children , Quinn , who is 7 , and Sadie , 5 , through a fairly simple prism .
“ To stave off tantrums , of course , ” she said .
From their days caring for infants , she said , parents are conditioned to be prepared for a sudden attack of hunger .
And so she keeps her car and purse amply packed with pretzels , baggies of Cinnamon Life cereal , Goldfish crackers and Clif bars .
For her children , little bites between meals have in some ways supplanted the meals themselves .
“ They usually need a snack midmorning and midafternoon , ” explained Ms. Dyner , who lives in Beverly Hills , Calif .
“ There may be a third snack , and this is usually due to the fact that our kids did n’t care much for what we provided for dinner , so now it is 7:30 and they are hungry .
At this point we may give them a yogurt . ”
Parents who give in too many times may find that snacks are the culinary equivalent of letting your 2 - year - old sleep in your bed .
“ People get themselves into these habits , which they later regret tremendously , ” said Ms. Ikeda , the nutritionist .
“ We do , as parents , make mistakes and then we either have to live with them or suffer the consequences in fixing them .
It gets exhausting saying ‘ no ’ all the time . ”
At the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , Microsoft ’s Robbie Bach stated in an interview with CBC that a vast majority of the major publishers around the world are currently working on projects that incorporate the motion - sensing capabilities of Project Natal .
In the interview Bach , who is the President of Entertainment & Devices Division at Microsoft , stated that “ something like 70 % or 80 % of the publishers in the world already doing Natal - based games . ”
Furthermore , in explaining why they chose to reveal Project Natal at 2009 ’s E3 , he stated that “ we wanted third - party publishers to know that it was real and we wanted them to have developer kits and to get them working on it . ”
He continued to explain that “ our first party studios are [ also ] very focused on this .
We want to have a few titles from Microsoft that show the way and then we want the breadth and power of the ecosystem from our partners to bring lots of new ideas , new innovations , new concepts to the marketplace .
Xbox games do n’t go away ; you have to think of all this as additive .
I think it adds to the beauty of what ’s going on . ”
At the Consumer Electronics Show , Microsoft also announced that Project Natal would be made available in time for the 2010 holiday season .
Huixin
He , associate professor of nanoscale chemistry at Rutgers University , Newark , and Tamara Minko , professor at the Rutgers Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy , have developed a nanotechnology approach that potentially could eliminate the problems of side effects and drug resistance in the treatment of cancer .
Under traditional chemotherapy , cancer cells , like bacteria , can develop resistance to drug therapy , leading to a relapse of the disease .
As reported in the December 21 , 2009 , issue of the journal Small , He , Minko and their co-researchers , including investigators from Merck & Co. and Carl Zeiss SMT , a global nanotechnology firm , have designed nanomaterials that allow for the delivery of both a chemical ( doxorubicin ) to destroy cancer cells and a genetic drug to prevent drug resistance .
When administered to drug - resistant ovarian cancer cells , the treatment was more than 130 times lethal than when doxorubicin was administrated alone .
" The drug can only be released when it is inside the cancer cells , " He said .
" This controlled internal release mechanism can dramatically eliminate side effects associated with anticancer drugs to normal tissues . "
Battling Aggressive Breast Cancer with Nanotubes
In related research , Professor He and another team of co-researchers have developed single - walled carbon nanotubes that hold the potential of providing a more effective means for detecting and selectively destroying aggressive breast cancer cells .
In a paper published in BMC Cancer late last year , the researchers showed that by chemically bonding a special antibody onto the nanotubes and taking advantage of two unique properties of carbon nanotubes , single cancer cells can be detected and selectively eradicated while leaving the nearby normal cells unharmed .
The uniqueness of this approach is that it is more easily extended to other types of cancer cells .
He 's research in the areas of cancer detection and treatment is funded in part with grants from the National Science Foundation and National Cancer Institute .
Research Focuses on Practical Applications Across a Wide Range of Fields
The application of He 's research is far and wide .
He and members of her lab at Rutgers are working on the practical application of nanomaterials as a diagnostic tool for Parkinson 's disease .
Other research is focused on the development of a platform to detect the presence of chemical warfare agents for homeland defense .
He and her lab members are also working on nanotechnology to measure iron ions in ocean atmosphere dust and sea water , which is critical for the study of greenhouse gases and climate change .
At Rutgers ,
He teaches undergraduate courses in analytical chemistry and graduate courses in electrochemical analytical chemistry .
She is the recipient of the 2009 Rutgers Presidential Fellowship for Teaching Excellence .

The family of Molly Hightower got the call they were dreading this morning :
in Haiti had died in this week 's catastrophic earthquake .
Hightower 's remains were found early today by search and rescue crews .
Her brother , Mike Hightower , said the family got word about Molly early this morning .
Hightower , 22 , of Port Orchard , Wash . , has been a volunteer for
since June .
She was living on the fifth floor of the building that crumbled under the force of the quake .
Her friend , Rachel Prusynski , a fellow UP grad , was pulled from the rubble with a broken arm and lacerations .
She was taken to the U.S. Embassy and then transported to Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
She then was flown to Florida , where she contacted the Hightowers to tell them what happened .
On Thursday , the Hightowers spotted an article on the Web about a Virginia - based search and rescue team that was searching through the rubble of Hightower 's building .
Hightower had been chronicling her experiences on her blog ,

" Today was the Universal Day for the Handicapped , so we had a big program at Kay St. Germaine with the preschoolers and some of the Kenscoff kids coming down as well .
The volunteers started off at mass at the hospital , with Father Rick back in town .
After that , we went to bless the babies that died in the hospital the night before , which I ’ve never done before .
It was devastating to see them be unwrapped , cleaned , blessed and rewrapped to be buried .
2 children died last night , and 3 more the night before so there were several bodies on the tables .
The hospital , on average , loses 2 or 3 children a day . "

What if a jury could decide a man 's guilt through mind reading ?
What if reading a defendant 's memory could betray their guilt ?
And what constitutes ' intent ' to commit murder ?
These are just some of the issues debated and reviewed in the inaugural issue of WIREs Cognitive Science , the latest interdisciplinary project from Wiley - Blackwell , which for registered institutions will be free for the first two years .
In the article " Neurolaw , " in the inaugural issue of WIREs Cognitive Science , co-authors Walter Sinnott - Armstrong and Annabelle Belcher assess the potential for the latest cognitive science research to revolutionize the legal system .
Neurolaw , also known as legal neuroscience , builds upon the research of cognitive , psychological , and social neuroscience by considering the implications for these disciplines within a legal framework .
Each of these disciplinary collaborations has been ground - breaking in increasing our knowledge of the way the human brain operates , and now neurolaw continues this trend .
One of the most controversial ways neuroscience is being used in the courtroom is through ' mind reading ' and the detection of mental states .
While only courts in New Mexico currently permit traditional lie detector , or polygraph , tests there are a number of companies claiming to have used neuroscience methods to detect lies .
Some of these methods involve electroencephalography ( EEG ) , whereby brain activity is measured through small electrodes placed on the scalp .
This widely accepted method of measuring brain electrical potentials has already been used in two forensic techniques which have appeared in US courtrooms : brain fingerprinting and brain electrical oscillations signature ( BEOS ) .
Brain fingerprinting purportedly tests for ' guilty knowledge , ' or memory of a kind that only a guilty person could have .
Other forms of guilt detection , using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , are based on the assumption that lying and truth - telling are associated with distinctive activity in different areas of the brain .
These and other potential forms of ' mind reading ' are still in development but may have far - reaching implications for court cases .
" Some proponents of neurolaw think that neuroscience will soon be used widely throughout the legal system and that it is bound to produce profound changes in both substantive and procedural law , " conclude the authors .
" Other leaders in neurolaw employ a less sanguine tone , urging caution so as to prevent misuses and abuses of neuroscience within courts , legislatures , prisons , and other parts of the legal system .
Either way we need to be ready to prevent misuses and encourage legitimate applications of neuroscience and the only way to achieve these goals is for neuroscientists and lawyers to work together in the field of neurolaw . "
As this paper shows , WIREs Cognitive Science takes an original interdisciplinary approach to understanding the key issues surrounding state - of - the - art cognitive research .
Disciplines featured in the inaugural issue include topics as diverse as cognitive biology , computer science , linguistics , neuroscience , philosophy and psychology .
What could be better than melt - in - your - mouth pork carnitas when you ’re stuck inside during a blizzard ?
I ’ve made this dish a few times , and not only is it simple to make , it ’s very versatile .
The pork can be used in tacos and burritos , as a pizza topping , as a pulled pork sandwich , or served with eggs — for starters .
Ingredients for the pork :
4 - 5 lb. pork shoulder ( bone in )
1 – 1½ tbsp . salt
2 tbsp . cumin
8 -10 cloves of garlic , minced
2 cups chopped fresh cilantro ( set 1 c. aside for the salsa )
½ cup pork stock ( beef or chicken can substitute )
1½ cups freshly squeezed orange juice
juice from 1 lemon
Start out by prepping all the ingredients .
Measure the salt and cumin , combine and set aside .
Peel and mince the garlic .
Wash and chop the cilantro leaves .
Juice the citrus .
Now for the pork .
Remove the meat from the bone and cut in to 1 to 2 inch cubes .
Put the bone in the crockpot .
The pork cubes need to be browned , in batches , before going in to the crockpot .
Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pot or frying pan .
Add one layer of pork cubes to the pan and sprinkle some of the cumin salt mixture over it .
After a few minutes , turn the cubes over , sprinkle some cumin mix on and brown the other side for a few minutes .
Transfer the browned cubes to the crockpot .
Repeat this until all the cubes have been browned .
Add the rest of the cumin mix , the minced garlic and chopped cilantro to the crockpot .
Pour the citrus and the pork stock over the top .
Mix it all up .
Cover the crockpot , turn it on high , and set a timer for 4 hours .
Now go for a walk in the blizzard .
When you return from your three hour walk , your house should be smelling yummy .
That can mean only one thing : it ’s time to make the salsa !
Ingredients for the salsa :
1 ripe avocado
2 medium tomatoes
½ to 1 cup chopped cilantro ( chopped when prepping the pork )
1 lime
a pinch of salt
1 tbsp. olive oil
You will also need :
flour tortillas
shredded cheese ( cheddar , manchego , quesr fresco or monterry jack )
hot sauce – optional
Peel the avocado and slice it in to quarter inch cubes , place in mixing bowl .
Slice the tomato in quarter inch cubes as well — add it to the bowl .
Add the chopped cilantro , cut the lime in half and squeeze both halves in to the bowl .
Add a pinch of salt , drizzle about 1 tbsp . of olive oil over the top and stir it up .
Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator until the pork is ready .
When the timer goes off , remove the pork cubes from the crockpot with a slotted spoon and place them in a bowl , leaving all the juice in the crock pot .
Heat a frying pan on medium high .
When it is hot , add some of the pork and fry it until it starts to brown — breaking up the cubes as you stir .
Add ½ to ¼ cup of the juice from the crockpot , stir until liquid is n’t visible and remove from heat .
Warm up the tortillas in the microwave for about 15 - 30 seconds until they are warm enough to bend without breaking .
Put some of the pork from the frying pan on a tortilla , then add some cheese ( I used cheddar for lack of anything better , but pepper jack , manchego or queso fresco can also be used ) .
Add a couple spoonfuls of the salsa and hot sauce if you desire .
Fold the tortilla over , or roll it up like a burrito and enjoy .

The world 's cheapest car , India 's tiny Tata Nano mini-car , will be sold in the U.S. starting three years from now , says its maker .
Company chief Ratan Tata told reporters at the New Delhi Auto Show , underway today , that it is now adapting the Nano to meet stringent U.S. crash safety requirements and testing a larger engine .
The Nano will first be sold in Europe , starting next year .
Unveiled in January 2008 , precisely 100 years after Henry Ford launched the iconic Model T that set the world on wheels , the Nano was designed to make four - wheeled transport available to tens of millions of Indians who now transport entire families on mopeds .

The $ 2,500 car
Tata 's goal was to offer a " one - lakh car , " meaning the base version would sell for approximately $ 2,500 .
He met that goal by having his engineers redesign every aspect of the 10 - foot - long four - door car to squeeze out costs .
Its tiny aluminum 624cc two - cylinder engine is fitted under the rear seat , avoiding costly front - wheel - drive parts .
The 33 - horsepower motor uses a balance shaft to cut vibration , and multi-point fuel injection plus a catalytic converter to meet Euro4 emissions limits .
Fuel efficiency is estimated at roughly 48 miles per gallon .
No airbags -- or second wiper
The U.S. version will clearly be far better equipped than the base version for India , which has does without airbags , air - conditioning , power steering , central locking , electric windows , a radio , a passenger - side mirror , even sun visors and a second windshield wiper .
Many of the Nanos ordered in India , however , have not been the base model but the better - equipped versions .
Just 20 percent , in fact , were the cheapest and most sparsely equipped .
It has already received more than 200,000 orders for the car this year .

Modifications for Europe
The Nano to be sold in Europe has a wheelbase half an inch longer , and a restyled front bumper and headlights .
The entire car is almost 8 inches longer , and the interior has been completely restyled .
Its engine has three cylinders , mated to a five - speed transmission .
It uses larger 15 - inch wheels and tires , and includes airbags , electric power steering , stability control , and anti-lock brakes .
Tata pledges it will offer climate control , a full infotainment systems , even optional leather upholstery .
Bumpy road
Tata had its share of teething troubles with the Nano .
It had to abandon a largely completed factory after local unrest , and start over on a new assembly plant .
Nonetheless , it delivered the first production car this past July and has aggressive plans for the future .
Despite this , drive reports say the Nano drives like a real car and fits four six - foot adults .
And the British magazine Autocar published a video showing the Nano passing its European crash tests , which should reassure anyone who worries that a car that small -- and cheap - - could n't possibly be safe .

" Someone 's sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago "
- Warren Buffett
Remember ?
Remember when men went to work and women stayed at home with their abandoned dreams and bottles of Valium and sherry ?
Remember when women 's hopes and dreams were fulfilled by simply getting married and having kids ... and then , vicariously , through the lofty achievements of their husbands and sons ?
Remember when a woman knew to keep quiet and to never speak back to her man ?
Remember when a woman fancied herself lucky if her husband did n't beat her too often or too forcefully ?
Those glorious days when domestic violence was something that happened at home - and everyone truly believed the oft - repeated refrain : " A man 's home is his castle " ?
A time when divorce , not domestic violence , was the nastiest of offenses ?
Back when couples stayed together no matter how much they despised one another , all for " the good of the children " ?
But also a time when a man could simply up and leave his family , leaving his wife and children destitute , with no financial support and no legal avenues of address ?
Remember back , as late as the early - 1960s , when women , like my mom , were asked during admittance interviews for med school whether they planned to have children or not , and , on answering " yes " , were told it would be a waste of time and valuable resources to educate a future mother to become a doctor ?
In other words , remember the Good Ol ' Days ?
The days when men dominated all walks of life and women knew their place ?
Well , the National Post 's Editorial Board sure does .
A Reactionary Backlash
You want a-holes , I mean real sexist a -holes ?
Better yet , you want some a - holes going off on a good ol ' fashioned reactionary diatribe ?
Well , look no further than these guys .
In case you missed their editorial a few days ago - Women 's Studies is still with us - it was a real doozie .
Ostensibly about university Women 's Studies programs , it was really all about how feminism has destroyed our once idyllic society .
The piece is a must - read for anyone who wants to know just what sort of world the editors at the National Post envision and idealize .
It 's a vision for the world that , at least when it comes to relations between the sexes , is not all that dissimilar from that of the Taliban .
Ok , perhaps that 's a bit extreme , but so is their rabid anti-feminism .
Sounding not unlike a bunch of Good Ol ' Boys down in Alabama or Mississippi venting at how racial integration has destroyed their once harmonious and perfect world , these bigots at the National Post remember a time before women wrecked everything with their unceasing demands for equality .
Now , that said , I do n't doubt for a minute that there are at least a couple of women on the National Post 's Editorial Board , for they never would have published a piece like this if that were not the case .
Probably some ultra - right - wing , wealthy snobs who care nothing of regular women and the struggles they have faced , and often still face today , in the real world .
Whoever they are , they sure do n't get the irony of writing such a piece .
Because , obviously , they 'd never have had the career they 've had and they certainly would n't be sitting on any boards , editorial or otherwise , if it were n't for the feminism they so despise .
Young Non-Feminists
Sadly , many young women today - and not just right - wing ideologues - adamantly , and quite ludicrously , claim that they 're anything but feminists , grossly ignorant that a ) feminism simply means a belief in the equality of men and women , and b ) their freedom to do anything and everything they want with their lives is something that was won for them through hard - fought struggle by generations of feminists , starting back in the 19th century with the Suffragette movement 's simple demand for the right to vote .
And regardless of what one may think about the situation here in Canada , America , and the rest of the developed world , the fact remains that the majority of women around the globe continue to live in incredibly oppressive , discriminatory , sexist , sometimes outright misogynist , societies .
And I 'm not just talking about places like Afghanistan , Saudi Arabia and Iran .
Women 's Studies
As for the specific topic of Women 's Studies programs , I took a couple of Women 's Studies courses ( in which I was one of only two or three men in the class ) back in the 1980s when I was at the University of Victoria and , truth be told , they were the best courses I took during my four years there .
I thrived at History , Political Science , Sociology etc. , but I always thought it was a bit silly when certain profs tried to pass - off what we were learning as " objective truth " .
There may be such a thing in the world of Math and Science , but not in the social sciences .
And Women Studies embraced that reality and openly encouraged the mixing of objective facts with subjective experiences and feelings to come up with something much closer to an honest educational approach .
Simply put , real world experiences are relevant to academic study .
Marx , Weber and Durkheim are all fine and dandy , but nineteenth century theories can only carry one so far .
Sometimes it 's good to mix in a little personal , real - life experience .
And that - the National Post Editorial Board 's ridiculous exaggerations , oversimplifications and nostalgic pining for the days of outright inequality aside - is why I 'd say every university student should take at least one Women Studies class at some point in their academic career .
Particularly those young women out there who are planning to be doctors and lawyers and engineers , but who claim to want nothing to do with feminism .
Though those pining for the glory days of the nineteenth century , and / or 1990 's Afghanistan , should probably take a pass .
How Offensive Was It ?
Finally , I should point out that this piece was so offensive that even Anne Marie Owens , the National Post ’s managing editor for news , felt compelled to write her own response in today 's paper .
However , this response by Penni Stewart - president , Canadian Association of University Teachers - and Katherine Giroux - Bougard - national chairperson , Canadian Federation of Students - is a much better rebuttal .

Pick your subheadline :
a) It ’s time to stop being polite and start getting real .
b) Here ’s hoping a picture is worth 1,000 words .
Any questions ?
OK , I imagine that there will be a few .
Here ’s how I came up with these numbers .
Senate Bill .
These estimates are straightforward — they ’re taken directly from the CBO ’s report on premiums for people at different income levels .
A family of four earning an income of $ 54,000 would pay $ 4,000 in premiums , and could expect to incur another $ 5,000 in out - of - pocket costs .
The $ 4,000 premium represents a substantial discount , because the government is covering 72 percent of the premium — meaning that the gross cost of the premium is $ 14,286 , some $ 10,286 of which the government pays .
One caution : this reflects the situation before the public option was removed from the bill .
But , provided that the subsidy schedule is n’t changed as well , that should n’t change these numbers much .
Status Quo .
In 2009 , the average premium for a family in the individual market was $ 6,328 , according to the insurance lobbying group AHIP .
However , this figure paints an optimistic picture for two reasons .
Firstly , the average family size in the AHIP dataset is 3.03 people ; for a family of four , that number would scale upward to $ 7,925 , by my calculations .
Secondly , the CBO ’s estimates are based on 2016 figures , not 2009 , so to make an apples - to - apples comparison , we have to account for inflation .
According to Kaiser , the average cost of health coverage has increased by about 8.7 percent annually over the past decade , and by 8.8 percent for family coverage .
Let ’s scale that down slightly , assuming 7.5 annual inflation in premiums from 2009 through 2016 inclusive .
That would bring the cost of the family ’s premium up by a nominal 66 percent , to $ 13,149 .
And remember : these are based on estimates of premiums provided by the insurance lobby .
I have no particular reason to think that they ’re biased , but if they are , it ’s probably on the low side .
Not only , however , would this family paying a lot more under the status quo , but they ’d be doing so for inferior insurance .
According to the CBO , the amount of coverage in the individual market would improve by between 27 and 30 percent under the Senate ’s bill .
Taking the midpoint of those numbers ( 28.5 percent ) , we can infer that there would be about $ 1,427 in additional cost sharing to this family in the status quo as compared with the Senate bill ; this would bring their cost sharing to $ 6,427 total .
Add the $ 6,247 to the $ 13,149 and you get an annual cost of $ 19,576 — for a family earning $ 54,000 !
Obviously , very few such families are going to be able to afford that unless they have a lot of money in the bank .
So , some of these families will go without insurance , or they ’ll by really crappy insurance , or they ’ll pay the premiums but skimp on out - of - pocket costs , which will negatively impact their fiscal and physical health .
But if this family were to want to obtain equivalent coverage to that which would be available to them for $ 9,000 in the Senate bill , it would cost them between $ 19,000 and $ 20,000 , according to my estimates .
Status Quo with SCHIP .
Fortunately , some families in this predicament do receive some relief via the SCHIP program .
SCHIP eligibility varies from state to state ; a family earning income at 225 percent of the poverty line , as this family does , is eligible for SCHIP in about half of the country .
Premiums are fairly cheap under SCHIP — for a family at 225 percent of poverty , generally on the order of about $ 60 per month to cover two children .
We ’ll assume that this will inflate slightly to $ 75 per month , or $ 900 per year , by 2016 .
The two adults in the household will still have to buy insurance in the individual market , which will cost $ 7,684 by 2016 .
That makes the family ’s total premium $ 8,584 .
For the adults , we assume that the cost sharing component runs proportional to premiums , and totals $ 3,756 .
For the children , this calculation is a little bit more ambiguous .
Out - of - pocket costs under SCHIP are capped at 5 percent of family income , which would be $ 2,700 for this family .
But that ’s a cap and not an average — we ’ll assume that the average is half of the cap , or $ 1,350 .
Total cost - sharing , therefore , is $ 5,106 between the adults and the children .
This means that premiums plus out of pocket costs will equal $ 13,690 for this family .
I estimate the subsidy by subtracting this figure from the cost of unsubsidized insurance in the individual market ; the difference is $ 5,885 .
Caveat / Disclaimer .
There are , obviously , some simplifying assumptions here , especially with regard to SCHIP .
The only thing I can promise you is that I ’m “ showing my work ” .
I would actively encourage people to pick apart these numbers and come up with their own , more robust estimates .
One thing that should probably be accounted for is that the families in both the status quo and the status quo +
SCHIP cases will frequently be able to deduct their health care expenses from their taxable income , especially if they ’ve incurred substantial out - of - pocket costs .
That means that the difference in net costs is slightly exaggerated by my figures .
* * *
Nevertheless , it ’s clear that this family would be receiving a very substantial subsidy , on the order of $ 10,000 in pretax income , under the Senate ’s bill .
The reason I picked this particular family is because it provides a reality check against the example selected by the great Darcy Burner , who argued in an article at Open Left :
Affordable coverage for everyone : FAIL .
The latest CBO estimates for the Senate bill say that a family of four with a household income of $ 54,000 / year should expect to pay 17 % of their gross income on healthcare – about $ 9,000 / year .
( And that was when there was a public option to hold down costs ! )
That ’s more than they ’ll spend on federal taxes .
That ’s more than they ’ll spend on food .
I ’m guessing if you took a poll , very few Americans would consider that affordable .
And because of the way they ’ve approached this , there ’s no effective cost cap on premiums and nothing providing downward pressure , so this is a problem that would get worse rather than better over time .
We can debate whether $ 9,000 for a family earning $ 54,000 is “ affordable ” ; what we know is that it ’s a hell of a lot more affordable than the status quo , under which the family might have to pay more than twice as much to receive equivalent coverage .
In fact , Burner ’s example is unfortunately chosen ; she picked one of the groups — a low - income family in the individual market — that would benefit the most under the Senate package .
Other groups would not be so beneficially impacted .
Premiums are projected to rise slightly , for instance , for high - income earners in the individual market , although this is a small fraction of people and they ’d get better health coverage as a result .
And people in the employer market would not be much affected , except those with generous benefits packages subject to the excise tax ; these folks would have to pay more out of pocket , although probably in exchange for more cash income .
On the other hand , there are those who have a pre-existing condition and who are not able to buy health coverage at all , and for whom the benefit is almost incalculably large .
I understand that most of the liberal skepticism over the Senate bill is well intentioned .
But it has become way , way off the mark .
Where do you think the $ 800 billion goes ?
It goes to low - income families just like these .
Where do you think it comes from ?
We wo n’t know for sure until the Senate and House produce their conference bill , but it comes substantially from corporations and high - income earners , plus some efficiency gains .
Because this is primarily a political analysis blog , I think people tend to assume that I ’m lost in the political forest and not seeing the policy trees .
In fact , the opposite is true .
For any “ progressive ” who is concerned about the inequality of wealth , income and opportunity in America , this bill would be an absolutely monumental achievement .
The more compelling critique , rather , is that the bill would fail to significantly “ bend the cost curve ” .
I do n’t dismiss that criticism at all , and certainly the insertion of a public option would have helped at the margins .
But fundamentally , that is a critique that would traditionally be associated with the conservative side of the debate , as it ultimately goes to mounting deficits in the wake of expanded government entitlements .
And please do pick apart my numbers : I ’m sure that you will find some questionable assumptions and possibly some outright errors .
But if you found a persuasive , progressive policy rationale against the bill , I ’d be stunned .
EDIT — Another important point or two :
To the extent there are critiques about this post , they are liable to revolve around the fact that $ 9,000 is not so affordable for our not - so - imaginary family .
Two things to note on this :
Firstly , in most years , the family will not be paying $ 9,000 .
They ’ll be paying closer to $ 4,000 — the base cost of the premium — or maybe $ 5,000 for a few meds and doctors ’ visits and so forth .
The costs will be much higher in those years when a member of the family gets sick .
But the alternative in those years would be not having health insurance at all — and in that case , either the the family member might die from the condition or the family will go bankrupt trying to prevent that .
Also , frankly , the individual mandate penalty is not very harsh , especially for lower - income people , so there ’s some potential for gaming the system in a way that is n’t economically optimal but would give this particular family a better deal than suggested above .
Secondly , the critiques over the level of subsidies are rather tangential to where the locus of progressive energy has been — on the public option .
The presence of a watered - down public option would make very little difference in terms of this family ’s cost structure — and yet , this same bill with a public option is one that most liberals would be head - over - heels for .
I happen to agree that the cost subsidies need to be improved somewhat for this type of family and indeed I wish that this is where more of the left ’s energy had been directed .
Fortunately , I think this is something that really can ( still ) be improved in conference committee or on the floor .
For instance , if you adopted the House bill ’s subsidies for families at under 250 % of poverty , and the Senate ’s ( which actually become more generous ) for people at greater than 250 % of poverty — perhaps in exchange for a harsher ( not weaker ! ) individual mandate penalty — you ’d have a pretty reasonable compromise .
The government has begun a major offensive against the rebels A senior Maoist rebel leader in India has offered a ceasefire ahead of possible talks with the government .
Koteswara Rao - also known as Kishenji - told the BBC that the truce , apparently without conditions , could start later this week .
The government , which recently launched a major offensive against the rebels , has yet to respond to the offer .
The rebels want communist rule in a large swathe of India .
More than 6,000 people have died in the 20 - year fight .
Koteswara Rao offered a 72 - day ceasefire across central and western India between 25 February and 7 May .
" First let us have a ceasefire and stop killing each other .
Then we will see whether we can talk meaningfully , " he told the BBC .
The offer came in response to Home Minister P Chidambaram 's recent statement that the Maoists had to give up violence in order to hold talks with the government .
" They do n't have to surrender weapons or disband their army .
They just have to stop the violence for negotiations to happen , " Mr Chidambaram said .
The BBC's Subir Bhaumik in Calcutta reports that the home minister is believed to be using a cabinet colleague for secret talks with the Maoists .
According to senior home ministry officials , Railway Minister Mamata Banerji , who hails from West Bengal and who has always advocated negotiations rather than military action against the Maoists , is conducting the talks , our correspondent says .
' Last chance '
Two weeks ago , Koteswara Rao offered to hold talks - but only if four senior rebel leaders were freed from custody and a security offensive against them halted .
The Maoists have fought for a communist state for 20 years
Our correspondent says the climbdown points to a division in rebel ranks over holding talks with the government .
Koteswara Rao has been under pressure from other senior rebels to open talks with the government , our correspondent says .
The rebels also fear continuing violence may lead to them losing support .
At the same time , some analysts say the rebels may have offered the ceasefire to regroup and consolidate their defences in the middle of the security offensive .
Mr Chidambaram says the Maoists have " one last chance " to hold talks with the government or the security forces will step up the offensive against them .
Nearly 50,000 federal paramilitary troops and an equal number of policemen , equipped with helicopters and unmanned aerial surveillance vehicles , are taking part in the assault on the rebels , officials say .
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has described the Maoists as the " country 's biggest internal security challenge " .
Nearly 600 civilians died in Maoist violence last year , the government says .
More than 300 security personnel and 200 rebels were also killed .
The rebels have a presence in more than a third of India 's 600 districts and are in effective control of a so - called " red corridor " across the centre of the country .
They say they are fighting for the rights of the rural poor who complain they have been neglected by successive governments for decades .

THE swine flu scare was a " false pandemic " led by drugs companies that stood to make billions from vaccines , a leading health expert said .
Wolfgang Wodarg , head of health at the Council of Europe , claimed major firms organized a " campaign of panic " to put pressure on the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to declare a pandemic , UK tabloid The Sun reports .
He believes it is , " one of the greatest medicine scandals of the century " , and has called for an inquiry .
An emergency debate on the issue will be held by the Council of Europe later this month .
The Council of Europe covers 47 European countries and seeks to develop common and democratic principles between the nations .
" It 's just a normal kind of flu .
It does not cause a tenth of deaths caused by the classic seasonal flu , " Dr Wodarg said .
" The great campaign of panic we have seen provided a golden opportunity for representatives from labs who knew they would hit the jackpot in the case of a pandemic being declared .
" We want to clarify everything that brought about this massive operation of disinformation .
" We want to know who made decisions , on the basis of what evidence , and precisely how the influence of the pharmaceutical industry came to bear on the decision - making . "
" A group of people in the WHO is associated very closely with the pharmaceutical industry . "
The WHO recently reaffirmed its stance that the pandemic is not over .
However , the number of swine flu deaths is dramatically lower than expected .
In an interview with France 's L'Humanite on Sunday , Dr Wodarg also raised concerns about swine flu vaccines .
" The vaccines were developed too quickly .
Some ingredients were insufficiently tested , " he said .
" But there is worse to come .
The vaccine developed by Novartis was produced in a bioreactor from cancerous cells , a technique that had never been used until now .
" This was not necessary .
It has also led to a considerable mismanagement of public money .
" The time has come at last for us to make demands on governments .
The purpose of the inquiry is to prevent more false alarms of this type in the future . "
" We must make sure people can rely on the analysis and the expertise of national and international public institutions .
The latter are now discredited , because millions of people have been vaccinated with products with inherent possible health risks . "
Comment is being sought from the Department of Health and Ageing .

Originally published as Swine flu ' false pandemic a scandal '
This past week readers of An American Editor were polled on obstacles to buying an ebook .
Readers were asked which of the listed items was the single biggest obstacle to their buying ebooks .
I was surprised by the results .
The two DRM questions gathered the most votes ( together 57 % of all votes ) .
Interestingly , 30 % responded “ DRM of any type regardless of whether it affects device portability ” and 27 % chose “ DRM that is not cross - device ( lack of device portability ) , ” indicating a near equal split among ebookers over DRM .
Approximately half of DRM choosers are willing to accept some form of DRM as long as it is device portable and half say they wo n’t accept DRM under any circumstance .
The third most popular response was pricing higher than $ 9.99 ( 26 % ) .
At least 26 % of responders are willing to accept DRM of any flavor if price does not exceed that magical $ 9.99 threshold .
( As we know , this threshold was set by Amazon .
It is n’t clear to me on what basis $ 9.99 was chosen as opposed to , say , $ 7.99 .
It also is n’t clear whether $ 9.99 is really that magical threshold or just a threshold currently popularized by Amazon . )
Other responses were as follows :
Price greater than $ 4.99 = 8 % of responders
Poor formatting = 5 %
Poor editing = 3 %
Book is self - published = 2 %
Clearly , ebookers are more willing to put up with poor formatting and editing than with a high price and DRM .
Does this mean that as long as a book is sold for $ 9.99 or less formatting and editing do not matter to ebookers ?
We ca n’t draw that conclusion — or really any conclusion — from last week ’s poll , but it does raise the issue of what compromises ebookers are willing to accept .
But what is interesting is the disparity in price levels .
I would have thought that for ebookers to whom price was the biggest obstacle , $ 4.99 would have been the magic threshold .
Apparently , ebookers are willing to pay more albeit not above $ 9.99 .
However , there were a lot of complaints that geographical restrictions were not a choice , with many readers saying that is the biggest obstacle to their purchasing an ebook .
I wonder how much of an obstacle it really is .
Let ’s go to this week ’s poll , for which there are several questions , so please be sure to read through this article .
Let ’s assume that the publisher of an ebook you have been eagerly waiting release of offers you the opportunity to buy that ebook and will make 1 change to purchasing “ obstacles ” as an inducement for you to buy it .
Which change would you ask the publisher to make from among those listed ?
[ This poll is not intended to cover every possible option .
I recognize that for some people the only answer is all of the choices or none of the choices or some other unlisted choice .
However , for this poll these are the items of interest . ]
If an ebook were released today that you had been eagerly waiting for , and was released with all of the following “ obstacles ” to your purchasing it , but the publisher agreed to make 1 change of your choice if you agreed to buy the ebook ,
If the only “ obstacle ” were DRM , that is , the ebook ’s price was no higher than $ 9.99 and there were no geographical restrictions ,
Although not explicitly stated in the discussions about ebooks , most of the discussion is focused on fiction ebooks , the books that people tend to read once and do not look to as reference books .
That raises questions about whether an ebooker ’s perspective changes depending on the type of book in question : fiction or nonfiction .
So this question is addressed solely to nonfiction ebooks , such as a biography , a history , or a book about computer software .
This poll will run for 1 week .
Please participate .
If you have suggestions for questions or topics for future polls please mention them in the comments section .
We 're releasing this statement to the media and Congress -- will you help us reach 250,000 signatures on it ?

JPC is a full PC emulator ( à la Bochs but in Java ) , including the BIOS , VGA BIOS , floppy drive and other hardware components .
Of particular interest to me , is the way x86 instructions are modeled and executed .
It works and stays at the binary level ( no fancy disassembly ) , and actually compiles x86 instructions to a simpler microcode language representing “ atomic ” instructions .
This microcode language is then straightforward to execute , although a bit more complex than similar micro-languages ( such as VEX , REIL or BIL ) .
The core of the x86 semantics is contained in the x86 to microcode compiler , found in org.jpc.emulator.memory.codeblock.optimised.ProtectedModeUDecoder.decodeOpcode( ) .
This method takes a binary x86 instruction and decodes its prefices , opcode , modrm , sib , displacement and immediate parameters .
Then it delegates the translation of the microcode to this sequence of methods :
writeInputOperands ( prefices , opcode , modrm , sib , displacement , immediate ) ; writeOperation ( prefices , opcode , modrm ) ; writeOutputOperands ( prefices , opcode , modrm , sib , displacement ) ; writeFlags ( prefices , opcode , modrm ) ; < span style = " color : # 000000 ; " >
For instance , if we take the binary instruction 04 42 ( add al , 0x42 ) , it is decoded with opcode = 0x04 and immediate = 0x42 .
Then based on these values , the instruction is translated to the following microcode sequence :
// writeInputOperands : LOAD0_AL LOAD1_IB 0x42 // writeOperation : ADD // writeOutputOperands : STORE0_AL // writeFlags : ADD_O8 _FLAGS < span style= " color : # ffffff ; " > </ span >
Now , understanding the semantics of an x86 instruction reduces to understanding the semantics of the microcode language .
For this , we need the microcode interpreter , which is org.jpc.emulator.memory.codeblock.optimised.ProtectedModeUBlock.execute( ) .
It is a relatively simple execution language ( execution - wise ) , with 5 general - purpose registers but with roughly 750 opcodes .
The execution of the above microcodes translates to this Java sequence :
reg0 = cpu.eax & 0xff ; reg1 = 0x42 & 0xff ; reg2 = reg0 ; reg0 = reg2 + reg1 ; cpu.eax = ( cpu.eax & ~ 0xff ) | ( reg0 & 0xff ) ; cpu.setZeroFlag(( byte)reg0 ) ; cpu.setParityFlag( reg0 ) ; cpu.setSignFlag( ( byte)reg0 ) ; cpu.setCarryFlag( reg0 , Processor.CY_TWIDDLE_FF ) ; cpu.setAuxiliaryCarryFlag( reg2 , reg1 , result , Processor.AC_XOR ) ; cpu.setOverflowFlag(reg0 , reg2 , reg1 , Processor.OF_ADD_BYTE ) ;
The Chatfields ' children were too scared to go in the front garden A father has spoken of his ordeal after being wrongly named as a paedophile on Facebook by a disgruntled neighbour .
Luke Chatfield was forced to leave his job , abused in the street and had a panic alarm installed at his home in Sale , Greater Manchester .
The father - of - three said his neighbour , Sally Pepper , posted the " evil lies " due to a dispute about her loud music .
A police spokesman said Ms Pepper was fined £ 80 for sending false messages likely to cause distress .
Ms Pepper posted the message on a Facebook vigilante site for sex offenders , which has since been removed .
She wrote : " I know another one , Luke Chatfield , he works in BBs cafe , Stretford Arndale . "
Another user then responded with : " Anyone know his house number ? "
Mr Chatfield only found out when someone told him about it at work .
' Constant abuse ' " I had to leave my job , " he said , " It was too much to cope with , she had posted where I worked and I was getting constant abuse .
" We had snowballs pelted at my house and my three young children were even too scared to go in the front garden in case they saw her . "
Mr Chatfield 's wife Karen said she felt Ms Pepper had " got away with her evil lies " .
Mr Chatfield , who also volunteers at his children 's school , has a clean criminal record bureau ( CRB ) check and has never broken the law .
" Two of my children are disabled , my wife is registered disabled , and I have to make sure my family is fed .
Sally Pepper told the BBC she did not regret what she did " Losing about £ 1,500 in earnings after being forced out of my job has made life even more difficult .
" She has almost destroyed my life . "
Ms Pepper told the BBC that she " was a nervous wreck " and wants to move house .
She said she did not regret what she did .
A Greater Manchester Police spokesman added : " Officers spoke to a woman .
.. about the offence and issued her with a fixed penalty notice for sending false messages likely to cause distress under the Communications Act .
" Both parties were in agreement with this course of action .
" The Sale Neighbourhood Policing Team has also been working with the housing trust in an effort to resolve any long - term issues between the neighbours . "

At Greg Kuperberg ’s request , I ’ve decided to follow my Ten Reasons To Believe P!=NP with …
Thirteen Reasons Why I ’d Be Surprised If Quantum Computing Were Fundamentally Impossible
So that there ’s no question about exactly where I stand , I ’ll start out by repeating , for the ten billionth time , the Official Scott Aaronson Quantum Computing Position Statement .
It ’s entirely conceivable that quantum computing will turn out to be impossible for a fundamental reason .
This would be much more interesting than if it ’s possible , since it would overturn our most basic ideas about the physical world .
The only real way to find out is to try to build a quantum computer .
Such an effort seems to me at least as scientifically important as ( say ) the search for supersymmetry or the Higgs boson .
I have no idea — none — how far it will get in my lifetime .
I now offer thirteen arguments to support the above views .
The Obvious Argument .
Quantum mechanics has been the foundation for all non-gravitational physics since 1926 .
Hoping that it would “ just go away ” has been one of the most consistently losing strategies in the history of science .
If physicists and engineers did n’t take quantum mechanics seriously as a description of the world , they would n’t have been able to invent the laser , transistor , or classical computer .
For that matter , they would n’t be able to explain why all the atoms in the universe do n’t instantly disintegrate .
Now , if you start with quantum mechanics , and write down the model of computation that directly flows from it , what do you end up with ?
BQP : Bounded - Error Quantum Polynomial - Time .
The Experimental Argument .
Ten years ago , one would n’t have been able to do much more than mount a general defense of quantum mechanics .
But by now , liquid - NMR quantum computers have been built that not only factored 15 into 3 x 5 with small probability of error , but also searched 8 - item databases .
I ’ve seen some of the machines that performed these staggering computational feats right here in Waterloo ; they look like big-ass cylinders with the word “ Bruker ” on them .
Seriously , while liquid - NMR ( at least for now ) does n’t seem to be scalable , there ’s been lots of recent work on solid - state NMR , photonics , and ion traps , all of which ( if I ’m not mistaken ) are up to at least 3 qubits .
While I do n’t think the experimentalists are anywhere close to succeeding , these are smart people who have n’t been sitting on their asses ( or if they have , then no doubt hard at work at a lab table or something ) .
The Better - Shor - Than - More Argument .
Why do skeptics always assume that , if quantum mechanics turns out to be only approximate , then whatever theory supersedes it will reinstate the Extended Church - Turing Thesis ?
Why is n’t it just as likely , a priori , that the new theory would yield even more computational power than BQP ?
This is n’t merely a logical point : to the extent that people have tried to propose serious alternatives to quantum mechanics ( where “ serious ” means “ agreeing with known experiments ” ) , those alternatives often do involve more computational power than BQP .
The Sure / Shor Argument .
If you believe quantum mechanics is going to break down before nontrivial quantum computing becomes possible , then you must believe there ’s some point where it will break down — some level of size , or complexity , or whatever , at which it will cease to be a useful description of the world .
What is that point ?
In other words , where is the line — possibly a fuzzy , asymptotic , resource - dependent line — that puts the quantum states that have already been observed on one side , and the quantum states that arise in Shor ’s factoring algorithm on the other ?
In a paper I wrote three years ago , I called such a line a “ Sure / Shor separator , ” and challenged skeptics to come up with some example of what it might be .
I even tried to get the ball rolling by studying such separators myself .
My idea was that having a Sure / Shor separator could motivate further research : once they knew where the “ barrier ” was , the experimentalists could set to work trying to cross it ; then , if they succeeded , the skeptics could come back with a new barrier , and so on .
Unfortunately , no skeptic has yet risen to the challenge .
It ’s not hard to see why : if you start with the many - particle entangled states that have already been observed ( for example , by the Zeilinger group and by Ghosh et al. ) and then throw in a few closure properties , you quickly end up with — well , the set of all quantum states .
Coming up with a “ reasonable ” set of states that includes
Sure states but does n’t include Shor states turns out to be an extremely hard problem .
The Linearity Argument .
In my experience , at least 70 % of all objections to quantum computing boil down to the idea that a quantum computer would be a “ souped - up analog computer ” — a machine that would store information not in voltage differences or the positions of pulleys , but instead in exponentially - small amplitudes .
From this idea it follows readily that , just as “ old - school ” analog computers have always run up against scalability problems , so too will quantum computers .
To see why the analogy fails , think about classical probabilities .
If you flip a coin a thousand times , you ’ll end up with a probability distribution over outcomes that requires real numbers of order 2-1000 to describe .
Does it follow from this that classical probabilistic computers are really analog computers in disguise , or that classical probability theory must be a mere approximation to some deeper , underlying theory ?
Of course not — for , unlike voltages or pulleys , probabilities evolve in time by means of norm - preserving linear transformations , which are insensitive to small errors .
Well , quantum amplitudes also evolve by means of norm - preserving linear transformations , and this is what makes them behave like probabilities with respect to error , and not like the state variables of an analog computer .
The Fault - Tolerance Argument .
Among the many nontrivial consequences of this linearity , there ’s one that probably counts as a separate argument : the Threshold Theorem .
This theorem states that even if a quantum computer is subject to noise , we can still use it to do universal computation , provided we have parallel processing and a supply of fresh qubits , and provided the error rate is at most ε per qubit per time step , for some constant ε>0 independent of the length of the computation .
The original lower bound on ε was about 10 - 6 , but recently Knill and others have brought it up to 1 - 3 % under plausible assumptions .
Many quantum computing researchers talk about this theorem as the knight in shining armor who rode in unexpectedly to vindicate all their hopes .
They ’re entitled to do so , but to me , the theorem has always felt more like a beautiful , detailed working - out of something that could n’t possibly have been false .
( And not just because it ’s a theorem . )
The What - A - Waste Argument .
Why do I say that the threshold theorem “ could n’t possibly have been false ” ?
Well , suppose quantum mechanics were an accurate description of reality , yet quantum computing was still impossible for some fundamental reason .
In that case , we ’d have to accept that Nature was doing a staggering amount of quantum computation that could never be “ extracted , ” even in principle .
Indeed , even assuming that life is ( and always will be ) confined to the vicinity of one planet , the resulting computational waste would make the waste of 1011 uninhabited galaxies look like chickenfeed .
I do n’t deny that such a possibility is logically consistent , but my complexity - theoretic instincts rebel against it .
The Non-Extravagance Argument .
In my opinion , if quantum computers could solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time , then there really would be grounds for regarding them as physically extravagant .
Like coming up with theories that allow causality violations and superluminal signalling , coming up with models of computation that can simulate NP , #P , and PSPACE is just too easy .
It ’s not interesting .
The interesting task is to come up with a model of computation that ’s stronger than the usual ones ( P , BPP , and P / poly ) , but not so strong that it encompasses NP - complete problems .
If it were n’t for BQP , I do n’t think I ’d have any clear idea of what such a model could look like .
( Sure , we have problems and complexity classes below NP , but that ’s different from a full - fledged model of computation . )
The Turn - The - Tables Argument .
If building quantum computers that outperform classical ones is fundamentally impossible , then it must be possible to write classical computer programs that efficiently simulate any quantum system found in Nature .
And yet , even though this way of looking at the question is perfectly equivalent , there ’s a reason quantum computing skeptics avoid it .
This is that , as soon as you frame the issue this way , they ( the skeptics ) are the ones who look like wild - eyed technological optimists — believing we ’ll be able to simulate superconductors and quark - gluon plasmas on an ordinary desktop PC !
The “ staid , ” “ conservative ” position is that such a simulation wo n’t be possible — or , equivalently , that the systems being simulated have more computational power than the PC doing the simulating .
The Island - In - Theoryspace Argument .
String theorists have been ridiculed for claiming that string theory is “ too beautiful to be wrong . ”
But as Peter Woit points out in his fascinating new book , this is not at all a bad argument .
It ’s a fine argument ; the real question is whether string theory — with its perturbation series , ten dimensions of which six are compactified for unknown reasons , landscape of vacua , etc. — really is as beautiful as its proponents think it is .
At the risk of breaking my vow , let me hasten to say that I ’m in no position to judge .
What I do know is that there ’s something mathematically unique about quantum mechanics : how it takes advantage of special properties of the L 2 norm that fail for other p-norms , how the parameter - counting for mixed states that works perfectly with complex numbers fails with real numbers and quaternions , and so on .
Crucially , it seems all but impossible to change quantum mechanics while retaining its nice properties .
More so than general relativity or any other theory we have , quantum mechanics gives every indication of being an island in theoryspace .
The Only - Game - In - Town Argument .
However one feels about the alternatives to string theory — loop quantum gravity , spin foams , twistors , and so on — at least each one has a “ developer base , ” a community of physicists who are actively trying to make it work .
By contrast , I do n’t know of any picture of the world in which quantum computing is impossible , that ’s being actively developed by any research community anywhere .
( Gerard ‘t Hooft and Stephen Wolfram are not research communities . )
All the skepticism of quantum computing that I ’m aware of is purely negative in character .
The Historical Argument .
If the above arguments are sound , then why have n’t people already succeeded in building quantum computers ?
It ’s been what , ten years already ?
Some historical perspective might be helpful here : in Samuel Johnson ’s The History of Rasselas , Prince of Abissinia , written in 1759 , Johnson has one of his characters give a correct explanation of why heavier - than - air flying machines should be physically possible , and then build a test plane that promptly plummets into a lake .
Johnson was safe in ridiculing the idea ; it would be another 144 years before Kitty Hawk .
Closer to our topic , Darwin wrote in his autobiography about an eccentric loon of his acquaintance , who dreamed of building an engine to automate routine human thought .
Though the loon — a certain Charles Babbage — had n’t run afoul of any fundamental theory , his proposal to build a classical computer was a century ahead of its time .
Since the 1600 ’s , science has often been generations ahead of technology .
History gives us no reason at all to assume that a technology will be discovered to be compatible with known laws of physics at about the same time as it becomes possible to implement .
The Trademark - Twist Argument .
This last argument is the hardest one to articulate , but possibly the most compelling to my mind .
In my view , Nature has been telling us , over and over and over , that our everyday intuitions will match the physical world if and only if we first apply a little “ twist ” to them .
Often this twist involves an unusual symmetry , or switching from the L 1 to the L 2 norm , or inserting negative or complex numbers where our intuition says that only nonnegative real numbers would make sense .
We see such a twist in special relativity , in the metric that ’s not positive definite but instead has a ( - 1,1,1,1 ) signature .
We see it in the - 1 phase that the universe picks up when you swap a fermion with its identical twin .
We see it in the fact that , to rotate an electron back to where it was , you have to turn it not 360o but 720o .
We see it in the Dirac equation .
We see it , of course , in quantum mechanics itself .
And what is BQP , if not P=BPP with Nature ’s trademark little twist ?

OCamlとextlibとfindlibと、あともちろんRubyが必要です。
$ cd nodedump $ ruby extconf $ make $ cd ../ src $ make $ cd .. $ ./rubydep ~/gonzui-1.2 2>gonzui.dot
などとして使います 。
標準出力とかの使い方がおかしいですが、許してください。Graphvizのdotになるので、あとは好きに下降してください。gonzui-1.2を解析した結果のイメージがあります( http://soutaro.com/gonzui-1.2.png)。
研究でどうしても必要になったため作りました。多分、当分更新しないと思います。
