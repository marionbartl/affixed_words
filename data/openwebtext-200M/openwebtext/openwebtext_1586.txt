Orange Dwarf Confirmed to be On Likely Collision Course With Our Solar System
Gliese 710 should arrive sometime within the next 1.5 million years
Two British nuclear submarines went to sea with a potentially disastrous safety problem that left both vessels at risk of a catastrophic accident , the Guardian can reveal .
Safety valves designed to release pressure from steam generators in an emergency were completely sealed off when the nuclear hunter killers Turbulent and Tireless left port , a leaked memo discloses .
The problem went undetected on HMS Turbulent for more than two years , during which time the vessel was on operations around the Atlantic , and visited Bergen in Norway , the Portuguese capital , Lisbon , and Faslane naval base near Glasgow .
It was not noticed on HMS Tireless for more than a year , and was finally detected last month , two months after Tireless started sea trials from its home port at Devonport naval base in Plymouth .
Tireless was involved in another serious incident in 2007 , when two submariners were killed in an onboard explosion in air purification equipment .
In 2000 , it was stranded in Gibraltar for nearly a year after a leak from pipework leading from its reactor , putting immense strain on British relations with Spain .
The Ministry of Defence memo , which was written last week , admits that both cases involving the sealed - off valves were " a serious incident " that raised major questions about " weak and ambiguous " safety procedures at Devonport dockyard and within the Royal Navy .
The blocked valves , on the hull of the submarines , meant that steam from nuclear - powered boilers could not have been released in an emergency , leading to a potentially disastrous build - up of pressure .
John Large , a consultant on nuclear safety who advises governments on submarine safety , said : " It was a very significant failure .
These two submarines were unfit for service .
It was a perilous situation . "
He said sealing these valves was like blocking the valve on a domestic pressure cooker .
If pressure had built up to dangerous levels , the submarine 's steam circuit could have burst , leaking radioactivity into the submarine and shutting down the reactor .
" There would be a risk of fatalities , " Large said .
" This was such a glaring and fundamental omission .
It 's jaw - dropping . "
The MoD memo , which has been circulated to thousands of managers , naval personnel and civilian workers at Devonport and Faslane naval bases , admits that the incidents should have been prevented but that safety procedures were seriously flawed .
" Despite there being several potential safety nets , none succeeded in identifying and arresting the events " before the submarines left the dockyard , the memo reveals .
It adds there has been a major shake - up of safety procedures .
The MoD told the Guardian : " We can confirm that , as part of routine maintenance checks , an issue was identified on HMS Turbulent and HMS Tireless which has now been resolved .
" We take safety extremely seriously and as soon as we were aware of this potential issue we took action to address the problem .
Detailed investigations to assess the cause and any possible safety implications are ongoing and it is too early to speculate on the outcome of those investigations . "
The memo said that the problem arose after the hull valves were replaced by " test blanks " during repair and maintenance work at the privatised Devonport nuclear dockyard .
These test blanks were fitted for " essential " leakage tests on the hulls and " useful " strength and leakage tests of steam discharge pipes inside the vessels .
They should have been removed before the submarines left the dockyard to begin their pre-operational " work - up " voyages in advance of going on patrol .
But there was " poor " discipline at Devonport .
The nuclear reactors on both vessels were allowed to be turned on and operated in sea trials and during full operations " without overpressure protection on steam generators " , the memo states .
John Ainslie , a spokesman for Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament , who monitors nuclear submarine activity , said that the very detailed safety warnings and criticisms in the memo showed the MoD was extremely worried about the discovery .
" This is one of a series of serious problems that they 've had with the nuclear fleet and at some point , there will be serious consequences , " he said .
" What this document picks out is a concern that they 're missing something as serious as this because the maintenance procedures are very complex .
There 's the clear potential that they 're not picking things up that they should . "

Astronauts may now be able to satisfy their sweet tooth as researchers have found a strawberry that can grow in space with little maintenance and energy .
Cary Mitchell , professor of horticulture , and Gioia Massa , a horticulture research scientist at Purdue University in the US , tested several cultivars of strawberries and found one variety named Seascape , which seems to meet the requirements for becoming a space crop .
" What we 're trying to do is grow our plants and minimise all of our inputs , " Massa said .
" We can grow these strawberries under shorter photoperiods than we thought and still get pretty much the same amount of yield . "
Seascape strawberries are day - neutral , meaning they are n't sensitive to the length of available daylight to flower .
Seascape was tested with as much as 20 hours of daylight and as little as 10 hours .
While there were fewer strawberries with less light , each berry was larger and the volume of the yields was statistically the same .
" I was astounded that even with a day - neutral cultivar we were able to get basically the same amount of fruit with half the light , " Mitchell said .
The findings showed that the Seascape strawberry cultivar is a good candidate for a space crop because it meets several guidelines set by NASA .
Strawberry plants are relatively small , meeting mass and volume restrictions .
Since Seascape provides fewer , but larger , berries under short days , there is less labour required of crew members who would have to pollinate and harvest the plants by hand .
Needing less light cuts down energy requirements not only for lamps , but also for systems that would have to remove heat created by those lights .
" We 're trying to think of the whole system -- growing food , preparing it and getting rid of the waste , " Massa said .
" Strawberries are easy to prepare and there 's little waste . "
Seascape also had less cycling , meaning it steadily supplied fruit throughout the test period .
Massa said the plants kept producing fruit for about six months after starting to flower .
Mitchell said the earliest space crops will likely be part of a " salad machine , " a small growth unit that will provide fresh produce that can supplement traditional space meals .
Crops being considered include lettuce , radishes and tomatoes .
Strawberries may be the only sweet fruit being considered , he said .
These findings were reported online in Advances in Space Research .

Posted by John , May 18th , 2010 - under Profit rates , Profits , Rudd Government , Rudd Labor .
It ’s a lie that Labor stands for nothing .
Its actions in power show it stands for war , poverty , racism and keeping the bosses rich .
On war , the ALP has bolstered troop numbers in Afghanistan as part of the insurance policy with the US called the Alliance .
This enables Australian imperialism to expand its influence in the region and join with the US in containing China ’s imperial growth .
What does it matter to Labor that a few misguided working class kids die for imperialism – theirs and ours ?
On poverty , the Rudd Government has continued the attack on unions begun by Hawke and Keating and carried on by Howard .
Fair Work Australia is but a nuanced version of Work Choices .
Its raison d’etre is to keep workers under tight control and ensure their unions do n’t and ca n’t get out of control ( ie strike for more pay ) .
In other words Labor is about continuing the long term trend of the bosses getting a bigger and bigger share of the national cake at the expense of workers .
No wonder Clive Palmer is so fat .
Labor has been feeding him .
In the 3 years Labor has been in power the position of the most disadvantaged group in Australia , our Aboriginal brothers and sisters , has gone backwards on most indicators .
They die much younger , often of the diseases of poverty , they are much poorer than the rest of us , and of course under the racist Northern Territory intervention they are subject to income quarantining that no white yet faces ( although some soon will ) .
The intervention in the Northern Territory is not about protecting kids .
It is about demonising aborigines , targeting the poor and disadvantaged and stealing their land .
Labor is even handed in its racism .
It applies its ‘ standards ’ not just to native born blacks but to dark skinned people from overseas too .
At the moment the Rudd Government has frozen the processing of refugee applications from Sri Lankan and and Afghan asylum seekers .
The situation is evidently so good in their home countries that we should n’t rush into these things .
Let ’s leave aside the fact that Afghanistan is a hellhole of Western making and in Sri Lanka the Government is conducting a campaign of genocide against Tamils .
Labor clearly stands for something on the environment , what our esteemed Prime Minister calls the great moral challenge of our time .
So great that he has postponed doing anything about it until 2012 at the earliest .
The plan Labor had for addressing climate change was in fact a set of handouts to the polluters to continue polluting .
Their Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was worse than doing nothing .
There is one principle that links all these policies .
If Labor stands for anything , it stands for the defence of the profit system and the restoration and improvement of profit rates .
This means at best moderating improvements in workers ’ living standards and at worst attacking them .
Labor rules for capital ; the Liberals rule for capitalists .
In a period when profit rates have been stagnant or falling in most of the developed world , and in Australia , almost every policy Labor has or adopts is geared to improving the profitability of Australian capitalism .
That is the Party ’s essence .
Three would - be thugs have learnt their lesson after setting upon a fellow train passenger in a dimly - lit alley in Sydney 's west
The three men attacked the 27 - year - old German medical student after getting off the train and following him down the alley at Kingswood on Tuesday .
What the muggers did not realise was that the alley ran behind the Ninja Senshi Ryu warrior school .
A ninja student coming out of class noticed the attack and alerted his teacher and three other students .
Ninja sensei , Kaylan Soto , says he and his students gave chase to the men .
" We looked around to see what was happening and there were three blokes on this guy just kicking him and punching him in the head , " he said .
" We started running towards them and they took off .
They would have seen five of us in ninja gear ... all in black with our belts on , running toward them .
" I think they 're probably still running if I 'm not mistaken . "
Police say they have charged a 16 - year - old boy and a 20 - year - old man with robbery in company over the assault .
They are looking for a third male described as being aged between 15 and 17 , 165 cm tall and caucasian .
Anyone with information is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 .
" Prince of Persia " star Gemma Arterton is the front - runner to replace Megan Fox in " Transformers 3 , " The Wrap has learned .
An individual close to the casting process says the actress has already had discussions with Bay about the coveted role .
Other possible replacements for Fox include models Bar Rafaeli , Miranda Kerr and Brooklyn Decker .
What is interesting about this is that we got a chance to talk to Gemma at the Prince of Persia : The Sands of Time premiere on Monday night .
We only got her for a few seconds on the red carpet and we took that time to ask her about a possible Clash of the Titans sequel .
She gave us a rather cryptic response .
" I do n’t know if I am doing ‘ Clash of the Titans 2 . ’
I have n’t seen a script yet so I do n’t know if it ’s happening , " she said .
Cool , that ’s a normal reaction , but then we asked whether she would want to make the sequel , and we got this answer : " I ’m not saying . "
We thought it was a weird response but moved on until we read the above about the possibility of her starring in Transformers 3 .
We ’re not sure when they would start production on a second Clash of the Titans , and one would think that she could do both , though her reaction may be telling that she ’s going to concentrate on the Michael Bay sequel for now .
We ’ll have to wait and see how this one turns out !
We should know soon who gets the role as shooting is already getting underway .

Once I was listening the health benefits of herbs on the radio , a specialist on the herbs said that stinging nettle was one of the most effective and beneficial herbs for our health .
He said that if people was aware of the benefits of nettle and how curative it was , they cultivated nothing but nettle .
This allegation may seem a bit unrealistic or pretentious , however it has many great benefits indeed .
Stinging nettle , or commonly known with its botanical name Urtica Dioica , is a plant growing in the tropical areas around the world .
The homeland of nettle is Brazil and other South American countries .
It is also abundant in Northern Europe and Asia .
Nettle has a well - known reputation for giving a sting when the skin touches the hairs and bristles on the leaves and stems .
It grows 2 to 4 meters .
It has white , green and yellow leaves .
When someone feels being stung by nettle , this is actually because of the irritants in the nettle .
Some of those irritants are formic acid , histamine and acetylcholine .
Let ’s talk about our main topic , that is , the health benefits of Stinging Nettle ( in othe words Urtica Dioica ) .
The Moon keeps getting more interesting all the time !
But now comes “ shocking ” news that exploring polar craters could be much harder and more dangerous than originally thought .
New research shows that as the solar wind flows over natural obstructions on the moon , such as the rims of craters at the poles , the craters could be charged to hundreds of volts .
“ In a nutshell , what we ’re finding is that the polar craters are very unusual electrical environments , and in particular there can be large surface charging at the bottom of these craters , ” said William Farrell from Goddard Space Flight Center , lead author of a new research on the Moon ’s environment .
The moon ’s orientation to the sun keeps the bottoms of polar craters in permanent shadow , allowing temperatures there to plunge below minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit , cold enough to store volatile material like water for billions of years .
And of course , any resources that may lie in those craters are of interest for any future explorers , should astronauts ever return to the Moon .
[ / caption ]
“ However , our research suggests that , in addition to the wicked cold , explorers and robots at the bottoms of polar lunar craters may have to contend with a complex electrical environment as well , which can affect surface chemistry , static discharge , and dust cling , ” said Farrell , who is part of a lunar Dream Team — the Lunar Science Institute ’s Dynamic Response of the Environment at the moon ( DREAM ) project , which is also part of NASA ’s Lunar Science Institute .
Solar wind inflow into craters can erode the surface , which affects recently discovered water molecules .
Static discharge could short out sensitive equipment , while the sticky and extremely abrasive lunar dust could wear out spacesuits and may be hazardous if tracked inside spacecraft and inhaled over long periods .
The solar wind is a thin gas of electrically charged components of atoms – negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions — that is constantly blowing from the surface of the sun into space .
Since the moon is only slightly tilted compared to the sun , the solar wind flows almost horizontally over the lunar surface at the poles and along the region where day transitions to night , called the terminator .
The researchers created computer simulations to discover what happens when the solar wind flows over the rims of polar craters .
They discovered that in some ways , the solar wind behaves like wind on Earth — flowing into deep polar valleys and crater floors .
Unlike wind on Earth , the dual electron - ion composition of the solar wind may create an unusual electric charge on the side of the mountain or crater wall ; that is , on the inside of the rim directly below the solar wind flow .
Since electrons are over 1,000 times lighter than ions , the lighter electrons in the solar wind rush into a lunar crater or valley ahead of the heavy ions , creating a negatively charged region inside the crater .
The ions eventually catch up , but rain into the crater at consistently lower concentrations than that of the electrons .
This imbalance in the crater makes the inside walls and floor acquire a negative electric charge .
The calculations reveal that the electron / ion separation effect is most extreme on a crater ’s leeward edge – along the inside crater wall and at the crater floor nearest the solar wind flow .
Along this inner edge , the heavy ions have the greatest difficulty getting to the surface .
Compared to the electrons , they act like a tractor - trailer struggling to follow a motorcycle ; they just ca n’t make as sharp a turn over the mountain top as the electrons .
“ The electrons build up an electron cloud on this leeward edge of the crater wall and floor , which can create an unusually large negative charge of a few hundred Volts relative to the dense solar wind flowing over the top , ” said Farrell .
The negative charge along this leeward edge wo n’t build up indefinitely .
Eventually , the attraction between the negatively charged region and positive ions in the solar wind will cause some other unusual electric current to flow .
The team believes one possible source for this current could be negatively charged dust that is repelled by the negatively charged surface , gets levitated and flows away from this highly charged region .
“ The Apollo astronauts in the orbiting Command Module saw faint rays on the lunar horizon during sunrise that might have been scattered light from electrically lofted dust , ” said Farrell .
“ Additionally , the Apollo 17 mission landed at a site similar to a crater environment – the Taurus - Littrow valley .
The Lunar Ejecta and Meteorite Experiment left by the Apollo 17 astronauts detected impacts from dust at terminator crossings where the solar wind is nearly - horizontal flowing , similar to the situation over polar craters . ”
“ This important work by Dr. Farrell and his team is further evidence that our view on the moon has changed dramatically in recent years , ” said Gregory Schmidt , deputy director of the NASA Lunar Science Institute at NASA ’s Ames Research Center , Moffett Field , Calif .
“ It has a dynamic and fascinating environment that we are only beginning to understand . ”
Next steps for the team include more complex computer models .
“ We want to develop a fully three - dimensional model to examine the effects of solar wind expansion around the edges of a mountain .
We now examine the vertical expansion , but we want to also know what happens horizontally , ” said Farrell .
As early as 2012 , NASA will launch the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer ( LADEE ) mission that will orbit the moon and could look for the dust flows predicted by the team ’s research .
The research was published March 24 in the Journal of Geophysical Research .

An occasional guide to the words and names in the news from Linda Shockey of the BBC Pronunciation Unit .
A volcano has errupted under a glacier in the Eyjafjallajokull area of Iceland , causing a cloud of volcanic ash to spread which in turn has led to British airports being shut down .

Today at Google I/O , Google officially announced the forthcoming release of an open source , royalty - free video format called WebM .
Using the VP8 codec that Google acquired from On2 last February , the format is backed by fellow browser makers Mozilla and Opera .
In April , rumors about the open sourcing of VP8 started to take off , but the implications of what VP8 — and now WebM — might mean has been somewhat clouded by the bigger battle between Apple and Adobe over HTML5 , Flash and the future of mobile platforms .
While WebM is not currently part of the HTML5 spec , it will be added as a supported part of the < video > tag for the Chrome , Firefox and Opera browsers .
In addition to announcing WebM , Google also told the audience that WebM support will be coming to YouTube as part of its HTML5 experiment .
All video that is in 720p or higher uploaded to YouTube from today onward will be encoded in WebM in addition to H.264 .
One issue that has been raised in the debate over HTML5 and Flash , in terms of web video , is the issue of what video codecs HTML5 supports .
Right now , HTML5 supports both H.264 and Xiph's Ogg Theora .
While free for end users and for users who upload video to the web , H.264 is not a royalty - free technology .
A consortium called the MPEG - LA , which includes Microsoft , Apple , Panasonic , Nokia , Sony and many other technology companies , oversees license requirements .
While in actual practice these licensing issues only impact people who are either creating an encoder or creating software to play back H.264 content , the issue has nonetheless been contentious , especially for companies like Mozilla and Opera who have ideological problems with using technology like H.264 .
Engadget 's Nilay Patel and I discussed these issues at length with Dan Benjamin a few weeks ago on his podcast , " The Conversation . "
With WebM , the royalty - free nature of the platform allows developers and software makers to use the technology without having to pay any licensing fees .
Unlike other royalty - free formats , VP8 has the potential to provide real competition against H.264 .
Adobe 's Kevin Lynch spoke at Google I/O and announced that Adobe plans to build VP8 support into Flash and that WebM can be used with Adobe products like Dreamweaver .
WebM is more than just video ; it also supports features like embedded and selectable text and web fonts .
In the coming weeks and months , we expect to see more encoders and player plugins built to support WebM .
The next step will be to see if hardware makers embrace WebM the same way they have embraced H.264 .
Accelerated video support for H.264 on a multitude of devices is one of the reasons that it has become the codec of choice for consumer video and a reason it has been so popular for video content creators .
Still , having alternatives is good .
It 's also important that open options be available on the web and that those options actually be compelling and usable .
We think that WebM is a great move from Google and it has certainly added a new dimension to the growing discussion about the future of web video .
The nightly builds of Chromium and Firefox now include WebM support .
Opera builds with WebM support are available at labs.opera.com .

C’est une première judiciaire en France , et les deux prévenus , sans doute heureusement pour eux , n’étaient pas vraiment à la hauteur .
Malik et Souhail , 19 et 20 ans , se dandinent gauchement devant le tribunal , trébuchent à chaque phrase , répondent à côté et à voix basse .
Malik , un lycéen à lunettes qui a poussé trop vite , a même eu la bonne idée d’enfiler un sweat - shirt à capuche pour cette comparution immédiate devant le tribunal de Versailles , qui appliquait pour la première fois , lundi 17 mai , les rigueurs de la toute nouvelle loi contre les bandes du 2 mars 2010 .
Les deux jeunes gens se sont fait pincer le 3 avril en gare de Houilles , dans les Yvelines , au milieu d’une soixantaine de copains , alors qu’ils étaient en route pour régler leur compte à une bande de Nanterre sur le parvis de la Défense .
Les deux jeunes le nient , et assurent ne pas se connaître .
Ils n’avaient en tous cas encore rien fait : c’est un délit préventif , une transposition pour les plus jeunes de l’association de malfaiteurs , qui a beaucoup servi en matière antiterroriste .
Ils sont jugés pour avoir « participé sciemment à un groupement , même formé de façon temporaire , en vue de la préparation , caractérisée par un ou plusieurs faits matériels , de violences volontaires contre les personnes ou de destructions ou dégradations de biens » , délit réprimé par l’article 222 - 14 - 2 du code pénal , et puni d’un an d’emprisonnement et de 15000 euros d’amende .
Quatre mineurs seront à leur tour présentés devant le juge des enfants .
La police avait été prévenue par la SNCF , samedi 3 avril , qu’une foule de jeunes de 14 à 20 ans venue de Conflans , Sartrouville , Poissy , Achères , confluait vers la Défense , pour venger des jeunes des Yvelines maltraités quelque temps auparavant par ceux de Nanterre .
Des contrôles ont été mis en place dans les gares dès 14 h 30 , alors que la SNCF assurait que les trains précédents transportaient déjà pas mal « de gens volubiles » .
En gare de Houilles - Carrières , le train a été franchement arrêté .
Une soixantaine de jeunes , selon les procès - verbaux de police , braillaient en réclamant le départ du train , insultaient les contrôleurs et les forces de l’ordre , et ont fini par sortir de la gare en cassant au passage des panneaux d’information .
Soixante policiers ont été appelés en renfort , et il y a eu un moment d’hésitation devant la gare quand une dizaine de gamins ont mis leur capuche et attrapé les pots de fleurs d’un malheureux fleuriste en criant , « 7 - 8 en force , on va vous casser ! »
Il ne s’est finalement rien passé , les jeune sont partis à pied vers Bezons .
Onze personnes ont été placées en garde - à- vue , les uns étaient équipés de béquilles bien que boitant assez peu , d’autres de couteaux , de tasers ( pistolets élctriques ) , de cutters et même d’un tire - bouchon .
Il y a eu effectivement une bagarre à La Défense , résorbée par la police qui a essuyé quelques jets de pierre .
Douze trains ont été détournés ce jour - là , l’un d’eux a été sévèrement dégradé .
La SNCF , qui s’est constituée partie civile , réclame 9680 ,22 euros à l’un des prévenus qui regarde paniqué son avocat .
Malik a été interpellé sur le quai de la gare de Houilles , avec un couteau caché dans sa chaussure .
Il a expliqué qu’il était là un peu par hasard .
« Par hasard ?
s’emporte la présidente .
Vous allez à la Défense , avec d’autres gens que vous connaissez , vous savez qu’il va y avoir une bagarre , vous avez un couteau , et vous dites que c’est par hasard ? »
Le jeune homme assure tant bien que mal que c’était un couteau - souvenir , puis reconnaît qu’il savait que ça allait chauffer à La Défense , « une meuf lui avait envoyé un texto ».
Mais il n’allait pas se battre , il allait regarder .
D’ailleurs , il va tous les samedis à la Défense .
Son avocat , Olivier Cabon , a mis un peu plus d’ordre dans sa défense .
« Cette loi sanctionne une intention , pas une tentative , c’est une loi qui ratisse large et s’appuie sur une responsabilité collective ».
Mais il faut définir les responsabilités individuelles .
«
Il n’a rien dégradé , il a été interpellé sur le quai , il n’a pas été violent , il ne s’est pas débattu , a expliqué son avocat .
Et c’est lui , spontanément , qui a dit qu’il avait un couteau dans sa chaussure .
Un couteau de 7 cm , madame la présidente ».
Me Cabon avait découpé un petit bout de papier de 7 cm , pour que le tribunal juge de l’arme fatale .
«
Sept centimètres , manche compris , un canif ridicule , un cadeau de son cousin , ce n’est pas une arme de dissuasion massive .
Quitte à aller se battre , il aurait pu prendre autre chose » .
Il allait voir la bagarre , « c’est malsain , reconnaît l’avocat , mais quand on regarde un match de boxe à la télé , je trouve ça un peu malsain aussi ».
Surtout , Me Cabon sort le procès - verbal d’un autre jeune , interpellé , lui , avec un couteau de cuisine de 19 cm , qu’il assure être allé acheter pour son papa avec deux paquets de biscuits .
Le père a assuré qu’il n’avait jamais réclamé de couteau , mais le jeune a été relâché , et on lui a restitué le couteau .
Mystère des procédures policières .
Souhail est lui soupçonné d’avoir été parmi la dizaine de jeunes encapuchonnés qui ont pris les pots de fleurs devant la gare .
Lui raconte qu’il allait voir un copain en gare de Houilles .
« Dix jeunes sont menaçants , on en interpelle cinq , reprend Me Cabon .
Rien , dans le procès - verbal n’indique qu’il en faisait partie , pas un détail vestimentaire .
On évoque quasiment pas la question de la Défense .
Qu’est -ce qu’il faisait à Houilles ?
On en sait rien .
Est -ce qu’il allait à la Défense ?
On en sait rien .
Le doute doit profiter au prévenu » .
Et l’avocat s’étonne que ces jeunes si menaçants aillent remettre gentiment en place les pots de fleurs s’ils étaient si menaçants .
Le procureur , Luc - André Lenormand , a été au plus court : le législateur a voté une loi qui palliait « un vide juridique » et permis l’interpellation préventive « d’une soixantaine d’énergumènes très virulents ».
Le tribunal selon lui « entrera forcément en voie de condamnation pour réprimer ce nouveau délit » , mais il a réclamé une peine modeste , trois mois d’emprisonnement avec sursis .
Jugement le 31 mai .
Le jugement
Les deux jeunes gens ont été condamnés lunid 31 mai à trois mois de prison avec sursis par le tribunal correctionnel de Versailles , assortis d'une amende de 600 euros chacun .
Ils risquaient au maximum un an d'emprisonnement et 15 000 euros d'amende .
La constitution de partie civile de la SNCF , qui réclamait 9 600 euros à l'un des prévenus , a été rejetée .
L'avocat des jeunes gens a estimé que la décision était " en demie - teinte " mais " mesurée " , tout en s'interrogeant sur le caractère exemplaire de la sanction .
" C'est quand même lourd car l'un des deux n'avait pas de casier judiciaire , a indiqué Me Olivier Cabon , et rien ne démontrait dans le dossier qu'ils avaient l'intention de commettre les faits pour lesquels ils étaient poursuivis " .

April 17 : Artist will modify crucifix WARR ACRES — Churchgoers are outraged over a crucifix in a Catholic church that they say shows an image of genitalia on Jesus .
The controversial crucifix has caused a deep divide among members of St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church , where it hangs above the main altar .
" There are a couple people who have left the parish , ” said the Rev. Philip Seeton , the church ’s pastor .
" There are people in the parish who do n’t like it and have stayed . ”
Critics of the crucifix take issue with what appears to be a large penis covering Jesus ’ abdominal area .
Seeton said the portion of the crucifix in question is meant to be Jesus ’ abdomen " showing distension ” — not a penis .
Seeton said , " I ’ve had people who have vocally said that that ’s what they see there .
I ’ve had people who have been just as vocal who said that ’s not what they ’re seeing there . ”
Janet Jaime , a local iconography artist who designed the crucifix , had no comment .
" I think it was painted according to the certain specific rules of iconography and church art , ” Seeton said of the crucifix .
The crucifix is about 10 feet tall .
It has been hanging above the altar since Feb. 21 .
Seeton said the crucifix does n’t concern him , and there are no plans to remove it .
Monsignor Edward Weisenburger of the Oklahoma City Archdiocese also said he has no problems with the crucifix .
He said the archdiocese has received no complaints about it .
However , numerous current and former church parishioners contacted The Oklahoman this week expressing outrage at what many called a " pornographic ” depiction of Jesus .
Many asked that their identities be withheld .
Parishioner Rita Cook said the crucifix is one of many recent decisions by Seeton , who has been at the church since 2008 , that longtime parishioners are concerned with .
" The crucifix is the straw on the camel ’s back , ” said Cook , who has attended the church for 35 years .
" I think it ’s an embarrassment to our Lord .
I think it ’s an embarrassment to our parishioners .
And I think it ’s an embarrassment to our visitors . ”
Molly Jenkins , who is not a member of the church , said she attended a funeral at the church recently and immediately noticed the crucifix .
" I was appalled at the sexualization of Christ , ” said Jenkins , who is not Catholic .
Jenkins said she contacted a Catholic friend to ask whether such crucifixes are common .
Her friend , Seannene Smith , said she visited the church Friday and also was disturbed .
" I was horrified , ” Smith said .
" I believe in freedom of expression .
I believe in artistic freedom .
I believe that a church is a holy place , and I certainly do n’t want people telling anyone how to worship , but I was shocked , stunned , and if I had n’t been prepared already , I think I would have just been ill . ”
Smith said she grew more concerned upon learning that students from the neighboring St. Charles Borromeo Catholic School regularly attend Mass in the church .
" I ’m already very sensitive because of the pedophilia issue , ” Smith said , referencing sexual abuse scandals that have plagued the Catholic Church in recent years .
Smith said she stopped going to church because of those scandals .
" This does n’t make it any better , ” Smith said .
Crucifix is a Catholic icon
Jaime , a local iconographer known for her religious artwork , was commissioned by the church to design the crucifix .
Seeton would n’t disclose whether Jaime was paid .
Jaime ’s husband , Reggie , said his wife will not discuss the crucifix publicly until she meets with officials from the church and Oklahoma City Archdiocese to discuss the controversy it has caused .
Reggie Jaime said critics of the crucifix probably are n’t aware of its history and meaning to the Catholic Church .
" This is n’t just a subjective drawing .
This is a historical icon of the church , ” Reggie Jaime said .
" I ca n’t help what you see in things , or she sees in things , or anyone . ”
The crucifix in question is a San Damiano cross , a common Catholic icon that originated in Italy in the 12th century and is widely associated with St. Francis of Assisi and the order he founded , the Franciscans .
The original cross is in Assisi , Italy .
The San Damiano cross is considered an icon because it depicts biblical figures .
The crucifix hanging at St. Charles Borromeo resembles other San Damiano crucifixes except for Jesus ’ abdominal area , which is noticeably more pronounced than on similar crucifixes .
Seeton said he and Janet Jaime reviewed numerous San Damiano crucifixes to decide how the crucifix should look .
Several parishioners have since come to Seeton with complaints about how the crucifix looks .
Seeton said he tries to alleviate their concerns by explaining the history of the crucifix and pointing them to places where they can learn more about it .
He said most parishioners are OK with the crucifix once they learn its history .

The median home price of a home sold in the U.S. is now down to $ 165,000 sending us back to nominal levels not seen since 2002 .
While the stock market is up 70 + percent in one year , housing as the store of most of American ’s net worth is still limping along at the bottom .
No bounce in this asset class .
This of course should not be a surprise given the magnitude of this housing bubble , something not seen since Florida in the 1920s .
Only difference this time is that it went national .
During the Great Depression roughly 40 percent of Americans were considered home owners .
Those that owned actually had to come in with more funds and ironically , they did better that time around with homes maintaining 70 percent of their value while stocks fell 89 percent .
California as a state has surpassed that mark with real estate values down nearly 50 percent from their peak values .
More Americans this time around are also home owners which spreads the pain around .
Let us look at what is going on at a national level , and then drill down here in Southern California :
Source : Bloomberg
It is interesting to see the bump from HAMP and also the tax credit .
That was short lived of course since the employment situation has n’t really improved much in that time .
Most of the jobs added last month were low paying positions .
As the chart above clearly shows , we are now back to the low point again .
People simply cannot afford to pay higher prices for homes as their wages cut back .
Yet the $ 165,000 median price is starting to make sense in many states across the country .
However here in California some areas are blissfully in a state of peyote induced delusion .
They are still in bubbles and will soon pop .
Culver City is one of those markets .
Today we salute you Culver City with our Real Homes of Genius Award .
Culver City – $ 779,000 or $ 200,000 across the Street
The above home is in a nice part of Culver City .
This is n’t a distressed sale .
The price tag will reflect that .
This home is a 2 bedrooms and 1 bath home listed at 1,012 square feet .
It was built in 1922 during the Roaring Twenties .
It has been listed on the MLS for 2 days .
The current list price ?
$ 779,000 .
The bubble mentality is back in force .
I tried finding sales history on this home but did n’t see anything listed which seems odd .
So I decided to look right across the street :
The home right across has the following details :
2 bedrooms
1 bath
1,078 square feet
Built in 1938
Seems like a reasonable home to use for comparison .
Now this home is not for sale in Culver City but it did have some sales history .
Fortunately for us the sale took place right at the birth of the California housing bubble :
Sales History
Sold 01/28/2000 : $ 200,000
So my question to you astute reader is this , did the house that is currently selling for $ 779,000 really appreciate some $ 579,000 from 2000 to 2010 in what is arguably the worst economy for California in the last century ?
Or in other words , the home went up in value on average $ 57,900 per year for ten consecutive years ( the median household income for California each year simply for being in Culver City ) .
When you look at things like this , you know full well these cities are still in massive bubbles .
Income in the area certainly did not go up to this level and unless we have some gold plated toilets in the home , this current price is in a bubble .
But let us assume you are a working couple with a household income of $ 120,000 .
This is higher than the mean household income for the city .
Source : Census
So how many people can afford this home ?
Let us run the numbers first .
Thanks to the geniuses in our government and their corrupt henchmen in Wall Street they have decided that even though the nationwide median price is $ 165,000 that FHA insured loans should go up to $ 729,750 in some areas .
This nonsense that home buyers are putting down big down payments is baloney .
In Southern California last month nearly 40 percent of all homes were bought with FHA insured loans .
The CAR had data showing that the vast majority went with the minimum 3.5 percent down payment just like option ARM borrowers make their minimum payment .
The all cash buyers were buying properties up in the Inland Empire and other depressed markets .
So let us run the numbers now :
The above is assuming we are putting down $ 49,250 .
The required salary to purchase this 2 bedrooms home is over $ 200,000 and only 6 percent of current Culver City residents even fall within that category .
That working couple making $ 120,000 has no way of buying this place at the current price .
This is their monthly take home :
The mortgage payment is nearly $ 5,200 per month yet they bring in $ 6,900 .
In other words , the housing payment eats up 75 % of their net pay .
This wo n’t even fly .
Yet I somehow find it hard to believe that someone making $ 200,000 or more wanting to buy this place in Culver City .
So what will happen ?
One option is suddenly wages fly through the roof and everyone is a six figure household .
That does n’t seem likely given our massive state budget fiasco and the fact that new jobs are lower paying with fewer benefits .
The other option is prices come down and come down by a lot .
For some of these areas that is the next road ahead .
And if you do n’t think this is true you are mistaken .
The MLS has 113 homes listed for Culver City .
But when we pull up the shadow inventory we find 187 homes listed :
Oh and how the problems run deep .
Now how can a supposedly prime area have so many problems ?
And many are scheduled auctions and the bid is far from the estimated value which is inflated :
In other words , prices will go lower .
But you probably already figured that out if you read this far .
Today we salute you Culver City with our Real Homes of Genius Award .

CCTV footage shows him " leap " into action and confront the would - be shoplifter who had slipped a AU$ 160 ( £ 97 ) X - Men book into his bag .
Mr Baulderstone said customers at the shop in Adelaide thought it was a stunt until he asked them to call the police .
" We had about 40 people dressed up as their favourite superheroes to celebrate International Free Comic Day , so he [ the thief ] did n't have much of a choice but to hand the X - Men Omnibus back after a little bit of a scuffle , " Mr Baulderstone told the Adelaide Advertiser .
Mr Baulderstone says he can look back and laugh now He said a group of Jedi knights blocked the door to prevent the thief from escaping , as The Flash looked on .
" I 've had a look at the security footage and it shows Spiderman running down the corridor of the shop , grabbing this guy , hauling him off , " said the 45 - year - old .

The current situation in Iran is both a result of and response to a complex combination of socio-political repression and economic corruption .
But it is expressed through a range of different discourses – nationalist and leftist , to be sure – but most significantly by different Islamic discourses that read the uprising as a struggle between an Islam of power , represented by Iran 's ruling regime , and an Islam of freedom , represented by many Muslim thinkers who oppose it .
This tension has theological and philosophical roots that can be traced back centuries , particularly through debates over the meaning of tawhid .
The interpretation of this theological concept is a critical distinction between the systems of " power - based " and " freedom - based " Islam .
In power - based Islam , tawhid signifies a monotheistic belief in which God is regarded as an omnipotent being who cultivates a master - slave relationship with believers .
Fear is the defining characteristic of this belief , which links the most powerful to the most powerless in a relationship of obedience .
People have no " rights " in this system ; all that exists is their " duty " .
In this version of tawhid , believers are thus understood to be duty - oriented beings who can touch the gates of heaven only by obeying religious authorities , the only ones deemed capable of deciphering God 's word , and by fulfilling duties as defined by these authorities .
In Iran , this school of thought , in its most radical form , is represented by Ayatollah Misbah Yazdi , who is the ideological power behind Ahmadinejad 's government .
In his most recent book , War and Jihad in the Qur'an , he defines human beings in Hobbesian terms as creatures who are by nature violent and ruthless .
In his view , such violence is endorsed by a God who was himself caught between two inevitable forces : his intrinsic creativity , on the one hand , and the creation of nature , including its evil creatures , on the other .
According to Yazdi , God was aware of the destructive tendencies in people but had no option but to create them .
His brutal creation then had to be controlled in order for life to continue , which is why Yazdi developed the doctrine of harekate qasri , which asserts that force and violence must be used to bring people onto the right path .
This doctrine dovetails with Khamenei 's strategy of imposing submission through fear , the method now being employed openly and systematically to crush the green movement .
This discourse has been challenged by many other Muslim thinkers , however , including Mehdi Bazargan ( who was prime minister in 1979 ) , Mohammed Shabestari , Abdol Karim Soroush , and Grand Ayatollah Montazeri in the last years of his life .
The most systematic challenge has come from Abol - hassan Banisadr ( Iranian president , 1980 - 81 ) .
According to Banisadr , the original meaning of the term has been replaced by its opposite through a series of historical , theological and philosophical processes .
In numerous works , but particularly Free Intellect , he defines tawhid as the absence of all power in the relationship between God and humans , people with each other and people with the environment .
He argues that this meaning of the concept is clearly discernable in the Qur'an , which explicitly states that God has given his guidance to all people irrespective of their status as believers or non-believers .
According to this model , tawhid is not about developing a master - slave relationship with God but rather being liberated through a relationship with God .
Tawhid liberates from relationships that limit and confine .
The concept thus provides people with a guiding principle that is compatible with their independence and freedom .
It is not difficult to see how important this is for the creation of a democratic and participatory political culture , and a state organised to provide the conditions for the exercise of individual and social freedoms , and thus for social justice .
In contemporary Iran , particularly in the opposition movement , we are observing a struggle to establish this possibility through the expression of a freedom - based interpretation of Islam , against a power - based interpretation which justifies the control of state and society through force .
This struggle is not a new phenomenon .
The freedom - based model has emerged in the past , also in response to the brutality and corruption of a religion put into the service of a state .
It developed in a less elaborate form during the 1979 revolution ; then , Khomeini was left with no option but to identify with it in order to maintain his political position .
It was also present in the first draft of the Iranian constitution .
Soon after the revolution , however , Khomeini moved away from this rhetorical commitment .
Indeed , 30 months later , under the pretence of legality , he orchestrated a coup against the country 's democratically - elected president who was demanding that Khomeini observe his commitments .
But during this short period , the genie was released from the bottle ; the power - based discourse came to dominate .
Since that time , the principles of freedom that initially inspired the 1979 revolution have remained sources of inspiration for many of the thinkers that now comprise the intellectual foundation of the Green movement .
This movement can thus be understood as the popularisation of an interpretation of Islam that fuelled the unfinished 1979 revolution and that is now seriously , if not yet successfully , challenging Islamic authoritarianism .
If it does succeed , however , it could pave the way for the growth for a movement of liberation in Islamic countries and among Muslim communities in the west .

WASHINGTON , April 27 ( Reuters ) -
An alternative U.S. financial regulatory reform package crafted by Senate Republicans seeks to draw a brighter line between monetary and fiscal policy , according to a document obtained by Reuters on Tuesday .
In its battle against the financial crisis , the U.S. Federal Reserve used its emergency lending powers to support the housing market and markets for student loans and credit card loans , among others .
A number of top Fed officials , most vocally Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser , have expressed discomfort with allocating credit to specific sectors of the economy , which they see as veering into fiscal policy in a way that could threaten the central bank ’s independence .
Senate Republicans blocked a sweeping overhaul of banking rules for a second straight day on Tuesday as they sought to extract more concessions from Democrats eager to crack down on Wall Street .
In a section of their reform proposals titled “ End Credit Channeling by the Fed , ” Republicans would require the U.S. central bank and Treasury Department to delineate where and when emergency lending would amount to credit channeling .
“ This is to address concerns growing out of the recent financial crisis that the Fed chose winners and losers through the choices it made regarding the allocation of credit , ” the document said .
The proposals would also require the Fed and Treasury to establish provisions to remove from the Fed ’s balance sheet assets the central bank took on during its financial fire - fighting that “ are more properly regarded as fiscal policy actions . ”
The Republican proposal said the Fed should only act as a lender of last resort to solvent firms against good collateral during short - term liquidity crises .
It would tighten current collateral requirements for emergency loans , with detailed requirements on asset quality .
The Fed and Treasury would have to disclose loan recipients and collateral , and any emergency lending would require a sign off from the Treasury secretary and the majority of the Fed ’s Washington - based Board of Governors .
Like Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd ’s bill , the Republicans would require the president of the New York Fed to become a political appointee .
He is currently picked by the bank ’s board of directors subject to approval by the Fed ’s Board of Governors in Washington .
Known for his large - scale photographs of dilapidated buildings in places like Cuba , Russia , and Times Square , Andrew Moore has now turned his attention to Detroit .
These images are from his new collection , Detroit Disassembled , published by Damiani and the Akron Art Museum , where an exhibition of his work will be on view from June 5 to October 10 .
Moore ’s photographs present a devastating scene of urban deterioration , offering us glimpses into abandoned motor plants , train stations , theaters , schools , hotels , police stations , and office buildings , along with vistas of vacant houses and lots .
All of the buildings are in deep states of decay : moss grows on the floor of an office at the former Ford Motor Company headquarters ; thousands of books molder in the Public Schools Book Depository ; an unseen person keeps a small fire going under a plastic shelter inside the trash - filled engine works room of the Dry Dock Company Complex .
One of Moore ’s photographs , showing an abandoned nursing home , appears in the April 29 issue of The New York Review , in Tony Judt ’s essay “ Ill Fares the Land . ”
Another book on the same subject , The Ruins of Detroit , by the French photographers Yves Marchand and Romain Meffre , will be published by Steidl this summer .
Marchand and Meffre had already begun their project when they met Moore , whose earlier work they knew , and they urged him to photograph Detroit as well .
As a result , there are now two distinctive takes on the decline of a once - powerful center of the US economy : while Moore ’s book is slender , with an essay by the poet Philip Levine , Marchand and Meffre ’s collection puts across a broader sociological analysis .
Both books allow an astonishing amount of beauty to surface , whether in the fading traces of ornate architectural elements or in the rich colors of freshly sprouted vegetation .

As a Californian with family in the Midwest , my Instagram feed has become a slideshow of two jarringly different pandemic experiences .
I see acquaintances in Kansas having large parties , no masks in sight , literally popping bottles of champagne indoors .
An old friend having a big wedding in Wisconsin , and a gender reveal party in Illinois , too , were both mask - free affairs .
This observation of the digital world transcends into the real one : a close friend who just returned from Iowa said it looked like the pandemic " never happened . "
The culture around the pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area , where I live , is much different .
In many ways , life still feels like it did in March , when the region first descended into a shelter - in - place status .
I do n't know anyone here in California who 's hosted or attended a gathering with more than 10 people without observing the recommended mitigation strategies like wearing a mask , being outside and social distancing .
Salons , gyms and hotels are just starting to open .
Indeed , the difference between the Midwest and California is a bit confusing , particularly as cases rise in the Midwest .
According to the Covid Tracking Project , the Midwest is currently experiencing a coronavirus surge .
And while there 's a mix of reasons behind this new surge — including the ( possibly premature ) reopening of some cities , universities and schools , and big gatherings like the the Sturgis motorcycle rally — there is a strong link between the low likelihood of public mask - wearing and the places where cases are rising , as The New York Times has reported .
Indeed , the Midwest seems to struggle uniquely with mask - wearing , as the Times county - level data reveals .
Given what we know about the success of mitigation strategies like donning a mask , it may seem peculiar for states like Iowa to suddenly surge in cases .
That suggests that the midwestern surge originates not because of lack of public health knowledge , but because of cultural reasons , or because of the politicized nature of masks , or both — something that is borne out by locals ' observations .
Take Polk County , Iowa , for example .
Over the summer , the state of Iowa emerged as a coronavirus hotspot .
Nola Aigner Davis , Public Health Communications Officer of the Polk County Health Department in Iowa , told Salon Polk County remains one of the top 10 hotspots in the United States .
Davis emphasized that it 's been difficult to get the coronavirus under control in part due to the lack of people wearing masks and social distancing .
" There are people who are still skeptical about this disease and [ how ] dangerous and deadly it can be .
. . . or it 's just people who this is n't something they 're accustomed to , like wearing a mask or social distancing , " Davis said .
" Well , we see every day that people are hospitalized and people are dying from this disease . "
Davis said she 's concerned about her constituent having " COVID - 19 fatigue , " a neologism that describes the condition in which the constant stress of the pandemic eventually leads to complacency , and the inability to make good decisions .
Davis said COVID - 19 fatigue reveals itself when , for instance , people who are awaiting coronavirus test results do n't stay home until they 've discovered whether or not their are positive .
" This is something that no one thought would last this long , " Davis added .
" We would not be wearing masks this long , we would not be social distancing this long ; I think when you develop a new way of life that people are not accustomed to , and you want your old life back , it 's just very tiresome . "
Brady Kirkpatrick , who lives in Omaha , Nebraska , said the state has been " mostly lax " about the pandemic since the beginning .
In Omaha , where coronavirus cases were rising in the summer , the city council passed a mask mandate .
However , Kirkpatrick said that in his experience , " most businesses only require you to wear your mask upon entry . "
" At the gym , about half the members wear masks while working out , " Kirkpatrick said .
" It seems that most people are n't very concerned about it since the cases here are fairly low , and the city is pretty spaced out . "
Omaha is seeing lower cases after the mask mandate , even if not everyone is taking it seriously as Kirkpatrick says .
However , according to AP News , the state 's seven - day rolling average for positivity rate is rising .
" Overall , many people here are sick of COVID and the rules that have been enforced , " Kirkpatrick said .
The state of Wisconsin is currently in a state of emergency , as hospitals in the northeast part of the state are near capacity and local resources remain strained .
In Dane County , where the University of Wisconsin–Madison ( UW ) is located , the county experienced its first significant surge in September since the pandemic began , according to Dane County Executive Joe Parisi , which it 's still battling .
The University started in - person classes , but paused them one week later because of a coronavirus outbreak .
However , the county 's health officials say in - person classes were n't the only reason behind the surge .
" The number of cases associated with UW is a concern , but plenty of virus is spreading elsewhere in the community too , " Janel Heinrich , Director of Public Health Madison & Dane County , said in a statement .
In Louisville , Kentucky , Lori Cheek told Salon over email that it's hard to " comprehend " how " most of the people are dealing with this pandemic at this point . "
Wearing a mask is not the norm where she lives , Cheek says .
" I 'm scared to go inside the public areas in my own apartment building , " Cheek said .
" I only take the elevator to and from my 6th floor apartment when I 'm taking my bike in and out of the building , and every time the door opens , there 's someone trying to get in the elevator with me without a mask . "
According to a Gallup poll published in mid-July , forty - four percent of U.S. adults say they " always " wear a mask when outside their homes , and 28 percent say they do so " very often . "
Interestingly , a majority of those who wear masks are either women or Democrats .
The poll found that 61 percent of Democrats polled said they always wear a mask .
Among Republicans , a majority of them said they wear masks infrequently .
A Pew Research Center study found a similar partisan divide .
Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend cloth masks for the general public .
Health experts strongly agree that the evidence is clear that masks can help prevent the spread of COVID - 19 .
Yet the act of wearing a mask has become politicized in part due to President Trump 's rhetoric and resistance around it .
In Wisconsin , where there 's currently a statewide mask mandate , a conservative law firm is asking a state court to block the enforcement — despite the state 's health department 's recommendations to wear them and avoid large gatherings .
" It is a proven method to prevent the spread of COVID - 19 , " Jennifer Miller , a spokesperson at the Wisconsin Department of Health Services , told Salon in an email .
" That said , masks and / or face coverings do not take the place of social and physical distancing , so we also encourage people to stay home as much as possible , maintain at least six feet of separation between themselves and others when they must go out , avoid large gatherings , and follow simple health hygiene habits like washing their hands frequently and thoroughly and covering coughs and sneezes . "
According to the World Health Organization , there have been 33,249,563 confirmed cases of COVID - 19 around the world and over one million deaths .
The United States accounts for more than 20 percent of the global death toll .
Indeed , many are wondering how the United States will ever overcome this pandemic , especially as states in the Midwest enter the autumn and winter seasons .
" If we do n't practice these mitigation strategies , we 're never going to see this virus go away , " Davis from the Polk County Health Department in Iowa said .
Texas governor ‘ proud ’ to be in Glenn Beck ’s ‘ army ’
It seems conservative firebrands are seeing God ’s punishment everywhere these days .
First there was televangelist Pat Robertson who in January told his audience that the Haitian earthquake was punishment for Haiti ’s founders having signed a “ pact with the devil . ”

Then came radio host Rush Limbaugh , who last week suggested that the Iceland volcano was “ God ’s punishment ” for the US passing health care reform .
Now a Texas state representative has taken the notion a step further , declaring that an elected official — rather than a natural disaster — is a sign of God ’s displeasure .
“ I believe that Barack Obama is God ’s punishment on us today , ” Rep. Leo Berman of Texas ’ 6th district told the audience at a Glenn Beck appearance in Tyler , Texas .
Berman added , “ But in 2012 , we are going to make Obama a one - term president . ”
Berman , whose comments were first reported on by the Tyler Morning Telegraph , appeared alongside a number of other prominent Texas conservatives at the Oil Palace arena on Saturday night , including Texas Governor Rick Perry .
Perry “ described Beck as a national leader of a powerful group sending a message to the current administration and Congress about Washington , DC , how to control spending and Americans taking their country back , ” the Morning Telegraph reported .

“ I consider myself proud to be in that army , ” Perry said .
Rep. Berman has built a track record of controversial comments .
Last year , activists launched a now - defunct Web site , CensureLeo.com , after Berman told a Chinese - American lawyer to “ kiss his ass ” and “ go home , ” presumably to China .
In 2007 , Berman delivered what one blogger called a “ hate - filled speech ” in which he claimed that “ illegal immigrants were bringing Polio , the plague , leprosy , tuberculosis , malaria , Chagas Disease and Dengue Fever to the United States in alarming numbers , ” the Capitol Annex reported .

However , it provides important background to the events .
This article first appeared at Danielle Sabai's Asian Left Observer . ]
May 17 , 2010 --
The political crisis engulfing Thailand is not a clap of thunder in an otherwise calm sky .
The discourse about a country where “ everyone lives in harmony and where there is no class struggle but a people united behind its adored sovereign ” has nothing to do with reality .
For several decades , the Thai people have been subjected to authoritarian regimes or dictatorships and a king in their service .
The Thai élites have however not succeeded in preventing regular uprisings against the established order , including those in 1973 , 1976 and 1992 , all repressed by bloodbaths .
Since 2005 , Thailand has faced a new and deep political crisis , longer than the previous ones , and whose outcome cannot be , as in the past , the stifling of the aspirations of the Thai people .
The economic boom of the period from 1986 - 1996 has brought about irreversible changes in society , notably the formation of a working class of around 7 million and structural political reforms .
Unlike in previous crises , ordinary
Thais – peasants , urban workers and the middle classes of Bangkok , the less well - off – have become conscious of their political weight and begun to make demands .
The 1990s : Eruption of civil society
The roots of the current conflict are anchored in the depths of Thai society .
The economic and political upheavals of the 1990s upset a balance which dated from the 1930s and had been established with the end of the absolute monarchy .
After the military coup of 1991 and the repression of 1992 , civil society entered what had previously been a very restricted political field .
Following a process lasting several years and a public consultation , a 16th constitution , called the “ constitution of the people ” , was adopted in 1997 .
For the first time in the history of Thailand , the two chambers were elected by universal suffrage .
The executive and legislature were separated .
The constitution contained safeguards to combat corruption and defend human rights .
If it allowed real democratic advances , it nonetheless had numerous limitations .
It was necessary to hold a university degree to be a member of parliament .
A sign of the contempt the élites have towards the people and a good way of maintaining privileges .
The party list system was criticised by the smaller political formations which found it difficult to elect MPs .
The electoral procedures set up tended to strengthen the two party system so as to ensure political stability : between 1995 and 1997 , Thailand had four governments !
For the same reasons , the role of the prime minister was strengthened .
This was used by Thaksin to strengthen his own power when he was prime minister .
The repression of 1992 led to a reflection on the need for transparency in politics and on the role and place of the military inside society .
For many years , the army would be confined to barracks .
But in reality it never renounced the exercise of power and the civilian governments never challenged its privileges .
The army remained a powerful financial and political institution which exercised its power behind the scenes .
The first half of the 1990s also saw strong economic growth and an acceleration of industrialisation .
Hundreds of thousands of rural youth , in particular women , left to work in manufacturing and services in and around Bangkok .
Wages were low and living conditions difficult but it was still preferable to working the land , which was not very fertile in the case of Isaan .
Work in Bangkok did not simply offer a possibility of earning money and helping parents and children left behind in the village .
This migration of young people to the capital is indicative of the transformations underway in Thai society : it offered them the possibility of being “ Thansamai ” , access to a different , “ modern ” , lifestyle , of freeing themselves from “ traditions ” which were seen as backward and onerous [ 1 ] .
As is the case everywhere else , Thaïs aspire to the same standard of living that they see on television and they would like to enjoy the fruits of growth .
The economic boom ended suddenly with the outbreak of the great financial crisis of 1997 which hit Thailand first before spreading to a series of Asian countries .
Many companies went bankrupt .
Those linked to services protected by the state came out best .
This was true of the enterprises owned by Thaksin Shinawatra , a billionaire who had made his fortune in telecommunications through licences and concessions which he had obtained from different governments and the military in the 1990s [ 2 ] .
The political and economic stability caused by the crisis strengthened him in the idea of launching a political career .
The political withdrawal of the army had opened up a political space .
In the business milieu , the idea spread that the army was no longer able to manage public affairs in an increasingly complex and globalised world .
In 1998 , Thaksin founded his own party , the Thai Rak Thai ( TRT -- Thaïs Love Thaïs ) with some of the vast wealth that he had emerged from the crisis with .
In 2001 , he was elected on the basis of a political programme which attempted to respond to a variety of sometimes contradictory social demands .
Once elected , he implemented a “ pro-poor ” policy which considerably improved the lives of millions of ordinary people .
Thaksin created a health system which was virtually free of charge ( less than a euro for a medical consultation ) , helped indebted peasants through a debt moratorium of several years ’ length , and set up a micro credit system to favour development projects in the villages .
It should not however be forgotten that he is a millionaire businessman whose policies serve his own interests first .
Corruption , authoritarianism and nepotism prospered while he was prime minister .
Nonetheless , for the first time a Thai politician had taken an interest in the fate of millions of his citizens .
His policies clearly followed a classic populist tradition : satisfying the demands of the peasants and workers in order to provide himself with an electoral base and the stability necessary for business to prosper .
Meanwhile , muzzling the workers ’ movement by maintaining laws restraining trade union activity and an electoral system which , by obliging urban workers to vote in their rural region of origin , blocked the emergence of left wing parties .
The war on drugs , waged early in his first term , led to thousands of deaths and arbitrary arrests .
Thaksin also resumed the war against the Malay minority in the deep south of Thailand .
Despite this state violence , which Thaksin had demagogically used to strengthen his legitimacy , the social aspects of his policies made him immensely popular .
This made him the sole Thai politician to win a consecutive second term .
He was triumphantly re-elected in 2005 .
The germs of a new political crisis
The bases of a new political crisis were now in place .
When Thaksin came to power , Thailand had been led for nearly 70 years by an élite which held money and power : the army , the higher bureaucracy , the monarchy and some big industrial families .
They shared a deep contempt for the people who they saw as uncultured and not suited for democracy .
More than twenty coups since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932 attest to it .
They are all in favour of democracy , but a “ Thai version ” of democracy that would allegedly be “ better adapted ” to Thai history , values and culture [ 3 ] .
In opposition to Western values , “ Asian values ” were supposed to stress the primacy of the group over the individual , respect for others , a sense of community , frugality , education , acceptance of hierarchy [ 4 ] .
In fact , all this served as ideological justification for a very inegalitarian system and deeply anti-democratic laws allowing a few among the privileged to enrich themselves and remain in power .
The citizens took no part in the decisions of those who governed while the latter were not motivated to account for their actions .
The feeling of belonging to the nation was inculcated in people asked to subordinate their own interests to those of the county .
At the heart of this ideological construction , the king played a central place .
As “ father ” of the nation that he incarnates , he regularly visits his “ children ” to listen to their problems , which he reinterprets “ properly ” .
The monarchy is at the centre of ( very ) many charitable works and development projects in the countryside .
The “ self sufficiency economy ” , the economic “ theory ” elaborated recently by the king illustrates the paternalist mechanisms and maintenance of social hierarchies very well . .
“ Sufficiency has three key principles : moderation ; wisdom or insight ; and the need for built - in resilience against the risks which arise from internal or external change ” [ 5 ] .
The message is clear : the peasants and the poor are asked to make do with what they have .
If the poor are poor , it is because they have not implemented solutions adapted to the resources at their disposal .
Emergency laws like the ISA ( Internal Security Act ) and the crime of lèse - majesté help smother any opposition .
The political game is completely emptied of content .
Political links are above all business and clientelist relations : large scale vote buying and collusion between business and politics .
In the 1990s , more than half of MPs originated from the world of business [ 6 ] .
The different political parties do not represent any alternative but are set up to participate in government coalitions where they hope to benefit from opportunities to do business .
A sort of return on investment – establishing an electoral base costs a lot of money .
On the other hand , the improvement in living conditions brought about by the economic boom of the 1986 - 96 period decreased social tensions and demands .
With the crisis of 1997 , things changed .
Hundreds of thousands of factory workers in the Bangkok area were dismissed and many returned to the countryside without payment .
The idea developed by Asia ’s ruling élites ( in particular Mahathir in Malaysia and Lee Kwan Yew in Singapore ) that economic growth should come before democracy was seriously shaken .
The Thaksin years made people conscious that the electoral game could also benefit the less well of .
It was possible to implement redistributive and more egalitarian economic policies .
Thaksin benefited fully from the system .
During his first term , he favoured “ friendly ” companies and placed “ loyalists ” at the head of the army .
The traditional establishment felt threatened : the financial opportunities , the juiciest contracts were escaping them .
The king ’s privy council lost control over army promotions , the main lever of maintenance of the order .
The Democrat Party , the main opposition party allied to the establishment , was not in a position to compete with the TRT at the electoral level .
It had not won an election for nearly 10 years .
The king himself felt threatened .
Thaksin ’s popularity competed directly with his own .
The traditional order was challenged .
The countryside elects governments , Bangkok overthrows them
The establishment sought by every means to free itself of Thaksin .
An opportunity came in January 2006 , when he decided to sell his company Shin Corp to Temasek , a company owned by the state of Singapore .
Royalist forces organised around Sondhi Limtongkul launched a nationalist campaign for the resignation of the prime minister and succeeded in linking together the numerous struggles of the time against the privatisation of the public electricity company EGAT , against the free trade agreements with the USA , against decentralisation in education and so on .
However , despite numerous demonstrations against him and a public intervention by the king , Thaksin triumphed again in the elections of April 2006 .
It was too much .
The army took the military option , undoubtedly with the approval of the “ palace ” . [ 7 ]
On September 19 , 2006 , while Thaksin was abroad at the UN , a new military coup was organised , this time without any bloodshed .
The objectives advanced were the fight against corruption and the necessity of restoring the “ unity of the country ” which had been disrupted by several months of uninterrupted demonstrations .
The establishment , the royalist forces but also a great part of the intelligentsia and middle classes celebrated the overthrow of the “ corrupt ” Thaksin .
In the year following the coup , everything was done to destroy Thaksin ’s instruments of power : the Thai Rak Thai ( TRT ) was dissolved , 111 MPs from the party were deemed ineligible for the five years to come .
Part of Thaksin ’s assets were frozen ( nearly 2 billion dollars ) .
A new constitution was written under military diktat .
However , despite the maintenance of martial law in Thaksin ’s bastions in the north and north - east , the military could not prevent a victory for the People ’s Power Party ( PPP ) , heirs of the TRT , at the election of December 23 , 2007 .
The victory of the forces allied to Thaksin revived the crisis .
Very quickly the new government of Samak Sundaravej envisaged amending the new constitution to forestall a new dissolution by the judiciary which had been considerably strengthened by the new constitution , with the power notably to dissolve a party if one of its members was found guilty of a crime .
From May 2008 to December of the same year , the People ’s Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) waged an unrelenting struggle to force Prime Minister Samak to resign .
The Yellow Shirts [ 8 ] are in no way the progressive force their name would imply .
The movement is led by Sonthi Limtongkul , a press magnate and former business partner of Thaksin , ruined by the 1997 crisis .
He linked up with a whole range of disaffected elements : royalists who felt threatened politically and economically by Thaksin ’s business clique ; military men who did not accept seeing their grip on society reduced since 1992 ; members of the Democrat Party , the traditional ally of the royalty and army and rejected by the business periphery ; judges from the various high courts ; intellectuals and members of the middle class tired of corruption and scandals ; monks belonging to reactionary Buddhist sects .
All supported the military coup .
Among the main leaders were Chamlong Srimuang , Phanlop Phinmanee and Prasong Soonsiri , three of the main veterans of the war against the Communist insurrection of the 1970s and 1980s .
All were horrified by the people who they deemed to ignorant to be able to vote and participate in political affairs .
They are opposed to democracy and mobilised so that the new constitution would put in place an elitist system under which only 30 % of the seats in parliament would be directly elected by a popular vote .
They consider Samak ’s government , elected democratically by the majority , as illegitimate .
On several occasion , the Yellow Shirts received the explicit support of the very reactionary queen Sirikit .
From May 2008 , supported by the Democrat Party and Abhisit , the Yellow Shirts remobilised .
For several weeks they occupied the office of the prime minister .
In September , Samak ’s government was dissolved by a judicial decree .
Samak , something of a gourmet , was sentenced for having received payment for his participation in televised cookery shows !
In response , a new government was formed around Somchai Wongsawat , brother in law of Thaksin .
The struggle culminated with the siege of Bangkok ’s two airports in late November 2008 [ 9 ] , stranding thousands of passengers for a week and undermining a Thai economy already disturbed by the world economic crisis .
On December 2 , 2008 , the PPP was dissolved by the constitutional court for electoral fraud .
On December 15 , following a reversal of alliance organised by the army inside parliament , Abhisit Vejjajiva was elected 27th prime minister by the deputies .
A military coup and two judicial decrees have overthrown three governments whose democratic legitimacy was not in doubt .
For most
Thais , it appeared increasingly clear that the democratic game was rigged and that the judges were in the service of the rich .
To this day , the leaders of the PAD who blockaded the two Bangkok airports have never been brought to court .
The countryside elects governments and the élites of Bangkok overthrow them if they do not like them !
This reality shows also how spatial and class differentiations pan out in Thailand .
The élites and the rich live in Bangkok , the poor originate from the provinces .
In Bangkok , peasants are referred to using the very contemptuous term “ baan nok ” ( “ outside house ” ) .
To live in the countryside is to be backward , uneducated , uncivilised and naïve .
Who are the Red Shirts ?
Faced with the situation opened by the putting in place of the Abhisit government , in early 2009 the “ United Front for Democracy and against Dictatorship ” ( UDD ) , the Red Shirt movement , was set up .
This political and social movement was set up originally by the unification of Thaksin ’s defenders and the pro-democracy forces that had emerged after the coup .
The alliance mobilised a popular base mainly made up of peasants , villagers and urban workers , in particular in the north and north - east of the country , fed up with the double language of the judiciary , the absence of democracy and the maintenance of deep inequalities despite a real modernisation of the country .
Although he has partly adopted on his own behalf the political reforms of Thaksin , Abhisit appears as what he is , the representative of the traditional elites .
The unity of the movement was achieved around the slogan of resignation of Prime Minister Abhisit and new democratic parliamentary elections .
Thaksin ’s wealth has largely contributed to developing the struggle , at least initially .
Nonetheless , the Red Shirts movement has changed a lot since its emergence .
If Thaksin remains a “ hero ” for many Red Shirts who feel he has contributed to an improvement in their living conditions , the demands are now on another level .
The objectives of Thaksin and the leaders of the UDD are to say the least divergent .
The leaders of the Red Shirts claim to be the champions of social justice and democracy .
Themes which do not suit Thaksin perfectly .
In addition , his chances of returning to power are thin and his main objective could well be to recover the 1.4 billion dollars seized by the judiciary in March .
In fact , Thaksin has withdrawn from the movement and as Chang Noi , a well known
Thai journalist , says , “ Thaksin could well not wish to ride this tiger now he knows how big and ferocious it is ” [ 10 ] .
As to its composition , the UDD has from the beginning been a broad and diverse movement .
Unity around the slogan of Abhisit ’s resignation and for immediate elections does little to conceal the very different political views and objectives among the leaders .
According to Tumberblog [ 11 ] a certain number of leaders like Surachai Danwattananusorn “ Sae - Dan ” , Jaran Dithapichai , Weng Tojirakarn or Vipoothalaeng Pattanaphumthai are former Communists .
Others like Jatuporn Promphan are MPs from the Puea Thai party , an heir of the Thai Rak Thai ( TRT ) and of the People ’s Power Party ( PPP ) .
Most are royalists or in any case do not publicly challenge the constitutional monarchy .
The law forbidding lèse majesté bans any debate on the monarchy .
The “ crime ” can be punished by 3 to 15 years imprisonment .
That does not favour freedom of expression and several Red Shirt personalities , like Giles Ji Ungpakorn and Jakaprob Penkair have had to go into exile to avoid prison .
At last , in August 2009 , after several months of after discussions , divergences appeared publicly among the leaders of the movement .
Jakaprob Penkair and “ Sae - Dan ” left it to form their own group , “ Red Siam ” .
The split took place around the tactic advocated by the main leaders of organising a petition to request the royal pardon for Thaksin .
A key question : the appeal to the king poses the question of the place of the monarchy and its desirable and possible evolution .
The detractors have argued that this petition accords to the king the power to interfere in an undemocratic manner in the struggle of the Red Shirts and would perpetuate illusions about the intentions of the monarchy .
For their part , the three leaders of the group “ Kwam Jing Wannee ” ( The Truth Today ) , Jatuporn Promphan , Weera Musikapong and Nattawut Saikua , fight for minor reforms in the context of the current monarchy .
Jatuporn explained very clearly to the newspaper “ The Nation ” : “ We want democracy under the King as head of state , therefore our activities are limited to attacking Privy Council president Prem Tinsulanonda or lower figures to prevent an escalating fight transgressing the constitutional monarchy ” [ 12 ]
The leaders of Red Siam , who are more radical , believe that the monarchy should be reformed .
Nonetheless they do not challenge the current framework of the constitutional monarchy . [ 13 ]
In terms of the rank and file , the Red Shirts are not the dangerous “ terrorists ” and conspirators against the monarchy portrayed by the government .
They are ordinary people .
The product of systematic brainwashing from the cradle , they are mainly of religious , nationalist and royalist sympathies [ 14 ] .
That is what makes this political movement different from the previous revolts in 1973 , 1976 and 1992 .
For the first time , it is ordinary people from the provinces , the peasants , workers , the poor and also the less well off middle classes of Bangkok who are mobilising .
The basis of the movement extends to a part of the middle classes who have become aware of the high cost that the coup has represented , whether in political or economic terms and now support a movement which seeks to re-establish democracy .
Many inhabitants of Bangkok have come to show their support for the Red Shirts or to join them .
The UDD has highlighted the specificity of this revolt in updating obsolete terms in the Thai language like “ phrai ” ( serf ) and “ amart ” ( nobles ) .
These terms illustrate the oppression and the injustices visited on those who “ have nothing ” in opposition to the privileged .
It certainly amounts to a class struggle , a revolt of the wretched against the established order .
The movement has stripped bare the machinery of this profoundly inegalitarian system , at the centre of which lies the monarchy .
End of reign
Is the monarchy still at the centre of the system ?
The question is legitimate .
The political crisis has seriously destabilised the institution .
The systematic references to the monarchy by the royalists themselves , first by the army to legitimate the coup then by the Yellow Shirts to legitimate their mobilisations against the “ pro Thaksin ” governments have helped deconstruct the image of the “ palace ” , guarantor of national unity and arbiter of partisan conflicts , elaborated over several decades .
The doubts have been sown by the Red Shirts and it will henceforth be hard for the establishment to maintain its grip over society by invoking the protection of the monarchy .
The crisis has also revealed that the monarchy is no longer in a position as in the past to weigh on events or smother the protests .
The king is dying , and has been in hospital since September 2009 .
The question of the succession is posed and has opened another political crisis inside the élites .
The legitimacy of the monarchy rests to a great extent on the almost God - like image of the current king .
Indeed , the designated heir to the throne , prince Vajiralongkorn , is utterly without the “ qualities ” of his father Bhumibol ( “ the blessed man ” ) .
He is weak politically , known for his decadent morals and detested by the majority of Thais .
Salacious stories about his private life circulate on websites before being censored .
He is moreover linked to Thaksin who has in the past partly subsidised his lifestyle .
The financial stakes are huge .
“ Forbes ” magazine estimated in 2009 that the Thai monarchy was the richest in the world with 30 billion dollars of net assets .
Its financial and industrial investments in all sectors of the Thai economy are colossal .
The smooth running of business depends , as all understand , on the maintenance of the established order .
Given the lack of charisma and legitimacy of Vajiralongkorn , he will not be in a position to have any political authority .
Princess Sirindhorn could play such a role as she is much appreciated but the law would only allow it if the heir died .
Internal struggles for the succession are intense .
Each of the claimants has built alliances with factions of the army and police , which partly explains the indecisions of the government until recent days .
At the other end of the social scale , we are very far from the high life .
A recent report from the UNDP [ 15 ] on Thailand tells us that inequality has not ceased to grow in recent years .
The UNDP compares the share of income of the richest 5 % to that of the poorest 5 % .
The results are revealing :
In relatively egalitarian societies like Japan or Scandinavia , the ration is around 3 to 4 , i.e. the richest 5 % are between three and four times richer than the poorest 5 % .
In the rest of Europe and in North America it is from 5 to 8 .
Among Thailand ’s neighbours , the ration is around 9 to 11 .
In Thailand it is in the region of 13 to 15 .
These inequalities are increasingly rejected by the population .
What outcome to the crisis ?
As these lines are written , the military forces have for three days been organising a violent repression of the Red Shirts .
According to numerous testimonies from foreign journalists and inhabitants of the capital , the military are firing on the demonstrators with live ammunition .
Several civilians have been killed in ambushes by snipers .
The confrontations began on May 13 after the head of security at the Rachaprasong camp , Sae Deng , was seriously wounded in the head by a bullet fired by a sniper .
The government denies responsibility for this assassination attempt but it seems obvious that only a crack sharpshooter could have such precision and not wound the International Herald Tribune journalist with whom Sae Deng was speaking when he was shot .
Already there have been around fifty deaths and it is probable that the real number will never be known because according to the Asian Human Right Commission the army has removed numerous bodies .
The Abhisit government had made an offer to the Red Shirts last week .
The national and international press speculated on a possible agreement which would satisfy the two parties .
Abhisit proposed a five point “ roadmap ” centred around elections on November 14 .
It was hard for the Red Shirt leaders to reject the plan outright .
But Abhisit offered no guarantee .
He refused to set a date for the dissolution of parliament and to withdraw the accusations of terrorism and conspiracy against the monarchy .
In these conditions , while stating that they accepted the plan and wished to negotiate its implementation , the Red Shirts refused to leave the neighbourhood they had occupied for 6 weeks .
Even if it is very difficult to obtain information on the subject , it also seems that the UDD had serious internal differences on the position to be adopted towards Abhisit ’s proposals .
At the beginning of the week , the Red Shirt leaders demanded that the deputy prime minister Suthep Thaugsuban was charged in relation to the confrontations of April 10 which led to around 20 deaths .
A request that the government used to justify backtracking on its election proposal and the repression which began on Thursday .
The situation is very complex and changeable and it is difficult to know how it will develop in the coming days and weeks .
In the immediate , all scenarios can be envisaged .
The repression could temporarily bring a halt to the Red Shirt demonstrations .
The army could also meet significant resistance , indeed a development of the provincial mobilisations .
In this case , a resignation of the government is probable with elections .
But it is also possible that a section of the army could take the situation as the pretext for a new coup .
An open struggle between different factions of the army should not be ruled out in that case .
The current impasse in the conflict is sadly not surprising : was Abhisit ’s plan to end the crisis sincere ?
The proposal raises numerous doubts .
When Thaksin attempted to renew his electoral mandate in April 2006 , after powerful mobilisations against him , Abhisit and the Democrat Party boycotted the elections .
Did Abhisit really want elections on November 14 ?
Information disclosed by the press reveals him as among the hardliners in the government who wanted repression rather than negotiations .
Inside the government , other ministers also did not want elections they were virtually certain to lose .
The date of the elections , November 14 , also posed a problem .
The value of an immediate dissolution of parliament , beyond its symbolic value , is that it allows the winning side to be in power on October 1 at the time of the annual reorganisation of the army command .
Abhisit ’s proposal would allow him to play for time and be in position at this strategic moment .
More fundamentally , in order for the elections to be organised , guarantees are needed so that they should be just and democratic and so that their outcome is respected by all .
Indeed , the Yellow Shirts did not conceal the fact that they rejected the proposed elections .
The élites are not ready to make concessions .
In addition , no democratic development is likely while the monarchy and the army , hand in hand , will accept no opposition to their omnipotence .
Thus one can imagine that a new electoral victory for the Red Shirt would have led to Yellow Shirt demonstrations to overthrow the new elected government .
For now , the democratic game seems completely blocked
Finally and undoubtedly most significantly : the failure of this attempt to exit the crisis is surely revealing of the fact that the majority of Thais no longer believe that elections alone can put an end to the crisis .
A deeper political change is needed .
The problem is that decades of repression mean that today there are no political parties based in the workers ’ movement capable of being candidates to power and to offer a progressive political solution to the crisis .
A number of leaders of the old workers ’ parties , whether social democratic or Maoist - inclined Communist , trade unions or peasant associations have been assassinated by the different dictatorial regimes .
The workers ’ movement has still not recovered .
That is why political opposition takes the unexpected form of the Red Shirts : a political movement which is neither a party nor an association , heterogeneous and marked by contradictions but whose essence is its organic link with the people .
We should hail the courage of these tens of thousands of workers and peasants who have occupied the commercial and business centres of Bangkok for many weeks and who are now experiencing the assaults of the army .
They deserve our support .

Israel faced a global diplomatic firestorm Monday over its deadly raid on a protest flotilla carrying humanitarian aid that was attempting to break through an Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip .
Amid demonstrations erupting worldwide , foreign leaders and protest organizers accused Israel of using excessive force in the raid in international waters .
At an emergency meeting , the United Nations Security Council condemned the violence and called for an investigation .
Israel defended its actions , saying its soldiers were ambushed with knives and metal bars — as well as handguns wrested from the commandos — during the late - night raid , which occurred about 40 miles off Israel ’s coast .
The Israeli military said nine protesters were killed .
Protest organizers put the death toll at 16 .
Dozens were wounded , including seven Israeli soldiers .
Video of the raid released by the Israeli military , Turkish television and other media sources depicted a dramatic high - seas brawl in which Israeli commandos rappelled from helicopters onto a ship and immediately clashed with activists on board .
Responding to the brewing crisis , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short his visit to Canada to return to Israel , cancelling a much - anticipated White House visit with President Obama scheduled for Tuesday that been widely seen as an opportunity to show improved U.S. - Israeli ties .
The Israeli raid appeared to be a public relations nightmare for Israel , putting the Obama administration in an awkward position just as it hoped to put to rest a frosty period in its alliance with Israel .
Whereas most governments used harsh language to condemn the raid , the administration responded cautiously , expressing regret at the loss of life but stopping short of criticizing Israel until full details of the incident are known .
The global focus on Israel ’s conduct in the raid — including the attention of the U.N. Security Council — now threatens to be a distraction from the U.S. administration ’s diplomatic priorities , notably getting international consensus for sanctions to deal with Iran ’s nuclear program .
Despite the international outrage directed at Israel , a senior administration official said Washington would strive to keep Arab states committed to the peace process .
“ There will be tensions here , but the real key will be keeping political support for the talks intact , ” said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ That will be our challenge . ”
The immediate focus of the international community , however , is now squarely on Israel ’s blockade of Gaza , which had slid into the background of international issues .
On Monday , world leaders decried the interception of the pro-Palestinian convoy , which was attempting to bring food , medical supplies , clothing and construction supplies to the impoverished territory .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy criticized Israel ’s “ disproportionate use of force . ” U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon condemned the violence .
The European Union ’s foreign affairs chief , Catherine Ashton , said the bloc was deeply concerned , and she called on Israel to conduct an inquiry .
British Foreign Secretary William
Hague deplored the killings and called for an end to the Gaza blockade .
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called the raid “ banditry and piracy ” on the high seas and “ murder conducted by a state . ”
Turkey , whose citizens accounted for more than half the flotilla ’s passengers and which has been an ally of Israel , recalled its ambassador to Israel and warned of further actions .
Ma Zhaoxu , China ’s Foreign Ministry spokesman , said his nation “ is appalled and condemns the Israeli navy ’s attack on the Turkish fleet shipping humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip . ”
Greece , Egypt , Sweden , Spain and Denmark summoned Israel ’s ambassadors , demanding explanations for the violence .
Greece suspended a military exercise with Israel and postponed a visit by Israel ’s air force chief .
Germany called for an immediate investigation but was careful not to directly place blame , adding that it was seeking information on six German citizens believed to have been aboard the ships .
Riot police used tear gas to drive back hundreds of protesters demonstrating outside the Israeli Embassy in Paris .
There were also demonstrations in the U.S. , Britain , Italy , Sweden , Norway , Cyprus and more than 20 cities in Greece .
At the United Nations , Palestinians and Arabs , backed by a number of Security Council members , called for Israel to lift the blockade on Gaza , immediately release the seized ships and activists , and allow them to deliver their goods .
After the raid , Israel ’s navy escorted the six vessels in the flotilla to the Israeli port of Ashdod , where the government had set up tents to accommodate the activists .
Protesters were offered the choice of flying home immediately or facing arrest and imprisonment .
By Monday evening , most were opting to be arrested , officials said , with as many as 600 activists from 40 nations still being held .
The Israeli military did not permit any of the detained passengers to speak to reporters or communicate with family members .
The passengers include members of the European Parliament , journalists and artists .
No information had been released about the identities of those killed .
Several dozen activists were being treated in Israeli hospitals .
Israeli officials Monday said their soldiers had expected moderate resistance and civil disobedience but instead encountered organized attacks the moment the commandos rappelled onto the Turkish - flagged Mavi Marmara , the lead ship in the flotilla , with more than 500 passengers .
“ They beat us up with metal sticks and knives , ” said one Israeli commando , speaking on condition of anonymity .
Soldiers had been ordered to treat the raid as a “ police action ” and use only paintball rifles to control the crowds , according to a report by Ynet , an Israeli news website .
But as the first soldiers boarded , they were quickly beset by protesters allegedly using switchblades , slingshots , deck chairs , marbles , metal balls and metal bars , military officials said .
According to the military , two protesters grabbed handguns from two commandos and began firing .
“ There was live fire at some point against us , ” the commando said .
“ They were shooting at us from below deck . ”
At least one soldier was thrown from the top deck of the boat to the lower deck by activists , according the commando and video released by the military .
Some soldiers jumped into the water to escape , the commando said .
At some point , military commanders authorized soldiers to use handguns against the crowds , military officials said .
“ Soldiers acted appropriately in this situation , ” said the military ’s chief of staff , Gaby Ashkenazi .
“ Soldiers found themselves in a life - threatening situation and used their weapons . ”
Two soldiers suffered gunshot wounds and one was stabbed , officials said .
Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon called the flotilla an “ armada of hate and violence ” that launched a “ premeditated and outrageous provocation . ”
Protest organizers gave a dramatically different version of events , insisting that activists were unarmed and that Israeli soldiers began shooting as soon as they boarded .
Leaders of Free Gaza , one of the pro-Palestinian groups that organized the flotilla , said Israeli soldiers launched an “ illegal ” night raid while the flotilla was still in international waters .
“ They can spin it any way they want , ” said Greta Berlin , a Free Gaza leader , speaking from the group ’s office in Cyprus .
“ We ’re the civilians and they are the military .
This was murder . ”
The group has been unable to contact its members since the attack began because Israel has jammed telephone signals .
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat called Israel ’s action a “ war crime , ” but he also told Al Jazeera television that he saw no need to pull out of peace negotiations being mediated by the U.S .
The Arab League , which represents 22 countries , released a statement assailing “ this terrorist act ” and called for an “ urgent meeting , ” which is expected to be held Tuesday .
Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri called the Israeli action “ a dangerous and crazy step that would inflame the struggle in the region . ”
In Israel , opposition leaders rallied to support the government in a sign of national unity .
But some Israelis called on the government to reevaluate the blockade .
“ It ’s a crime , ” Israeli Arab lawmaker Ahmad Tibi said .
“ Israel feels like it lives above international law and can do whatever it wants . ”
But Ayalon , accusing some of the protesters of having links with terrorist groups , defended the boats ’ seizure .
“ Allowing these ships to go in an illegal way to Gaza would have opened a corridor of smuggling arms and terrorists to Gaza , ” he said .
Israel has maintained a blockade against Gaza since 2007 to protest the territory ’s takeover by the Palestinian militant group Hamas .

The European Space Agency 's Envisat has captured the changes in direction of the rapidly - growing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico as strong winds over the weekend pushed it around and hampered clean - up efforts .
In these latest images , the oil spill is visible due east of the Delta National Wildlife Refuge extending into the Gulf .
The white dots are oil rigs and ships .
Wind can easily spread oil on the water , with the course determined by the wind 's direction and speed .
Following the explosion of the drilling rig on 22 April that produced the oil leak , the winds were blowing west - northwest .
On Saturday winds were blowing from the southeast , pushing the slick toward Louisiana .
Envisat acquired these images from its Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar ( ASAR ) and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer ( MERIS ) on 2 May 03:45 UTC ( Saturday night local time ) and on 2 May 16:10 UTC ( Sunday morning local time ) , respectively .
Radar is especially suited for detecting oil spills because it works day and night , can see through clouds ( unlike optical sensors ) and is particularly sensitive to the smoother water surface caused by the oil .
Depending on the situation , oil is harder to detect in optical satellite observations because the surface changes are not as pronounced .
To see the latest MERIS images of the oil spill , visit the MIRAVI website ( http://miravi.eo.esa.int/en/).
MIRAVI , which is free and requires no registration , generates images from the raw data collected by MERIS and provides them online quickly after acquisition .
The next ASAR and MERIS images of the oil spill are scheduled for 5 May , with the images being made available about two hours later .
Envisat images are being provided to US authorities immediately after they are acquired through the International Charter Space and Major Disasters .
On 22 April the US Geological Survey , on behalf of the US Coast Guard , requested the Charter to provide rapid access to radar and optical satellite imagery of the oil slick .
Since then , Envisat MERIS and ASAR data have been provided in near - real time and have been used by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
The Charter is an international collaboration between space agencies to put satellite remote sensing at the service of civil protection agencies and others in response to natural and man-made disasters .
That was a fun April Fool 's Day , you guys !
To replace T - Rex and company with Reginald and Beartato from Nedroid , I used the trick of a transparent PNG file that masked out the existing graphics .
Then , I was free to put any new graphics on top !
The empty mask file is here , if you want to play with it .
And play with it you might want to , because although I 've turned off the image replacement by default , it 's still available on the site !
Just add " &butiwouldratherbereading=nedroid " to any Dinosaur Comics URL and you 'll see something like this .
To pull this off I actually used some older code that had n't been up on the site since - wow , 2004 , I think - called " What if Dinosaur Comics had Puppies with Other Comics " ( it was a good name then and it remains a good name now ) .
In this same folder I found some old images that had been made then for other comics , so check out :
Dinosaur Comics plus Achewood
Dinosaur Comics plus Penny Arcade
Dinosaur Comics plus Wigu
Dinosaur Comics plus Pokey the Penguin
And feel free to make your own !
Just draw in the white space in the mask file , keeping in mind that anywhere you put art that is n't white runs the risk of covering up text ( the Penny Arcade one is especially bad for that ) ( as is the Pokey one but it 's on purpose there ! )
You can do other tricks too ( assuming you avoid the guest or mirror universe comics ) !
Here 's one I just made called Dinosaur Comics where T - Rex Swears Way More
UPDATE :
T- RexKCD !!
UPDATE AGAIN :
Problem Sleuth T - Rex !!
WHAT'S THIS , ANOTHER UPDATE ?:
Daisy Owl T - Rex !
Shortpacked T - Rex ! Wondermark T - Rex !
And if you mis-read " onewheretrexSWEARSmore " as " onewheretrexWEARSmore " , that dream can come true too , although be careful because after looking at that , going back to the original comics makes T - Rex look so , so naked .
One year ago today : anyway i'm off to the chocolate factory !!

Sir James
Black is credited with inventing beta - blockers
Nobel Prize - winning scientist Sir James
Black has died at the age of 85 , it has been announced .
Sir James was considered one of the great Scottish scientists of the 20th Century and is credited with having invented beta - blocker drugs in 1962 .
He was born in Uddingston , Lanarkshire , grew up in Fife , and studied medicine at St Andrews University .
In 1988 he won the Nobel Prize for medicine and was given the UK's highest honour , the Order of Merit , in 2000 .
Sir James died on Monday morning after a long illness .
Beta - blockers now play an essential role in the treatment of angina and heart attacks .
The Scottish scientist also went on to invent the first effective non-surgical treatment for stomach ulcers .
Medals and awards charting his career went on display at the National Museums of Scotland in Edinburgh last year .

Formula
One targets greener future
Formula
One teams are close to agreeing upon a new engine formula for the six - year period beginning in 2013 .
Until then , development of the current 2.4 litre V8s will remain ' frozen ' , to be replaced thereafter by similarly powerful engines that use less fuel , emit less pollution and are affordable for the small teams .
Spain 's El Mundo Deportivo newspaper said an in - principle agreement has been reached for a four cylinder , 1.5 litre engine equipped with a twin - turbo and direct injection .
The new formula would reportedly also involve KERS .
" If F1 has to develop something helpful for real ( road ) driving conditions , then the best solution is for an engine that is turbocharged and GDI ( gasoline direct injection ) , " Ferrari CEO Amedeo Felisa said .
" That is what we would support .
It is the best solution for driving efficiency and utilisation of the engine in a positive way . "
Mercedes ' Norbert
Haug agrees that smaller engines are likely for reasons of consumption and emissions , but warns that high technology needs to remain a crucial focus .
" If you fly from Europe to Japan on a 747 , you would use more fuel than an entire F1 season , " he said .
" We need to see the whole picture . "
When a bill calling for divestment from some companies doing business with Israel surfaced at a mid-March student government committee hearing at the University of California , Berkeley , local Jewish communal watchdogs were taken by surprise .
When the divestment measure was overwhelmingly approved at a student senate debate days later , some students affiliated with Hillel left the meeting in tears .
On different Sides : Nobel laureates Elie Wiesel ( top ) and Archbishop Desmond Tutu both wrote letters about the divestment bill .
Even when the student senate president vetoed the measure , those against divestment hardly saw it as a victory ; they knew that the veto could be easily undone , since the bill was passed with more votes than would be needed to overturn the veto .
And so a campaign was launched .
The debate on the veto was scheduled for the night of April 14 .
In the two weeks prior , Berkeley Hillel coordinated a comprehensive national lobbying campaign consisting of a teach - in , face - to - face meetings with student senators and an intervention by a Nobel laureate , all aimed at robbing the divestment supporters of three senate votes .
Adam Naftalin - Kelman , the Hillel ’s newly installed executive director , said that the strategy for countering divestment efforts was devised at a roundtable meeting convened by Hillel and attended by representatives of local branches of the Anti-Defamation League , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , the Jewish Community Relations Council , J Street , Israel ’s consul general in San Francisco and local rabbis .
Outmaneuvering the pro-divestment supporters , this organizing coup appears to have worked :
After a marathon debate that lasted well into the next morning , two senators changed their minds and one abstained , and the veto was upheld .
“ Three votes changed , ” Akiva Tor , the consul general , told the Forward .
“ So something happened . ”
The controversial resolution called on the university to divest from General Electric Co. and United Technologies “ because of their military support of the occupation of the Palestinian territories . ”
It also created a committee to suggest additional companies for future divestment .
The Hillel - organized teach - in , open exclusively to members of the student senate , featured talks by the consul general , an Israeli visiting professor , a professor of international law and others .
Seven senators attended .
One , a co-sponsor of the bill who did not change her vote , said that the presenters were respectful but she felt uncomfortable .
“ There were undertones of intimidation to me , ” Emily Carlton said .
“ For one thing , they were all a lot older , they were all a lot more distinguished . ”
One anti-divestment student group handed out suggested talking points for those speaking against the bill at the student government meeting .
The existence of the talking points , which were posted on the blog Mondoweiss , was confirmed by Naftalin - Kelman , who said that they were not distributed by the Hillel .
“ DON ’T try to deconstruct the bill , ” the talking points read .
“ Instead , focus on how it is an attack on the Jewish community . ”
In addition , the Jewish groups solicited open letters to the student senators .
Letters were sent by Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel , J Street , and Amos Oz , among others .
Supporters of the divestment bill also lobbied key senators , but their effort was less directed than that of the pro-Israel groups , according to one of the bill ’s drafters , Emiliano Huet - Vaughn , who is not a member of the student senate .
“ It was pretty ad hoc , ” he said of efforts to wrangle enough votes to overturn the presidential veto .
“ I suggested to the some senators people I knew that knew a lot about the topic … .
They chose if they wanted to meet with them or not . ”
Still , supporters of the bill were able to muster a Nobel laureate of their own .
Emily Carlton said divestment proponents solicited a letter in support of their position from Archbishop Desmond Tutu , who was awarded a Nobel peace prize for his work in South Africa ’s anti-apartheid movement .
Carlton also said that a letter sent in support of the pro-divestment position by left - wing journalist Naomi Klein surprised her and others .
A group of prominent Jewish members of the U.C. Berkeley community , including professor Daniel Boyarin , took out a two - page advertisement in The Daily Californian , a student - run newspaper , in support of the bill .
Boyarin said that the advertisement was organized through an e-mail listserv that had been convened for an earlier campaign , and that it was not coordinated by the student groups promoting the bill .
According to Carlton , tremendous pressure was brought to bear on Minji Kim , the senator seen as the key swing vote .
“ Both sides had people talk to her before , ” Carlton said .
“ Both sides campaigned very hard , and she was under an incredible amount of pressure . ”
Kim could not be reached for comment .
NhuNhu Nguyen , a senator who switched to opposing the divestment proposal from supporting it , also did not respond to a request for comment .
Naftalin - Kelman and Tor were among the hundreds to attend the marathon debate that ran through the night April 14 .
The venue was changed multiple times to accommodate overflow crowds .
Finally , at 5:30 a.m. on April 15 , 12 senators voted to overturn the veto , seven voted to let it stand and one senator abstained .
One of the senators who voted to let the veto stand was actually a supporter of the bill , and after the vote , she made a motion to reopen discussion .
Debate continued until 7:30 a.m. , when the measure was tabled .
A student senator said that the measure may be taken up again before the end of the semester , but if so it would probably happen in a closed session .
Whether or not the resolution eventually passes , the intense lobbying campaign may have already had a lasting effect on the Berkeley student government .
In the weeks between the first vote and the attempt to overturn the veto , discussions about how to challenge Berkeley student senate support for the bill were held as faraway as Washington , D.C.
At an AIPAC conference in Washington in late March , AIPAC leadership development director Jonathan Kessler said that his organization would “ make sure that pro-Israel students take over the student government and reverse the vote , ” as recorded in a video taken at the conference by the JTA .
“ This is how AIPAC operates in our nation ’s Capitol .
This is how AIPAC must operate on our nation ’s campuses , ” he said .
In Berkeley student government election results announced April 13 , one of the senators who had vocally opposed the divestment resolution was elected president of the student government .
His party , considered the more moderate of the two Berkeley student parties , won a majority in the senate .
Naftalin - Kelman said that the divestment vote might have played a role in the results but if so , it was one of many factors .
“ I think it did pull out more Jewish votes than in the past , ” he said .
“ There ’s other things on campus , as well … I think it may have had a contributing factor .
I do n’t think it was as big as some people think . ”
In response to an inquiry from the Forward , an AIPAC spokesman wrote in an e-mail : “ We took no position on the Berkeley student election , since like in any other election , we do n’t rate or endorse candidates .
Of course we would always , publicly and consistently , encourage pro-Israel students to be active in civic and political life . ”
The spokesman declined to make Kessler available for an interview .

Flash on the Mac is broken
Steve Jobs is now famously purported to have called Flash a “ CPU hog ” and “ old technology ” , something I ’d have to agree with based on my experience .
Flash is simply broken on the Mac , there is just no denying it .
I do n’t know what the problem is and I ’m not going to pretend to know , but I do know that it makes for a generally miserable experience to encounter a Flash website when you ’re on a Mac .
Apple ’s problems with the Adobe Flash plugin have been in tech news a lot recently , so we ’re going to show what the complaints are about .
It does n’t matter how good your browser is , the Flash plugin will probably screw it up by taking over every possible CPU cycle .
Load a Flash - based site and your MacBook Pro will sound like it ’s preparing to enter Earths orbit .
This is what people are complaining about , and this is exactly why Apple does n’t want Flash on their touch devices .
I do n’t believe you , Flash on the Mac is beautifully written and a wonderful compliment to any web browser , it ’s full of soft flowers and will bake you cakes and tuck you into bed , all while only using 1 % of CPU when running 600 YouTube Videos !
I wish !
If you ’re looking for a sure - fire way to meltdown your Mac browser with some Flash , check out BB 2.0 , the collaborative music project , where you ’re supposed to play various YouTube videos to create your own music … fancy idea but I can’t play more than 8 videos at a time on my Mac without whatever browser becoming totally unresponsive , with Firefox fairing the worst and requiring a Forced Quit to return to sanity ( for the record , I can play them all on a relatively weak Windows Netbook next to me , in any browser ) .
Ok enough is enough , what can I do as a Mac user ?
Other than voicing your complaints ( Adobe must be listening somewhere , and hopefully addressing the problem ) , I think the best thing for Mac users who are fed up with Flash ’s performance is to simply add a Flash blocker to their web browser .
Here ’s a few options to consider :
FlashBlock for Firefox
BashFlash for Chrome
ClickToFlash for Safari

To our knowledge , the above images are not photoshopped , these are real screenshots of Flash freakouts in Mac OS X on various browsers , some from our own OS X Daily staff , reader submissions , forum rants , and web searches .
We have personally confirmed many of the Flash problems and we encourage you to verify it yourself by getting on a Mac and loading any Flash intensive site like this , or simply and sadly going to YouTube and playing a video while you have the Activity Monitor open .
Dear Adobe , it may already be too late , but fix Flash on the Mac !
After a six - month trial , a San Francisco city admin was found guilty Tuesday of a sole felony count of hijacking the city 's computer system .
Terry Childs , 45 , was guilty of one count of locking out the city from its FiberWAN network containing city e-mails , payroll , police records , information on jail inmates and more – virtually an all - access pass to City Hall .
Childs was arrested in July 2008 after refusing to hand over passwords to the Wide Area Network system he was accused of taking control of illegally .
A San Francisco jury deliberated a week before reaching a verdict .
Childs ' $ 5 million bail was set five times higher than most murder defendants ' because the authorities feared that , if released , he might permanently lock the system and erase records .
The FiberWAN network system is the major backbone of the consolidated city - and - county government 's computing infrastructure , connecting hundreds of different departments and buildings to a central data center , and to each other .
The FiberWAN system carries more than 60 percent of the network traffic for San Francisco 's government .
Childs had worked as a computer technician with the city for five years before his arrest .
He earned $ 126,000 in base pay , in addition to another $ 22,500 for being on call to assist with network malfunctions .
The city 's data system was restored after Mayor Gavin Newsom spoke with Childs in jail , where he finally gave the passwords to the mayor .
Childs faces a maximum 5 - year prison term when sentenced June 14 .

Ever since the FACT mix series began , we ’ve been fantasising about hosting one from Gavin Russom .
Today the fantasy becomes speaker - rattling reality , as we present an exclusive and specially - recorded session from the DFA stalwart , synth guru , acid evangelist and all - round good guy .
You ’ll want to be downloading it as soon as humanly possible .
If you read our recent interview , you ’ll know a lot ’s been happening in Russom ’s world of late .
After making his name – and helping build DFA ’s estimable reputation – with the uniformly excellent Delia & Gavin and Black Leotard Front records , the artist and producer spent a few years in Berlin , honing his skills , expanding his mind and breaking cover to deliver the storming Black Meteoric Star 12 ″s and album .
Representing Russom ’s intuitive , open - ended take on acid house and techno , the Black Meteoric Star project has since been retired , but its focussing of dancefloor energy undoubtedly informs his latest venture , The Crystal Ark .
Inspired first and foremost by the wealth of South American music that Russom absorbed on his travels there , not to mention his enduring love of tear - out Belgian rave from the early 90s , The Crystal Ark has already released one excellent single on DFA ( ‘ The City Never Sleeps ’ ) , with more to follow along with a live show of some shape or form .
Now based back in New York , acid remains a focal interest for Russom , and one of his most bold and mind - warping remixes to date appeared last week on Carlos Giffoni ’s essential No Fun Acid 12 ″ .
It would be an exaggeration to say that acid courses through the veins of his FACT mix , but it ’s true that tough , psychedelic house and techno sounds abound – from the grinding NY warehouse sounds of Levon Vincent and DJ Qu to the dubwise techno of Peter Van Hoesen and grandstanding Detroit architecture of Vince Watson .
But there are plenty of curveballs as well – most notably a track taken from Steve Halpern ’s 1983 new age wig - out Spectrum Suite , which recalls Russom ’s stately , kosmische - influenced collaborations with Delia Gonzalez , and the gorgeous downtown disco from Diamond Vampires ’ ‘ Friday Nights ’ .
2010 looks set to be another vintage year for Russom : as well as The Crystal Ark , there ’s a new Delia & Gavin 12 ″ dropping soon , and he ’s also now a part of LCD Soundsystem , having built some custom synth - rigs for the band ’s This Is Happening LP and imminent world tour .

Enumeration for Census 2011 will begin in Gujarat on April 21 .
For the first time , a photograph and biometric data — including prints of all the 10 fingers of the hands - of all individuals above 15 years of age will be collected along with primary information about them .
Initially , only the primary identification information about individuals will be collected ; the photos and the biometric data will be collected at a later date .
Anyone refusing to give the information sought by census officials can be fined Rs1,000 .
Giving this information , Manish Bharadwaj , director of census operations , Government of India , said that this was the first time that the National Population Register ( NPR ) programme had been linked to the census exercise .
“ Under the Census Act , it is mandatory for citizens to furnish information sought by census officials , ” Bhargava said .
“ Anyone who refuses to give the required information can be fined Rs1,000 by the designated officer . ”
Primary information about individuals collected from them will eventually form the database for the building of a National Population Register ( NPR ) .
In the first phase of the exercise that begins on April 21 , census officials will visit every household in the state with two forms - one for the ‘ House - listing and Housing Census ’ and the other for personal information ( such as name , gender , age etc ) for the NPR .
“ Individuals will be required to fill the NPR form along with the form for household census , ” Bharadwaj said .
Two months after the task of collecting primary information from individuals is over , the work on their photo and biometric registration will begin .
“ The primary information , biometric data and the photos of the individuals surveyed will be handed over to the Unique ID Authority of India , ” he said .
“ The authority will scan the data and match it with the national database to avoid duplication . ”
Bhargava further explained that the authority will then give the UID photo and biometric registration data to local authorities — the gram sabha in the case of villages and ward offices in the case of urban areas — so that people can inspect them .

State - of - the - art British warplanes have taken to the air 64 times since 2006 to head off Russian aircraft , figures reveal .
They are being scrambled to repel the 1,380 mph Tu160 Blackjack and Tu95 Bear bombers .
The RAF 's elite ' Quick Reaction Alert ' force is being called into action following the Kremlin 's growing tendency to flex its muscles and test Western response times to its increasingly aggressive incursions .
Tornado F3 fighters from 111 Squadron based at RAF Leuchars in Fife and Typhoon F2s - also known as Eurofighters - from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire are on 24 - hour standby .
The revelations come after the RAF was forced to axe the number of Tornado training flights in a bid to save £ 80,000 a month on fuel and other costs .
Defence chiefs admitted in March that RAF warplanes were scrambled no fewer than 20 times last year to warn off Russian bombers .
But the latest statistics , revealed under the Freedom of Information Act , uncover the true extent of Russian premier Vladimir Putin 's sabre - rattling .
International experts believe the missions are an attempt by Russia to re-assert itself as a superpower after crippling budget cuts forced it to scrap the flights in the 1990s .
The supersonic Tu160 , nicknamed the White Swan by its pilots , can carry up to 40tons of weapons including cruise or short - range nuclear missiles .
Mr Putin , himself a former Blackjack pilot , is suspected of ordering the training missions to the fringes of UK airspace .
Now the RAF has released a series of dramatic pictures taken by British airmen who tracked a Blackjack warplane for four hours as it snaked along the Outer Hebrides .
British fighter pilots intercepted the Russians in international airspace near Stornoway , on the Isle of Lewis , and took photographs of the planes in the dawn light .
The two Tornados shadowed the bombers for hundreds of miles before they turned away .
An RAF spokesman said that the revival of the training runs was not seen as a threat .
But Matthew Clements , Eurasia analyst of Jane 's Defence News , said : ' Although ostensibly these are for training purposes they also provide Russia with a symbolic show that it is able to project its power beyond its own borders . '
Defence aviation analyst Mike Gething said : ' Each side is doing what it 's supposed to do : they 're training .
' The Russians have got a bomber force that they need to train , and they like long flights to this part of the world .
' But make no mistake - when those aircraft meet one another each side is taking pictures and monitoring radio conversations , and other emissions , from each other 's aircraft .
' It 's an intelligence - gathering exercise as much as a training exercise . '
A spokesman for the Russian Embassy said : ' It 's just training flights - nothing more than that .
' As any other country , Russia has the right to conduct patrol flights in the international airspace - strictly abiding by the corresponding international regulations .
' Russian strategic aircraft have never entered into sovereign UK airspace or that of other states . '

NEW DELHI —A Catholic priest charged with sexually assaulting a 14 - year - old girl in Minnesota is working in his home diocese in India and has no plans to return to the U.S. to face the courts , he and his bishop told The Associated Press on Monday .
Church documents obtained by the AP show the Vatican was alerted to the accusations against the Rev. Joseph Palanivel Jeyapaul more than three years ago but , according to the bishop , the Most Rev. A. Almaraj , did not take any part in disciplining him .
The priest has received only a minor punishment and is currently working in his bishop 's office processing teacher appointments for a dozen church schools in the diocese of Ootacamund in southern India .
" We can not simply throw out the priest , so he is just staying in the bishop 's house , and he is helping me with the appointment of teachers , " said Almaraj , the bishop of Ootacamund .
" He says he is innocent , and these are only allegations .
... I do n't know what else to do . "
Almaraj emphasized that Jeyapaul was engaged in only " paperwork , nothing to do with the children or anything . "
The main group of clerical abuse victims in the United States has scheduled a news conference for Monday in St. Paul , Minnesota , to draw attention to the Jeyapaul case and demand he be suspended and returned to face justice in the United States .
The group , Survivors Network for those Abused by Priests , has been campaigning recently to draw attention to what it considers the Vatican 's complicity in cases of abusive priests being moved around dioceses to avoid criminal prosecution .
The Vatican has denounced such accusations and has blamed the media for what it calls a smear campaign against the pope and his advisers .
The Vatican has insisted Pope Benedict XVI takes such accusations seriously and cracked down on abuse in 2001 by ordering dioceses to inform the Vatican of all such cases .
However , the Vatican has n't issued any guidelines requiring bishops to heed civil authorities , though it insists nothing in its directives precludes such cooperation .
Jeyapaul is currently wanted on two counts of criminal sexual conduct stemming from accusations he assaulted a young , female parishioner in the fall of 2004 at the Blessed Sacrament Church in Greenbush , Minnesota , where he was working .
Each charge carries a sentence of up to 30 years .
According to the criminal complaint , the teenage girl accused Jeyapaul of threatening to kill her family if she did not come into the rectory , where he then forced her to perform oral sex on him and groped her in the fall of 2004 .
In a telephone call with The Associated Press , Jeyapaul denied the charges .
This year , 50 years on from the independence of most former French colonies in Africa , relations between France and its erstwhile possessions south of the Sahara remain murkier and more confused than ever .
Never mind .
In the summer , Paris plans to host a so - called " renovation summit " to revamp Franco - African relations .
But many critics , both in France and in Africa , say the gathering will be more a sign of business - as - usual rather than something that will encourage reform .
Paradoxically , protests against Francafrique ( the Franco - African shadow state which perpetuated French influence south of the Sahara after 1960 ) have been far more vocal in the wake of the massive French disengagement from the region after the end of the Cold War than during the three decades - les trente glorieuses - of French neocolonialism from 1960 - 1989 .
The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of East - West geopolitical rivalry encouraged public debate about France 's role in Africa .
France has been reluctant to play the role of the gendarme of Africa
France has been reluctant to play the role of the gendarme of Africa Just how many first - and second - generation immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa are living in France today remains an open question , as French law prohibits statistics based on racial criteria .
However , it is estimated that up to 5 % of the country 's 65 million inhabitants originate from the region .
Many have acquired French citizenship and form , together with long - standing French nationals from the Antilles , what the national media refers to as " Black France " .
But since racially tainted riots erupted in major French cities at the end of 2005 , many French people of African descent - perhaps alienated from the powers - that - be in Paris - consciously define themselves as " hyphenated " citizens : Franco - Africans with divided national loyalties .
Renewed , balanced and transparent
On the eve of this year 's Bastille Day , the heads of state of former French interests in Africa are due to gather around President Nicolas Sarkozy " to highlight and to bear out the evolution of Franco - African relations which are to remain privileged while being renewed , balanced and transparent " .
Using less convoluted language than the official communique , the president explained in December that the purpose was " to turn the page of the debate on [ French ] colonisation and post - colonisation " .
Exhibitions , round - table discussions , publications and academic conferences have been scheduled throughout this year .
The military show is meant to be a reminder of Franco - African fraternity of arms , notably against Nazi occupation in World War II .
The African heads of state will also attend the traditional garden party at the Elysee Palace following the Bastille Day parade .
The event 's theme is " Diversity - the human reality which links the colonial past to present - day immigrant France , " according to the Elysee communique , but this in particular is causing a few ructions .
The person appointed by Mr Sarkozy to run this year 's events is Jacques Toubon whose previous political career is quite telling .
Not only is he a die - hard Gaullist - an ideology named after former President Charles de Gaulle who insisted on maintaining as much control as possible over France 's African interests - but he is also a former minister of culture and , since 2005 , has been at the helm of a new museum dedicated to the history of immigration in France .
The museum occupies a pavilion erected for the Colonial Exhibition in 1931 , which marked the acme of French imperialism .
As a result , criticism has been voiced against the mixed messages being sent by the government on the subject .
Renegotiation
On the one hand there seems to be a direct line drawn between la plus grande France - the " Greater France " of colonial times - and immigration .
But , on the other hand , since Mr Sarkozy 's election in spring 2007 , the French government has intensified efforts to conclude bilateral treaties with states south of the Sahara aiming at a " joint management " of migratory movements .
Yet while small and relatively privileged countries like Gabon have signed such agreements , more important reservoirs of sub-Saharan immigration , namely Mali , have so far refused to " co-police " migration .
Mr Sarkozy 's government has been more successful in renegotiating the defence treaties which were signed with all former colonies in 1960 ( except for Sekou Toure 's Guinea which cut the umbilical cord with Paris in 1958 , achieving independence two years earlier than all the other former French colonies ) .
The revised treaties clarify mutual obligations and , in particular , no longer contain " secret clauses " for French military intervention in case of internal conflict .
Making discretionary use of its right to intervene , France has staged over 40 military operations to save , or sometimes topple , African regimes since 1960 , mostly during the Cold War .
But since the fall of the Berlin Wall , and especially after the debacle in Rwanda in 1994 , France has been reluctant to play the role of the gendarme of Africa .
There are still about 10,000 French soldiers deployed south of the Sahara , down from 15,000 in 1989 .
But half of them are serving on temporary missions , often under UN mandates .
Also , in the past 20 years , Paris has closed three out of six permanent bases on the continent .
France 's foreign direct investment in Africa has also plummeted since the Berlin Wall crumbled .
While the African share stood at just over 30 % in 1989 , it has been consistently below 5 % since the turn of the century .
Furthermore , the bulk of France 's overseas capital investment has been shrewdly diversified beyond former colonial boundaries in favour of non-francophone countries such as Nigeria , Angola , Kenya and South Africa .
Shady middlemen
Yet , despite France 's disengagement from its former colonies , political mores between Paris and the francophone capitals of the continent remained characterised by back - door arrangements and shady middlemen .
But since he took office , President Sarkozy has perpetuated France 's time - honoured tradition of parallel diplomacy in Africa .
One set of advisers presides in public over the official business with Africa , while high - ranking Elysee staff , in tandem with unofficial middlemen , is in charge of the lucrative and highly personalised politics that Mr Sarkozy denounced during his presidential campaign .
The French media regularly expose the broken promises and the new lease on life given to Francafrique .
The elite collusion of Francafrique has become an anachronism , at odds with the stark realities of shrinking French engagement - both government and private - with its former territories south of the Sahara .
For example , Mauritania 's General Mohammed Ould Abdelaziz continued to visit the Elysee Palace after the coup that brought him to power , despite being denounced in capitals across Europe .
Hence , if they care at all , most French belittle the 2010 " renovation summit " as a political gimmick , actually not all that different from the so - called " independence of the flag " granted to the African colonies in 1960 .

Color us unsurprised , but it 's still notable to hear that Adobe is stopping investment in its software 's capability to port content over to iPhone OS .
The company 's great hope on this front , Packager for iPhone , will still ship as part of Flash CS5 as planned , but beyond that Adobe is essentially giving up on Apple 's mobile OS until further notice .
In spite of being repeatedly rebuffed by Jobs and company before , the Flash maker had kept up hope that it could sway ( or nag ) Apple into validating its wares , but the final straw in this relationship seems to have been Apple 's dev tool lockdown .
So what will Adobe do now ?
Principal Product Manager Mike Chambers tells us that Android is doing kind of okay and his company will shift its attentions to it and other mobile platforms .
Of course , we 're just giving you the cleaned up version -- for the full finger - pointing diatribe against Apple , you 'll have to hit the source link .
Right on cue , here 's Apple 's terse response : " Someone has it backwards -- it is HTML5 , CSS , JavaScript , and H.264 ( all supported by the iPhone and iPad ) that are open and standard , while Adobe 's Flash is closed and proprietary . "

Windows Phone 7
Series marks the first time Microsoft has done something legitimately exciting with its phone software in years , and by all counts , it looks fantastic .
The new interface is like nothing we 've seen on a phone before , and the experience of actually using a Windows Phone device is kind of stunning , no matter what smartphone software you 're used to .
So , how can you try it , half a year before it 's supposed to hit stores ?

What You Need
The Windows Phone 7 developer kit is a suite of software used to create apps for the new OS , which , in hopes of having a healthy catalog of apps available for the platform by the time it launches , Microsoft has released for free .
Bundled with the SDK is a device emulator , which lets you run Windows Phone 7 in a windows on your desktop .
It 's fun to play with in the stripped - down version Microsoft includes with the development kit , but with a little tweaking , we can unlock a much fuller version of the OS to fiddle around with .
So !
Here 's what you need :
• A Windows PC ( Or a virtual machine , running Windows )
• The Windows Phone 7 Development Kit
• This custom Windows Phone 7 ROM [ Download , Torrent ]
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Installation and First Run
1 . When you download the Windows Phone 7 Development kit , you 'll be led into an automated installer , which contains a whole range of development tools , from the XNA Game Studio to Silverlight to Visual Basic .
Let the installer run its course — you do n't need everything , but it 's best not to mess with the options too much .
Anyway , let it finish .

2 . Once it 's done , you may be prompted to restart your computer — go ahead .
3 . When you 're back up and running , open up Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express , which is the primary dev tool for constructing Windows Phone apps .
Advertisement
4 . Once it 's open , you should see a sort of dual - pane interface , almost like an HTML editor .
From here , click on " New Project , " either in the top left of the main window or from the File menu .
Advertisement
5. Click OK , to open up one of the app templates .
It does n't matter which one , really .
6. Press F5 to run the emulator .
The first startup will take a minute or so , but once it 's done , you 'll be clicking around Windows Phone 7 as if you actually had a phone , floating right there in front of you .
Sort of .

Looks a bit sparse , right ?
Microsoft tucked most of the interesting stuff out of sight , leaving developers with this , a stripped - down piece of software that 's just complete enough to test an app .
Luckily , the default apps are there — they 're just hidden .
Advertisement
Unlocking the Apps
The version of the OS shipped for development is stripped down to almost nothing , with just a browser and some settings pages remaining .
To play with the rest of the OS — the default apps , like email , Zune , Xbox Live , and whatnot — you need to load the emulator with an unlocked image .
Advertisement
7 . The Windows 7 image file you downloaded earlier will be in either a RAR or BIN format — isolate the BIN file , because that 's the actual operating system .
8 . Copy the BIN file , and paste it into :
[ YourHardDrive ] : / Program Files / Microsoft SDKs / WindowsPhone /v7.0/Emulation /Images
9 . Make sure the emulator is closed , and rename the BIN file that 's in there to whatever you want .
( In cases like this , I usually like to just change the file extension to .old )
Advertisement
10 . Now , rename the new image file WM70C1.bin , to replace the old one .
11 . Reopen Visual Studio , press F5 , and hey !
There it is .
Advertisement
From here you 'll be able to click around Windows Phone 7 as it exists today .
This is almost the exact same version of the OS we got to play with back at launch , so it should give you a pretty good idea as to what Microsoft 's going for with their new software .

Tetsuo cat would have taken Akira to a whole new level
With smallpox largely eradicated around the world , health organizations phased out the smallpox vaccine between the 1950s and 1970s ( the last natural case of the disease was seen in 1977 , in Somalia ) .
During that span , Raymond Weinstein says , the AIDS crisis broke out in force .
And in a study in BMC Immunology , he argues those two events could be connected .
Supposing that smallpox vaccination could have some effect on a person 's susceptibility to HIV , researchers led by Weinstein tested the idea on cells in a lab .
They took immune cells from 10 people recently vaccinated against smallpox and 10 people never vaccinated .
HIV , they found , was five times less successful at replicating with the cells of vaccinated people .
Why ?
The researchers believe vaccination may offer some protection against HIV by producing long - term alterations in the immune system , possibly including the expression of a receptor called CCR5 on the surface of white blood cells , which is exploited by the smallpox virus and HIV [ BBC News ] .
Any finding that expands knowledge of how HIV replicates could be an important one .
And while this small study can't prove Weinstein 's assertion is correct , the argument is , at the very least , plausible .
Says Weinstein :
" There have been several proposed explanations for the rapid spread of HIV in Africa , including wars , the reuse of unsterilised needles and the contamination of early batches of polio vaccine .
However , all of these have been either disproved or do not sufficiently explain the behaviour of the HIV pandemic " [ Press Association ] .

Toyota has introduced big price cuts in the US
Toyota 's US sales bounced back in March as substantial discounts helped to win back customers who had been shaken by the firm 's mass safety recalls .
The Japanese carmaker saw its US sales jump 40.7 % last month compared with a year earlier .
The big rise came after its sales slumped by 8.7 % in February .
Ford and General Motors also saw their sales rise last month , up 39.8 % and 20.6 % respectively .
Chrysler , the third of the " Big Three " US car firms , saw its sales fall 8.3 % .
' Brand trust '
Toyota has had to recall more than eight million cars worldwide due to problems with accelerator pedals and brakes .
" Toyota 's strong sales performance in March reflects our customers ' continued confidence in the safety and reliability of our vehicles , and their trust in the brand , " said Don Esmond , senior vice president of automotive operations for Toyota Motor Sales USA .
" We are standing by our cars , and we 're grateful that our customers are standing by Toyota . "
Toyota is the world 's largest carmaker , both in terms of revenues and sales .
Nissan 's US sales rose 43.3 % in March , while Hyundai 's added 15.4 % .
For our latest mission , we brought the movie Ghostbusters to life in the reading room of The New York Public Library at 42 Street .
The 1984 movie begins with a scene in the very same room , so we figured it was time for the Ghostbusters to make an encore appearance .
Enjoy the video first and then go behind - the - scenes with the photos and report below .
Agents Hines , Purnell , Lathan , and Scordelis
The New York Public Library approached us about a month ago and asked if we would want to stage an Improv Everywhere mission on their property .
The library is facing serious budget cuts , and they thought having us do something awesome there might serve to remind people of how great the NYPL is .
We could n’t say no to the opportunity to do something in their gorgeous , 100 year - old Rose Main Reading Room .
It actually was n’t the first time we staged something on the NYPL grounds .
Back in 2002 , we held a ridiculous protest claiming to be a group called Writers Against Piracy .
That mission was , of course , unauthorized .
It was nice to get invited by the library this time around and to have their permission to set up our cameras .
When brainstorming ideas for the mission , I immediately thought of Ghostbusters .
The NYPL is heavily featured in the beginning of the movie , opening with a crane shot of the lion statue outside and cutting to the reading room .
The thought of bringing the Ghostbusters back to the library 25 years later cracked me up .
Agent Lathan and his binocular glasses
Agent Purnell puts on his fake mustache
Showing the ghosts a map of the reading room
We met on the steps out front and got organized .
Agent Adams came up with a plan to spread our team of six camera people discreetly around the room .
Most of our operators used DSLR cameras , which allowed them to blend in perfectly with the constant stream of tourists taking photos of the historic room .
I went over all of the blocking and timing with the actors .
They then headed inside to a staging area and got into costume .
Agent Rodgers was the first ghost to enter .
He grabbed a book off of a shelf on the way in and started heading for a seat .
He was quickly stopped by a security guard , who had no idea what was going on .
Guard : Sir , what are you doing ?
Rodgers : Um … haunting the library .
The guard allowed him to take a seat , and then went over to the information desk to laugh about it with another employee .
Rodgers takes his seat .
Notice the girl in pink ’s reaction ( behind the girl in white )
The first ghost got some nice reactions from the folks he sat by , but they eventually went back to working when it became clear the ghost was just going to sit and read a book .
That is , until ghost number two entered .
Agent Walker enters as the second ghost
( note the same guard reacting in the background )

After about five minutes , the final ghost made his entrance .
He walked down the aisle and headed over to the dictionary stand .
Agent Vernon
With three ghosts spread out in the reading room , who you gonna call ?
Ghostbusters surveying the room
Tourists and library patrons take notice ( and photos ! ) of the Ghostbusters
The first ghost reads , unaware of the danger he ’s in
As soon as the Ghostbusters spotted the ghosts , Agent Lathan shouted , “ Get ’em ! ”
The ghost leaps to his feet
All three ghosts leapt up and immediately started running around and making ghost noises .
Agent Hines finds the computer - using ghost
While the ghost - phase of the mission was pretty low - key , as soon as the chase started the room came alive .
The room full of library patrons and tourists all started laughing , smiling , and frantically getting out their cameras and camera phones .
It was cool to see tables full of people taking off their headphones and laughing with each other .
Agent Scordelis follows a ghost out the door
The whole chase lasted less than a minute , as we did n’t want to be too disruptive to the people trying to get their work done .
The Ghostbusters were n’t able to get their hands on the ghosts and ended up following them out of the reading room .
After they left , the room broke out in applause .
The Ghostbusters chase was n’t quite over yet .
They followed the ghosts down the stairs and out the front door of the building !
The chase continues down Fifth Avenue
The Ghostbusters rounded the corner onto 42nd Street and disappeared out of view in pursuit of the ghosts .
My guess is that they were successful , as the Ghostbusters were spotted later in the day in good spirits posing for a photo with a young fan .
Mission Accomplished .

Two years ago , when I was a newcomer to Media Watch , I went to the Logies for the first time .
They put me on the top ABC table , with , among others , Managing Director Mark Scott , grown - up actor William McInnes and child star Bindi Irwin , whose TV series Bindi : The Jungle Girl was screening on ABC Kids .
Bindi was only nine .
She was charming .
She signed an autograph for my then - 7 - year - old daughter , who was impressed that for once her dad had met someone interesting .
I skipped last year - when you have to catch an 8:00 am flight back to Sydney to record Media Watch , a late night of partying in Melbourne loses a lot of its appeal .
But this year I decided to give it another go , and found myself sitting at the same table as Wil Anderson .
The ABC delivered us late to the Crown Palladium .
So I must have missed the appeal to guests not to Twitter .
Wil was enthusiastically tweeting away , so I pulled out the iPhone and sat around trying to think of witty and amusing things to say to keep my meagre 2,000 or so followers happy .
( Wil , I believe , has upwards of 33,000 ) .
Early on , he sent this tweet : " Jonathan Holmes is at my table .
Hope they read out my tweets in those sexy media watch voice ... "
The final s of ' voices ' was presumably the 141st character , and was ruthlessly excised by Twitter .
In any case , I doubt we 'll be reading out Wil 's tweets next Monday .
We 've been beaten to it by Today Tonight , A Current Affair , and a dozen shocked shock - jocks .
Wil Anderson , like Catherine Deveny , is a professional comedian .
Deveny writes a regular column for The Age , but it 's not her employer .
Anderson presents
The Gruen Transfer and used to present the Glass House for the ABC , but it 's not his employer .
Whether The Age has issued guidelines on the use of Twitter by those who are its employees , I 'm not sure ; but the ABC certainly has .
Its guidance to ABC staff who have private Twitter accounts consists of just four short sentences .
One is : " Do not mix the professional and the personal in ways likely to bring the ABC into disrepute " ; another : " Do not imply ABC endorsement of your personal views " .
But for those who , like me , have an ' ABC account ' , which can be listed and cross-promoted on ABC platforms , it 's a different matter .
The guidance note states baldly :
If a complaint is received about content on an ABC account , the ABC accepts responsibility and the Editorial Policies apply .
Whoa !
Though they 're in the process of being radically pruned , the ABC 's Editorial Policies currently run to 100 pages , not including appendices .
That 's a lot to bear in mind when you 're sending 140 characters .
Little wonder that the ABC 's most - followed tweeters - people like Lateline 's Leigh Sales ( @leighsales , for Twitter - users ) or PM's Mark Colvin ( @colvinius ) are careful .
They make bad jokes from time to time , and indeed good ones , but you 'll never catch them tweeting an obscenity or voicing an opinion on a matter of political controversy .
Much of the time they simply point their followers to interesting things they 've read or seen somewhere on the web .
Even Jonathan Green , the editor of The Drum , has become more cautious since his little green frog icon migrated from Crikey to the ABC late last year .
Yet Twitter derives much of its attraction from its spontaneity - and indeed , from its rudeness .
Tweeters use bad language .
Tweeters scoff , and deride , and fulminate , and whinge .
Some of them , it must be said , could also bore for Australia .
But the ABC knows what it 's doing .
For when Catherine Deveny complains that tweeting is like passing notes in school , she 's being disingenuous .
She apparently has 4,726 followers right now - I 'm not sure if that number has gone up or down since Logies night - but any of them can retweet anything she says to a wider audience .
More to the point , the offending tweets all carried the hashtag #logies , which meant that they would be read by any Twitter - user interested in the Logies that night .
They were very public indeed .
She also claimed she was taken out of context .
I 'm not the first to remark that Twitter has no context .
Each tweet must stand alone , 140 characters max .
Hard to convey irony , or amusement , or hate .
Hard to convey that when you say you hope Bindi gets laid , you 're using satire " to expose celebrity raunch culture and the sexual objectification of women " .
Twitter is a treacherous medium .
So fast , so simple , so easy to get wrong .
There 's the fact that , unless you have a huge following , a lot of the time you 're exchanging messages with a small circle .
It 's easy to forget the larger world out there .
And it 's easy to make mistakes .
I did it myself on Logies night , and I 've been dreading being quoted ever since .
So I thought I 'd out myself before anyone else does .
It happened when Don Lane 's son PJ was on stage commemorating his dad .
Much of his act consisted of a fax purportedly sent by the great man from heaven .
It was excruciating .
Joke after joke fell flat .
Some of it was downright tasteless , like the stuff about Carl Williams 's recent arrival ( in heaven !
What was St Peter thinking ? )
But I 'd not been paying attention when PJ was introduced , and my grasp of popular culture is n't what it should be .
I was under the impression that , like many Americans , Don had named his son after himself .
I thought he was called ' Don Lane Jr ' .
So I tweeted : ' Don Lane Jr. Oh dear !
Don Lame '
I meant , of course , that the tribute by the son , not the life and work of his father , was lame .
But it would n't have read like that to many Twitter users .
And there was another thing I did n't know .
Whether because Nine agreed with my assessment , or because they were desperately trying to get the show down to some sort of bearable length , Don Lane 's putative fax from heaven was n't included in the program that went to air .
So no - one watching the show at home would have known what on Earth I was on about .
It was the only negative tweet I sent that evening .
I did n't give the game away by tweeting winners .
I did n't tweet much at all , if truth be told .
But I could so easily have ended up being pilloried alongside Deveny and Anderson .
As it was , the worst thing I copped was a return tweet from someone called @ BazzaBC , a person of indeterminate gender whose profile simply reads " Pig. Philosopher .
Drunk . "
BazzaBC 's tweet read : " @jonaholmesMW
I did n't pick you as being such an old bitch . "
Fair enough .
If my tweet had been picked up by the MSM ( mainstream media , in case you 're not into the blogosphere ) I too would have pleaded I 'd been taken out of context .
But really , I would n't have had much of a leg to stand on .
But then , I was using an ' ABC Twitter account ' .
The ABC's Editorial Policies apply .
Wil Anderson was n't , any more than Catherine Deveny was tweeting for The Age .
Wil will be back on the ABC in June , presenting The Gruen Transfer series 3 .
Tasteless though her tweets undoubtedly were , I 'm one of those who think The Age has done itself no favours by sacking Catherine Deveny for being who she is .
Jonathan Holmes is the presenter of ABC TV's Media Watch .
MIAMI — In very rough terms , the sun 's activity ebbs and flows in an 11 - year cycle , with flares , coronal mass ejections and other energetic phenomena peaking at what is called solar maximum and bottoming out at solar minimum .
Sunspots , markers of magnetic activity on the sun 's surface , provide a visual proxy to mark the cycle 's evolution , appearing in droves at maximum and all but disappearing at minimum .
But the behavior of our host star is not as predictable as all that — the most recent solar minimum was surprisingly deep and long , finally bottoming out around late 2008 or so .
Solar physicists here at the semiannual meeting of the American Astronomical Society this week offered a number of mechanisms to shed light on what has been happening on the sun of late , but conceded that the final answer — or more likely answers — remains opaque .
Beyond scientific understanding , motivations for better solar weather forecasts include hopes to use them to safeguard against electrical grid disruptions , damage to Earth - orbiting satellites and threats to the health of space travelers posed by solar radiation flare - ups .
One researcher has looked for clues to solar weather in the meridional flow , which moves from the solar equator toward the poles , and which seems to change speed during the shifting solar cycle .
Another looked at the solar " jet stream , " a slow current that originates at solar mid-latitudes and pushes in a bifurcated stream toward both the equator and the poles .
Another scientist examined the inner workings of the sun through the oscillation of sound waves propagating through the solar interior ; yet another looked at magnetic maps to chart the shifting flux across the sun .
" I think we 're almost in violent agreement that this is an interesting minimum , " said David Hathaway of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala .
By several measures — geomagnetic activity , weakness of polar magnetic fields , flagging solar deflection of galactic cosmic rays — the minimum was the deepest on record , Hathaway said , although some of those records contain just a few cycles .
Hathaway focused on shifting speeds of the meridional flow , finding that the flow was anomalously fast at the most recent minimum .
But , speaking of heliophysics forecasting techniques in general , he cautioned against leaping to any conclusions based on small - number statistics .
" We need to be careful about extending what we 've seen in one or two cycles to all of them , " he said .
Frank Hill of the National Solar Observatory ( NSO ) instead examined the jet stream , a periodic east–west flow of material that corresponds with the onset and end of the solar cycle .
With helioseismology data , which track acoustic oscillations on the sun , researchers can check in on the progress of the jet stream at depths of roughly 1,000 kilometers , potentially allowing for better forecasts of the timing of the solar cycle .
But it is " still too early to tell " if the jet stream can robustly predict solar activity , Hill acknowledged , noting that the stream could be a cause or an effect of the cycle .
Hill 's NSO colleague Sushanta Tripathy also turned to helioseismology to investigate the recent solar minimum , finding that in acoustic oscillations deep within the sun there were in fact two separate minima — one in late 2007 that did not correspond to the sunspot minimum , and one around late 2008 that did .
In prior data , from 1995 to 2007 , the frequency shifts in the oscillations had matched up well with the sunspot counts .
And at shallower depths within the sun , the seismic and sunspot activity were in phase for the most recent solar minimum as well .
All in all , the cycle was definitely unusual , Tripathy said .
Julia Saba of SP Systems , Inc. , and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , had yet another approach , turning to magnetic maps to track regional differences on the sun .
Her approach accurately forecast the timing of the 2008 solar minimum 18 months in advance , she said , but acknowledged that the forecast had been revised from an earlier prediction .
Based on current data , Saba said , the next solar cycle looks like it will be weak and prolonged .
But that could all change — her predictions assume " that the sun does n't change on us again . "
After hearing his colleagues ' various approaches to investigating the sun 's behavior , Hill took stock of a field with many open questions .
" My main impression of all this is I 'm gratified to see that we all agree that this is an interesting minimum , " Hill said .
" What 's not so gratifying is we have no clue why any of these effects are happening . "

2010 May 17
PRINCETON , NJ - Americans ' support for the moral acceptability of gay and lesbian relations crossed the symbolic 50 % threshold in 2010 .
At the same time , the percentage calling these relations " morally wrong " dropped to 43 % , the lowest in Gallup 's decade - long trend .
Gallup 's annual Values and Beliefs survey , conducted each May , documents a gradual increase in public acceptance of gay relations since about 2006 .
However , the change is seen almost exclusively among men , and particularly men younger than 50 .
Additionally , Gallup finds greater movement toward acceptance among independents and Democrats than among Republicans , and a big jump in acceptance among moderates .
Liberals were already widely accepting of gay relations in 2006 , and have remained that way , while conservatives ' acceptance continues to run low .
Notably , there has been a 16 - point jump in acceptance among Catholics , nearly three times the increase seen among Protestants .
Acceptance among Americans with no religious identity has expanded as well .
The same May 3 - 6 Gallup poll finds the slight majority of Americans still against legalizing gay marriage ; however , at 53 % , the extent of that opposition is down slightly this year .
Acceptance for the legality of gay and lesbian relations has varied over the past decade , but , at 58 % today , it is near the highest Gallup has measured ( 60 % in 2003 ) .
Americans remain closely divided over the factors contributing to being gay .
Currently , 37 % say being gay is due to upbringing and environment while 36 % say it is a trait one is born with .
The division on this question has been the norm for most of the past decade , although the plurality response has fluctuated .
Longer term , however , there has been a major change in Americans ' views on this question , with far fewer today than in the 1970s and 1980s believing that being gay or lesbian is the result of upbringing and other life experiences .
Bottom Line
There is a gradual cultural shift under way in Americans ' views toward gay individuals and gay rights .
While public attitudes have n't moved consistently in gays ' and lesbians ' favor every year , the general trend is clearly in that direction .
This year , the shift is apparent in a record - high level of the public seeing gay and lesbian relations as morally acceptable .
Meanwhile , support for legalizing gay marriage , and for the legality of gay and lesbian relations more generally , is near record highs .
A new clickjacking worm is spreading through Facebook via the " Like " feature .
The attack , which is said to have hit hundreds of thousands of users , uses a combination of social engineering and clickjacking to make it appear as if a user has " liked " a link .
The messages that are being used in the link text include , " LOL This girl gets OWNED after a POLICE OFFICER reads her STATUS MESSAGE , " " This man takes a picture of himself EVERYDAY for 8 YEARS !! , " " The Prom Dress That Got This Girl Suspended From School " and " This Girl Has An Interesting Way Of Eating A Banana , Check It Out ! "
When a user clicks on the text that appears to be " liked " he is taken to a blank page that just has the text , " Click here to continue . "
Clicking anywhere on that page will then publish the same message to that users Facebook page .
This vector is extremely similar to the Fbhole worm that spread across Facebook 10 days ago .
Because users unwittingly end up recommending the offending page to their social graph , this is the type of worm that can spread extremely quickly .

Fox has been dropped from Transformers 3 by Paramount studios after her outspoken comments about the franchise .
Variety reports that Transformers director Michael Bay wanted to take the story in a “ different direction ” and a new actress to play Shia LaBeouf 's love interest , sources familiar with the production said .
Fox played the role of Mikaela Banes in the first Transformers film released in 2007 and reprised her role in the 2009 film Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen .
Picture gallery : Screen star Megan Fox
The decision to dump her from the role comes after Fox ’s outspoken criticism about the Transformer franchise .
She raised eyebrows when she compared director Bay to Hitler and Napoleon during an interview in the UK - published Wonderland Magazine last year .
And in an interview with Entertainment Weekly , Fox said Transformers was n't " trying to be the greatest movie on earth ” .
“ It 's not trying to be a Golden Globe - nominated film .
It 's a badass popcorn summer movie , ” she said at the time .
It is not clear whether Fox ’s departure from the franchise will damage the project .
Transformers is reported to be one of Paramount Studio 's most lucrative projects .
The first film grossed close to $ US710 million worldwide , while the second film in the series earned $ US836 million .

CANNABIS CULTURE –
The order to extradite marijuana activist Marc Emery to the United States for an expected five - year prison term has been signed by the Canadian Minister of Justice , Rob Nicholson .
CLICK HERE for more information about how to HELP MARC EMERY !
Cannabis Culture has learned that Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Conservative Party of Canada made their decision shortly after Emery turned himself in to Canadian authorities this morning : The Prince of Pot will be handed over to the United States for selling marijuana seeds over the Internet .

More info added daily !
“ I am absolutely devastated that this Conservative government has opted to send my husband , a Canadian citizen , to the United States for a ‘ crime ’ that amounts to a $ 200 dollar fine in Canada , ” said Marc ’s wife Jodie Emery .
“ This case is about silencing my Husband for his marijuana activism .
This Conservative government has declared a culture war in Canada and my husband is it ’s latest victim . ”
Marc spoke to reporters outside of the downtown Vancouver Law Courts before turning himself in , and said orders to extradite him would be the equivalent of outsourcing our justice system .
He said he hopes some good comes from his imprisonment .
“ If he sends me away , it will anger millions of Americans and millions of Canadians , ” he told the press .
“ I need them to be angry , otherwise we wo n’t get any change on this drug war . ”
Marc ’s lawyer and fellow marijuana activist Kirk Tousaw told Cannabis Culture that in all likelihood , Marc would be sent south across the border by the end of the week where he will eventually appear before a sentencing judge .
Marc is expected to be sentenced to five years as part of a plea deal arranged with American prosecutors .
Opting to wait until Marc was in custody on a bail technicality , Nicholson sent the order to Marc ’s lawyers shortly after he entered custody .
Marc had expected to be out on bail again today as the Justice Minister was expected to request another extension on the controversial move .
Marc ’s case started in 2005 when American Authorities raided his Vancouver store and offices with the help of the Vancouver Police Department .
Marc , whose business sold marijuana seeds to “ Overgrow the Government ” donated all the proceeds of his business to various activism groups working to legalize marijuana and medical marijuana .
“ Today ’s decision is another step in Canada ’s adoption of the failed and harmful drug war approach that , ironically , the American government is moving away from , ” said Tousaw .
“ Canadians are deeply opposed to this extradition and the outsourcing of Canadian criminal justice policy .
This unpopular decision is sure to hurt the Conservative government at the ballot box in the next election .
Mr. Emery is resolute and told me , from his jail cell , to never give up the fight for cannabis freedom . ”

‘ Prince of Pot ’ will be extradited , lawyer says
by The Globe and Mail
Marc Emery ’s lawyer says the self - described “ Prince of Pot ” has been ordered extradited to the United States .
Kirk Tousaw says he received word from the federal justice department shortly after the long time marijuana advocate turned himself into custody today that the minister has decided to sign off on his extradition .
Mr. Emery has been out on bail since last fall , when he was released from custody as the minister made the final decision in his case .
He made a plea deal with U.S. prosecutors last year , agreeing to plead guilty in connection to his Vancouver - based seed - selling business in return for a sentence of five years in prison .
It ’s not clear when Mr. Emery will be sent to the U.S. , but Mr. Tousaw says he expects it will happen within the week .
Mr. Emery says he ’s instructed his supporters to hound MPs in the Conservative government and ensure they pay a political price for the decision .
Calling himself a “ great Canadian ” who has spent his life advocating for the legalization of marijuana , Mr. Emery turned himself in Monday morning to face possible extradition to the United States .
“ I think of myself as a great Canadian – I ’ve worked my whole life for individual freedom in this country , I ’ve never asked for anything in return , ” Mr. Emery told reporters outside B.C. Supreme Court in downtown Vancouver , with his wife by his side and a throng of supporters carrying “ Free Marc ” signs .
“ And now I will be possibly handed over to the United States for a five - year sentence for the so - called crime of selling seeds from my desk .
I ’m proud of what I ’ve done , and I have no regrets . ”
Mr. Emery has been out on bail since last fall , when he was released from custody as the federal justice minister made a decision on whether to extradite him .
Justice Minister Rob Nicholson must decide whether to turn Mr. Emery over to American authorities , keep him in Canada , or again request more time to make his final decision .
The minister was not immediately available for comment .
Mr. Emery has been eligible for extradition since early January .
Mr. Emery made a plea deal with U.S. prosecutors last year , agreeing to plead guilty in connection to his Vancouver - based seed - selling business in return for a sentence of five years in prison .
American prosecutors allege through Mr. Emery ’s magazine and website he has sold about four million marijuana seeds and that 75 per cent of those went to customers in the United States .
Documents obtained by Mr. Emery ’s lawyer revealed that a U.S. undercover agent posing as a marijuana seed buyer worked in Canada to secure the criminal charges against Mr. Emery south of the border .
The U.S. undercover operation is described in a briefing memo to Justice Minister Rob Nicholson dated Feb. 10 , 2010 , which outlines the case against Mr. Emery .
The memo said numerous mail order purchases were made by U.S. undercover agents between March 2004 and March 2005 and an undercover U.S. Drug Enforcement agent was then sent to Vancouver .
The memo said the agent was under the supervision and working with the approval of Vancouver ’s police department .
Allegations against Mr. Emery include that staff at his Cannabis Culture store in Vancouver counselled the agent on how to smuggle seeds across the border and how to grow the marijuana .
“ It is alleged that [ the store employee ] told agent Mendez that border inspectors do not conduct strip searches of females , so she should hide the seeds somewhere on her body , ” the memo stated .
The documents say the DEA agent made several deals to purchase marijuana seeds in exchange for cash and that Mr. Emery knew she was going to smuggle the seeds over the border .
The information was obtained under the federal Access to Information Act by Kirk Tousaw , a lawyer and former Marijuana Party campaign manager .
In addition to his seed - selling business and marijuana paraphernalia store , Mr. Emery is the president of the B.C. Marijuana Party .
He was originally charged with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute marijuana and money laundering .
Two of his Cannabis Culture employees were also accused , but charges were dropped as part of the plea agreement .
The minister ’s memo states the federal government has received more than 2,700 letters about Emery and virtually all of them ask that Mr. Nicholson refuse to extradite him .
Mr. Emery said he has public support on his side .
“ I feel it will be very politically unpopular if [ the minister ] proceeds with the extradition because , let ’s say five to seven million Canadian ’s use marijuana …
I have the support of hundreds of thousands , possibly millions of Canadians . ”
If he is extradited to the United States , Mr. Emery hopes he ’ll be allowed to return to Canada to serve out his jail sentence .

Canada ’s ‘ Prince of Pot ’ ordered extradited to US
by Jeremy Hainsworth , Associated Press
VANCOUVER , British Columbia —
The lawyer for Canada ’s so - called Prince of Pot said Monday that his client has been ordered extradited to the United States .
Marc Emery has sold millions of marijuana seeds around the world by mail over the past decade , drawing the attention of U.S. drug officials , who want him extradited to Seattle .
Emery ’s lawyer , Kirk Tousaw , said Canada ’s Minister of Justice Rob Nicholson signed off on his extradition shortly after the marijuana advocate turned himself in on Monday to authorities .
The justice minister ’s spokeswoman , Carole Saindon , would not comment on the order or the timing of his surrender , saying only that Emery has the option of a court appeal of the order .
The department said Emery ’s extradition was sought on charges of conspiracy to manufacture marijuana , conspiracy to distribute marijuana and conspiracy to engage in money laundering .
Emery reached a plea deal with U.S. prosecutors last year , agreeing to plead guilty to conspiracy to manufacture marijuana in return for a sentence of five years in prison .
The charges are in connection with his Vancouver , British Columbia - based seed - selling business .
Emery ’s wife , Jodie Emery , said she was appalled that the Canadian justice minister would order the extradition .
“ It ’s the worst option .
We did n’t even entertain it as an option , ” she said .
“ I ’m just stunned . ”
She accused Nicholson of wanting “ to silence the most vocal opponent of the drug war . ”
Marc Emery has long maintained that the prosecution was politically motivated in the U.S. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has repeatedly denied that .
Emery has been out on bail since Nov. 17 , when he was released from custody as the minister made the final decision in his case .
Keith Stroup , founder of the Washington , D.C. - based National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana laws , said Emery has been open about his activities in Canada for years .
“ The Canadian authorities have not seen fit to treat him as a criminal , ” Stroup said .
“ Why in the world they would want to send him to the United States , I do n’t understand . ”
Stroup said putting Emery in jail will galvanize the marijuana movement and turn him into “ more of a hero and an icon . ”
Jodie Emery said supporters will begin lobbying to have Emery serve his time in a Canadian prison as others have been allowed to do .
It is not clear when Emery will be sent to the U.S. Tousaw said he expects it will happen within the week .

Extradition order issued for pot activist Emery
by CBC News
CLICK HERE TO WATCH VIDEOS of Jodie Emery and Kirk Tousaw talking about Marc ’s extradition
Vancouver ’s so - called Prince of Pot will be turned over to U.S. authorities to face drug charges five years after he was first arrested for selling marijuana seeds to U.S. residents , his wife and lawyer have confirmed .
Marc Emery , 51 , turned himself in to authorities at B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver on Monday after his bail , granted in November , expired .
His wife , Jodie , told CBC News she has learned that federal Justice Minister Robert Nicholson has signed an order clearing the way for Emery to be extradited to the U.S .
Emery ’s lawyer , Kirk Tousaw , said as part of a plea bargain deal , Emery will not appeal the extradition order and will likely be transferred to Seattle within a week .
Busted in Canada for breaking U.S. laws
Emery was arrested in 2005 — following an investigation by Canadian and U.S. police — for allegedly selling marijuana seeds over the internet from Vancouver to residents of the U.S .
He made an agreement with U.S. prosecutors last year that he would plead guilty to one charge of drug distribution in exchange for a five - year sentence .
Under the terms of the deal , Emery is expecting return to Canada to serve his sentence , said Tousaw .
The marijuana advocate surrendered for extradition last September but was later freed on bail in November , because Nicholson had not yet signed the order .
Before turning himself in on Monday , Emery told CBC News he was hopeful that Nicholson would decide to stay his extradition after he turned himself in .
Emery has said previously that he made the plea agreement with U.S. prosecutors so that his two co-accused — Michelle Rainey and Greg Williams — would each be given two years ’ probation and to avoid a criminal trial that could result in a prison sentence of up to 50 years .
Meanwhile , The Canadian Press is reporting that a briefing memo to Canada ’s justice minister said a U.S. drug enforcement agent worked in Canada to secure U.S. criminal charges against Marc Emery .
The memo also said thousands of letters have been sent to government urging the minister not to extradite the pot advocate .
Emery said he is n’t surprised by the support because millions of people oppose the idea of Canada bending to American will .

Canada ’s ‘ Prince of Pot ’ turns himself in for US extradition
by AFP
VANCOUVER , Canada — Canada ’s self - styled “ Prince of Pot ” rallied supporters on Monday before turning himself in to Canadian authorities to be extradited to the United States to face a five - year jail term .
Marc Emery , 52 , is alleged by US prosecutors to have sold more than four million marijuana seeds through the mail via his website .
About 75 percent of the seeds went to US customers .
His wife Jodie Emery told AFP her husband expected to be extradited within “ days or a week ” after exhausting all legal challenges and an appeal for clemency to Canada ’s justice minister .
“ It ? s absolutely devastating to think that I might not see my husband for five years , ” she said .
“ It ? s a harsh reality . ”
The couple are still holding out hope that Emery may be allowed to serve his sentence in a Canadian jail to be near his family , if Canada ’s Public Safety Minister Vic Toews consents .
“ We hope to have him transferred here , ” she said .
Meantime , “ I am going to keep busy by running our store and our website online , keeping the cause alive , rallying to bring him back home to Canada . ”
Speaking outside the British Columbia Supreme Court before turning himself in , Marc Emery touted his activism to legalize marijuana as “ the work of a great Canadian . ”
As well , he downplayed his “ so - called crime of selling seeds from my desk here in downtown Vancouver to consenting adults all over the world and in the United States . ”
Marc Emery , who is the publisher of “ Cannabis Culture ” magazine and president of the British Columbia Marijuana Party , claimed Canada has five million to seven million pot smokers and he asked them to join his fight for freedom .
“ I ’m proud of what I have done and have no regrets , ” he said , flanked by two dozen of his supporters and claiming to have millions more in Canada and the United States .
“ I have told my supporters every Conservative member of Parliament ( from the ruling party ) should be hounded endlessly , unrelentingly and unmercifully until they are defeated in the next or following election .
“ It ’s to be a life project for them , ” he said .
“ As long as I am incarcerated in the US or Canada they are not to give the members of Parliament any peace in my regards . ”
Emery ’s troubles started in 2005 when Vancouver police simultaneously raided his store and party headquarters at the request of the US Drug Enforcement Administration .
The DEA claimed his operation generated nearly five million US dollars in profits annually and charged him and two co-defendants on three counts of conspiracy to distribute marijuana , marijuana seeds and money laundering .
No charges have ever been pursued in Canada .

Canada ’s ‘ Prince of Pot ’ to be extradited to U.S .
by The Montreal Gazette
VANCOUVER – Canada ’s so - called Prince of Pot was ordered extradited Monday to face drug and money - laundering charges in the United States .
Marijuana entrepreneur and activist Marc Emery surrendered to authorities , leaving reporters and assembled friends with the words : “ Go Canucks Go . ”
Jodie Emery , a Green party candidate , said she was concerned for her husband ’s future in a U.S. prison where he expects to spend at least five years for crimes associated with his marijuana seed - selling business .
The B.C. Court of Appeal said in 2008 that the appropriate sentence for someone convicted of selling marijuana seeds by mail was a month or two in jail , and a year ’s probation .
Canadians are torn on Emery ’s case .
An online survey conducted last year found 46 per cent of respondents agree with extraditing Emery , while 48 per cent disagree .

Canadian extradited to face U.S. charges
by UPI
VANCOUVER , British Columbia , May 10 ( UPI ) —
A Canadian marijuana activist will be extradited to the United States to face sentencing on drug and money - laundering charges , officials say .
Marc Emery of Vancouver , B.C. , Canada ’s self - proclaimed “ Prince of Pot , ” was given a five - year prison sentence last fall after pleading guilty to conspiracy to manufacture marijuana stemming from a mail - order business selling pot seeds from Vancouver to U.S. residents , The ( Vancouver ) Province reported Monday .
Emery , who has been out of jail on bail since November awaiting a decision on the extradition , turned himself in to Canadian authorities Monday .
Emery said he thought Justice Minister Rob Nicholson delayed his decision because extraditing Emery could be seen as a potential political liability for the Conservative government , the newspaper said .
“ I think he would rather say yes if they had a majority government where there would be no repercussions , but we could have an election called in two weeks or even in the fall , ” Emery said .
“ I think there ’s a great deal of shock and disappointment , ” Emery ’s attorney Kirk Tousaw said .
“ It ’s clear to me that this is a deeply unpopular move by the Conservative government . ”
Emery says he hopes to be transferred back to Canada to serve his time .
“ If he sends me away , it will anger millions of Americans and millions of Canadians , ” Emery said of the extradition order .
“ I need them to be angry , otherwise we wo n’t get any change on this drug war . ”

Vancouver MPs voice opposition to Marc Emery ’s extradition
by Stephen Thomson
Two Vancouver MPs are decrying a decision to support the extradition of marijuana activist Marc Emery to the United States .
In 2005 , Emery was arrested as part of a joint Canada - U.S. law enforcement effort on charges that relate to an alleged online marijuana seed - selling business based in Vancouver .
Emery had been out on bail for the past six months from the North Fraser Pretrial Centre .
With the period of his release set to expire , Emery surrendered himself to authorities this morning ( May 10 ) at the Vancouver courts to await a decision on extradition .
Emery ’s wife , Jodie , told the Straight earlier today that she had learned federal justice minister Robert Nicholson approved an extradition order .
The decision has now come under fire from NDP MP Libby Davies and Liberal MP Ujjal Dosanjh .
Both MPs tabled a 12,000 - signature petition earlier this year in the House of Commons that opposed Marc Emery ’s extradition .
“ It ’s about Canadian sovereignty , ” Davies , the MP for Vancouver East , told the Straight .
“ Why would we cart off a Canadian to serve time in America for something he would n’t have been charged with in Canada ?
Now what we ’re left with is trying to press that he at least be allowed to serve his time in Canada . ”
Dosanjh , the MP for Vancouver South , told the Straight that Emery faces a “ disproportionate sentence that he would n’t have received in Canada ” .
“ I believe in that case we as a country should ensure that he ’s at least able to serve his sentence in a Canadian prison , ” Dosanjh said .
“ He ’s not a dangerous offender . ”
The federal department of justice could not be reached for comment .

The Thomas Vermaelen interview : part one
Earlier this year Walter Broeckx approached Arsenal FC with a request for an interview with Thomas Vermaelen , who is not only a compatriot of Walter ’s but also from the same part of the country .
Arsenal were incredibly helpful in arranging the interview , and this interview which was conducted ( naturally ) in Flemish is now on the Arsenal Benelux web site .
Walter very kindly granted Untold the exclusive rights to the interview in English .
For the benefit of those of us unfamiliar with Flemish culture , Flemish football , and the Antwerp area of Belgium the article starts with a brief review by Walter of the region and Vermaelen ’s early career and how this fits into what we know of him at Arsenal .
— — — — — ——
–
Thomas Vermaelen was born on 14 November 1985 in Kapellen .
But he lived in Stabroek when he was a kid with his family ; a little town situated in the shadow of Antwerp , the “ capital ” of Flanders .
Antwerp is one of the biggest harbours in Europe .
If you look from Stabroek in the direction of Antwerp you can see the gigantic harbour facilities and factories that bring work to the region .
Watch Arsenal Live Streams With StreamFootball.tv
He started his football career for Germinal Ekeren , a town near Stabroek and a near neighbour of Antwerp .
Germinal Ekeren then merged with Beerschot and the new team for whom he played was named Germinal Beerschot Antwerpen .
He then went to Ajax and after a short loan spell in RKC , also in Holland , he made it to the first team of Ajax .
He became a captain in the Ajax side and then he joined Arsenal in the summer of 2009 .
From there on the rest of the story is mostly known to us .
The scepticism of many fans that he was too short to play for us changed into admiration after a few weeks .
Yes , he was only 1,81 meter tall ( or short ) but his ability to jump , his attitude and his scoring ability silenced all the early critics .
For his killer look and his goal scoring record he soon got his nickname : The Verminator .
Walter Broeckx :
When you were a kid was it football morning , noon and night from the moment you could walk , or did you get involved in other sports when you were young ?
Thomas Vermaelen :
It was mostly football I must admit .
I used to play with my brother and a nephew of mine .
But I also liked to play table tennis when I was a kid .
WB : Were you one of those kids that when school was finished you threw the satchel in the hallway and took the ball back out ?
TV : No , not really because school was also very important .
WB : According to official data you started playing at Germinal Ekeren in your childhood .
Is this true ?
Have you never played for a local team in Stabroek ?
TV : No I never played for the local team in Stabroek , Germinal Ekeren was my first club .
( Note : Germinal Ekeren was a first division team in those days .
Stabroek is a team in the lowest divisions in football in the Antwerp county )
WB : What position did you start playing in the youth ?
TV : When I started in the youth teams and I always played as a defender .
WB : How old were you when you first knew or thought : Maybe I can become a professional footballer ?
TV : The first time I thought of having the chance of becoming a professional player was when Ajax came knocking on the door .
Before that I had never thought about it and was just enjoying my football .
WB : After the merger between Beerschot and Germinal Ekeren you also played in the youth teams of the merged club .
What did you really think as young kid of the merger ?
TV : I had no problems with that .
I just wanted to play football and whatever the name of the team was I did n’t care at that time .
WB : Are there some trainers you ’ve learned a lot from and have some good memories in your youth ?
TV : I owe a lot to my uncle .
He was very important in the beginning of my career .
And if I have to pick one youth trainer it has to be Danyy Veyt .
( Note : Danny Veyt was a former first division footballer who played 12 games for the Belgium national team .
Veyt was a striker and played for some 10 years in the highest division in Belgium .
After his career he became trainer and in this job he took care of Vermaelen at one point )
WB : How old were you when you went to Ajax ?
What was your reaction and the reaction of your parents , when asked to go to Ajax at that age ?
TV : was 15 at that moment and I wanted to leave home immediately .
I really liked the idea and was very happy with it .
My parents were also happy although naturally they had some reservations at first .
They were a bit more worried than I was .
So they were a bit more cautious , but I think that is normal .
WB : Where did you stay in Amsterdam in the beginning ?
Did you live in a home with some sort of foster parents that took care of you or did you have to stand on your own feet form the start ?
TV : I stayed with a foster family and it was all very well organised by Ajax .
WB : How was the reception at Ajax in the beginning itself ?
Did they throw you in the deep end to see if you could swim ?
TV : The reception I got with Ajax was very good .
They helped me with everything .
They took care of school , and the foster family .
They arranged transport from my home to the training .
They made all the arrangements that were required for me .
I ’m very grateful for that .
WB : How fast did you turn from being an “ Antwerpenaar ” ( an inhabitant of Antwerp ) to a “ Amsterdammer ?
( an inhabitant of Amsterdam )
TV : I have always stayed an Antwerpenaar .
That is what I have been from the start .
But I must admit , I picked up a few things when living in Amsterdam but that is only natural when you live there for a few years like I did .
WB : Your career actually started when you were with Ajax and you went on loan to RKC .
Was that your own choice at that time or was it Ajax that decided for you ?
How was it for you at RKC and how do you feel about it now ?
TV : It was my own choice at that moment to go to RKC .
And it all went well .
I just wanted to play more and I did play more there than I ever could play at Ajax at that moment .
I learned a lot that year it was a very good choice .
WB : Once back at Ajax then your real career started .
Which trainer are you the most grateful of at Ajax ?
TV : Koeman was the trainer that gave me my first ever chance to play a game for Ajax so I owe him a lot .
But the most important trainer for me when I was with Ajax was Danny Blind .
He really gave me full confidence and backed me to become the player I have become .
( Note : Danny Blind was a former Ajax defender and international for Holland – one of the most popular players from Ajax in the last 20 years who also was manager in the years that Thomas played in Ajax )
WB : Ajax won several competitions .
Of which you have the best memories ?
TV : De Dutch KNVB cup wins against AZ and PSV are the most memorable things off course .
Those are the things that keep coming back when I think of those years .
WB : You were appointed captain at Ajax at a young age and as a foreigner .
What did you think ?
Were you shocked that the trainer chose you ?
TV : For me , it was a very big honour to become captain of a team like Ajax .
But in fact it did not come as a total surprise to me .
I felt the manager had full confidence in me and becoming the captain was just a result of that .

California state pension funds going broke , Stanford study finds
New calculations by Stanford graduate students show that California 's three main public employee pension funds are in more dire financial trouble than previously believed .
L.A. Cicero Students Howard Bornstein and Lisha
Wang spoke with reporters after a news conference where they and the other members of their research group announced their findings about the state retirement system .
California public employee pension systems are worse off than anyone previously projected , according to a new report generated by five graduate students in Stanford 's graduate Public Policy Program .
The result could be greater pressure on the state budget and a shortage of pension funds in the future .
" This is a really dire situation , " graduate student Howard Bornstein said today at a press conference at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research ( SIEPR ) , which is publishing the students ' findings .
" If we do n't do something now , we 're going to have major issues in just a few years . "
Bornstein and his fellow graduate students examined public records of past performance of three pension funds – the California Public Employees ' Retirement System ( CalPERS ) , the California State Teachers ' Retirement System ( CalSTRS ) and the University of California Retirement System ( UCRS ) , which together administer pensions for approximately 2.6 million Californians .
The students ran computer simulations to predict the unfunded liabilities of the pension funds over the next 16 years .
Major investment needed
" The simulation shows that the state would need to invest more than $ 200 billion , and possibly as much as $ 350 billion , today to return the fund to a minimum responsible level of funding , " said Bornstein , who noted that the figure is approximately four times the current state budget .
" It 's an enormous number , " said Joe Nation , a public policy lecturer at SIEPR and the adviser for the research team .
He said it 's important to look at the shortfall relative to state resources .
Pension funds fluctuate with market performance , but state employees are guaranteed a fixed pension regardless .
If the market performs poorly , the state is obligated to step in and provide the missing pension funds .
That takes money away from other public projects , such as education and healthcare , Nation said .
" The students did an amazing job providing a better sense of unfunded liability for those three pension funds , and I hope observers out there will begin to understand that this is a financial train wreck that is not very far down the tracks , " Nation said .
In the report , Bornstein and his fellow graduate students suggest policies to fix the shortfall and prevent a similar one in the future .
They propose that the managers of the pension funds project more realistic rates of return , which would indicate higher liabilities in the future .
" The whole approach that the state currently uses is inherently flawed .
They look at averages as opposed to a fan of outcomes , " said Bornstein .
" If you instead look at the range of outcomes in the future , you 'd see there 's over a 60 percent chance of a deficit greater than $ 250 billion for CalPERS alone .
This is something that really scares us . "
The students suggest that the minimum level of caution should be for the pension systems to aim for an 80 percent probability of having at least 80 percent of the funds necessary to cover the pensions .
They also advocate investing more conservatively , taking fewer risks .
" Funds in other parts of the country are in similar situations , and they are beginning to invest in riskier assets , " Nation said .
" That 's exactly the wrong thing to do .
If the market does n't perform well , the taxpayer ends up paying . "
Suggested fixes
The students suggest either reducing pension benefits or moving to a hybrid system in which retirees receive a smaller fixed pension combined with a 401 ( k ) - style plan .
This would relieve some of the burden on the state and give employees more responsibility for their retirement .
Two - thirds of Californians would support such a plan , according to a poll by the Public Policy Institute of California .
" The biggest challenge with this is making sure elected officials understand the severity of the problem , " Nation said .
" It 's a political hot potato and most politicians shy away from the issue because you offend a lot of the constituencies by acknowledging the problem exists . "
But , he said , citizens and institutions are increasingly aware of the situation and are speaking out .
" The University of California is engaged in this debate because they finally understand that as pension fund benefits grow , there will be fewer dollars for higher education , " Nation said .
The report was prepared for the Office of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger as part of the Graduate Practicum in Public Policy , a two - quarter sequence required for master 's degree students in the Public Policy and International Policy Studies programs .
In addition to the masters ’ program in Public Policy , Bornstein will earn his Masters in Business Administration degree this June .
SIEPR conducts research on important economic policy issues facing the United States and other countries .
SIEPR 's goal is to inform policymakers and to influence their decisions with long - term policy solutions .

Image caption Social media and mobile phones were highly valued .
There are positive links between access to technology and feelings of well - being , a study claims .
BCS , the Chartered Institute for IT , analysed the results of a survey of 35,000 people around the world .
Access to communication devices was found to be the most valued .
It found that women in developing countries , and people of both sexes with low incomes or poor education , were most influenced emotionally by their access to technology .
It is partly because women tend to have a more central role in family and other social networks , said researcher Paul Flatters of Trajectory Partnership , which conducted the research on behalf of the BCS .
" Our hypothesis is that women in developing countries benefit more because they are more socially constrained in society , " he added .
" The next phase of our research is to test that . "
Ageless appeal
The study also found that the correlation does not appear to increase with age , despite the efforts of various countries to get their older populations online .
A lot of things that are written about IT are negative .
But we were puzzled by the fact that people are attached to their IT as well - how do you square that circle ?
Paul Flatters
" Whether young or old , we 're all social beings , we all have a need for the things IT access facilitates , " said Mr Flatters .
The research team 's findings contradict the views of psychologists such as Yair Amichai - Hamburger , director of the Research Center for Internet Psychology at the Sammy Ofer School of Communications in Israel .
In an opinion column for New Scientist magazine last year , Mr Amichai - Hamburger wrote that technology had a negative impact on people 's well - being by blurring professional and personal time .
" We need ways to help recover those increasingly large parts of our lives that we have ceded to technology , to regain mastery over technology and learn to use it in a healthy and positive way , " he said .
The results of the BCS study are " slightly counter - intuitive , " admitted Mr Flatters .
" A lot of things that are written about IT are negative , " he said .
" But we were puzzled by the fact that people are attached to their IT as well - how do you square that circle ? "
Ownership of technology is a status symbol in many cultures , according to Kathi Kitner , senior research scientist at Intel .
While having a computer is considered synonymous with a good education worldwide , the emerging middle classes of India think it is also a sign of prosperity , she said .
" Whether that prosperity in terms of monetary returns actually materialises is not documented , but it is very real in terms of perception , " she said .
In Kiplinger 's latest search for top cities , we focused on places that specialize in out - of - the - box thinking .
SEE ALSO:10 Best Value Cities for 2011 " New ideas generate new businesses , " says Kevin Stolarick , our numbers guru , who this year evaluated U.S. cities for growth and growth potential .
Stolarick is research director at the Martin Prosperity Institute , a think tank that studies economic prosperity .
" In the places where innovation works , it really works , " he says .
Advertisement - Article continues below After researching and visiting our 2010 Best Cities , it became clear that the innovation factor has three elements .
Mark Emmert , president of the University of Washington in Seattle , put his finger on two of them : smart people and great ideas .
But we 'd argue that it's the third element -- collaboration -- that really supercharges a city 's economic engine .
When governments , universities and business communities work together , the economic vitality is impressive .
And it 's no coincidence that economic vitality and livability go hand in hand .
Creativity in music , arts and culture , plus neighborhoods and recreational facilities that rank high for " coolness , " attract like - minded professionals who go on to cultivate a region 's business scene .
All of which make our 2010 Best Cities not just great places to live but also great places to start a business or find a job .

OTTAWA — The Conservative government says lobbying by police and victims will not deter its quest to dismantle the long gun registry .
“ We are committed to ending it , ” Transport Minister John Baird said Thursday .
Even so the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police , the Canadian Police Association , the Canadian Association of Police Boards joined to urge the government not to get rid of the tool .
“ The knowledge of who possesses firearms helps us to prevent tragic events virtually every day in this country , ” said William Blair , Toronto police chief and president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police .
Charles Momy , president of the police association , said if the registry “ can prevent one person in this country from either committing suicide , from being injured or killed , or that a crime is solved as a result of information obtained by the registry , is n’t that worth it for all Canadians ? ”
Conservative Manitoba MP
Candice
Hoeppner , whose private member ’s bill calls for the registry to be scrapped , said she was n’t buying it .
“ Police , just like Canadians , are divided on the real value and usefulness of the long - gun registry .
Many front - line officers do not support the registry , ” she told a news conference .
She held the news conference with three former Winnipeg SWAT team members who said the registry is all but useless .
Dave Shipman , who retired after 25 years with the force — 16 of them in homicide — said he ’s seen hundreds of killings with a myriad of weapons .
“ Never have I attended a killing when a registry of any of the weapons would have prevented that killing from occurring , ” Shipman said .
The Tories have long opposed the long - gun registry as costly and ineffective .
They say the registry was originally forecast to cost $ 2 million , but that costs ballooned to $ 1 billion or more by last summer .
But the police organizations noted it now only costs $ 4.1 million a year to operate .
Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said Canada must maintain the integrity of the gun registry after attending a service on the steps of Parliament to remember the victims and survivors of the 1989 Montreal ’s École Polytechnique massacre in which 14 women were killed .
That incident was largely responsible for the creation of the long - gun registry .
“ We simply ca n’t understand how a law - and - order party , the Conservatives , do n’t understand the importance of the registry as a matter of public safety , ” said Ignatieff , told reporters .

Transport Minister John Baird said the government has decided to get tough on gun and other crimes , rather than waste more money on the gun registry .
“ That is why we are pursuing an aggressive regime through amendments to the Criminal Code , ” Baird said .

This is the third part in a multi-part series describing a technique to generate formal CSP models of CHP programs by redefining the CHP monad and primitive actions to output the model of the program .
In part 1 we saw the redefinition of the monad and the specification type ; in part 2 we saw how to pretty - print the model , including the parallel composition alphabets .
In this part , we look at choice and IO actions .
In part 1 of this guide , we saw how to define parallel composition .
The specifications for each branch were generated , composed into a Par item , and added to the model .
Choice is not so straightforward , because it can introduce branching execution paths .
Consider this code :
alt [ syncBarrier b >> return Nothing , syncBarrier c >> return ( Just x ) ] >>= maybe p q
The choice does n’t return a single value — it returns one of two , and which value is returned will affect the code coming afterwards .
So we need a different approach from just putting a choice on the front of the sequential execution of the model .
In fact , there is quite a simple solution just by using one of the laws of CHP from the tutorial :
alt [ p , q ] >>= k = alt [ p >>= k , q >>= k]
This rule is usually useful because you can use it to remove the code duplication on the right by transforming to the form on the left .
Here , we will use the rule in the opposite way , to move the binding of the multiple results back into the alt and attach it to each branch .
Choice
The alt :: [ CHP a ] -> CHP a function chooses between several alternatives .
We define it by using the Alt specification item :
alt :: [ CHP a ] -> CHP a alt [ ] = stopSpecT $ return Stop alt ps = altSpecT ps altSpecT :: Monad m => [ CHPSpecT m a ] -> CHPSpecT m a altSpecT ms = CHPSpecT $ \k -> do xfs <- mapM ( flip runSpecT k ) ms return ( error " alt return " , \s -> [ Alt $ map ( ( $ s ) . snd ) xfs ] )
The key aspect of this code is that due to the continuation - passing style of the replacement CHP monad , we have a continuation ( “ k ” in the above code ) that represents all actions that would be taken after the alt .
We pass this as the continuation when we run each of our branches of the alt ( the first line of the do block ) .
The specification - modifying functions from each branch are applied to future specifications , then returned as a specification containing a single Alt item .
This can be depicted as follows :
Note that the eventual return values of all of the branches are discarded .
This is not as bad as first appears , because the result values are only used if this choice is in a parallel composition and its result is needed ( which is surprisingly rare in CHP code ) or if the choice is in a recursive process where the result is needed ( this again is surprisingly rare , and will be dealt with in a future part of the guide ) .
IO Actions
The real CHP monad is really a monad transformer on top of the IO monad , and supports IO actions being lifted into the CHP monad .
An IO action may perform all sorts of actions , but these fall outside the scope of our modelling .
The more significant problem for the modelling is that the IO actions may return a meaningful value ( i.e. one other than a unit return ) .
These values can then be used in the CHP program , and in particular they may be used to branch execution .
If we simply return an error value in these cases , the code will fail .
We can do slightly better than that , to allow partial support for IO actions when modelling .
In the case of an IO computation , we have some code ( the code following the IO computation ) that takes a value ( the return value of the IO computation ) and produces an output based on the value ( the model of the code following the IO computation ) .
This is , in effect , a testing problem , and we can borrow techniques from software testing to solve it .
Haskell has several clever testing libraries : QuickCheck is one of the most well - known , but an even cleverer library is Lazy SmallCheck .
Lazy SmallCheck allows for an efficient search of the input space to a function by starting off with undefined values , and partially defining them as necessary .
Not only can this be efficient , but a particularly nice aspect is that it allows us to know if the search was complete or not .
The Lazy SmallCheck library does n’t actually expose enough of its implementation as it currently stands , so I took it and modified it until I was able to produce a fuzz function :
fuzz :: ( Serial a ) => ( a -> StateT s IO b) -> StateT s IO ( [ b ] , Bool )
This function takes an IO computation that sits inside a state monad transformer ( I needed this , and it was much easier to embed this in the fuzz function than to do it any other way ) .
The input space for this function is searched ( with the stateful side - effects of any successful returns being kept ) and a list of return values ( the models ) is produced .
The boolean parameter indicates whether the search was complete : that is , whether it examined all possible values in the search space ( either by exhaustion of all fully - defined values , or because it explored a complete set of partially defined values ) .
We can use the fuzz function on the continuation passed to the IO computation in order to explore the continuation ’s possible models with different input values to the continuation .
This will give us a collection of models , each of which represents a possible behaviour of the program from this point , based on an event ( the IO action ) that we must treat as unpredictable and out of our control .
In CSP we can join these models together as an external choice between processes that are prefixed with non-synchronising events : that is , events that are not featured anywhere else in the model .
The external choice between such events indicates that the process ’s behaviour will depend on which event is offered by its environment , and that we must assume that any event might be offered ( i.e. any input value might be returned ) .
This code achieves that :
liftIO_CHP :: Serial a => IO a -> CHP a liftIO_CHP _ = CHPSpecT $ \k -> do ( vals , complete ) <- fuzz k unless complete $ liftIO $ putStrLn " Incomplete fuzzing of IO computation " nonces <- replicateM ( length vals ) newEvent let firstLabel = " IO_ " ++ show ( head nonces ) zipWithM_ labelEvent nonces ( map ( firstLabel + + ) suffixes ) modify $ \st -> st { chpIOEvents = Set.union ( Set.fromList nonces ) ( chpIOEvents st ) } return ( error " liftIO return " , \s -> [ Alt $ zipWith (
f -> Sync ( Left n ) : snd f s ) nonces vals ] ) where suffixes = map ( : [ ] ) [ ' A '..' Z ' ] ++ map show [ ( 0 :: Integer ) ..]
As ever , this technique is limited : the search may be incomplete , in which case the model may be incomplete .
We print a message in these cases to warn the user of the problem .
The search will only be incomplete if the return value has a large flat domain ( e.g. integers ) and / or the subsequent computation makes full use of the domain .
If the return value is ignored or if it is not used to make decisions about the control path , the search will be complete ( because the value will never be defined ) .
So if , for example , a String is returned and then passed to a different IO action to write to a file , this will not cause a problem in the modelling because the behaviour in terms of CSP processes is invariant to the return value .
The only time this search above comes into play is when the return value is used to affect the execution path , for example if the process acts differently when the String is empty .
( This is reminiscent of the different between monads and applicative functors : if CHP was only an applicative functor , IO actions could be completely ignored . )
Example
For an example , I will use a simple simulation example with a tick - tock barrier to divide time into time - steps .
The simulation has six site processes wired up in a ring , with each site connected to its neighbours via a pair of barriers , representing incoming and outgoing movements .
A site may be full or empty .
If it is full ( i.e. contains an agent ) , it makes a random choice as to which direction to send the agent in a time - step ( and then ends the time - step ) .
If it is empty , it offers to receive a new agent from either side , or to end the time - step .
Here ’s the diagram ( the star indicates a full site ) and the code :
site :: EnrolledBarrier -> ( EnrolledBarrier , EnrolledBarrier ) -> ( EnrolledBarrier , EnrolledBarrier ) -> Bool -> CHP ( ) site = process " site " $ \bar ( inL , outL ) ( inR , outR ) occupied -> ( if occupied then do should Move <- liftIO_CHP ' " shouldMove " $ getStdRandom random if should Move then do moveLeft <- liftIO_CHP ' " moveLeft " $ getStdRandom random if moveLeft then syncBarrier outL else syncBarrier outR syncBarrier bar return False else syncBarrier bar >> return
True else alt [ syncBarrier inL >> syncBarrier bar >> return True , syncBarrier inR >> syncBarrier bar >> return True , syncBarrier bar >> return False ] ) >>= site bar ( inL , outL ) ( inR , outR ) main :: IO ( ) main = specify True ( runSiteRing [ True , False , False , True , False , False ] ) >>= putStrLn
I ’ve omitted a couple of uninteresting wiring functions .
You can see that I ’m using a version of liftIO_CHP that allows me to supply a label , which helps in reading the model .
The program uses choice , and lifted IO actions to get random boolean values .
It also has a potential deadlock , which we will find using the FDR model - checker .
One problem with this whole technique at the moment is that each site generates a separate model , even though they are all similar enough to be expressed in one model .
So here are the processes that make up the behaviour of the first site — there are similar pairs for the other five sites :
site_2 = ((( IO_shouldMove7A -> tock -> site_2 ) [ ]
( IO_shouldMove7B -> ( ( IO_moveLeft5A -> right_0 -> tock -> site_3 ) [ ]
( IO_moveLeft5B -> left_5 -> tock -> site_3 ) ) ) ) ) site_3 = ( (( right_5 -> tock -> site _2 ) [ ] ( left_0 -> tock -> site _2 ) [ ] ( tock -> site_3 ) ) )
The site _2 process is the full process .
It makes a choice between two events : IO_shouldMove7A and IO_shouldMove7B .
These are the two possible outcomes of asking for a random boolean .
In one case , it synchronises on the tock event and recurses — this must be the won’t - move case .
In the other , it chooses between two other events : IO_moveLeft5A and IO_moveLeft5B .
These are the decisions as to whether to go right or left : it next either synchronises on its right event or its left event , and then becomes site_3 .
The site_3 process is the empty process .
It will agree to synchronise with its neighbours , end the timestep and become the full process — or to just end the timestep and remain the empty process .
There are six such pairs of processes in the model , one for each site in our model .
The only difference between them is the names of the dummy IO events , and the numbers of the right and left events .
They are all wired up in the main process :
main_1= ( ( ( site_2 ) [ |{| left_0 , left_5 , right_0 , right_5 , tock |}| ] ( ( ( site_4 ) [ |{| left_4 , right_4 , tock |}| ] ( ( ( site_6 ) [ |{| left_3 , right_3 , tock |}| ] ( ( ( site_8 ) [ |{| left_2 , right _2 , tock |}| ] ( ( ( site_10 ) [ |{| left_1 , right_1 , tock |}| ] ( site_12 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
We can add a single line at the end of the model : assert main_1 :[ deadlock free ] and feed it to FDR , asking it to produce a trace if it finds a counter - example .
FDR does find a counter - example for our assertion : a trace that ends in deadlock .
Here it is :
IO_shouldMove7B IO_moveLeft5A right_0 IO_shouldMove25A tock IO_shouldMove35B IO_moveLeft33A right_1 IO_shouldMove25B IO_moveLeft23B
We can take this trace ( a chronological list of events that occur ) and relate it to the model .
Here ’s the short form : the agent in the first site moves right , while the agent in the fourth site stays put , and the time - step ends .
Then the agent that is now in the second site moves right , and the agent in the fourth site decides to move left .
At this point , one agent is in the third site ( which is waiting to end the time - step ) and the other is in the fourth site trying to move into the third site .
Deadlock !
There are several ways to solve this problem , but I ’m not really interested in them — the point here was to show that we took a simple example , we generated our model and fed it straight to the proof - checker which gave us a trace that produces deadlock .
Reading the CSP and relating the trace to the model is straightforward , but can be long - winded .
What might be nice in future is to have an option to somehow encode the source location in the event name , to then easily point back to the source and say “ this bit of the source happened , then that bit happened , then deadlock ” .
In the next part of the guide I ’ll show how we can deal with tracking communications when building the model .
I previously posted on how Nokia open - sourced the Symbian mobile operating system and the advantages this will bring to mobile web developers .
Nokia has now released their first mobile device based on the open - source version of Symbian , the Nokia N8 phone .
It is the first version of the software since the Symbian foundation announced that it had made its code open source in February .
The Foundation – which includes Nokia , Motorola and Samsung amongst others – gave away the code to developers for free in the hope that it would help speed up the pace of improvements .
Any organisation or individual can now use and modify it .
The software in the N8 allows the phone to have multi- touch and multi-tasking , meaning more than one application can be open at any one time .
The device will be Nokia ’s flagship smartphone .
It can be plugged into home theatres and supports surround sound as well as high - quality video .
Social networks , such as Twitter and Facebook , can be displayed on the home screen in a single application .
Lee Williams , executive director of the Symbian Foundation , said he was “ stoked ” that Nokia had chosen to use the operating system on its phone .
BBC News article
The school superintendent in Central Falls , R.I. , has moved to fire all 74 teachers at the town ’s only high school , after their union refused to accept her demands .
School chief Frances Gallo had demanded that teachers agree to a “ transformation plan ” that included lengthening the school day , requiring teachers to attend weekly 90 - minute meetings after school , and having them be evaluated by “ third - party ” evaluators .
In addition , Gallo sought to mandate duties teachers say they are already performing on their own initiative : tutoring students before and after school , and eating lunch with students .
The superintendent says these steps are necessary to remedy the school ’s low test scores and graduation rates .
She did not offer the teachers additional pay for most of the added duties .
The Central Falls Teachers Union , part of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers , says it agreed with the transformation concept but objected to the superintendent ’s “ take it or leave it ” approach .
The teachers said they wanted input on the content as well as the compensation for the additional time worked , and raised questions about the outside evaluators .
The superintendent said she will issue termination notices later this month .
The school district ’s Board of Trustees will vote on the firings Feb. 23 .
Gallo said the teachers could reapply for their jobs , but with different job descriptions .
Last month State Education Commissioner Deborah
Gist named the school one of the worst in the state and presented four options .
Gallo’s “ transformation ” plan was one .
The others were : closing the school ; inviting a charter program or company to run the school ; or the “ turnaround ” model : replacing the principal and firing all teachers , rehiring no more than 50 percent .
That ’s the option Gallo has now moved to .
James Parisi , field representative for the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers , called the firings a “ bargaining tactic ” to get the union to agree to the superintendent ’s terms .
In fact , Parisi said , there has been a lot of reform at the school supported by the teachers .
That has helped raise reading scores by 21 percent over the last two years , he noted .
If there are teachers whose performance is below par , that can and should be dealt with , he said , but “ there is no relation between mass firings of teachers and making schools better . ”
Central Falls has charter elementary and middle schools , and Parisi and others believe the moves by Gallo and Grist are a “ prelude ” to turning the high school over to a charter operator .
That is a trend promoted in U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan ’s “ Race to the Top ” program .
“ There ’s a lot of money to be made ” in charter school operations , Parisi commented .
A packed meeting of the trustees last week drew an outpouring of support for the teachers from students and alumni .
Central Falls , a former mill town , is one of the state ’s poorest .
This is the same town that gained notoriety in 2008 over its for - profit immigrant detention center , where an immigrant died after not receiving proper medical .
A New York Times article in December 2008 noted that such prisons , for which the city received $ 2 or $ 3 per inmate , had a special attraction for poverty - stricken communities .
With an influx of immigrants in recent years , the town ’s population is now majority Latino .
Long - term local residents were among those imprisoned in the detention center after being swept up in federal immigration roundups .
Together with a vicious anti-immigrant campaign in Rhode Island , backed by the Republican governor , the raids sowed a climate of fear that affected students at Central Falls High , the Times reported in 2008 .
“ At Central Falls High School , some students stopped coming to class because their families had gone into hiding , said Margie Cruz , a school - home liaison : ‘ The child was born here , the child is legal .
But the family has to hide because the father will be deported .
‘ I ’ve seen students stopped for a traffic violation and the whole family got deported , ’ she added .
‘ Children that were here for years .
I watched them grow up . ' ”
Mass firing of their teachers seems like yet another demoralizing message for these teenagers .

Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan on Monday accused Israel of state terrorism after Israeli marines stormed a Turkish aid ship bound for Gaza .
" This action , totally contrary to the principles of international law , is inhumane state terrorism .
Nobody should think we will keep quiet in the face of this , " Erdogan told reporters from Chile , where he was cutting short an official visit to Latin America to deal with the crisis .

We 're afraid Turkey recalls Israel envoy over flotilla raid
The raid , in which at least 10 pro-Palestinian activists were killed , triggered a diplomatic crisis and plans for an emergency session of the UN Security Council .
European nations , as well as the United Nations and Turkey , voiced outrage at the bloody end to the bid to break Israel 's blockade of the Gaza Strip .
Its navy stopped six ships ferrying 700 people and 10,000 tons of supplies toward the Islamist - run Palestinian enclave .
In Washington , Israel 's powerful friend the United States said only that it regretted the loss of life and was looking into the " tragedy " .

Senior Israeli defense officials said at least 10 civilians died on the Mavi Marmara , a Turkish cruise ship carrying 581 people , after commandos came under fire , including with weapons that the activists had snatched from the boarding party .
Seven of the troops and 20 protesters were injured , the military said .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke with both Netanyahu and Erdogan in an effort to ease tensions .
" We must make every effort to avoid escalation , and therefore everything must be clarified as soon as possible , " she said , adding that the presence of international observers " can assist the investigation " into the raid .
Irish Prime Minister Taoiseach Brian Cowen called for an international inquiry into the Israeli raid , and expressed concern for the 10 of Irish nationals who took part in the sail .
Cowen said he believed Israel ’s blockade of humanitarian assistance to Gaza was illegal under international law .
“ Whilst the Israeli government has withdrawn from Gaza , they remain a de facto occupying force since they decide what gets into Gaza and who gets out of it , ” he told the Irish Times .

I first heard of Edsger W Dijkstra in the context of agile programming .
I was having a discussion regarding agile programming with some friends and explaining Test Driven Development and the concept of first creating tests that can prove show the correctness of the code before writing the code , when a friend mentioned that this sounded a lot like some of the arguments put forward by Prof.
Dijkstra in his Turing award lecture in 1972 .
I found that hard to believe , after all , if this was known in 1972 then why is it only becoming popular now ?
So I started looking up Edsger W Dijkstra and realized that this man was one of the pioneering giants of software programming .
He is the father of structured programming and one of the guiding heads responsible for much of the way we program computers today .
There is a lot written about him all over the place – I shall focus on his Turing award lecture , that was titled “ The Humble Programmer “ .
In this lecture , Prof. Dijkstra puts forth six arguments on the way software programming should be done .
On reading these six arguments I cannot help but feel that this lecture was one of the main inspirations used by the authors of the agile programming movement and design patterns community .
The six arguments put forward in the lecture are as follows –
“ A study of program structure had revealed that programs — even alternative programs for the same task and with the same mathematical content — can differ tremendously in their intellectual manageability .
A number of rules have been discovered , violation of which will either seriously impair or totally destroy the intellectual manageability of the program .
I now suggest that we confine ourselves to the design and implementation of intellectually manageable programs .
The programmer only needs to consider intellectually manageable programs , the alternative alternatives he is choosing from are much , much easier to cope with . ”
“ As soon as we have decided to restrict ourselves to the subject of intellectually manageable programs , we have achieved once and for all a drastic reduction of the solution space to be considered .
This argument is distinct from argument 1 . ” “ If one first asks oneself what the structure of a convincing proof would be and having found this , then construct a program satisfying this proofs requirements , the these correctness concerns turn out to be a very effective heuristic guidance .
By definition this approach is only applicable if restrict ourselves to intellectually manageable programs . ”
“ The only mental tool by which a very finite piece of reasoning can cover a myriad of cases is called an “ abstraction ” .
There are number of patterns of abstraction that play a vital role in the construction of programs .
Knowledge of these patterns of abstraction are essential . ”
“ A programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his own skull ; so he approaches the task of programming in full humility and avoids clever tricks . ”
“ The only solution problems we can solve in a satisfactory manner are those that finally admit a nicely factored solution . ”
When you go through these arguments you see the seeds for the various movements in programming software today –
I really enjoyed reading his lecture – I have the lecture here ( The_Humble_Programmer ) if you want to read it .
He must have been an extremely engaging speaker – a lot of his quotes are available here .
Till next time – Happy Programming !
Update : I have made a couple of corrections based of some of the comments here .
When I wrote that argument 3 is the basis for TDD I meant that in the lecture Dijkstra talks about first finding the structure of a proof and then constructing the program satisfying the proofs requirement .
This is similar to the TDD approach of first writing a test and then writing code that satisfies the test .

The National Science Board , which oversees the National Science Foundation , is tasked with assessing periodically scientific literacy in the US , which manifests as their biennial Science and Engineering Indicators .
In the 2010 edition the NSB made the odd and controversial decision to omit the data regarding belief by Americans in evolution and the Big Bang .
Hiding data is never a good idea .
Science thrives on transparency – better to publish the data with an explanation than just sweep it under the rug .
As usually happens , the data is now going to get far more attention than it otherwise would have .
Perhaps the NSB did this on purpose , to draw attention to the problem .
They would have been exceptionally clever , but I doubt that ’s what happened .
It is much more likely to have been a bone - headed political move .
The stated reason for the omission is that the results reflect religious attitudes more than scientific knowledge .
This is a reasonable inference from the data , but it is not clear how strong each factor is .
Further , the NSB should have just released the data with that discussion – which they actually did quite nicely in that section of the report that was deleted .
Here are parts of the deleted section .
In international comparisons , U.S. scores on two science knowledge questions are considerably lower than those in almost all other countries where the questions have
been asked .
Americans were less likely to answer “ true ” to the following scientific knowledge questions : “ Human beings , as we know them today , developed from earlier species of animals . ”
“ The universe began with a huge explosion . ”
In the United States , 45 % of GSS respondents answered true to the first question in 2008 , similar to other years when the question was asked .
In other countries and in Europe , the comparable figures were higher : 78 % in Japan , 70 % in Europe , 69 % in China , and 64 % in South Korea .
Russia and Turkey were the only countries where less than half of respondents responded correctly ( 44 % and 27 % respectively ) ( Gokhberg and Shuvalova , 2004 ; EC 2005 ) .
Similarly , Americans were less likely than survey respondents in South Korea and Japan to answer the big bang question correctly : one third of Americans answered this question correctly compared with 67 % of South Korean and 63 % of Japanese respondents ( figure 7 - 11 ) .
The 45 % figure is not different than previous years .
The report goes on to discuss , quite nicely , that the way survey questions are phrased greatly affect the outcome .
If the question about evolution , for example , is prefaced with “ according to the theory of evolution ” – then more people will endorse it as true .
This does suggest that more people understand at least the basic concept of evolution than believe in it .
The NSB explanation also does not make sense because this section is labeled “ Public Attitudes and Understanding ” – so why omit data on the premise that it reflects attitudes more than understanding ?
The report is about both – so publish the data and discuss the complex relationship between the two .
In fact , the very complexity they claim they are trying to avoid is exactly what they should be exploring .
They should also endeavor to design a survey in the future that further fleshes out this relationship .
I also think it does a very superficial job of assessing understanding .
Knowing that , according to evolution , species change over time is so basic that it does not really tell us much about the public understanding of evolution .
How about asking about the evidence for evolution , how natural selection works as a mechanism , or how genetics reflects evolutionary history .
Start with the basics , and then see how deep public understanding goes – at least scratch beneath the surface a little bit .
Rather – the federal organization dedicated to promoting science education in this country decided to sweep their most pressing issue under the rug .
Fail !
To be fair , the NSF does much that is good .
A recent editorial in Nature discusses the fact that most people learn most of their science outside the classroom – so - called informal science education .
They also report :
The NSF , to its credit , is funding research into this area , and many others relating to informal learning .
It should continue to do so .
In the meantime , however , education authorities need to recognize the importance of informal science education and do more to promote it — if only as a way to motivate students in the classroom .
I think this is a huge issue that will only increase over time .
You , dear reader , are engaging in informal science education when you read this blog or other science blogs .
Science podcasts are also becoming increasingly popular .
And science programming has long been a part of television programming .
Popular science magazines are still huge , and most are learning to increase their presence on the web .
This is all good .
It also reflects what I have long believed about science education – the most important thing to teach people is how to learn , how to assess and evaluate science information , and to instill them with a desire to do so – an appreciation for the power and beauty of science .
The ultimate goal is to give people a sound theoretical grounding in science and a working fund of scientific knowledge .
But this approach follows the proverb – give someone a fish and you feed them for a day , teach them how to fish and you feed them for life .
So my approach has been to teach people how to fish .
And , in my opinion , that should be the primary goal of formal science education – to create life - long self - learners in science .
As the Nature article points out , as adults many of the issues that are relevant to us now ( genetically modified foods , stem cell research , global climate change ) did not even exist or were minor issues when we were in school .
We need to be preparing students today for the scientific controversies of tomorrow .
Further , our experience with attitudes toward evolution reflects the fact that if we do n’t effectively deal with these issues today they will continue to be problems decades into the future .
I am glad to see that attention is being paid to this issue .
Hopefully this snafu from the NSB will inadvertently draw more attention .

Tags : Human rights
The Rudd Government has decided not to introduce a national Human Rights Act .
Typically conservatives have welcomed the decision while liberals have condemned it .
Both misunderstand that we live in a world that not only restricts freedom ; it is built on unfreedom .
We are denied the freedom to be human in a society where we are forced to sell our labour power to survive .
As Rousseau put it , man is born free but he is everywhere in chains .
Turning Rousseau on his head , those chains are not of the mind but economically determined – under capitalism production is organised for profit and based on wage slavery .
As Marx famously proclaimed in the Communist Manifesto : Workers of the world unite , you have nothing to lose but your chains .
Human rights legislation does not at all challenge the fundamental inhumanity that is capitalism ; it reinforces it .
It is at its best a form of political emancipation , but it is not , and does not deliver , human liberation .
Human Rights
Acts are an expression of systemic differences that reflect capitalist concepts like race , sexuality and gender .
They are not their destroyer .
What human rights laws do is reinforce the idea we need protection from other people when in fact our humanity only finds real expression with and through other people .
Human rights legislation individualises and atomises us in a society where cooperation and community is in fact essential for production to occur .
Human rights are a political mirror of the individual expropriation of value in the context of the socialisation of its production .
It is ordinary working people , in fighting for their basic economic and political rights , who have won real gains .
The right to vote , the overthrow of slavery , the destruction of the idea of women as the property rights of men and home carers , and the decriminalisation of homosexual activity were won through mass struggle , not parliamentary niceties .
And yet these victories , while steps forward , are not real human liberation .
Every few years workers get to vote for labour parties whose principal commitment is to the ruling class .
Women are massively under- represented in the leadership of companies and the public service .
They are paid 17 percent less than men for work of equal value .
Racism is systemic in Australia , with many aborigines for example in the Northern Territory under occupation , and their life span up to 17 years shorter than non-Aboriginal Australians .
The Rudd Labor Government locks up asylum seekers in concentration camps around the country .
Human rights legislation will not change that .
In fact , given the lack of struggle in Australia today , the fight over human rights here is a battle between two wings of the bourgeoisie over how best to embed and reinforce the exploitative relationship between capital and labour – the carrot or the stick .
In Russia , as the Stalinist capitalist class cemented its brutal political power , it introduced the most liberal and freedom friendly Constitution on paper in history .
The reality of the gulags and the show trials gave the lie to emancipation and the concepts of freedom became subservient to the needs of the new Russian ruling class to drive peasants off the land and into the new factories and to expropriate the wealth Russian workers were creating .
The left can support the liberal wing of the bourgeoisie in its push for human rights .
We do so because it opens up the possibility of struggle from below for real human rights .
Our task is to extend and deepen the milksop rights the bourgeoisie might want to grant .
But really the debate is a sideline to the main issue – are there struggles going on in the here and now against the repressive nature of capitalism ?
Yes .
There are campaigns against Labor ’s Northern Territory invasion , against Labor ’s freeze on refugees , against Labor ’s attempts to jail Ark Tribe for attending a lunchtime union meeting , for same sex equality , even occasionally industrial action over wages and jobs .
Marx was once asked ‘ What is ? ’
Struggle was his answer .
That ’s where we on the left should concentrate our forces .
Holy crap .

In Tibetan Buddhist and Indian Hindu / Buddhist traditions , Shambhala is a mythical kingdom hidden somewhere in Inner Asia .
It is mentioned in various ancient texts , including the Kalachakra Tantra and the ancient texts of the Zhang Zhung culture which predated Tibetan Buddhism in western Tibet .
The Bön scriptures speak of a closely related land called Olmolungring .
The concept of Shangri - La , as first described in James Hilton 's 1933 novel Lost Horizon , is claimed to have been inspired by the Shambhala myth .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Beset by questions about Jerusalem ’s future in talks with the Palestinians , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reached for the Bible on Wednesday to stake out the Jewish state ’s contested claim on the city .
Israel 's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu waves after his speech at an assembly for Jerusalem Day at the Merkaz Harav seminary in Jerusalem May 12 , 2010 .
Jerusalem Day , which begins on Tuesday night , marks the anniversary of Israel 's capture of the Arab Eastern part of the city .
Israel annexed East Jerusalem as part of its capital in the 1967 Middle East War in a move not recognized internationally .
REUTERS / Baz Ratner
Netanyahu told a parliamentary session commemorating Israel ’s capture of East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war that “ Jerusalem ” and its alternative Hebrew name “ Zion ” appear 850 times in the Old Testament , Judaism ’s core canon .
“ As to how many times Jerusalem is mentioned in the holy scriptures of other faiths , I recommend you check , ” he said .
Citing such ancestry , Israel calls all of Jerusalem its “ eternal and indivisible ” capital -- a designation not recognized abroad , where many powers support Arab claims to East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state .
The dispute is further inflamed by the fact East Jerusalem houses al - Aqsa mosque , Islam ’s third - holiest shrine , on a plaza that Jews revere as the vestige of two biblical Jewish temples .
Heckled by a lawmaker from Israel ’s Arab minority , Netanyahu offered a lesson in comparative religion from the lectern .
“ Because you asked : Jerusalem is mentioned 142 times in the New Testament , and none of the 16 various Arabic names for Jerusalem is mentioned in the Koran .
But in an expanded interpretation of the Koran from the 12th century , one passage is said to refer to Jerusalem , ” he said .
Responding to Netanyahu ’s citations , Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said : “ I find it very distasteful , this use of religion to incite hatred and fear .
East Jerusalem is an occupied Palestinian town , and East Jerusalem cannot continue to be occupied if there is to be peace . ”
MANY RULERS
Destroyed as a Jewish capital by the Romans in the 1st century AD , Jerusalem was a Christian city under their Byzantine successors before falling to Muslim Arabs in the 7th .
European Crusaders regained it for a century , after which came 700 years of Muslim rule until Britain defeated the Ottoman Turks in 1917 .
As Britain prepared to quit , the United Nations proposed international rule for the city in 1947 as a “ corpus separatum . ”
That proposal was overtaken by fighting that left Israel holding West Jerusalem in 1948 and Jordanian forces in East Jerusalem .
Israel then took the rest in the Six Day War of 1967 .
The city , within boundaries defined by Israel but not recognized internationally , is now home to 750,000 people , two in three of them Jews and the rest mostly Muslim Palestinians .
Netanyahu did not refer in his speech to indirect peace negotiations with the Palestinians that resumed this month after 1 - 1/ 2 years of U.S. trouble - shooting .
Diplomacy has been mired by mutual recrimination , including from Israel over the Palestinian refusal to formally recognize it as a Jewish state .
This has ossified into diehard hostility among Palestinians aligned with Islamist Hamas , while those more inclined toward peacemaking accuse Israel of sabotaging prospects by treating occupied land as a Jewish birthright that can be freely seized .
Netanyahu said Israel would retain control over all of Jerusalem while ensuring freedom of worship at its holy sites .
Such assertions are challenged by Palestinians given that Israel , over the last decade of fighting , has often limited their access to al - Aqsa .
Christians in the adjacent West Bank complain of similar difficulties in reaching Jerusalem churches .
“ There is no undercutting , nor do I intend to undercut , the connection of others to Jerusalem , ” Netanyahu said .
“ But I do confront the attempt to undercut and warp or obfuscate the unique connection that we , the people of Israel , have to the capital of Israel . ”
Adobe Flash : Almost as Open as Microsoft Office
“ Open ” is one of those terms that means a lot of different things to different people .
Most should be able to agree , though , that open - vs. - closed is a continuum — shades of gray , not just black and white .
A light enough shade of gray is “ open ” , dark enough is “ closed ” .
The arguments are over where those thresholds lie .
I , for example , would argue that HTML5 is open , and that Flash is not .
HTML5 is open , to my eyes , because no one vendor defines or controls either its specification or its numerous implementations .
The specification is being written and decided upon by consensus by two standards groups , WHATWG and the W3C .
There are critics of the HTML5 spec , as well as critics of the process used to create it and the power vested in WHATWG editor Ian Hickson .
But you ca n’t please everybody .
The bottom line is that all five of the top web browser makers — Microsoft , Mozilla , Google , Apple , and Opera — agree that HTML5 is an open spec .
There ’s not much you can get those five to agree upon .
Adobe ’s argument that Flash is open largely hinges upon their having published a specification for the SWF file format , and that in May 2008 , Adobe dropped the Macromedia - era licensing restriction forbidding the creation of software to play SWF content .
The existence of this spec certainly makes SWF more open than if the spec did not exist .
But open enough to qualify Flash as an open technology ?
One argument against that would be that even a complete working implementation of everything in Adobe ’s published spec would leave you with a Flash player that does n’t work with much popular Flash content .
As Christina Warren wrote yesterday at Mashable :
While Adobe can argue that elements of Flash ( through its Open Screen Project ) are indeed open source , Flash itself is not an open standard .
While Adobe cites some open source implementations in its “ truth about Flash ” , like Gnash — the open source Flash alternative — those same runtimes cannot achieve parity with the closed - source alternatives because parts of Flash associated with DRM and other content controls are n’t available .
Just ask XBMC users in the UK who ca n’t play BBC iPlayer content anymore .
I believe the same is true for any DRM - protected Flash media , such as Hulu .
It ’s not just that non-Adobe implementations do n’t work , but that they can’t .
But let ’s put that aside .
I often find it a useful technique to concede a point for the sake of argument and see where that leads .
So let ’s concede that Flash is “ open ” because Adobe has published the partial SWF 10 file format spec .
Microsoft published the OOXML file format specs for its Office apps .
And not only did they publish the specs , they submitted them to a widely - respected industry standards organization , and now they ’re ISO standards .
Adobe ’s
Flash specs have never been submitted to a standards body , let alone accepted , thus , anyone who argues that Adobe Flash is open would agree that Microsoft Office is even more open .
Newsman cries : ' I 'm fed up with you telling me what I think '
What is it with Sky News since the election ?
First Kay Burley tells pro-electoral reform protester David Babbs of 38 Degrees he " might as well go home and watch it on Sky News " ( which led to Saturday 's Sack Kay Burley !
Watch the BBC !
episode – live on Sky News ) .
Then today Adam Boulton 's interview with Alastair Campbell on the prospects of a Liberal Democrat - Labour deal without Gordon Brown as PM turned into something of a spectacular bunfight .
In the video you get to see the tone deteriorating through their talk of coalitions to the point 4 mins 30 secs in where Boulton starts jabbing at Campbell : " I 'm fed up with you telling me what I think . "
Host Jeremy Thompson joins in to tell Tony Blair 's former spin doctor he has been " provocative " .
It 's a remarkable and heated piece of footage from a remarkable day in politics .
If you 've not got time for the full 6 mins 20 seconds , these are the final 52 seconds in HD .
There are probably quite a few 24 - hour news reporters who are ready for a break .
Update : A colleague has sent me a link to Campbell and Boulton rowing on election night about the tone of the Sky News election coverage .
Campbell tells Boulton : " Adam , you 're great at giving it , you can't take it . "
Looks like the two already had form .
Extra update :
There 's been a second incident tonight as the Adam Boulton v Alastair Campbell spat continues to trend on Twitter .
This time Labour MP Ben Bradshaw says to Adam Boulton : " I know you feel sore about this [ Bradshaw 's assertion that ' no one won ' the election ] " and a mini repeat of Boulton 's earlier outburst occurs .
Douglas Valentine worked as a researcher for the King family and testified at the trial about suspicions that Dr. King might have been under U.S. government surveillance at the time of the assassination .
On Dec. 8 , a jury in Memphis , Tenn. , deliberated for only three hours before deciding that the long - held official version of Martin Luther King Jr. ’s assassination was wrong .
The jury ’s verdict implicated a retired Memphis businessman and government agencies in a conspiracy to kill the civil rights giant .
Though the trial testimony had received little press attention outside of the Memphis area , the startling outcome drew an immediate rebuttal from defenders of the official finding : that James Earl Ray acted alone or possibly as part of a low - level conspiracy of a few white racists .
Leading newspapers across the country disparaged the December verdict as the product of a flawed conspiracy theory given a one - sided presentation .
The Washington Post even lumped the conspiracy proponents in with those who insist Adolf Hitler was unfairly accused of genocide .
“ The deceit of history , whether it occurs in the context of Holocaust denial or in an effort to rewrite the story of Dr. King ’s death , is a dangerous impulse for which those committed to reasoned debate and truth cannot sit still , ” a Post editorial read .
“ The more quickly and completely this jury ’s discredited verdict is forgotten the better . ” [ WP , Dec. 12 , 1999 ]
For its part , the King family cited the verdict as a way of dealing with its personal grief .
“ We hope to put this behind us and move on with our lives , ” said Dexter King , speaking on behalf of the family .
“ This is a time for reconciliation , healing and closure . ”
But should closure  or forgetfulness  follow a verdict that finds the federal government complicit in a conspiracy to assassinate one of this nation ’s most historic figures ?
Are there indeed legitimate reasons to doubt the official story ?
And how should Americans evaluate this unorthodox trial , its evidence and the verdict ?
Without doubt , the trial in Memphis lacked the neat wrap - up of a Perry Mason drama .
The testimony was sometimes imprecise , dredging up disputed memories more than three decades old .
Some testimony was hearsay ; long depositions by deceased or absent figures were read into the record ; and some witnesses had changed their stories over time amid accusations of profiteering .

There was a messiness that often accompanies complex cases of great notoriety .
The plaintiff ’s case also did not encounter a rigorous challenge from Lewis K. Garrison , the attorney for defendant Loyd Jowers .
Garrison shares the doubts about the official version , and his client , Jowers , has implicated himself in the conspiracy , although insisting his role was tangential .
Some critics compared the trial to a professional wrestling match with the defense putting up only token resistance .
Yet , despite the shortcomings , the trial was the first time that evidence from the King assassination was presented to a jury in a court of law .
The verdict demonstrated that 12 citizens  six blacks and six whites  did not find the notion of a wide - ranging conspiracy to kill King as ludicrous as many commentators did .
The trial suggested , too , that the government erred by neglecting the larger issue of public interest in the mystery of who killed Martin Luther King Jr. Instead the government simply affirmed and reaffirmed James Earl Ray ’s guilty plea for three decades .
Insisting that the evidence pointed clearly toward Ray as the assassin , the government never agreed to vacate Ray ’s guilty plea and allow for a full - scale trial , a possibility that ended when Ray died from liver disease in 1998 .
At that point , the King family judged that a wrongful death suit against Jowers was the last chance for King ’s murder to be considered by a jury .
From the start , the family encountered harsh criticism from many editorial writers who judged the conspiracy allegations nutty .
The King family ’s suspicions , however , derived from one fact that was beyond dispute : that powerful elements of the federal government indeed were out to get Martin Luther King Jr. in the years before his murder .
In particular , FBI director J. Edgar Hoover despised King as a dangerous radical who threatened the national security and needed to be neutralized by almost any means necessary .
After King ’s “ I have a dream speech ” in 1963 , FBI assistant director William Sullivan called King “ the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country . ”
Hoover reacted to King ’s Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 with the comment that King was “ the most notorious liar in the country . ”
The documented record is clear that the FBI and other federal agencies aggressively investigated King as an enemy of the state .
His movements were monitored ; his phones were tapped ; his rooms were bugged ; derogatory information about his personal life was leaked to discredit him ; he was blackmailed about extramarital affairs ; he was sent a message suggesting that he commit suicide .
“ There is only one way out for you , ” the message read .
“ You better take it before your filthy , abnormal , fraudulent self is bared to the nation . ”
These FBI operations escalated as black uprisings burned down parts of American cities and as the nation ’s campuses erupted in protests against the Vietnam War .
To many young Americans , black and white , King was a man of unparalleled stature and extraordinary courage .
He was the leader who could merge the civil rights and anti-war movements .
Increasingly , King saw the two issues as intertwined , as President Lyndon Johnson siphoned off anti-poverty funds to prosecute the costly war in Vietnam .
TDY Valentine , Douglas Best Price : $ 91.18 Buy New $ 157.66 ( as of 01:45 EST - Details )
On April 15 , 1967 , less than a year before his murder , King concluded a speech to an anti-war rally with a call on the Johnson administration to “ stop the bombing . ”
King also began planning a Poor People ’s March on Washington that would put a tent city on the Mall and press the government for a broad redistribution of the nation ’s wealth .
Covert government operations worked to disrupt both the anti-war and civil rights movements by infiltrating them with spies and agents provocateurs .
The FBI 's COINTELPRO sought to neutralize what were called “ black nationalist hate groups , ” counting among its targets King ’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference .
One FBI memo fretted about the possible emergence of a black “ Messiah ” who could “ unify and electrify ” the various black militant groups .
The memo listed King as “ a real contender ” for this leadership role .
With this backdrop came the chaotic events in Memphis in early 1968 as King lent his support to a sanitation workers ’ strike marred by violence .
The government ’s surveillance of King in Memphis  by both federal agents and city police  would rest at the heart of the case more than three decades later .
On April 4 , 1968 , at 6 p.m. , King emerged from his room on the second floor of the Lorraine Motel .
As he leaned over the balcony , King was struck by a single bullet and died .
As word of his death spread , riots exploded in cities across the country .
Fiery smoke billowed from behind the Capitol dome .
Government officials struggled to restore order and police searched for King ’s assassin .
One of those questioned was restaurant owner Loyd Jowers whose Jim ’s Grill was below the rooming house where James Earl Ray had stayed and from where authorities contend the fatal shot was fired .
Jowers told the police he knew nothing about the shooting , but had heard a noise that “ sounded like something that fell in the kitchen . ”
[ The Commercial Appeal , Dec. 9 , 1999 ]
The international manhunt ended at London ’s Heathrow Airport on June 8 , 1968 , when Scotland Yard detained Ray for carrying an illegal firearm .
Ray was extradited back to the United States to stand trial as King ’s lone assassin .
The FBI insisted that it could find no solid evidence indicating that Ray was part of any conspiracy .
But the authorities contended they had a strong case against Ray , including a recovered rifle with Ray ’s fingerprints .
The rifle fired bullets of the same caliber as the one that killed King .
Orders to Kill : The Tr... William F. Pepper Best Price : $ 155.81 Buy New $ 199.00 ( as of 09:54 EST - Details )
While Ray sat in jail , Jowers ’s name popped up again in the case .
On Feb. 10 , 1969 , Betty Spates , a waitress at Jim ’s Grill , implicated Jowers in the assassination .
She said Jowers found a gun behind the caf and may actually have shot King .
Two days later , however , Spates recanted .
[ The Commercial Appeal , Dec. 9 , 1999 ]
On March 10 , 1969 , Ray accepted the advice of his attorney and pleaded guilty .
He was sentenced to 99 years in prison .
Three days later , however , he wrote a letter to the judge asking that his guilty plea be set aside .
He claimed that he was innocent and that his lawyer had misled him into making the plea .
Ray began telling a complex tale in which he was duped by an operative he knew only as “ Raul . ”
Ray claimed that Raul arranged the assassination and set Ray up to take the fall .
Government investigators rejected Raul ’s existence and insisted that Ray was simply spinning a story to escape a long prison term .
The courts rejected Ray ’s request for a trial .
As far as the legal system of Memphis was concerned , the case was closed .
But there did appear to be weaknesses in the prosecution case that might have shown up at trial .
For instance , Charles Stephens , a key witness placing Ray at the scene of the crime , appeared to have been drunk at the time and had offered contradictory accounts of the assailant ’s description , according to a reporter who encountered him after the shooting .
[ For details , see William F. Pepper 's Orders to Kill . ]
Outside the government , other skeptical investigators began to pick at the loose ends of the case .
In 1971 , investigative writer Harold Weisberg published the first dissenting account of the official King case in his book , Frame Up. Weisberg noted problems with the physical evidence , including the FBI ’s failure to match the death slug to the alleged murder weapon .
Questions about the case mounted when the federal government declassified records revealing the intensity of FBI hatred for King .
The combination of factual discrepancies and a possible government motive led some of King ’s friends to suspect a conspiracy .
In 1977 , civil rights leader Ralph Abernathy encouraged lawyer William F. Pepper to meet with Ray and hear out the convict ’s tale .
Pepper said he took on the assignment in part because he had encouraged King to join in publicly criticizing the Vietnam War and felt a sense of responsibility for King ’s fate .
Responding to growing public doubts about the official accounts of the three major assassinations that rocked the nation in the 1960s , Congress also agreed to re-examine the murders of President John F. Kennedy , Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and King .
In congressional testimony , however , Ray came off poorly .
Rep. Louis Stokes , D - Ohio , the chairman of the investigating committee , said Ray ’s performance convinced him that Ray indeed was the assassin and that there was no government role in the murder .
The panel did leave open the possibility that other individuals were involved , but limited the scope of any conspiracy to maybe Ray ’s brothers , Jerry and John , or two St. Louis racists who allegedly put a bounty on King ’s life .
But others on the panel , such as Rep. Walter Fauntroy , D - D.C. , continued to harbor doubts about the congressional findings .
After a decade of on - and - off work on the case , Pepper decided to press ahead .
He agreed to represent Ray and filed a habeas corpus suit on his behalf .
Also , in 1993 , a mock television trial presented the evidence against Ray to a “ jury , ” which returned the convict ’s “ acquittal . ”
Pepper asserted that the government ’s case was so weak that Ray would win a regular trial , too .
Jowers reentered the controversy as well , reversing his initial statement to police in which he denied knowledge of the assassination .
On Dec. 16 , 1993 , in a nationally televised ABC - TV interview , Jowers claimed that a Mafia - connected Memphis produce dealer , Frank C. Liberto , had paid him $ 100,000 to arrange King ’s murder .
But Liberto was then dead and the man named by Jowers as the paid hit - man denied any role in the murder .
[ The Commercial Appeal , Dec. 9 , 1999 ]
In 1995 , Pepper published an account of his investigation in Orders to Kill .
The book contended that the conspirators behind the assassination included elements of the Mafia , the FBI and U.S. Army intelligence .
Pepper located witnesses with new evidence .
John McFerren , a black grocery owner , was quoted as saying that an hour before the assassination , he overheard Liberto order someone over the phone to “ shoot the son of a bitch when he comes on the balcony . ”
But Pepper ’s credibility suffered when he cited anonymous sources in identifying William Eidson as a deceased member of a U.S. Army assassination squad that was present in Memphis on the day King died .
ABC - TV researchers found Eidson to be alive and furious at Pepper ’s insinuations about his alleged role in the King assassination .
Still , the King family  especially King ’s children  grew increasingly interested in the controversy .
On March 27 , 1997 , King ’s younger son , Dexter , sat down with Ray in prison , listened to Ray ’s story and announced his belief that Ray was telling the truth .
In a separate meeting with the King family , Jowers claimed that a police officer shot King from behind Jim ’s Grill .
The officer then handed the smoking rifle to Jowers , the former restaurant owner said .
The authorities in Tennessee , however , continued to rebuff Ray ’s appeals for a trial .
Prosecutors concluded that Jowers ’s story lacked credibility and may have been motivated by greed .
Ray ’s pleas for his day in court finally ended with his death from liver disease .
On Oct. 2 , 1998 , the King family filed a wrongful death suit against Jowers .
The trial opened in November 1999 , attracting scant attention from the national press .
Jowers , 73 , attended only part of the trial and did not testify .
His admissions of complicity were recounted by others who had spoken with him .
Former United Nations ambassador Andrew Young testified that he found Jowers sincere during a four - hour conversation about the assassination .
“ I got the impression this was a man who was very sick [ and who ] wanted to go to confession to get his soul right , ” Young said .
According to Young , Jowers said he had served Memphis police officers and federal agents when they met in Jowers ’s restaurant before the assassination .
Jowers also recounted his story of Mafia money going to a man who delivered a rifle to Jowers ’s caf .
After the assassination , the man , a Memphis police officer , handed the rifle to Jowers through a back door , according to Jowers ’s account .
[ Scripps Howard News Service , Nov. 18 , 1999 ]
A former state judge , Joe Brown , took the stand to challenge the government ’s confidence that Ray ’s rifle was the murder weapon .
During one of Ray ’s earlier court hearings , Brown had ordered new ballistic tests on the gun and the bullet that killed King .
The results had been inconclusive , with the forensics experts unable to rule whether the gun was the murder weapon or was n’t .
In his testimony , however , Brown asserted that the sight on the rifle was so poor that it could n’t have killed King .
The Strength of the Wo ... Douglas Valentine Best Price : $ 16.57 Buy New $ 107.83 ( as of 07:35 EST - Details )
“ This weapon literally could not hit the broadside of a barn , ” Brown said .
But he acknowledged that he had no formal training as a weapons expert .
The jury also heard testimony that federal authorities were monitoring the area around the Lorraine Motel .
Carthel Weeden , a former captain with the Memphis Fire Department , said that on the afternoon of April 4 , 1968 , two men appeared at the fire station across from the motel and showed the credentials of U.S. Army officers .
The men then carried briefcases , which they said held photographic equipment , up to the roof of the station .
Weeden said the men positioned themselves behind a parapet approximately 18 inches high , a position that gave them a clear view of the Lorraine Motel and the rooming house window from which Ray allegedly fired the shot that killed King .
They also would have had a view of the area behind Jim ’s Grill .
But what happened to any possible photographs remains a mystery .
Weeden added that he was never questioned by local or federal authorities .
Former Rep. Fauntroy also testified at the Kings - Jowers trial .
Fauntroy complained that the 1978 congressional inquiry was not as thorough as the public might have thought .
The committee dropped the investigation when funding dried up and left some promising leads unexplored , he told the jury .
“ Had we had [ another ] six months , we may well have gotten to the bottom of everything , ” Fauntroy testified on Nov. 29 .
“ We did n’t have the time to investigate leads we had established but could not follow . …
We asked the Justice Department to follow up … and to see if there was more than just a low - level conspiracy . ”
Other witnesses described a strange withdrawal of police protection from around the motel about an hour before King ’s death .
A group of black homicide detectives , who had served as King ’s bodyguards on previous visits to Memphis , were kept from performing those duties in April 1968 .
In his summation , trying to minimize his client ’s alleged role in the conspiracy , Garrison asked the jury , “ would the owner of a greasy spoon restaurant , and a lone assassin , could they pull away officers from the scene of an assassination ?
Could they put someone up on the top of the fire station ? ”
The cumulative evidence apparently convinced the jury .
After the trial , juror Robert Tucker told a reporter that the 12 jurors agreed that the assassination was too complex for one person to handle .
He noted the testimony about the police guards being removed and Army agents observing King from the firehouse .
“ All of these things added up , ” Tucker said .
[ AP , Dec. 9 , 1999 ]
Even before the trial ended , the media controversy about the case had begun .
Many reporters viewed the conspiracy allegations as half - baked and the defense as offering few challenges to the breathtaking assertions .
The jury , for instance , heard little about the gradual evolution of Jowers ’s story , which began with a flat denial and grew over time with the addition of sometimes - conflicting details .
In a commentary on the case , history writer John McMillian reaffirmed his confidence in Ray ’s guilt and his certainty that the wrongful death suit was “ misguided . ”
But McMillian noted that the King family ’s suspicions about the government ’s actions were grounded in the reality of the FBI ’s campaign to ruin King ’s reputation .
“ While King was alive , he and his family suffered needlessly from slimy government subterfuge , ” McMillian wrote .
Though believing Ray was “ justly punished for being King ’s assassin , u201D McMillian wrote , u201 Cthe FBI has never been held accountable for a much more lengthy , expensive and organized campaign to destroy King . ”
[ The Commercial Appeal , Nov. 26 , 1999 ]
Other critics focused on Pepper .
Court TV analyst Harriet Ryan noted that the King family ’s motivations appeared sincere , but “ the same can not be said for Pepper [ who ] stands to gain from sales of his book . ”
Gerald Posner , author of the conspiracy - debunking book , Killing the Dream , argued that the trial “ bordered on the absurd ” due to a “ lethargic ” defense and a passive judge who allowed “ most everything to come into the record . ”
The Strength of the Pa ... Valentine , Douglas Best Price : $ 7.95 Buy New $ 12.00 ( as of 12:30 EST - Details )
Posner also cited money as the motive behind the case .
He accused Pepper of misleading the King family for personal gain and suggested that the King family went along as part of a scheme to sell the movie rights to film producer Oliver Stone .
Pepper responded that a film project that the King family had discussed with Warner Bros. had fallen through before the civil case was brought .
He noted , too , that the family sought and received only a token jury award of $ 100 .
[ WP , Dec. 18 , 1999 ]
But the back - and - forth quickly muddied whatever new understanding the public might have gained from the trial .
Part of the confusion could be traced to the effectiveness of Posner and other critics in making their case in a wide array of newspapers and on television talk shows .
Some of the blame , however , must fall on Pepper and his flawed investigation that did include some erroneous assertions .
The larger tragedy may be that the serious questions about King ’s assassination have receded even deeper into the historical mist .
As Court TV analyst Ryan noted , “ Whatever theories Garrison and Pepper get into the record … it is not likely they will change the general belief that Ray was responsible . ”
Though Ryan may be right , another perspective came in 1996 when two admirers of Dr. King  the Rev. James M. Lawson Jr. and actor Mike Farrell  wrote a fund - raising letter seeking support for a fuller investigation of the assassination .
They argued that the full story of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination was too important to the country to leave any stone unturned .
They stated :
“ There are buried truths in our history which continue to insist themselves back into the light , perhaps because they hold within them the nearly dead embers of what we were once intended to be as a nation . ”

" Nothing ...
Karma
Karma is a set of patches to access point software to get it to respond to probe requests not just for itself but for any ESSID requested .
This allows the AP to act as a lure to draw in any clients probing for known networks .
The original Karma patches were released by Dino Dia Zovi for Madwifi , I then took over and ported the patches to Madwifi-ng and have now taken them to the new hostapd .
Contrary to some people belief the Karma patches do not get the AP to send out beacons beyond any that it has been configured to in its normal setup as an AP .
This means that when you start it up you should not expect to see a flood of new networks advertised in your client .
The way it works is that most clients have a list of perfered networks , usually most of them set to auto - connect .
When a clients wireless is enabled it works through this list sending out probe requests for each one .
As soon as Karma sees a probe request it says yes , regardless of what ESSID is requested , and the client then tries to associate .
Some clients may continue to probe for other APs with higher preference in their list so may will drop off the first one they associate with in preference of the highest one that Karma responds to .
Most clients , when they try to associate , will check the encryption level offered by the AP , if this does n't match what is expected then the client wo n't associate .
This causes a flapping client , one that connects then disconnects quickly over a short period .
I have however seen some clients just dropping to no encryption if that is what is offered .
If you are testing Karma and clients are n't connecting make sure they have networks in their preferred list and that they are set to auto - connect , just because Windows has a list of preferred APs it does n't mean that it is set to auto - connect to them all .
I get regular bug reports from people saying that Karma is n't doing its job but when they finally check the list they find that no networks are set to auto - connect .
Hostapd
After some prodding from Zero_Chaos I 've finally patched hostapd allowing Atheros users to move away from Madwifi-ng and into ath5k and ath9k .
It should also open the field to users of Prism54 and various other cards but these are yet to be tested .
Below you have a choice of download options , a patch for the version 1.0 source or a pre-patched copy , there is also a sample config file .
To use the pre-patched source simply untar the tarball , change to the hostapd directory and run make .
You can then start the AP with the - dd parameter to get the Karma output messages .
The config file I provide has an ESSID of " FreeInternet " which it is beaconing , this is designed to attract those who are n't probing for any networks but can be drawn in by the offer of a free connection .
The config file is commented up so it should be easy to modify to your own needs .
You can check you are running the patched version of hostapd by checking the version information :
# ./hostapd -v hostapd v1.0 User space daemon for IEEE 802.11 AP management , IEEE 802.1X / WPA / WPA2/ EAP/RADIUS
Authenticator Copyright ( c ) 2002-2012 , Jouni Malinen < j@w1.fi > and contributors Karma patches by Robin Wood - robin@digininja.org
And start it like this :
# ./hostapd -dd ~/hostapd-karma.conf
If you grep out just the KARMA references then you will see something like this after a successful association :
KARMA : Probe Request from 00:c0 : ca:2f:96:50 for SSID ' test '
KARMA : Checking SSID for start of association , pass through test KARMA : Successful association of 00:c0 : ca:2f:96:50
If you want to send all the output directly to a file rather than either to screen or having to pipe it to a file or other app , as of version 1.0 you can now use the -f option to send the output to a file .
The only problem with this is you have to enable the feature at build time .
The patched source , and the patch , both enable this but if you want to check for it look for CONFIG_DEBUG_FILE and make sure it is set to 1 .
One problem I know about with this release is that when the client finally associates only the MAC address is printed , not the ESSID it is associated with .
This is because by this point it is assumed that the association is with the same ESSID as in the config file so the original probed ESSID does n't appear to be stored in any of the available structures .
I 'm working on this and will hopefully find a way to pass it through to here .
hostapd_cli
With the madwifi-ng drivers you could interact with the running driver using the iwpriv command , with Hostapd you get hostapd_cli which I think is a much nicer tool .
I 've extended the default version to add a bunch of new commands to control the Karma additions .
When you start hostapd_cli it searches for an instance of hostapd and connects automatically if it is able :

McGinniss previously wrote a critical expose on Palin and her natural gas pipeline plan for the Conde Nast publication Porfolio last year , and is planning a book about the former Alaska governor and GOP vice presidential candidate .
It 's tentatively titled Sarah Palin 's Year of Living Dangerously and could be on the shelves in the fall of 2011 .

Here he is about 15 feet away on the neighbor 's rented deck overlooking my children 's play area and my kitchen window , " Palin posted on Facebook late Monday , hours after returning from a trip to the Lower 48 and learning of McGinniss ' presence .
" We 're sure to have a doozey to look forward to with this treasure he 's penning .
Wonder what kind of material he 'll gather while overlooking Piper 's bedroom , my little garden , and the family 's swimming hole ? " she wrote .
Neither McGinniss nor his agent were available for comment Tuesday .
However , his publishing house , Broadway Books , released a statement .
It reads , in part : " McGinniss is the author of Going to Extremes , a classic book about Alaska , and his work - in - progress returns him to the 49th state to examine Sarah Palin 's significance as both a political and cultural phenomenon and as an embodiment of the contradictory forces that shaped Alaska as it moved into its second half - century of statehood .
" Well regarded for his in - depth , up - close reporting , Mr. McGinniss will be highly respectful of his subject 's privacy as he investigates her public activities , " the statement says .
Palin has promised to ensure that privacy .
" And you know what they say about ' fences make for good neighbors ' ?
Well , we 'll get started on that tall fence tomorrow , " she wrote on Facebook .

As promised , I ’m now making data dumps of The Right Tool available .
You can download them here .
The data there will be updated daily .
This contains all the statements and languages ( including ones which I ’ve since removed from the site ) , and all rankings of them with an identifier to distinguish users .
It does n’t contain any of the calculated data ( ’ cause there ’s a lot of it .
I may open source some of the calculation code later , but in the meantime ask me if you want to reproduce the results ) .
I ’m releasing all of this under a “ let me know if you do anything cool with it ” license . :-)
Basically , it ’s yours to play with as you see fit , but if anything interesting emerges out of it I really would like to hear about it !
Emacs is well known as an editor , but calling Emacs an editor is like calling the Queen Mary a boat .
The source RPM for Emacs 21.1 is some 20 MB — huge for an editor .
You do n't have to use all of it , but sometimes it 's nice to know it 's there .
Emacs is heavily customizable , which makes it very flexible .
For example , I am writing this article with Emacs and will spell check it with Emacs .
“ Well ” , I hear you saying , “ if it 's good for writing articles , it can't be very good for developing software . ”
That 's where Emacs ' flexibility and customization come in ; you can use it for either or for something completely different .
Want to see a shrink , play Tetris or manipulate dates in the Mayan calendar ?
Emacs .
Emacs ' customization comes in packages , called modes .
Major modes set Emacs up to do a particular sort of thing , such as the C mode to edit C and C++ source or the psgml mode ( www.lysator.liu.se/projects/about_psgml.html) to edit the documentation after you 've written your program .
Minor customizations provide added facilities to major modes .
Show - paren mode shows matching parentheses , and auto - fill mode allows you to enter filled text without explicitly entering line breaks .
Most modes have variables to control their behavior , and you can modify them temporarily or permanently .
Most users store their customizations in ~/.emacs , called the “ dot Emacs ” file .
For the curious , mine is on the Web at w3.trib.com/~ccurley/emacs.init.html .
Others can be found at “ the very unofficial .emacs home ” , www.dotemacs.de.
This article covers GNU Emacs version 21.1 ( www.fsf.org/software/emacs/emacs.html).
XEmacs ( www.xemacs.org) is also available on most Linux distributions and will probably do everything I describe here .
A Brief Program
What I will do to show off Emacs as an integrated development environment ( IDE ) is walk through the development of a short C program and show you how to do it .
We 'll write the infamous Hello World program known and loved by C programmers everywhere .
While this article shows C development , Emacs has support for other languages as well , including C++ , assembly , Scheme , Java , Ada , IDL , Makefiles , Lisp ( including Emacs Lisp , the language in which much of Emacs is written ) and FORTRAN .
And that 's just what comes with Emacs .
Add - on packages abound ; there is even one for Forth .
In addition , you can use Emacs for many other types of files .
When it comes time to document your program , you can use Emacs ' psgml mode to make editing the documentation source much easier .
There are modes for HTML and TeX as well .
Directory Manipulation in Emacs
The first thing we do is use Emacs ' dired mode to create a directory to put the program in .
In dired mode , we type a + , and then enter the name of the directory to create in the minibuffer at the bottom of the editor ( Figure 1 ) .
Press Return and Emacs creates the directory for us .
Figure 1 . Using Emacs ' dired mode to create a directory for the program — we've shrunk the window down to save space in the magazine , but the essentials are there .
The next thing we do is enter that directory , then create the file hello.c with the usual keystrokes for visiting a file , Ctrl - X Ctrl - F .
Type the filename , hello.c , into the minibuffer and press Return .
We now see Emacs ready with a new buffer for our program .
Entering the Source
The first thing any C programmer should do upon opening a new file is enter a comment to say what the file does .
So we press M-; ( M- for meta , or Alt on most PC keyboards ) and get a C++- style comment delimiter and the cursor ready to take our comment .
The reason I get a C++ comment is because I have customized Emacs to put me into C++ mode for C .
You will probably get a C - style comment delimiter , /* */ , with the cursor in the middle ready for you to type in your comment .
If you 'd rather use C++ comments , do M - X C++- mode .
Then we add a timestamp , all defined by Emacs ' timestamp minor mode .
Again , this is something I have customized ; you may not get it to work .
A C program has to have a main function , and so we type it in GNU style : the return type on one line , followed by the function declaration on the next .
Notice as we type away that syntax highlighting takes effect ( Figure 2 ) .
Figure 2 . Entering the function declaration for main in Emacs .
Note the syntax highlighting and also the parentheses matching .
Electric C
Now for one of the really fun things about Emacs : Electric C. Press certain characters , and Emacs takes care of the indentation and the pretty printing for us .
Having completed the function declaration , in a normal editor one would press Return , type a left brace ( { ) , then press Return and Tab .
Not in Emacs ; just type a left brace and Emacs does the rest .
( If it does n't work the first time , undo the brace with Ctrl - _ , then press Ctrl - C Ctrl - A to toggle electrification . )
Now we type in a line of code .
Type in printf , then a space .
Now it 's time for a parenthesis .
While we 're at it , to keep our parentheses balanced , it 's also time for a closed parentheses .
So press M -( , that 's Alt -( on a PC keyboard .
Emacs puts in the pair of parentheses and moves back a character so we can type code inside .
And , we type in " Hello , wolrd .
" , typo and all ( we 'll come back to that ) .
Instead of pressing Return , we enter another electric character , Ctrl - J .
The astute reader has already noticed that we left out a semicolon .
Watch what happens .
Ctrl - J should move us down a line and indent to just below the “ p ” in “ printf ” .
In this case , it does n't .
Emacs assumes that we are continuing from the line above , so it indents further .
Even to a software engineer who has only had his first cup of coffee for the day , this should be an alert that something is wrong .
Yes , indeed , we missed our semicolon .
We undo the Ctrl - J with Ctrl - Shift -- ( that 's Control - Shift - Hyphen ) and type in the semicolon .
Hey !
Semicolons are electric , too !
But notice how Emacs prevented a bug from happening ?
That 's even cooler !
Now , of course , it 's time to enter a right brace in order to end the function main .
Because our electric semicolon indented for us , do we have to backspace back to the left column ?
Nope , just type the right brace .
Compiling and Testing
Now that we have our program written , we save it ( Ctrl - X Ctrl - S ) and run a test compile .
Since this is a single - source file program , we do n't need a make file .
( But there is a make file mode , which I will leave as an exercise for the student . )
Instead , we compile from within Emacs , M - X compile .
This results in a proposed compile command line , in this case the default make - k .
Since we do n't have a make file , we use the down arrow key and write our own compile command : gcc - g -o hello hello .c
The -g option compiles in information for GDB , the GNU Debugger , and the -o option tells the linker that the output file is to be named “ hello ” .
And we get , much to our amazement , a perfect compile ( Figure 3 ) .
Figure 3 . A Successful Compile in Emacs
Now to test it .
Feeling brave — or lucky — we fire up a shell under Emacs with M - X shell and execute the program ( Figure 4 ) .
However , something is n't quite right .
We misspelled “ world ” .
Oops .
Figure 4 . Executing the Program from a Shell inside Emacs
Spell Checking
But rather than just correct that error , we can spell check our comments and strings .
To do that , we go back to the source buffer with Ctrl - X Ctrl - B Return .
Now either use the pull - down menu ( Tools — > Spell - Checking — > Spell - Check Comments ) or do M - X ispell - comments - and - strings ( now is a good time to see the Sidebar on Tab completion ) .
We press the spacebar to bypass IDE and 0 to accept world instead of wolrd ( Figure 5 ) .
Then Ctrl - X Ctrl - X to save our changes .
Figure 5 . Spell Checking Source Code in Emacs
Now that we have that done , it 's time to compile again .
Like Bash , Emacs remembers our command history , so M - X followed by one or more up arrow keys gets us back to the compile command .
Press Return .
Emacs shows us our last compile command line .
It looks good , so press Return again .
Debugging with Emacs Emacs is also a front end for GDB .
To enter GDB mode , do M - X gdb .
Emacs comes up with a proposed command line , “ gdb ” .
We add the name of the executable file to debug , hello , and press Return .
This tosses us into gdb mode , with the gdb prompt ready for action .
We set a breakpoint at the function “ main ” with the gdb command break main .
( Tab completion works here , too . )
Then type run to run the program to our first breakpoint .
GDB shows us the input values to the program .
Emacs , however , has the other window set up to show the source .
As we step through the program , Emacs will indicate the next line to execute with an arrow in the source window .
We can even switch buffers ( Ctrl - X Ctrl - O ) and edit the source as the fancy strikes .
Pressing N executes one statement .
In this case , that statement produces output , which we see in the GDB window .
One more N and GDB informs us that the program exited with a return value of , well , garbage .
We recall that the successful completion of a program should generally return zero .
We should add that to the program .
So we quit GDB and switch to the source - code window .
The cursor is just in front of the final brace of the program .
To add the return code , we enter return ( 0 ) .
We wo n't get very fancy in our show - and - tell .
But for anything more sophisticated than what we do here , you will find a lot of repetition before getting to the interesting part of the program execution .
Therefore , you can prepare an init file for GDB , which is a list of GDB commands that are executed in the order GDB encounters them in the file .
So you can automate anything GDB can do — which is quite a lot .
Compilation Debugging Being in a hurry , we neglected our semicolon and pressed Return instead of Ctrl - J . Try a compile .
Do M- X and the up arrow keys until you have “ compile ” in the minibuffer , then press Return .
The command line is good , so press Return again .
Oops !
We have an error .
To locate the error in the source , we press Ctrl - X ` .
This puts the first error message at the top of the compile output buffer and the cursor at the offending line .
The error is before the brace , so we look at the end of the previous line .
How terrible ; we 've committed the classic newbie programmer 's error and left out the semicolon .
So we press the left arrow key and add the semicolon .
Then we save our work with Ctrl - X Ctrl - S. Emacs ' compilation mode is set up to detect error messages from a great many compilers ( Microsoft Visual C++ , for example ) and not only C compilers .
Emacs also recognizes the output from weblint , an HTML checker .
Notice that the electric semicolon did two things : it indented our line for us , which was nice of it , but it also inserted a line between the “ return ” statement and the closing brace , positioning the cursor ready to add another line .
Well , that is n't what we wanted .
So we undo it with M - Shift --.
Now we override the electric semicolon and insert a semicolon with Ctrl - Q ;.
Pretty Printing
It would be nice to have the program all properly indented , so we use Emacs ' indentation tools .
First we select a region to indent .
To select the entire program , Ctrl - X H. Then we indent with Ctrl - M-\ ( that 's Control meta - backslash ) .
To look at the results , we hide the compilation buffer with Ctrl - X 1 and admire our handiwork ( Figure 6 ) .
That done , we compile once more ( M - X compile Return Return ) .
This time we are successful .
Figure 6 . Pretty Printing with Emacs
Electric Comments and Auto - Fill Mode
Of course , any programmer knows to comment their code copiously .
First , we need a general comment to tell what the program does .
So we enter that in the source file right after the timestamp ( Figure 7 ) .
Start with Emacs ' command to start a comment , M- ; .
Notice as you type that the text simply wraps around ( as indicated by the arrows in the left and right margins ) .
That 's ugly , so we press M - Q to “ fill ” the paragraph .
Notice that the C++ comment delimiters are inserted at the beginning of each line ( Figure 8 ) .
Figure 7 . Entering a Comment ( or Other Text ) into Emacs Figure 8 .
The Same Comment , Now “ Filled ” We can arrange to fill text automatically with M - X auto - fill - mode , but this will fill our C source as well , which is not what we want .
If you like , you can turn auto - fill mode on for comments and off again for source .
You can also comment a line of code .
Put the cursor anywhere on the line , press M-; and continue .
Emacs will put in the comment delimiter at the end of the line and move the cursor to the appropriate place to enter the comment .
That will be the end of the line for C++- style comments , but between the delimiters for C - style comments , /* ... */.
And , do n't forget to spell check your comments with M - X ispell - comments - and - strings .
Version Control with Emacs Emacs has a front end for CVS , RCS or SCCS , called VC .
The first two are free - software version control systems and come with many Linux distributions .
VC is smart enough to figure out which one you are using .
Most VC functions are handled with the key sequence Ctrl - X Ctrl - Q or Ctrl - X V V. Depending on the present state of the file , VC will check it in or out .
If the file has never been added to the version control system , Emacs will determine that and check it in for you .
When you check in a change , Emacs will make a temporary buffer for the change comment , so you have no excuse for ignoring that good programming habit .
This front end works with any document under version control .
For example , the Linux Documentation Project uses remote CVS to control their linuxdoc and docbook source files .
Even though I contribute over a 56 KBps dial - up line , I can use Emacs to make the CVS process transparent .
Tags
Tags are a database of function , and optionally , typedef names are created with the program etags and stored in the file TAGS .
They are stored together with their locations , making it easy to examine the definition of a function .
To create a tags file for C programs , run etags -t *.[ ch ] from any shell .
You can use tags for many programming languages ; run etags -- help from a shell for a list .
Our minimal program has only one file and only one function .
Other developers should be so lucky ; many C projects spread out across multiple files in multiple directories .
Tags will cover complex situations like that as well .
In fact , the more complex the project , the better tags shine .
To examine the source for a function , use M-. ( that 's meta - period ) .
Start typing the name of the function and use tab completion .
If you have n't already specified a tags file to use , Emacs will ask .
Usually the default is exactly what you want ( Figure 9 ) .
Figure 9 .
Using the Tags Facility to Locate a Function Notice that the default function name is the word next to the cursor in the source window .
Tags mode lets you edit one file , place the cursor over the name of a function to examine and go edit that function with minimal keystrokes .
You can also display the source for the function in another window , with Ctrl - X 4 ..
This lets you examine multiple functions simultaneously , as many functions as you can fit on the screen .
If you want to see every reference to a function , use M - X tags - search .
To continue the search , use M- , .
Also , tags are very useful for searching and replacing function names within projects .
For example , if I have a function named Frodo and I want to rename it Gollum , I not only need to change the function declaration , but I have to get every prototype and every reference .
So M - X tags - query - replace and away I go .
Both of these search functions use regular expressions , making them very powerful .
You can browse C++ classes with Ebrowse .
File Diffing Diffing is comparing two files , say two versions of a source file .
Most programmers are familiar with diff and patch .
Emacs provides a powerful front end for diff and patch .
For one thing , Emacs ' ediff mode shows the two ( or three ) files in the editor one above the other .
The differences are highlighted on any display capable of color ( Figure 10 ) .
The entire line is indicated , and the exact differences are indicated in different colors .
Figure 10 .
Showing the Difference between Two Files
Not only that , but you can use single - character commands to move differences from one file to the other ; a or b moves the line from the A or B buffer , respectively , to the other .
This allows you to walk through two files , compare them and accept or reject each difference .
To step through the two files one difference at a time , put the ediff control panel in focus .
Use the spacebar to advance and the P key to go back ( Figure 11 ) .
Ediff mode can keep up with changes you make on the fly .
Try adding a line to goodbye.c right after the printf line , a call to flush ( ) ; .
Figure 11 . The Control Panel for Emacs ' Ediff Mode
Help Emacs has a huge library of built - in help .
The gateway to Emacs ' help is Ctrl - H .
If you are n't familiar with Emacs at all , get started with the tutorial , Ctrl - H T .
If you are already familiar with Emacs , you should walk through the tutorial ; there 's always something to learn about Emacs .
If you are familiar with the GNU program Info , you already know how to use Emacs ' help system .
Ctrl - H I gets you to the top menu of the Info system .
From there , Memacs gets you to the Emacs documentation .
And , of course , the documentation for Info is available from the top - level Info menu .
If you want documentation for other programs or for Linux function calls , you can use Emacs as an Info reader .
Or , you can read the man pages from within Emacs .
You can use Emacs as a front end for Man with the command M - X manual - entry .
Or you can have Emacs interpret the man page and display it for you with the woman ( WithOut MAN ) package .
Since the Cygwin tools for Windows ( www.cygwin.com) include man pages but not a program to read them , woman is just the ticket .
For example , to see the man page for printf , put the cursor over the word printf in your source code .
Enter M - X woman and press Return .
Emacs will propose printf as the default manual entry .
There are two printf man pages , one in man 3 and one in man 1 .
Tell Emacs you want man 3 by pressing 3 Tab .
Emacs will complete the filename , then press Return .
Emacs will show you the man page for printf .
Packaging
Hardware
The LCD - equipped EVO 4G ( left ) beside the AMOLED Nexus One ( right ) ,
both set at maximum brightness .
Camera / camcorder
Handset packaging has evolved significantly in the past two to three years -- a nod to the fact that consumers do care , in fact , about the environment ( go figure ) and take notice when manufacturers package a 4 - ounce phone in a box big enough to swallow a laptop whole .
We 've seen the boxes get a whole lot smaller , but the EVO 's is n't just small -- it 's also ... well , weird .
Our own Vlad Savov described it as resembling a microwaveable meal , and we think that pretty much sums it up : it 's like an egg carton material surrounded by a bit of decorative cardboard that can be slipped off , and from a distance , it looks like you might peel the top off and expect steam to billow out .
Rest assured , if steam actually billows out of this thing when you open it , you 'll want to promptly return it to the store .
Inside , you 'll find just the bare essentials under a recycled flip top : a package containing the usual assortment of manuals and documents , a recycling envelope for your old phone ( which , let 's be honest , is probably better off being sold or handed to a family member than recycled ) , a Micro - USB cable , USB wall charger ( without a second cable , unfortunately , so you 'll need to find one if you want to leave cables plugged into both your PC and charger ) , a 1500 mAh battery , 8GB microSD card , and of course , the EVO itself .
Our EVO arrived with the battery already installed and charged to about 50 percent , but it was a review unit -- your experience may vary .
Alright , enough with the pleasantries ; what about the phone itself ?
Well , it 's certainly imposing -- there 's just no way around it -- and HTC did n't try to tone things down , coating it head to toe in a mix of gloss and soft - touch black with red accents .
Actually , most of the visible red accents left on the production device are beneath the kickstand ( more on that in a moment ) and around the camera lens ; the pre-production unit that we played with back at CTIA also featured a red earpiece grill , which we thought was both edgy and tasteful ... but someone at Sprint must 've disagreed , because it 's just a muted silver now .
Microsoft has said that its mantra for the design of Windows Phone 7 has been " content , not chrome , " and we 'd argue that the EVO 4G basically exemplifies a hardware version of that philosophy .
Every square millimeter of the EVO serves ( or seems to serve ) a purpose -- nothing is there simply for the sake of design .
On the one hand , it 's a no - frills device , but on the other hand , the sheer magnitude of its specifications mean that what little design is there still makes an incredibly powerful statement .
In other words , wherever you go , people notice this phone .
They notice it against your face , they notice it set on a table .
In fact , it 's hard to not notice .
We find it to be an extraordinarily sexy device , and passers - by we encountered seemed to agree .
Though the phone generally feels extraordinarily solid and substantial ( there are n't any major moving parts , after all ) , we did have one minor niggle with build quality .
When the capacitive buttons below the display are lit , there 's a ton of light leakage along the bottom edge of the phone where the display meets the plastic surround .
Obviously , that 's not an issue in bright lighting , but in dimmer environments , it 's definitely enough leakage to notice and give the phone a visibly cheaper look to it .
Then again , this might not be endemic to the entire production run -- and even if it is , it 's not going to make or break anyone 's decision to buy the EVO , nor their ability to enjoy the living daylights out of it .
The edges of phone are simple affairs .
Like the Nexus One , the EVO lacks a dedicated camera button , but it changes the position of the volume rocker from the right side to the left ; we 're not sure if that was necessitated by the phone 's internals , if Sprint specifically requested it be that way , or if there are other dark forces at play .
The rocker is quite pronounced , so it 's plenty easy to find with your thumb while you 're on a call .
Around bottom , you 'll find a left - oriented mic hole ( biased for right - handed talkers , we figure ) along with two ports side - by - side in the middle : the standard Micro - USB connector , which is used for both data connections and charging , plus a standard HDMI Type D micro connector that 's perfect for outputting those 720 p videos you 've shot on the phone .
It would 've been pretty sweet if Sprint had thrown a compatible HDMI cable in the box since odds are good you do n't have one of these lying around , but we can understand why they did n't -- we 've no doubt their per-unit costs are pretty high on this one as it is .
The top of the phone features your typical 3.5 mm headphone jack along with a power button toward the right side , which brings us to another one of our complaints : the button is basically flush , and the surface on which it 's mounted is angled slightly forward , which makes it surprisingly difficult to find and push the button without looking for it -- especially one - handed .
Even a quarter - or half - millimeter of height above the edge 's surface would 've solved this .
Turning our attention back to the front , Nexus
One owners feeling burned by the finicky capacitive buttons can put their minds at ease , because the four examples below the EVO 's display work just beautifully .
Interestingly , we 're not sure how much of the improvement is actual and how much is simply psychological , because they 're only marginally larger and lower than the Nexus One's ; if anything , we suspect that surrounding each icon with a circle probably increases the odds that we 're hitting the buttons exactly where they need to be hit .
Of course , the aforementioned light leakage is another matter altogether -- but in terms of raw functionality , we found that the buttons are perfectly usable .
The rear of the handset is comprised of a single curved piece of black soft - touch plastic that features the red-rimmed 8 megapixel optics next to a pair of white LEDs and the speakerphone port .
What really concerns us here is that the phone rests directly on the lens , which is pretty unheard of ; modern smartphones with decent cameras have a tendency to either recess the lens or conceal it with a sliding cover , but you wo n't find any of that with the EVO , so it 'll be interesting to see whether users ' photos become cloudier over time as the glass gets scratched up .
Needless to say , we 'd probably recommend against placing the phone on hard surfaces -- particularly face - up -- but we suppose the silver lining here is that the protruding lens brings the speakerphone off the surface for maximum volume .
Down below , you 've got an inlaid chrome HTC logo , which does a good job of communicating the high - end nature of the beast -- this is no third - rate silkscreen job here , folks -- followed by the kickstand , a feature first seen in HTC's US line on the Imagio .
This seems like more of a novelty in smaller devices , but when you 're talking about a display this expansive , it actually makes a lot of sense -- we can totally imagine propping this up on our desk and watching some Sprint TV ( though we were n't totally stoked to discover that you 've got to disable WiFi to watch it ) .
It also saves you a few bucks on a desktop dock ( as long as you 're cool plugging in the Micro - USB cable by hand ) that 's perfect for use as a table clock or radio -- and heck , it 's good for just getting the EVO off its camera lens .
The kickstand has a very strong , positive spring loaded action and feels like it's made of solid metal , so we would n't be too worried about breaking it ; if we had one complaint , it 's that there does n't appear to be a way to set the phone to perform an action when you open the kickstand ( a la Nokia N86 ) .
But seriously , we 're really reaching for a reason to complain here .
The EVO plays along with one of HTC 's more recent design memes kicked off by the HD Mini earlier this year : brightly - colored innards .
Boy , does it ever play along !
Popping the battery cover off ( yes , you pop it with your fingernail -- it does n't slide ) reveals a fire engine red interior complete with matching battery , just like you 'll find in the Droid Incredible .
Sure , granted , if you replace the pack with a third - party model down the road , it wo n't likely match -- but then again , this is about as superfluous and hedonistic of a design element as we can possibly imagine , because it serves precisely zero function and is almost never seen by the user .
Heck , it 's such a covert feature , it 's practically a private joke of HTC's ... and we can appreciate a good private joke now and again .
The microSD card lives underneath the battery , so we 'd probably recommend just getting a nice big one ( good luck finding a 32 GB ! ) and leaving it put -- especially since HTC has chosen one of the most unusual slot designs we 've ever seen on a phone .
Basically , the card rests loosely in a trench and is secured using a plastic peg overhead ; press it down to hold the card in place .
A fingernail is enough to pop the peg up again , and the card just falls right out .
It 's such a bizarre design that we can only assume it was necessitated ( versus , say , a conventional spring - loaded slot ) by virtue of the EVO 's tightly - packed circuitry .
Nothing a good , old - fashioned teardown wo n't definitively answer , we 're sure .
Comparisons are inevitably going to be made to HTC 's other 4.3 - inch beast -- the Windows Mobile 6.5 - based HD2 -- but when you get into the details , the phones are actually almost completely different animals .
The HD2 clocks in at 11 millimeters thick , roughly 2 mm thinner than the EVO , and it 's just enough of a difference to notice ; we 've always thought that the HD2 feels almost impossibly thin , while the EVO is a bit more substantial .
Mind you , the EVO 's gargantuan surface area erases any notion that it's a " thick " phone , but it does feel perceptibly beefier in the hand than either the HD2 or the 11.5 mm Nexus One .
Speaking of the HD2 , the EVO 's display is probably sourced from the same supplier , as far as we can tell -- most importantly , it 's bright and it feels good to the touch .
It does n't feel utterly unmovable like you 'd expect a glass display to , but it 's far from flimsy ; you can just barely detect a hint of give if you really press it .
Frankly , it 's surprisingly similar in terms of color saturation to the Nexus One 's AMOLED display when both are set to full - tilt brightness , which suggests that AMOLED 's perceived advantage in mobile devices might not really exist ; we 're certainly not blown away by the Nexus One 's battery life , for example , and it 's practically useless in sunlight .
The EVO fared a bit better in bright sunlight with the automatic brightness control turned on -- it did n't hurt to have a hand cupped over the display , granted , but we could definitely make out what was going on ( and here 's a little bonus : it 's usable in all orientations while wearing polarized sunglasses ) .
A big , big part of the EVO 's draw is the 8 megapixel autofocus camera with dual LED flash and -- drum roll , please -- yes , 720 p video recording .
The shots had a little bit more splotchiness and noise ( er , make that noise reduction ) than we would 've liked , but they still looked just great scaled down to monitor size ; as with pretty much any phone camera , you 're not going to want to blow these up and frame them for an art exhibition .
What really blew us away was n't the picture quality , but the shutter lag -- or rather , the lack thereof .
You go to take a shot , and boom , the shot 's taken .
The biggest lag time is with autofocus , but even that 's unusually quick for a phone ; it got a little slower in low light , but that 's to be expected .
There is no prouder moment in Haiti ’s history than Jan. 1 , 1804 , when a band of statesmen - warriors declared independence from France , casting off colonialism and slavery to become the world ’s first black republic .
They proclaimed their freedom boldly — “ we must live independent or die , ” they wrote — but for decades , Haiti lacked its own official copy of those words .
Its Declaration of Independence existed only in handwritten duplicate or in newspapers .
Until now .
A Canadian graduate student at Duke University , Julia Gaffield , has unearthed from the British National Archives the first known , government - issued version of Haiti ’s founding document .
The eight - page pamphlet , now visible online , gives scholars new insights into a period with few primary sources .
But for Haitian intellectuals , the discovery has taken on even broader significance .
That the document would be found in February , just weeks after the earthquake that killed so many ; that its authenticity would be confirmed in time for the donor conference that could define Haiti ’s future — some see providence at work .

Patience Diff Advantages
There 's no coherent explanation of what the advantages of Patience Diff are , so I 'll explain now .
First , a quick overview of how Patience Diff works - Match the first lines of both if they 're identical , then match the second , third , etc. until a pair does n't match .
Match the last lines of both if they 're identical , then match the next to last , second to last , etc. until a pair does n't match .
Find all lines which occur exactly once on both sides , then do longest common subsequence on those lines , matching them up .
Do steps 1 - 2 on each section between matched lines I 've previously described it with the ordering a bit different and a recursive step at the end , but this ordering always gives the same result and performs much better , and the performance hit of doing the recursion is n't worth it , because it rarely if ever finds any more matches , and even when it does it is n't clear whether the extra matches produce a functionally superior diff .
A much more detailed and more graphical explanation is
Another advantage of patience diff is that it frequently does n't match lines which just plain should n't match .
For example , if you 've completely rewritten a section of code it should n't match up the blank lines in each version , as void func1 ( ) { x += 1 } +void functhreehalves ( ) { + x += 1.5 +} + void func2 ( ) { x += 2 } Which is straightforward and obvious , but frequently diff algorithms will interpret it like this : void func1 ( ) { x += 1 +} + + void functhreehalves ( ) { + x += 1.5 } void func2 ( ) { x += 2 } While technically that works , it 's obviously inferior and is a bit of a pet peeve of mine .
In principle one could tweak an LCS - based diff to always do the right thing here , but the algorithmic complexity of LCS make implementations of it essentially unmaintainable .
That 's another another advantage of patience diff - it 's simple and understandable that it can be modified and extended reasonably , and why it performs correctly in all these examples can be easily analyzed .

A much more detailed and more graphical explanation is here .
A side by side of how that particular diff gets mangled by standard diff algorithms is here .
This is the example which motivated patience diff in the first place .
If you make extensive changes to a file and remove a function from the end of it and add a function to the beginning , there will be a tendency for an LCS based diff algorithm to match up all of the curly brackets instead of the functions , so if it 's matching F1 F2 F3 to F4 F1 F2 instead of viewing F4 as new and F3 as deleted , it will match the curly brackets of F1 to F4 , F2 to F1 , and F3 to F2 .
The result is every bit as gross and useless as it sounds , and can easily force a merge conflict in cases which could have been resolved completely cleanly .
This has a particularly strong tendency to happen if you put curly brackets on lines by themselves or are religious about putting curly brackets around single - line blocks even though it is n't technically necessary or even if you just put lots of blank lines between your functions .
Another advantage of patience diff is that it frequently does n't match lines which just plain should n't match .
For example , if you 've completely rewritten a section of code it should n't match up the blank lines in each version , as this example shows .
Finally , there 's this example :
Which is straightforward and obvious , but frequently diff algorithms will interpret it like this :
While technically that works , it 's obviously inferior and is a bit of a pet peeve of mine .
In principle one could tweak an LCS - based diff to always do the right thing here , but the algorithmic complexity of LCS make implementations of it essentially unmaintainable .
That 's another another advantage of patience diff - it 's simple and understandable that it can be modified and extended reasonably , and why it performs correctly in all these examples can be easily analyzed .

Your overview here says " longest common substring " ; the post by alfodenzo
Your overview here says " longest common substring " ; the post bysays " longest common subsequence " .
If this is intended as the canonical explanation you should perhaps clarify which is meant just to be sure :-) .

Fixed that , thanks .
It 's supposed to be subsequence .
It 's kinda confusing because both words are used for diff , and they both have the same acronym .

bramcohen Straight LCS - based diff just does an LCS and it 's done .
Patience diff pulls out just the lines which occur exactly once on both sides , does an LCS on those , and extends out from there .
This has the advantage of ignoring potentially misleading lines , and also is a much simpler algorithm due to the lack of duplicate lines .

Is there a stand alone utility available ?
Something not embedded within a DVCS ?

bramcohen I believe the diff code in bazaar , which uses patience diff ( the extended one with recursive application , which I 'm basically saying is unnecessary here ) can be run as a standalone diff utility .

If you are suggesting that I can say
$ bzr diff path1 path2
that does not work .
I get
bzr : ERROR : Not a branch : " path1 " .

axxyaan I think you would do better to eliminate step 1 and step 2 .
Because they can make patience diff interpret the diff as the latter in your example here .
Suppose a new function is added , your functhreehalves here .
Now what happens when you start comparing lines from the bottom up in your old and new file .
You will start by finding the common function func2 in both files .
But then you will find that the blank line and the end of func1 in the old file will match the blank line and the end of functhreehalves in the new file .
So the result will be a diff in your pet peeve version .

During his commencement speech at the University of Michigan today , President Obama took on the partisanship in both the Left and Right Wing media , “ Today ’s 24/7 echo - chamber amplifies the most inflammatory soundbites louder and faster than ever before . ”
Obama urged Americans to be less partisan and try to see both sides of an issue .
Obama called for a more civil political dialogue , “ But we ca n’t expect to solve our problems if all we do is tear each other down .
You can disagree with a certain policy without demonizing the person who espouses it .
You can question somebody ’s views and their judgment without questioning their motives or their patriotism .
Throwing around phrases like “ socialists ” and “ Soviet - style takeover ” and “ fascist ” and “ right - wing nut ” – that may grab headlines , but it also has the effect of comparing our government , our political opponents , to authoritarian , even murderous regimes . ”
He continued , “ Now , we ’ve seen this kind of politics in the past .
It ’s been practiced by both fringes of the ideological spectrum , by the left and the right , since our nation ’s birth .
But it ’s starting to creep into the center of our discourse .
And the problem with it is not the hurt feelings or the bruised egos of the public officials who are criticized .
Remember , they signed up for it .
Michelle always reminds me of that .
The problem is that this kind of vilification and over - the - top rhetoric closes the door to the possibility of compromise .
It undermines democratic deliberation .
It prevents learning — since , after all , why should we listen to a “ fascist , ” or a “ socialist , ” or a “ right - wing nut , ” or a left - wing nut ” ? ”

The President implied that the partisan media environment is dumbing down America , “ Today ’s 24/7 echo - chamber amplifies the most inflammatory soundbites louder and faster than ever before .
And it ’s also , however , given us unprecedented choice .
Whereas most Americans used to get their news from the same three networks over dinner , or a few influential papers on Sunday morning , we now have the option to get our information from any number of blogs or websites or cable news shows .
And this can have both a good and bad development for democracy .
For if we choose only to expose ourselves to opinions and viewpoints that are in line with our own , studies suggest that we become more polarized , more set in our ways .
That will only reinforce and even deepen the political divides in this country . ”
Obama asked partisans to try to see the other side , “ But if we choose to actively seek out information that challenges our assumptions and our beliefs , perhaps we can begin to understand where the people who disagree with us are coming from .
Now , this requires us to agree on a certain set of facts to debate from .
That ’s why we need a vibrant and thriving news business that is separate from opinion makers and talking heads .
That ’s why we need an educated citizenry that values hard evidence and not just assertion .
As Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously once said , “ Everybody is entitled to his own opinion , but not his own facts . ”
He called on Americans on both the Left and Right to break out of their partisan shells , “ Still , if you ’re somebody who only reads the editorial page of The New York Times , try glancing at the page of The Wall Street Journal once in a while .
If you ’re a fan of Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh , try reading a few columns on the Huffington Post website .
It may make your blood boil ; your mind may not be changed .
But the practice of listening to opposing views is essential for effective citizenship .
It is essential for our democracy . ”
Obama is totally correct , but the odds of what he is recommending actually happening are slim to none .
The reason is simple .
Partisanship makes money .
Fox News has a license to print money because they appeal to the right .
MSNBC ’s profits skyrocketed when they moved to the left .
One look at the ratings struggles of the non-partisan CNN can tell you that moderation is not where it is at in today ’s media environment .
The President was calling for a harkening back to the days when news organizations were not supposed to make money , and ratings did n’t matter .
In the time before corporate ownership , news organizations did n’t have a political agenda , and were there as more a public service and a civic duty to keep the American people informed , but as soon as corporate America discovered that news can be a gold mine of profits , the pressures on news divisions increased , and their role changed .
Most consumers of media have been trained to not seek out facts , but to rely on sources of information that confirm their own opinions and biases .
The American people no longer have the ability to critically think about what is being presented to them .
People expect to be entertained by a Keith Olbermann or Bill O’Reilly .
Their job is to present the news in a fun fashion to their audience .
The media has gotten rich by fueling partisanship , while our national IQ and dialogue has sunk to an all time low .
I spent several hours today preparing a short article on defense spending for The Beacon , updating similar articles I wrote in 2004 and 2007 .
The subject matter required me to do a fair amount of work that most people no doubt would consider tedious — locating and cross-checking data , performing various arithmetic operations , checking my figures again and again to ensure their accuracy .
I have been doing this sort of work off and on ever since my college days , and strange to say , I rather enjoy it .
I used to joke with my grad students that “ I ’m what you might call a data man , Jack ” ( with apologies to Group Captain Lionel Mandrake ) .
Today , however , as I was working along , my mind seized on something I had never dwelt upon .
Numbers , data checking , mathematical operations — these things are abstract and in themselves completely lifeless , regardless of the human qualities or quantities to which they sometimes relate .
One can work on the figures themselves without being drawn , perhaps unwillingly , into reflections on distressing things : loss , disappointment , pain , desperation , sorrow , death .
Perhaps this disjunction between the black - and - white of numbers and numerical computations , on the one hand , and the exquisitely varied coloration of human life and death , on the other , explains the origin of the expression “ cold , calculating killer . ”
At this point in my reflections , I could not help recalling Robert Strange McNamara .
( Was it simply a coincidental family oddity — his mother ’s maiden name — that denominated him strange , or was his middle name divinely ordained to serve as a warning ? )
McNamara was a promising young man , but the big impetus to his later career achievements came during World War II , when he impressed his superiors while serving in the air force as a bombing efficiency expert .
I wonder if he ever thought , while examining his data on the results of the U.S. incendiary bombing of the highly flammable Japanese cities , about the human beings — the old women , the infants and little kids , and all of the others who had done so little to deserve their fiery fate — who were suffering the unimaginable agonies of being terribly burned or of seeing their loved ones burned to death and torn apart by blasts .
Or did the up - and - coming young officer think only about the ratio of X to Y during his working hours , and then stop by the officers ’ club for a stiff drink or two before dozing off between clean sheets ?
I do n’t pretend to know what passed through his mind , or through the minds of countless other men who played similar roles amid the madness of war .
I do know that many people have the capacity to keep troubling thoughts out of the forefront of their minds , to avoid dwelling on things they tell themselves they cannot do anything about in any event , and thus to steer clear of speaking or even thinking about exactly what they are doing .
This self - protective evasiveness may explain why soldiers so often speak not of causing horrific deaths and destruction , but of “ getting the job done ” so they can return home for a slice of blueberry pie with their wives or sweethearts .
Data , then , may serve as soporifics — medicinal tablets that keep our minds off things about which we dare not think too hard or too long .
Even then , however , we may be left with Hamlet ’s ominous worry , for in that sleep , what dreams may come ?
Whether nightmares disturbed McNamara ’s slumber during World War II or later , when he was secretary of defense during the Vietnam War , with responsibility for the B - 52s employed to turn immense swaths of land into carpet - bombed hell , I do not know .
I do know , however , that in the 1960s he surrounded himself with “ whiz kids ” who were devoted to bringing their “ planning , programming , and budgeting system ” to bear on getting “ more bang for the buck . ”
People who knew McNamara ’s background were surely not surprised .
“ Cold , calculating killers ” – can anyone honestly deny that this term applies in an altogether literal way to these men .
And who would have expected anything else ?
Had n’t they already honed their skills while working for the RAND Corporation , where they had learned to speak “ rationally ” of megadeaths and to conclude with numerical precision that if in a nuclear exchange with the Soviets , we suffered 100 million deaths and they suffered 150 million deaths , we would have “ won the war ” ?
Data are fine things ;
I ’ve devoted much of my professional life to their examination and analysis .
Yet it behooves all of us to realize that data may sometimes clothe madness or veil inhumanity , and to beware the power of numbers to lull us into an immoral sleep .

At the recent press day for Paul W.S. Anderson ’s upcoming sequel Resident Evil : Retribution , Dread Central had the opportunity to sit down and chat exclusively with the flick ’s star and “ resident ” badass : Milla Jovovich .
We spoke with the actress about the evolution of Alice over the last ten years since the first Resident Evil debuted in theaters , her thoughts on playing multiple versions of the same character for Retribution and more .
Check out our exclusive one - on - one with Jovovich below , and look for more on Resident Evil : Retribution this week !
Related Story : Exclusive : Paul W.S. Anderson Discusses Resident Evil : Retribution , Future Franchise Plans and More
Dread Central :
You ’ve been with this character for over ten years now ; how did it feel to change things up with Alice ’s dynamic for Retribution ?
Did you get to have any input regarding the direction of Alice at all on this one ?
Milla Jovovich :
You know , this one was really great for me because I thought it was great to see Alice become a human being again .
In the first movie she ’s a human being , but then in parts two , three and four , she ’s pretty much superhuman .
Alice had these powers and she was being controlled by the Umbrella Corporation , which left her kind of like this isolated loner .
Suddenly , here , she ’s able to have her team back , have her friends back and finally get to have a sense of humor about it all because hey , the world IS how it is now , and you either deal with it by laughing and going with it or giving up - and Alice is n’t giving up .
And having the “ Suburban Alice ” component was a really interesting element for Paul to write because being parents now ourselves , the stakes are risen so much higher when there ’s a child involved .
We also thought that maybe it would also bring this character down into this world more , anchor her more and make her more relatable by seeing Alice reluctantly become this little girl ’s ( Aryana Engineer ) caretaker .
Dread Central : Can you talk about the tonal difference in those “ Suburban Alice ” moments and having to play those scenes completely against character ?
Milla Jovovich :
It ’s kind of funny - in all of the Resident Evil movies , this is the first time that we take this story into a real - life kind of suburban area , and it was really wonderful for me because I was still getting to play Alice but I was playing the Alice who grew up in a small town , who was probably the captain of the cheerleading squad in high school and got married really young .
You know - she ’s goes to Costco every weekend and has a minivan .
And to be able to have that kind of juxtaposition like you do here between “ Battle Alice ” and this really nice stay - at - home housewife kind of character … it was fun to play both sides in this , especially when you see how the Alice everyone knows has to deal with taking care of this child and having to do things like be nurturing and protective .
I mean , she ’s had to deal with her friends dying , but now there ’s this child who pretty much changes everything .
I mean , killing zombies is one thing , but kids … whoa !
Nothing prepares you for that ( laughs ) .
Dread Central : I wanted to ask - considering the state of the world and the fact that there does n’t seem to be a safe place left on Earth , what do you feel it is that keeps Alice and all of these characters fighting despite the odds ?
I mean , the world ’s pretty much been progressively going to hell over time so what ’s left to fight for ?
Milla Jovovich : Well , if there are any future movies past this , Paul will have to figure out what we ’ll be fighting for then .
But you ’re right ; there is n’t a lot of hope really left amongst these characters so I think they ’re all fighting because that ’s all they know how to do .
It ’s that warrior syndrome where if you were n’t fighting , you would n’t know what to do with yourself .
What would Alice or anyone do if they did n’t have a gun in their hand or there was n’t an apocalypse to try and survive ?
It ’s hard to tell because this is their realities .
I think the fight is there because that ’s now engrained in all of us - it ’s part of our DNA , and now for Alice it ’s personal for her .
She has to make Umbrella pay .
Written and directed by Paul Anderson , Resident Evil : Retribution stars Milla Jovovich , Boris Kodjoe , Li Bingbing , Kevin Durand , Shawn Roberts , Michelle Rodriguez , Sienna Guillory , Johann Urb , and Colin Salmon .
Look for Resident Evil : Retribution in theatres on September 14 , 2012 , from Screen Gems .

If Elena Kagan is confirmed by the Senate , there will be three women on the Supreme Court for the first time .
This is a measure of how far women have come .
Two will be single and childless .
This may be a measure of something else entirely .
There certainly wo n’t be a shortage of parents on the court .
Antonin Scalia alone has nine children .
John G. Roberts and Samuel Alito each have two , Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy each have three and Clarence Thomas has a son from his first marriage and a grandnephew he began raising after the child ’s father was sentenced to prison .
Nor is it a given that for a woman to find a seat on the highest court she must choose career over children .
While Sonia Sotomayor is divorced and childless and Kagan never married and has no children , Sandra Day O’Connor has three sons and was married for 56 years before her husband died of complications from Alzheimer ’s in 2009 .
Ruth Bader Ginsburg , in turn , is the mother of two ; an introvert married for 56 years to an extrovert , she has one of the most endearing marriages in Washington .

The question , then — about the legal arena in particular and society in general — is what , if anything , has changed since the years when O’Connor and Ginsburg rose to the court .
The world got better for women , right ?
More accepting , accommodating and flexible ?
Despite Foxconn allegedly asking all employees to sign contracts promising not to kill themselves , another worker has jumped out of a building window .
This came hours after Foxconn 's CEO was boasting to press of the fabulous facilities at the factories .

It appears the Olympic - sized swimming pool just is n't enough to keep workers happy .
The 10th employee to kill himself jumped sometime just before midnight ( local Chinese time ) last night ; apparently he was aged just 23 years .

Great Britain has its own version of the Christian right , one which has borrowed extensively from our own .
One difference , according to Andrew Brown at the Guardian : many of its clerical leaders are black .
Brown sees trouble ahead as this British Christian right gears up for the upcoming election .
The movement , he writes , “ is nationalist , socially conservative , suspicious of markets , critical of Islam , authoritarian . ”
On Easter Sunday , its leadership put their signatures to the Westminster 2010 Declaration , a document that sounds very much like the Manhattan Declaration put out last year by American evangelical , Catholic , and Orthodox conservatives , and which promised civil disobedience to laws that mess with what these arch - conservatives insist are Scriptural and natural law prohibitions on sex outside of marriage and other alleged abominations .
Manhattan : “ We affirm . . . marriage as a conjugal union of man and woman , ordained by God from the creation , and historically understood by believers and non-believers alike , to be the most basic institution in society . ”
Westminster : “ We pledge to support marriage – the lifelong covenantal union of one man and one woman as husband and wife .
We believe it is divinely ordained , the only context for sexual intercourse , and the most important unit for sustaining the health , education , and welfare of all . ”
One key difference between the British and American versions is that the Westminster signatories , unlike their counterparts across the pond in Manhattan , have taken up the issue of immigration .
In the Manhattan Declaration , which claims to be a call to “ Christian conscience ” to preserve life and family , and which asserts that “ Christians are heirs of a 2,000 - year tradition of proclaiming God ’s word , seeking justice in our societies , resisting tyranny , and reaching out with compassion to the poor , oppressed and suffering , ” there is n’t even a mention of immigration .
Undoubtedly the base of support for the document , or at least the allies that base needs to cohere a conservative coalition , would never countenance such an open - hearted Christianity .
But in Britain , the focus on immigration is limited , too , and demonstrates that the globalized Christianity that is bringing immigration into the Westminster document sees it not as a religious conscience issue , but as a way of marginalizing Muslims .
As Brown puts it , by calling for protection of those “ appropriately seeking asylum , ” the Westminster Declaration suggests “ the beginnings of a religious test on immigration policy .
Muslim immigration makes these people very nervous , but poor Christians , especially fleeing from persecution in Muslim countries , should , they believe , be welcomed . ”
You might say the Westminster signatories are a bit more advanced than their Manhattan counterparts by even taking up immigration .
( Or perhaps it is a matter of necessity because some of the signatories , no doubt influenced by American evangelicalism brought to Africa and elsewhere , are themselves immigrants to Britain , or at least pastor a community of immigrants . )
But like the Manhattan Declaration , the orientation of the Westminster Declaration is framed around the persecution of Christians by ( in the case of the Manhattan Declaration ) secular society and ( in the case of the Westminster Declaration ) secular society and Islam .
That ’s not to say that the American Christian right does n’t advance its own anti-Islam propaganda and activism .
It ’s just that it has n’t figured out how to weave it into a document about “ Christian conscience ” yet .

On The Daily Show last night host Jon Stewart deftly exposed the flaws in the conservative argument against Obama that everything he does is just like George W. Bush .
Stewart said , “ Remember that terrible thing that Bush did that we fought for eight years to convince you was n’t bad , but actually good ?
Well now we use those very incidents as the low water mark for your guy … ”

After playing various clips of right wing pundits comparing Kagan to Harriet Miers , Stewart pretended to look her up and defined her as , “ Harriet Miers : Former Bush crony , Supreme Court nominated and quickly withdrawn , name now synonomous with intellectual heft and reckless nominating . ”
After playing a clip of Bay Buchanan saying the difference between Kagan and Miers is , “ Ivy League . ”
Stewart drew the conclusion that , “ So she ’s exactly like Harriet Miers except for the dumb part ?
Just like the only difference between me and Michael Jordan is athletic ability . ”

Stewart then pointed out how it is the Right that loves to compare Obama to Bush , “ So Kagan is Obama ’s Harriet Miers , his Bush like misstep , kinda sucks because he is still recovering from his last Bush like misstep . ”
After playing clips of the Right call in the oil spill Obama ’s Katrina , Stewart said , “ It ’s crazy .
It ’s like no matter what happens during the Obama administration , there ’s the perfect Bush f*ck up for the occasion …
It ’s like Bush has a set of greeting cards , oh you displayed a complete lack of self awareness during a time that would be seen as a test of your leadership , well there ’s a Bush f*ck up for that . ”
The Daily Show host talked about how self undermining this comparison is , “ The crazy part is that it ’s conservatives and Republicans that are in the biggest rush to make the comparisons .
Remember that terrible thing that Bush did that we fought for eight years to convince you was n’t bad , but actually good ?
Well now we use those very incidents as the low water mark for your guy , and they ’re not just interested in comparing Obama ’s new problems with Bush ’s old problems , they ’re also looking to bequeath all that Bush oversaw like some sort of cancerous heirloom .
It ’s like these guys treat this country like some sort of used car salesman …. and the best part is they ca n’t even recognize their own tacit admission of the previous administration ’s failure . ”
The minute that Obama took office the Right started trying to smear him with the legacy of the president that they strongly supported for eight years .
There is no greater self admission of failure than the Right ’s argument that Obama is just like Bush .
It is as if they are saying , “ Look your guy is just as terrible as our guy was , ” but on the basis of this argument they then have the nerve to ask the American people to return them to power .
As usual , Stewart is pointing of the hypocrisy of a media that is more interested in narrative than logic .
LaGrange , Illinois ( CNN ) -- Kaley Shannon first saw the devastation in Haiti while watching the 5 o'clock news with her father .
Seeing so many people in need after the January 12 earthquake , the determined girl from the Chicago suburbs wanted to help .
" When I saw those pictures , I realized those kids in Haiti did n't have a future unless someone would help them , " said Shannon , 14 .
" I knew I had to be that someone . "
Shannon , who is active in her school 's theater , says she got some inspiration from Hollywood .
" Brad Pitt builds houses in New Orleans , Angelina Jolie adopts kids from other countries -- that selflessness inspires me .
I wanted to give people hope like they do , " she said .
Her goal was to raise $ 90,000 by this week , which marks 90 days since the earthquake .
But to do that , she had to act quickly .
She immediately called her friends at her church youth group , who were eager to help .
They started brainstorming .
" We had ideas coming out in every direction , " she said .
With Valentine 's Day approaching , the group decided to bake heart - shaped cookies and sell them to make money for the quake survivors .
They also settled on a name for their group : Student Hearts for Haiti .
" I'm not the best baker in the world , but we were determined , " Shannon said .
With the help of their church 's industrial - sized oven , the teens baked 2,000 cookies , selling them to people heading to and from the train stations in the Chicago suburb of LaGrange .
" I 'm absolutely not a morning person , and it was freezing , but we knew our mission was urgent , " Shannon said .
The cookies were a huge hit .
Commuters gobbled them up .
Even people trying to stick to a diet would drop in their change .
By the end of the first day , Student Hearts for Haiti had made $ 3,200 .
They sold the remaining cookies at Shannon 's father 's office in downtown Chicago .
There , a UPS delivery man decided to buy 10 bags of cookies .
He told Shannon he was from Haiti .
His mother still lived there , running an orphanage that was badly damaged .
" He gave me the biggest bear hug and told me how proud he was that I was helping , " Shannon said .
" That gave me an idea . "
The group sent the donations from the cookie sales to the Red Cross and Mercy Corps for immediate relief .
But if her kid-run organization wanted to continue , Shannon thought , it should provide a way for kids in the Chicago area to directly help the kids in Haiti .
" I thought after we all saw what we did on TV , other kids in my area would want to help , " she said .
" Student Hearts for Haiti could give them the tools to do that . "
So with her father 's help , Shannon set up a Facebook page and started calling local schools .
They also partnered with Free the Children , based in Toronto , Ontario , to rebuild a school in Haiti .
Other fundraising ideas came pouring through the Facebook page : A boy whose father ran a wristband factory donated " Hearts for Haiti " wristbands .
Shannon 's high school , Lyons Township , donated the proceeds from its King of Hearts dance .
Another boy turned his 15th birthday party into a fundraiser .
Local merchants in LaGrange and Western Springs put out donations buckets , and so did many of Shannon 's teachers .
And 12 local schools started their own efforts .
One of those schools was Mary Grace Chizewski's .
Chizewski , 12 , had also been affected by the images of suffering in Haiti .
Shortly after the quake , she had reached out to her friends at St. Francis Xavier , and they approached the school 's principal to ask if they could help .
" These kids in Haiti had lost everything .
I thought , ' How are they going to succeed in life if they do n't have a school ? ' " Chizewski said .
" We hear all the time at our own school that we should help others when they are in need -- I thought here 's our chance . "
While sympathetic , the principal told them the school was already committed to several service projects .
She was n't sure if there 'd be time .
But a couple of days later , the principal got a call from Shannon 's father , who convinced her to help Student Hearts for Haiti .
" I was so excited when the principal called to ask if I was still interested in helping raise money for Haiti , " Chizewski said .
Shannon 's father gave the St. Francis Xavier students T - shirts and wristbands , and Chizewski and her friends spent the next recess planning how to sell the donated items .
They put posters up on every floor and used the morning announcements to ask students to help .
The group kept a big heart poster in the main office to track their progress .
They 'd color in a little more each time they 'd raise $ 500 .
When the heart was full , the principal let the whole school know with an announcement on the PA system .
On the school 's dress - down day , students wore their Hearts for Haiti T - shirts and wristbands .
" It was so cool to see all those kids in the halls wearing our T - shirts , " Chizewski said .
" I 'd never done anything like this before . "
In the end , the 672 - student school generated more than $ 5,500 .
That amount was doubled when Student Hearts for Haiti got a matching grant , which meant that St. Francis Xavier 's effort was enough to build and furnish one classroom in Haiti .
With the matching grant from the Moyer Foundation , which was founded by Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Jamie Moyer and his wife , Karen , the group has raised more than $ 80,000 so far .
Shannon says she still hopes to reach her goal of $ 90,000 , and after that , she has no plans to stop there .
" I want to rebuild as many schools as we can , " Shannon said .
" We 've had rival schools helping ; we 've had kids from the public schools and the Catholic schools , kids who do n't normally talk to each other working together on this .
" I think this has helped kids realize it feels good to be a part of something bigger than just you . "

James Sikes , the San Diego runaway Toyota Prius driver , filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and now has over $ 700,000 in debt .
According to one anonymous tipster , we 're also told he has n't been making payments on his Prius .
UPDATE !
Advertisement
We received an email earlier today from an anonymous tipster who claims James ( Jim ) Sikes , the driver of the runaway Toyota Prius , was in financial trouble and even behind by five months on his payments for the Prius .
If that 's true , it 's potential motivation for wanting to find an out — any out — on paying for the vehicle .
Advertisement
We did some public records searches ( thanks to the help of Gawker 's John Cook ) and found Sikes and his wife Patty found themselves , like many in the California real estate business , on the bursting side of the real estate bubble last year .
The two declared bankruptcy in June of 2008 and have a combined liability of over $ 700,000 dollars in debt .
Among the list of creditors holding secured claims is none other than Toyota Financial Services for a lease on a 2008 Toyota Prius with 7,200 miles on the odometer .
Total value of the lease at the time of bankruptcy was $ 20,494 .

So , with almost three - quarter million dollars in debt there 's obviously the potential for financial motivation here .
But , for his part , when we questioned Mr. Sikes over email earlier today , he denied being behind on his Prius payments .
Advertisement
Mr. Sikes also has not shied away from cameras appearing on CNN and numerous other television programs .
In each , he 's stated numerous times he's not going to sue and is n't looking for any financial remuneration from Toyota other than a new vehicle .
Advertisement
We 've asked the law firm representing him to furnish us with an up - to - date copy of his Toyota statement and we 'll post that as soon as we receive it — to either debunk this myth or add fuel to any fire .
We 'd also like to point out Toyota itself sent out a tweet yesterday showing how a Prius of that generation can easily be stopped if it 's accelerating out of control .
But , for the moment , we 'll ask you to again listen to the full 911 tape and tell us what you think — does that sound like a man faking or genuinely afraid for his life ?
Advertisement
But regardless of what happens with the Sikes case , the bigger issue for Toyota will be every cash - strapped ' yota - owner looking for an easy out on their loans and leases potentially thinking about doing just this with their car .
That 's a lot of potential carnage to wade through .
Advertisement
UPDATE : We 're now hearing rumors that Sikes has a history of items in his possession being stolen and him filing for insurance claims .
We found at least one case of this in his bankruptcy documents , which we 've included below .
We 're told we should know more about a second incident shortly .
Advertisement
But there 's also another , more salacious tidbit we 've found which may or may not be irrelevant — we 're still trying to fit this piece into the puzzle .
With a tip from a commenter at TTAC , we discovered Sikes owned and operated a web site called AdultSwingLife.com .
Interesting .
There 's also a report from KTLX with a neighbor stating he may have been involved in the porn industry .
Someone alleging to be a former business partner also claims
Sikes stole from their company and acted fraudulently .
København : Den lille havfrue er vendt tilbage - Statens Naturhistoriske Museum stod skærtorsdag bag en aprilsnar - spøg på Langelinie i København .
Pressemeddelelsen lyder :
Et velkendt og dog anderledes syn mødte morgenfriske påsketurister på Langeliniekajen i dag .
Den lille havfrue er vendt tilbage , ikke fra den lange rejse til Shanghai og ikke som den berømte statue i bronze , men som skelet .
Skelettet , der til daglig befinder sig i Zoologisk Museums magasiner , hører til blandt museets kosteligste klenodier .
Skelettet stammer oprindelig fra det Kongelige Kunstkammer , hvortil det kom i begyndelsen af 1700 - tallet .
Skelettet tilhører arten Hydronymphus pesci , der uddøde i slutningen af 1600 - tallet .
Der findes kun
Èt lignende skelet i verden , nemlig på Eremitagemuseet i Sankt Petersborg , men det er ikke så komplet som københavnereksemplaret , idet halen mangler .
Efter den korte optræden på Langeliniekajen vendte den lille havfrue tilbage til Zoologisk museum , hvor hun vil være udstillet påsken over .
På grund af vejret turde museets konservatorer ikke tillade , at skelettet var ude i længere tid , stenen , som den lille havfrue sidder på , er nemlig en kopi af gips .

BBC Sport in Sheffield
Neil Robertson beat Scot Graeme Dott 18 - 13 to become the first Australian to win the world snooker title .
Robertson , who rises to number two in the world , had trailed 5 - 3 but having edged ahead , kept his nose in front despite not being at his best .
He sunk the last ball of a tense , error - ridden final at 0054 BST .
The 28 - year - old is the first player from outside the UK and Ireland to win the world title since Canadian Cliff Thorburn 's victory in 1980 .
Snooker 's showpiece event had been overshadowed by the suspension of 2009 world champion John Higgins following bribery allegations .
My mum and her partner have travelled for ages and they only got two hours ' sleep before the final , so for them to be here makes it absolutely perfect
Neil Robertson
Big breaks were at a premium in the final , with Scotland 's Dott knocking in the only century .
It was a gruelling , but gripping , climax to the Sheffield tournament , with the players equalling the record set by John Higgins and Mark Selby in 2007 for the latest finish to a Crucible final .
There will be huge celebrations in Robertson 's home city of Melbourne as the country watched him become the first Australian to lift the famous trophy and pick up his fifth ranking title .
Despite neither player being able to replicate the break - building skills showcased earlier in the 17 - day tournament , there was certainly no shortage of tension as the pair traded blows in an edgy contest .
Having racked up seven centuries at this tournament , Robertson 's highest knock in this clash was only 90 , but at the crucial times , his safety , tenacity and long potting proved enough to see off his battling opponent .
Just moments after potting the final ball of the clinching frame , Robertson said the support of his family - who had flown over from Australia in time for the final - made the occasion even more special .
" This is absolutely incredible , " Robertson , who will receive a cheque for £ 250,000 for his achievement , told BBC Sport .
" I seriously can't believe it .
In my last - 16 match , I was 11 - 5 down to Martin Gould and after my ( semi- final ) match with Ali Carter I was really disappointed I could n't have any of my family over for the final .
" Then I got a voicemail from my mum to say that when I was 15 - 9 up overnight against Ali , she had jumped on a plane , so it was quite lucky I finished the job off !
" My mum and her partner have travelled for ages and they only got two hours ' sleep before the final , so for them to be here makes it absolutely perfect . "
Robertson went one better than compatriot Eddie Charlton , who lost in three finals in the 1960s and 1970s , and he said he hoped his success would give the sport a major boost in Australia .
" Obviously Australians love Olympic and world champions , " added Robertson .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" It would have been a big blow if I had lost in the final .
I had all that pressure to contend with but hopefully this is the start of something and we can have an event there now . "
Dott , the 2006 Crucible winner , has battled with depression and a downturn in results in recent seasons , but found his form at the right time to reach his third world final .
But the 32 - year - old did not quite hit the heights in the final , and admitted Robertson had fully deserved his victory .
" He was far and away the better player - how I managed to get 13 frames I do n't know , " said Dott .
" I am obviously disappointed to lose in the final and not really perform .
But I needed to get to the semi-finals to get back in the top 16 and I have played really well , so hopefully I will be back for next next year . "
The players resumed the final session of the final with Robertson leading 12 - 10 , maintaining the two - frame advantage he held at the end of Sunday 's action .
Try as he might , Dott could not get back in front of his opponent on the scoreboard as the pressure - and , as a result , the number of mistakes - continued to grow inside snooker 's most famous venue .
A 57 by Dott brought the score back to 13 - 12 but that was as close as he got .
The 29th became the longest frame of the match , with Robertson taking 48 minutes to stretch his lead to 16 - 13 .
Even the Scot looked frustrated with the pace of the game and after smashing the pack in the next , no less than three reds stopped in the jaws of the pockets to hand Robertson the frame which put him on the verge of victory .
And after a 53 break in the last , a famous victory was in the bag and Robertson 's mother Alison was on hand to begin the celebrations .

A team of top federal prosecutors and investigators has taken the first steps toward a formal criminal investigation into oil giant BP ’s actions before and after the drilling rig disaster off Louisiana .
The investigators , who have been quietly gathering evidence in Louisiana over the last three weeks , are focusing on whether BP skirted federal safety regulations and misled the U.S. government by saying it could quickly clean up an environmental accident .
The team has met with U.S. attorneys and state officials in the Gulf Coast region and has sent letters to executives of BP and Transocean Ltd. , the drilling rig owner , warning them against destroying documents or other internal records .
Underscoring the gravity of the inquiry , the team is headed by Assistant Atty .
Gen. Ignacia Moreno of the environment and natural resources division and Assistant Atty .
Gen. Tony West , who heads the Justice Department ’s civil division .
The move by federal prosecutors represents an escalation in the government ’s involvement in the oil spill — from coordinating the environmental cleanup to searching for possible criminal violations .
The Justice Department ’s inquiry is a standard preliminary step taken to determine whether a formal investigation is warranted .
But even in this early stage , it has the earmarks of one of the largest investigative undertakings of the Obama administration .
In one sign of its potential scope , the Obama administration has asked for $ 10 million to be set aside to pay for the investigation .
President Obama , in a letter May 12 to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D- San Francisco ) , said the funding was needed “ to hold BP , and other responsible parties in this spill , accountable for the crisis . ”
Oil company officials said they were conducting an internal review and had been sharing information with the government .
The companies also have pledged to help clean up the oil spreading along the gulf and pay for damages .
“ I understand people want a simple answer about why this happened and who is to blame , ” said BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward .
Assistant Atty . Gen. Ronald Welch said federal investigators were pushing ahead with their inquiries .
“ The Department of Justice will take all necessary and appropriate steps to ensure that those responsible for this tragic series of events are held fully accountable , ” Welch said in a letter Tuesday to Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif. ) , who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee .
Welch said the team had put the companies on notice about the investigation .
“ The department has sent formal demands to British Petroleum , Transocean and other companies to ensure the preservation of potentially relevant information , ” he said .
“ These letters invoke federal requirements for preserving evidence in anticipation of litigation . ”
He said the team had spoken with attorneys for BP and Transocean “ to ensure they are complying with these demands . ”
Welch was responding to concerns from Boxer after she said testimony and evidence presented to her committee suggested possible “ illicit activities ” involving the oil spill .
In a May 17 letter to Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. , Boxer asked him and his department to “ review this matter with respect to civil and criminal laws related to false statements to the federal government . ”
In describing the oversight work of her committee , Boxer said the panel had uncovered statements by BP that now appeared to be “ false and misleading . ”
As an example , she identified a February 2009 document from BP to the federal Minerals Management Service .
In it , she said , BP evaluated the company ’s ability to respond to a blowout .
BP said in the document that an oil spill would have little or no effect on fish habitats because the company would use “ proven equipment and technology ” to respond to a blowout and spill and quickly contain the damage , Boxer said .
“ In the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , ” Boxer wrote in her letter to Holder , “ it does not in any way appear that there was ‘ proven equipment and technology ’ to respond to the spill , which could have tragic consequences for local economies and the natural resources of the Gulf of Mexico . ”
She also noted that after the oil rig explosion , BP said in a May 10 statement that all of its techniques underway to stop the spill “ involve significant uncertainties because they have not been tested in these conditions before . ”
“ BP said they were ready for this spill if it occurred , ” Boxer said in a committee statement .
“ Clearly they were unprepared — and dangerously so . ”
On Thursday , one of BP ’s top officials on the rig on the day of the explosion , Robert Kaluza , invoked the 5th Amendment against self - incrimination and refused to testify at a separate Coast Guard inquiry in Louisiana .
The company defended Kaluza , saying in a statement : “ Bob is a dedicated , hardworking , conscientious man .
Bob did no wrong on the Deepwater Horizon , and we will make damn sure that this comes out at the appropriate time . ”

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Oxygen may not be the staple of modern complex life that scientists once thought .
Until now , the only life forms known to live exclusively in anoxic conditions were viruses , bacteria and Archaea .
But in a new study , scientists have discovered three new multicellular marine species that appear to have never lived in aerobic conditions , and never metabolized oxygen .
The discovery of the new species , which live buried in sediment under the Mediterranean seafloor , is significant in that it marks the first observation of multicellular organisms , or metazoans , that spend their entire lifecycle under permanently anoxic conditions .
A few metazoans have been known to tolerate anoxic conditions , but only for limited periods of time .
The team of Italian and Danish researchers , Roberto Danovaro , et al. , that discovered the new life forms has identified the creatures as belonging to the animal phylum Loricifera , the most recently described animal phylum .
Loriciferans , which have a length of less than one millimeter , typically live in sediment .
The three new organisms belong to different genera ( Spinoloricus , Rugiloricus , and Pliciloricus ) , although their species have not yet been named .
Despite belonging to previously known taxonomic groups , the new species possess some radical differences compared with other metazoans .
Most significantly , the new species do not have mitochondria , the cellular organelles that use oxygen and sugar to generate the cell ’s energy .
Instead , the new loriciferans have organelles that resemble hydrogenosomes , which are used by some single - celled eukaryotes to generate energy without oxygen .
However , this is the first time that these organelles have been observed in multicellular organisms .
Previous research has indicated that hydrogenosomes may have evolved from mitochondria , while other research suggests they evolved independently .
To find the new species , the researchers carried out three oceanographic expeditions from 1998 to 2008 to search for life in the extreme environments located more than 3,000 meters ( about two miles ) under the Mediterranean Sea .
The researchers focused on an area called the L’Atalante basin , which is located off the southern coast of Greece .
As the scientists explain , this type of “ deep hypersaline anoxic basin ” was created by the flooding of mineral sediments from 5.5 million years ago .
For the past 50,000 years , the basin has possessed a dense hypersaline brine layer up to 60 meters thick .
The brine serves as a physical barrier that prohibits oxygen exchange between the water and sediment , making the basin completely oxygen - free .
In addition , the basin is rich in methane and hydrogen sulphide , and is also home to a diverse assembly of prokaryotes that have adapted to these conditions .
Because previous studies have reported the presence of cadaverous metazoans that had sunk to anoxic deep - sea sediments in the Black Sea , the researchers here stained the newly collected specimens with Rose Bengal , a protein binding stain that colors living organisms with a much greater intensity than deceased organisms , demonstrating that the new species were indeed alive .
In addition , the scientists observed specimens of the undescribed species of both genera Spinoloricus and Rugiloricus that had a large oocyte in their ovary , which showed a nucleus containing a nucleolus , providing evidence of reproduction .

“ The results reported here support the hypothesis that the loriciferans inhabiting the anoxic sediments of the L’Atalante basin have developed an obligate anaerobic metabolism and specific adaptations to live without oxygen , ” the researchers conclude .
“ Although the evolutionary / adaptative mechanisms leading to the colonization of such extreme environments by these metazoans remain an enigma , this discovery opens new perspectives for the study of metazoan life in habitats lacking molecular oxygen . ”
The work is financially supported by the EU within the framework of the HERMES ( Hot Spot Ecosystem Research on the Margins of European Seas ) and HERMIONE ( Hotspot Ecosystem Research and Man's Impact On European Seas ) projects .

Editor 's note : Fisher Stevens is an actor , director and producer .
He is a producer of " The Cove , " an Oscar - nominated film that won the best documentary award from the National Board of Review in 2009 .
He co-founded Naked Angels theater company in 1986 and co-founded GreeneStreet films in 1996 .
( CNN ) -- Before I started working on the documentary " The Cove , " I assumed like many others that dolphins and orcas enjoyed living at Sea World and other marine parks .
They always seemed to be smiling , jumping merrily around their tanks , eager to put on a show for human spectators .
However , when I met Ric O'Barry , my perspective changed .
O'Barry was the man responsible for capturing Kathy -- the original " Flipper " -- from the wild and helping to create the language used to train dolphins to do tricks and flips .
When Cathy died in his arms some years later , O'Barry realized the whole process of capturing and training dolphins was wrong .
He eventually co-wrote the book " Behind the Dolphin 's Smile , " where he explains that the smiles you see on these animals are not true reflections of happiness .
In actuality , they hate to be enclosed in their holding tanks and are often not fed until it is time to perform their daily routines .
During his time as a trainer , O'Barry learned dolphins had true feelings -- they would get depressed , stressed out , even suicidal .
In some parks , the trainers have to give the animals Maalox and Tagamet to treat the ulcers that develop from their stress .
The horrific tragedy that occurred last week at SeaWorld in Orlando , Florida , has left me deeply shaken .
My heart goes out to Dawn Brancheau and her family .
Dawn lost her life doing the job that she loved , yet I -- like O'Barry -- believe that this job should no longer exist .
We know now that the whale involved in this accident has a well - documented history of violent behavior .
SeaWorld knew of this history yet continued to exploit the animal and endanger the lives of its employees to put money in its pockets .
If this is n't a wake - up call , I do n't know what is .
At this very moment , a dozen boats in the town of Taiji , Japan , are heading out and rounding up hundreds of dolphins in a secluded cove .
The fisherman will close off the cove with nets , and with the help of employees from various dolphinariums , they will try to find the next " Flipper " among their catch .
The fishermen will snatch these beautiful creatures from their natural habitats , hoist them into nets , load them onto airplanes and drop them into a cement tank in the middle of Turkey , Korea or other nearby Asian countries .
In some ways , these animals are the lucky ones .
These dolphins escaped the fate of many of their pod mates , who are brutally slaughtered with primitive harpoons -- turning the cove into a scene straight from Melville 's " Moby Dick . "
The water turns bright red with the blood of the slain .
The fishermen then transport the meat -- despite health concerns of mercury content in the dolphins ' systems -- back to shore , where they sell it to local vendors .
It 's time for us to step up and make a difference in these animals ' lives .
Until we make marine parks obsolete , dolphins and other sea mammals will continue to be senselessly captured and slaughtered .
We can no longer fall for the argument that SeaWorld shows " make us love the dolphins and want to understand and protect them " -- this could n't be further from the truth .
As I see it , we will only truly love and understand these animals when we can watch them running wild and genuinely smiling in their natural habitat .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fisher Stevens .
From the Gulf of Mexico to the heart of big cities , nothing stands in the way of oil
I , for one , welcome my Neandertal ancestry .
It may not sound like a lot — between 1 and 4 percent .
But that ’s the equivalent of one great - great - great grandparent ’s DNA contribution .
In the case of the Neandertal contribution , more than 1500 generations ago , it ’s an enduring legacy of an ancient group of people , spread across many lines of the genealogies of living people .
Beyond their genealogical interest , Neandertal genes might have made a big difference to our evolutionary potential .
In case you wonder what the heck I ’m talking about , here ’s the story :
Two new papers in Science describe the full draft sequence of the Neandertal genome , and perform additional analyses to understand the pattern of adaptive evolution in the population ancestral to living people .
Richard Green and colleagues report on the genome , demonstrating very convincingly that present - day people have Neandertal ancestors .
It is not entirely obvious when and where the gene flow between Neandertals and other ancient populations happened — whether it was associated with the dispersal of most of our ancestry from Africa , or whether it may have been earlier .
The gene flow was not limited to Europe , and evidence for Neandertal ancestry occurs in East Asian and Australasian populations .
The paper is full of other good stuff , including some evidence about which gene regions changed under selection in the ancestral human population .
Meanwhile , the second paper by Burbano and colleagues applies new microarray techniques to assess how much of the human legacy of amino acid changes has arisen in the latest , post - Neandertal period of our evolution .
So there ’s a lot about the pattern of evolution and gene flow leading to living people , and a lot about adaptive and functional evolution .
That makes a lot for me to cover – and while I have the papers a little early , time is short .
Let ’s see how much I can help clarify what ’s in this new research .
If you had to sum up in a few words , what does this mean for paleoanthropology ?
These scientists have given an immense gift to humanity .
I ’ve been comparing it to the pictures of Earth that came back from Apollo 8 .
The Neandertal genome gives us a picture of ourselves , from the outside looking in .
We can see , and now learn about , the essential genetic changes that make us human – the things that made our emergence as a global species possible .
And in doing so , they ’ve taken a forgotten group of people – whom even most anthropologists had given up on — and they ’ve restored them to their rightful place in our heritage .
Beyond that , they ’ve taken all of their data and deposited it in a public database , so that the rest of us can inspect them , replicate results , and learn new things from them .
High school kids can download this stuff and do science fair projects on Neandertal genomics .
This is what anthropology ought to be .
What did they sequence ?
The Max Planck group obtained most of their genomic sequence from three specimens from Vindija — Vi33.16 , Vi33.25 , and Vi33.26 .
These are all postcranial fragments with minimal anatomical information .
Green and colleagues were able to establish that the three bones represent different women , and that Vi33.16 and Vi33.26 may represent maternal relatives .
From these skeletons they got 5.3 billion bases of sequence .
All this from an amount of bone powder about equal in mass to an aspirin pill .
Amazing .
I mean , I know the folks at Max Planck are reading this .
It ’s inspiring to see what they ’ve been able to do .
These are three pieces of barely diagnostic hominin bone , and they ’ve obtained literally hundreds of times more information than we have ever gotten from the fossil record of Neandertals .
I ’ll describe the analyses of genetic similarity with humans in more detail below .
As a brief summary , of those positions where the human genome differs from chimpanzees , Neandertals have the chimpanzee version around 12.7 percent of the time – meaning that across the genome , a Neandertal and a human will share a genetic ancestor an average of around 800,000 years ago .
This is a couple hundred thousand years higher than the same number if we compare two humans to each other .
The higher age of genetic common ancestors reflects partial isolation between the Neandertal population and the African populations that gave rise to most of our current genetic variation .
The team were able to identify 111 candidate duplications , almost all of which have some evidence of copy number variation in humans or other primates .
They tentatively show that Neandertals have a bit more copy number variation than present - day humans , and identify a few loci with substantially higher copy numbers in one group or the other .
A substantial part of the paper is dedicated to finding evidence of positive selection on the human lineage after the emergence of Neandertals .
The idea is to look for fixed selective sweeps – regions where humans are likely to have SNPs absent in Neandertals and a relatively shallow gene tree .
They identify 212 regions like this — as I discuss below , a surprisingly low number .
The second paper , by Hernán Burbano and colleagues , describes the application of a targeted microarray to probe Neandertal genetic samples for protein - coding variants that separate humans from chimpanzees .
They identify 88 amino acid substitutions that seem fixed in the known sample of living humans , but not present in the Neandertal sequence .
Those 88 are not necessarily all functionally important , although this list will include a number of “ structural ” genetic changes that make a difference to proteins expressed worldwide today .
There is much to come in analyzing the categories and genes represented in both lists , which may tell us very interesting things about our Late Pleistocene evolution .
What is the evidence for interbreeding ?
From their initial work sequencing the nuclear genome in Neandertals , the Max Planck group has followed a clever strategy :
Do n’t look at the Neandertal sequence to see what humans share , look at human variation to see which version the Neandertal sequence has .
The strategy is smart because it helps to obviate some major problems with ancient DNA — you do n’t have all the parts , and the parts you do have probably contain a lot of sequencing errors of various kinds .
By looking first at sites that vary within humans ( or , in some comparisons , between humans and chimpanzees ) , we can focus on a very simple question – did the Neandertal have one version , or the other ?
Applied to human variation today , there are several ways we might use a Neandertal genome test the hypothesis of no interbreeding .
Green and colleagues focus on two complementary approaches .
Approach 1 : If Neandertals contributed no genes to living populations , then they should be equally related to all living people , no matter where in the world those people live .
Green and colleagues show that the Neandertal genome is closer to some humans than others .
People whose ancestry lies outside Africa are significantly more like Neandertals than are people who live in Africa today .
In this study , the authors include whole genomes from people in France , China and Papua New Guinea outside Africa , and Yoruba and San inside Africa .
The Africans are not as close to the Neandertal as any of the non-Africans .
That does n’t mean that non-Africans derive most of their genes from Neandertals – in fact , as I describe below , the proportion is quite small .
Living people are more like each other – even non-Africans and Africans – than any of them are like Neandertals .
The point is that despite this great similarity of living people , we have genetic variants that we share with the Neandertal genome , and that proportion is a lot higher outside Africa than inside it .
The natural conclusion is the Neandertals contributed more genes to non-Africans than to Africans .
One thing is for sure :
You ca n’t explain this observation under the hypothesis that a small , African population expanded out of Africa without interbreeding with Neandertals along the way .
Approach 2 : Look at the genes most likely to represent ancient population structure , the ones with deep roots outside Africa .
This is an idea that we came up with to look for genes in living humans that might have come in from Neandertals or other ancient populations ( for example , we described it in our 2008 review ) .
Look for the parts of the genome with the deepest genealogical roots outside of Africa .
Those are candidates for Neandertal gene flow – a high chance that one of the two sides of that deep root was present outside of Africa for hundreds of thousands of years .
Green and colleagues took this idea to the next level .
They found parts of the genome where non-Africans have a deep root and Africans do n’t .
Then they looked at the Neandertal sequence .
Out of the 12 regions they identified with deep roots outside Africa , they found that the Neandertals had the deep , non-African specific version in 10 of those .
I mean , there ’s really not any other way you can explain this .
We got those genes from Neandertals .
Every one of those loci is a region where some people have a Neandertal - derived allele , and others do n’t .
Those particular 10 loci are a small fraction of the overall Neandertal - derived element of our heritage – because they used Perlegen SNPs to find them , they ended up with regions that are fairly long ( 100 kb or more in length ) .
Those are probably all really interesting , but there will be more of them when we can reliably identify smaller segments with deep genealogies .
Could the results have been caused by contamination ?
Green and colleagues are utterly convincing about the level of contamination in their sequence .
They have employed several independent checks , all of which arrive at the same conclusion :
The modern human contamination in almost all their comparisons is limited to significantly less than one percent – and for autosomal sequence they can give a tight estimate of 0.7 percent contaminating sequence .
The methods that Green and colleagues used to test for a Neandertal contribution to non-African populations are not likely to be strongly influenced by contamination .
The probe for deep roots in particular is extremely unlikely to be influenced by contamination in the Neandertal sequence .
The very low contamination rate , and methods that should be robust to some contamination , means that we can be very confident in their result .
How much Neandertal ancestry do we have ?
The Neandertal contribution does not make up a major proportion of any population , even outside of Africa .
Green and colleagues apply a population model that involves isolation between ancestral Neandertal and African populations , a dispersal from Africa into Eurasia , and subsequent mixture with the Neandertals .
Under this model , the estimated fraction of Neandertal ancestry for non-African populations today is between 1 and 4 percent .
Now , let ’s put on our skeptics ’ hats .
Is this the right model ?
If Neandertal and African populations had not been isolated , then the amount of mixture after an out - of - Africa dispersal would be lower .
On the other hand , the dispersing African population would already be part Neandertal , because of genetic mixture .
The proportion of ancestry from ancestral Neandertals would be around the same amount , it would just be distributed across a longer time .
They did not examine the question of how much of the genome came in from Neandertals because of selection .
The estimate they have , between 1 and 4 percent , is so high that this is not just a few genes introgressing in from Neandertals – it is a big fraction of the neutral , non-coding part of the genome .
So selection does n’t explain the similarity , nor can parallelism – the similarity is genome - wide , not just coding or functional changes , and not as far as we know clustered into regions that might have hitchhiked with adaptive alleles .
But there ’s clearly a lot more to do , characterizing the functional implications of some regions , testing for selection , and finding Neandertal variants that might have reached very high frequencies in later populations .
To the extent that selection has influenced the pattern , it will also throw off the simple population model .
But it does n’t throw off the fraction of Neandertal ancestry — if it ’s three percent , it does n’t matter whether it was selected or neutral , it ’s still three percent .
So the bottom line is , the fraction is going to be about right , regardless of the mechanism by which the genetic mixture happened .
Can we please take off our skeptics ' hats ?
It 's getting in the way of my Neandertal victory dance .
No .
All the cool paleoanthropologists wear hats .
What about population structure within Africa ?
Could that explain the apparent Neandertal contribution ?
We ’ve known about the occasional deep - rooted genealogies outside Africa for a long time ( and Jeff Wall ’s work , as an example among others , has explained that pattern as archaic human mixture into non-Africans ) .
They ’ve been talking about something like five percent of the human genome coming from admixture with ancient groups outside of Africa .
So this should n’t come as a shock .
Until now , though , it has been possible for some people to wave these results away .
We did n’t really know that any of those deep roots were in archaic humans , and after all , who ’s to say that they are n’t variants that originated in Africa and have since been lost there , or that we have n’t found them yet ?
African variation is great , and if you imagine that some variation might have once existed in northeastern Africa and was subsequently lost within African populations , that might look like admixture with archaic humans outside of Africa .
This line of argument is now special pleading .
Why would we posit a cryptic mystery population in Africa , which happens to look genetically identical to Neandertals , but has subsequently disappeared ?
A big fraction of deep genealogies outside Africa really are in Neandertals .
By far the simplest explanation is that today ’s non-Africans got them from ancient non-Africans .
This is no surprise – that ’s where the data have been pointing now for five years .
Yet Africans are a lot more diverse than other populations , and this diversity itself does reflect the dynamics of the ancient African population .
The Neandertals are n’t so different from that pattern that now still exists within Africa – they ’re extending the notion that “ modern ” is something that ’s been evolving for a long time .
I expect we ’ll be able to come to a better understanding of ancient population interactions within Africa , by understanding the parts of the genome that have come from Neandertals outside of Africa .
Could the gene flow be due to ancient interactions between West Asia and Africa ?
Green and colleagues suggest that at most few genes from modern humans ended up in Neandertals .
That is , although they find lots of evidence of old - looking genes in us that are shared with the Neandertal genome , they find few cases of new - looking genes in us that are shared with that genome .
That might suggest several things about interactions between Africa and West Asia and Europe during the Middle to Late Pleistocene .
For example , if there had been high gene flow from Africa into West Asia after the first appearance of a distinct Neandertal population , maybe 200,000 to 400,000 years ago , we might expect to find some new - looking genes in humans that Neandertals also got .
On the other hand , the data are from European Neandertals , who are at the end of a fairly long chain of populations from Northeast Africa .
If gene flow had been ongoing into the Levant or further into West Asia during the last 200,000 years , it ’s not obvious how many of these genes would have made it into Europe .
The rapid mitochondrial DNA coalescence of Neandertals does suggest substantial mobility in the population across Central Asia to Western Europe .
But maybe that apparent dynamism had a boost from mtDNA selection .
So just on the data , I do n’t think we know yet whether this is gene flow in the Levant 200,000 or 100,000 years ago , or whether it ’s genes coming from West Asian Neandertals into dispersing Africans after 100,000 years ago .
I expect all are likely .
I have some ideas how to test some of these things , and we will get started immediately .
The lack of apparent mixture of " modern " genes into Neandertals -- what does it mean ?
It means that a model of one - way gene flow from Neandertals into us can explain the pattern of genetic similarity .
The authors explain this as a function of population expansion .
The expanding population ( us ) picks up some Neandertal genes that expand in numbers , while the contracting population ( Neandertals ) does n’t have a chance to pick up as many genes because it is declining in numbers .
That model seems plausible , particularly in comparison with historical cases of population contact .
On the other hand , the three Neandertals from which most of the genome sequence was derived all date to before 40,000 years ago .
There were n’t any modern humans around for them to have interacted with around Vindija at that time .
So should we be surprised that they do n’t have genes of modern humans ?
A more interesting question was posed to me by a very sharp journalist :
What would we expect the result to have been if they had sequenced a Near Eastern Neandertal , like Amud , for example ?
The answer seems obvious – the admixture fraction should have been higher .
That population , which is the most likely to have been the source of mixture , must have been somewhat genetically different from the European Neandertals .
Any extent of genetic differentiation between them would make the European Neandertals look less like non-Africans today than the Near Eastern ones .
I ’ll have more to say about these Near Eastern Neandertals in the next few days .
But wait a minute .
I thought the mitochondrial DNA proved that Neandertals are extinct !
Selection .
Selection .
Selection .
I ’ve been saying it for years .
I ’ve published it .
Will you learn to listen to me , already ?
The mtDNA of Neandertals is gone because it conferred some disadvantage .
There are many reasons to suspect this – the Neandertal variation is itself apparently recently derived ; the human variation is clearly in disequilibrium , especially outside Africa ; the mtDNA genes affect functions that differ greatly in Neandertal and recent populations , including energetics , longevity , and brain ; there are clear signs of mtDNA selection in many recent human populations .
Mitochondrial DNA is useful for a lot of reasons , but nobody should ever have relied on it alone as evidence of Neandertal population dynamics .
Is it really true that there is no variation in Neandertal ancestry outside Africa ?
The comparisons in the paper are highly convincing because of the sheer amount of sequence taken from the sampled individuals .
A single gene locus from an individual may be unrepresentative of the person ’s population , but averaged across the whole genome , the difference between two people from distant populations is very , very close to the difference between the two populations .
But they sampled very few individuals .
So we are left with a question – do we really know we ’ve sampled variation outside Africa enough to make regional estimates of Neandertal gene flow ?
I think we could do better with more genomes .
For example , when it comes to finding deep genealogies , we need to be able to find shorter regions than the ones used by Green and colleagues .
That will expand the sample of candidate loci , and will catch some Neandertal - derived genes that we ’re missing now .
Moreover , if gene flow was really around 1 - 4 percent , many SNPs that came in from Neandertals will be rare enough to be missing from the big SNP genotyping samples .
We may find some variants with whole - genome sequencing on larger samples that will be worth examining .
But most important , we ’ll be able to develop strategies based on this success to find ancient population structure involving groups where we do n’t yet have the DNA – like populations of South and East Asia .
Some of those may give us the chance to test those methods soon , as for the Denisova individual .
Is this multiregional evolution , or just out - of - Africa with some leakage of earlier Eurasian genes ?
Out - of - Africa movement was a major mechanism of recent human evolution .
The genetic ancestry of living people is multiregional .
I see no contradiction between those statements .
From now on , we are all multiregionalists trying to explain the out - of - Africa pattern .
There was clearly a dispersal of African genes into the rest of the world during the Late Pleistocene , sometime between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago .
Living people everywhere on Earth derive more than 90 percent of their genes from African populations who lived 100,000 years ago .
That much is plain .
( Why did I not write “ more than 96 percent ? ” See below . )
These genetic observations require some kind of out - of - Africa event .
This event was not limited to a few genes , and selection of a few genes even with substantial hitchhiking of surrounding genome cannot account for the pattern .
There must have been some kind of demographic expansion including African - derived populations and preferentially excluding the genes of Eurasian populations like the Neandertals .
Selection on a gene network might have mediated the expansion , as suggested by Eswaran ( 2002 ) .
Or the expansion might have been culturally or technologically mediated , as many other people have suggested .
Those are hypotheses about mechanisms .
How did it come to be that living people trace the overwhelming majority of their ancestry to Africa within the last 100,000 years ?
These explanations may answer that question .
The present study shows that Neandertals were at a minimum partially isolated from their contemporaries in Africa , and that the genetic divergence between those populations was larger than the genetic differences between European , Asian , and African populations today .
Yet those Neandertals are among our ancestors .
Late Pleistocene humans had multiregional origins , and the evolution of the Neandertals was itself a case of relatively recent population dispersal from Africa or West Asia .
Human and Neandertal genes mostly derive from common genetic ancestors between 400,000 and a million years ago – much , much later than the initial habitation of Eurasia 1.8 million years ago .
But 1 - 4 percent is so minor , can it be an important part of our evolution ?
There are three things you have to ask about the fraction of Neandertal ancestry .
1 . How much gene flow would it take to guarantee that anything adaptive in the Neandertal population survived into later people ?
The answer to that question is simple – it takes a few dozen matings to get most adaptive genes into our population .
If there was a lot of interference with the genetic background , it might take more – just to make sure that the advantageous alleles had a chance to be de-linked from the genetic background .
If Neandertals are one percent of the ancestry of non-Africans , we can be very sure that any gene in a Neandertal that had adaptive value in the later population is here now .
That means they were important in an evolutionary sense .
2 . What fraction of the human population 50,000 years ago were Neandertals ?
This is very important – when it comes to neutral genetic loci , the essential question is how much the Neandertals may be underrepresented today relative to their numbers in the past .
Is three percent too low ?
It seems very unlikely that the fraction of Neandertals compared to the rest of humans was as high as 10 percent – we know that Africa already had a large population 50,000 years ago , and everything we know about Neandertals suggests a very low population density , an effective size much smaller than 10,000 individuals .
Were five percent of the people on Earth 50,000 years ago Neandertals ?
We do n’t really know the answers , but now we have a chance to test hypotheses about ancient population size and expansion in Neandertals .
My point at the moment is only this :
If today Neandertal genes make up only one percent of the gene pool of the 5 billion people outside Africa , that ’s the genetic equivalent of 50 million Neandertals .
In relative terms , their contribution to our population may be a reduction from their fraction of the Late Pleistocene population .
Not that great a reduction , not a massive crash to zero .
A reduction in the wake of the out - of - Africa movement , possibly from five percent to three .
3 . How many Neandertals are there with us now ?
You might think the answer to this is obviously zero .
But in genetic terms , we can ask , how many times has the average Neandertal - derived gene been replicated in our present gene pool ?
Those are n’t Neandertal individuals – that is , a forensic anthropologist would n’t classify them as Neandertals .
They ’re the genetic equivalent .
The answer to this is also simple :
In absolute terms , the Neandertals are here around us , yawping from the rooftops .
There are more than five billion people living outside of Africa today .
If they are one percent Neandertal , that ’s the genetic equivalent of fifty million Neandertals walking the Earth around us .
Does that sound minor ?
If I told you that your average gene would be replicated into fifty million copies in the future , would you be satisfied ?
Maybe your ambition is greater , but I think the Neandertals have done very well for themselves .
Does this mean that Neandertals belong in our species , Homo sapiens ?
Yes .
Interbreeding with fertile offspring in nature .
That ’s the biological species concept .
Now , some paleontologists might still disagree – maintaining that species are units that can be distinguished morphologically , or by one or more derived features , or any number of other definitions .
That ’s fine with me , as long as they ’re clear .
But understand :
It does define all non-Africans today as an interspecific hybrid population .
So maybe they want to rethink that one ?
If Eurasians got less than 4 percent from Neandertals , does n't that mean that they got more than 96 percent from Africa ?
I look at the 1 - 4 percent estimate as a minimum , for several reasons .
As I ’ll note below , this estimate mainly refers to the excess Neandertal ancestry outside Africa , which means there may be some additional amount that both recent African and non-African populations share .
But more important , Neandertals were n’t the only people living in Eurasia 100,000 years ago .
China did n’t have Neandertals , nor did Southeast Asia and Java .
India was full of hominins , which might or might not have shared substantial genetic similarity with Neandertals .
They ’re close enough to the known Neandertal range to speculate that they may have been close , but the only available fossil , the Middle Pleistocene Narmada skull , is not very informative .
Any of these populations might have been genetically different from Neandertals , and might have also contributed genes to present - day human populations – genes that would n’t show up by scanning the Neandertal genome .
The recent genetic sequencing of the Denisova pinky ( a.k.a. the X - woman ) from the Altai Mountains reminds us that these populations outside of Africa may have been quite a bit closer to us , genetically , than we might have expected from the 1.8 - million - year record of humans outside Africa .
These populations were dynamic in ways that many paleoanthropologists have n’t yet appreciated .
Do living Africans have Neandertal ancestry , too ?
I think that the present study does n’t have the power to answer this question , at least with the design that the authors used .
The fact that living Africans are less genetically similar to the Neandertals is extremely important evidence of the Neandertals ’ genetic contribution to populations outside Africa .
But it does n’t bear on how much back - migration into Africa may have happened .
We know that the answer is nonzero , because Africa has received immigrants from other parts of the world during historic times .
The same genetic patterns that reflect population contacts up and down the East African coast , and across the Sahara into West Africa , show the possible conduits for the flow of Neandertal - derived genes into African populations .
But how much genetic dispersal into Africa happened in LSA or late MSA times ?
Mitochondrial and Y chromosome distributions in Northeast Africa suggest there was been some .
Nevertheless , Africa would have been a very difficult place to return , for humans who had begun adapting to different ecological and disease environment .
I think that some Neandertal genes might have made it back into Africa , even in ancient times , but I would n’t be surprised if that number was small .
The big shoe left to drop is the extent of population differentiation within Africa during MSA times .
So far we ’ve seen hints that these populations might have been nearly as differentiated from each other as they were from Neandertals , with substantial gene flow homogenizing them in the last 30,000 years .
This paper includes an additional Bushman genome , after the four published earlier this year .
Comparing that new genome to the Neandertals , its modal difference from the human reference ( Hg18 ) genome is between the other humans and the Neandertal .
Not quite halfway between , but nearly so .
There ’s a lot of genomic variation within Africa , and exploring the population history that explains that variation may turn up some surprises .
What about recent selection ?
One of the really exciting aspects of this work is that both Green and colleagues and Burbano and colleagues look for things that all humans today share but Neandertals lack .
You might call these “ the genes that make us modern , ” although functionally we have little idea what any of them do .
Both papers show one thing that is extremely interesting :
There are n’t very many such genetic changes .
Burbano and colleagues put together a microarray including all the amino acid changes inferred to have happened on the human lineage .
They used this to genotype the Neandertal DNA , and show that out of more than 10,000 amino acid changes that happened in human evolution , only 88 of them are shared by humans today but not present in the Neandertals .
That ’s amazingly few .
Green and colleagues did a similar exercise , except they went looking for “ selective sweeps ” in the ancestors of today ’s ’ humans .
These are regions of the genome that have an unusually low amount of incomplete lineage sorting with Neandertals , and therefore represent shallow genealogies for all living people .
They identify 212 regions that seem to be new selected genes present in humans and not in Neandertals .
This number is probably fairly close to the real number of selected changes in the ancestry of modern humans , because it includes non-coding changes that might have been selected .
Again , that ’s really a small number .
We have roughly 200,000 - 300,000 years for these to have occurred on the human lineage – after the inferred population divergence with Neandertals , but early enough that one of these selected genes could reach fixation in the expanding and dispersing human population .
That makes roughly one selected substitution per 1000 years .
Which is more or less the rate that we infer by comparing humans and chimpanzees .
What this means is simple :
The origin of modern humans was nothing special , in adaptive terms .
To the extent that we can see adaptive genetic changes , they happened at the basic long - term rate that they happened during the rest of our evolution .
Now from my perspective , this means something even more interesting .
In our earlier work , we inferred a recent acceleration of human evolution from living human populations .
That is a measure of the number of new selected mutations that have arisen very recently , within the last 40,000 years .
And most of those happened within the past 10,000 years .
In that short time period , more than a couple thousand selected changes arose in the different human populations we surveyed .
We demonstrated that this was a genuine acceleration , because it is much higher than the rate that could have occurred across human evolution , from the human - chimpanzee ancestor .
What we now know is that this is a genuine acceleration compared to the evolution of modern humans , within the last couple hundred thousand years .
Our recent evolution , after the dispersal of human populations across the world , was much faster than the evolution of Late Pleistocene populations .
In adaptive terms , it is really true – we ’re more different from early “ modern ” humans today , than they were from Neandertals .
Possibly many times more different .
More ?
That ’s what I have time for now , if I want to get this posted .
There is much , much more to say on the topic , and you can bet it will be all Neandertals all the time here for the foreseeable future .

NEW YORK -
The biggest U.S. city may call for a cut in the Pentagon budget to fund domestic needs , if City Council member Letitia James has her way .
James announced she will introduce a council resolution this month asking the state ’s congressional delegation to seek cuts in the proposed military budget to provide funding to state and local governments to deal with massive budget deficits throughout the country .
New York City is presently facing a $ 4.9 billion deficit .
To resolve the deficit , the mayor has proposed draconian cuts to essential city services and jobs .
Meanwhile , the nation ’s military budget is at a record high .
The resolution calls for transferring military spending to support job creation , affordable housing , anti-hunger programs , environmental protection , education and other essential human needs .
Supporters include community groups and New York ’s Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand , D , who are seeking an additional $ 4 billion annually as part of the reauthorization of federal child nutrition programs , such as WIC and school meals .
Presently , the Senate Agriculture Committee is proposing only a $ 450 million increase .
Since the City Council has no real sway over foreign policy , the resolution will be mainly symbolic .
But James believes the resolution will pass with broad support , and encourage members of the community to take action .
She is working with the council ’s newly formed progressive caucus and other members .
Beyond that , she said , it is up to the people of New York City to reach their congressional representatives to get action from Washington .
Anti-hunger and peace groups joined James at a City Hall press conference and rally on April 15 , Tax dDy , calling for military cuts to fund the budget deficits and human needs .
James was introduced by Mark Dunlea of the Hunger Action Network of New York State .
She focusing her remarks on the needs of children , the elderly and the unemployed .
She pointed out that though the official unemployment rate in the city is 10.2 percent , the real figure is three times that number .
Christy Robb of Hour Children , a Long Island City - based family service organization , spoke of the growing number of people going hungry and the lacking of resources to meet their needs .
“ There has been no talk about extra federal dollars for food this year and now we have Mayor Bloomberg talking about cutting the emergency food aid program and Governor Paterson talking about cutting the Hunger Prevention and Nutrition Assistance Program , ” she said .
Matt Weinstein of Brooklyn for Peace noted that the mayor of Binghamton , N.Y. , Matthew T. Ryan , has put up at his City Hall a device displaying a running tally of the cost of current wars and occupations , highlighting the enormous burden the military budget is putting on Binghamton and other cities around the country .
Mayor Bloomberg , Weinstein said , only concerns himself with keeping Wall Street in the money .

I have yet to read an account of the Tea Party movement which makes any sort of comprehensive sense .
What passes for " commentary " on the subject is mostly ideologically - driven spin from the " left " or " right , " both of which see the movement as a handy rhetorical device they can mock or co-opt to make their same old tired " talking points . "
My own sense is that a coherent account of the Tea Party movement must be far more nuanced and historically informed .
The standard - issue pundit / commentator 's ignorance of American history is so abysmal that it is little wonder that commentary on the movement is so threadbare .
To the frustration of those MSM pundits and Party ideologues seeking a sound - bite summary , the Tea Party movement is neither fully formed nor monolithic .
There are Democratic Tea Party types , quasi-Libertarians -- an entire spectrum of causes and emotional drivers loosely bound up under the one banner .
The comically self - serving frenzy of the Democrats and the blatant desperation to co-opt the movement by the Republicans are less reflective of the Tea Party than they are of the parties ' own fears and failures .
The " progressives " either ignore the Tea Party 's influence and gatherings , hoping not to encourage it with exposure , or they mock and discredit it by focusing on the inevitable self - aggrandizing grand - standers who appear like locusts whenever a new political movement is self - assembling .
What is striking to me is how the MSM coverage reflects -- but does not comment on in a self - aware fashion -- the stark terror aroused in the status quo by the Tea Party movement .
The Tea Party is creating fear and loathing in the status quo ( Demopublicans and Savior State / Financial Plutocracy partnership ) because it is the only potential political threat to the Savior State 's protected fiefdoms and the financial / corporate Elites .
The Savior State is unprepared to deal with anyone who can't be bought off with a few crumbs of entitlement / bread and circuses .
As I discuss in Survival+ , the Savior State is partnered with the nation 's Financial and corporate / cartel Power Elites .
To keep the lower - income masses politicially subservient , compliant and thus complicit in the rule by Elites and Savior State fiefdoms ( public unions , sickcare and defense cartels , etc. ) , the Savior State distributes food stamps , extended unemployment , tax credits and other forms of " free money " to the underclass to keep them distracted , fed and politically neutered .
The status quo's private - sector propaganda division , the Mainstream Media ( dominated by a handful of global corporations ) , provides plentiful " entertainment " to the masses while the Government Ministries of Propaganda distribute endless reams of phony data and manipulated statistics to support the " confidence building " view that the status quo is firmly in charge and thus resistance is both needless ( because everything 's going great ) and futile ( because you 're so powerless and we 're so powerful ) .
The ideal state of affairs for the Savior State status quo is complacency , complicity and a pervasive fatalism that the status quo is permanent and godlike and there is no point in resisting it .
The incentives are all to join in the fun and game the system as rapaciously as you can via liar loans , credit card debt you never intend to pay off , speculation in stocks and housing as a replacement for actually producing value in the real world , trumped - up resumes , bogus balance sheets , cheating on entrance exams , etc .
Into this comfortable world of protected State fiefdoms , Financial Overlords and fatalistic complicity in an economy based on lies , debt and speculative bubbles comes the Tea Party .
The Tea Party participants are fueled by a deep and abiding awareness that the country is going down the wrong path , not just in a political or financial context but in a moral , values - based sense .
( The three are interconnected , after all . )
The standard - issue sneering " progressive " pundit openly mocks the working - class roots of the movement , and spares no smear in attempting to discredit it : it 's racist , led by show - boaters and nutters , etc .
ARM Holdings and Apple go way back and on Thursday the market was taking the view their relationship could be about to become even tighter .
Shares in the Cambridge - based chip designer soared to an eight - year high as rumours continued to circulate that Apple may have ARM in its sights as an acquisition target .
But before speculators get too carried away , Arm 's chief executive Warren East reminds everyone to look at the economics .
With ARM 's market capitalisation at more than £ 3bn why fork out a fortune to own it when Apple and others can license the designs at a fraction of that ?
" Exciting though it is to have the share price pushed up by these rumours , common sense tells us that our standard business model is an excellent way for technology companies to gain access to our technology .
Nobody has to buy the company , " East told the Guardian .
At the root of the rumours , ARM 's microchips can be found in most of the world 's mobile phones , including Apple 's iPhone .
As consumer demand for smartphones grow and as the devices get smarter , they will need more of Arm 's designs .
Having said that , Apple now owns its own chip designer – PA Semi .
The talk left ARM 's shares up 8.4 p , or 3.4 % , to 258.9 p , the highest since April 2002 and made them the day's top performers on the FTSE 100 .
The bluechip index had a punishing day overall as new worries about Greece 's deficit rattled nerves around the world - something that pushed the euro close to a 12 - week low against the pound .
The FTSE 100 finished down 58.1 points , or 1 % , at 5665.3 adding to steep losses made on Wednesday as miners sold off for a second day .
Although the flight ban was over , worries about volcanic ash - related losses continued to weigh on British Airways and it was one of the day 's biggest fallers down 8 p , or 3.4 % , at 225.5 p .
Assessing the fallout , analysts at ratings agency Fitch commented that Lufthansa and Air France - KLM were likely to have been hit the worst in absolute terms but that BA was the longest affected with a 100 % network closure lasting almost six days .
" The industry recovery is at a fragile stage and this significant flight disruption is likely to delay the progress European airlines had made towards improving credit metrics .
As the industry remains in a weak financial position , it now cannot afford any further large shocks without jeopardising its creditworthiness , " said Fitch 's Sabrina Ran .
Looking ahead to next week there was a boost to Unilever from a broker upgrade and as rival food group Nestle posted an upbeat outlook .
Analysts at Panmure Gordon expect " good " first quarter results when the soup - to - soap marker reports next Thursday and believe that after trading in the doldrums for some time the shares will soon take off .
They raised their recommendation to " buy " from " hold " and increased their price target to £ 23.00 from £ 20.00 , a vote of confidence that left Unilever shares up 21 p , or 1.1 % , at £ 19.61 .
When most people discuss how the Federal Reserve benefits the big banks , they usually only focus on the ways that the Federal Reserve directly brings in income .
But there is so much more to it than that .
The truth is that the Federal Reserve is used in a whole variety of ways to indirectly assist the big banks in making huge gobs of money .
One of the ways this is currently being accomplished is through the U.S. Treasury carry trade .
So how does this carry trade work ?
Well , it basically has three steps and it works something like this ….
#1) Mr. Big Bank goes over to the Federal Reserve and says , “ Hey Mr. Federal Reserve – please loan me a big bag of cash for next to nothing . ”
Of course , the Federal Reserve is more than happy to loan it to him .
# 2) Mr. Big
Bank then invests the same big bag of cash into U.S. Tresuries which have a much higher interest rate than what Mr. Big Bank just borrowed at .
To give you an idea , 10 - year U.S. Treasuries are earning around 3 and a half percent right now .
# 3) Mr. Big Bank sits back and enjoys the huge amount of risk - free cash which comes pouring in .
This little three step procedure helped enable four of the biggest U.S. banks ( Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America and Citigroup ) to have a “ perfect quarter ” during the first quarter of 2010 .
What that means is that these four banks had zero days of trading losses in the first quarter .
Would n’t you like to have a perfect batting average ?
Do n’t you wish you could pitch a perfect game every time ?
Well , it certainly helps when you are being subsidized by the Federal Reserve as Bloomberg recently explained ….
The trading results , which helped the banks report higher quarterly profit than analysts estimated even as unemployment stagnated at a 27 - year high , came with a big assist from the Federal Reserve .
The U.S. central bank helped lenders by holding short - term borrowing costs near zero , giving them a chance to profit by carrying even 10 - year government notes that yielded an average of 3.70 percent last quarter .
Does n’t it just seem like whenever we turn around the Federal Reserve is doing something new to “ help out ” the big banks ?
This is just getting ridiculous .
Remember all of that talk about how the U.S. government had to help out Wall Street so that they could help out Main Street ?
Well , a ton of money did get injected into the banking system .
In fact , the Federal Reserve pumped hundreds upon hundreds of billions of dollars into the banking system since the beginning of the financial crisis .
This has caused the U.S. monetary base to explode … .
So did the big banks use all of that money to help out Main Street ?
No .
In fact , business lending by the big banks has been falling precipitously .
So what have the big banks been doing with all of that money ?
Buying U.S. government debt of course ….
So instead of making loans to American businesses who desperately needed it , most of this new money has gone to pump up yet another bubble .
This time the bubble is in U.S. Treasuries .
Asia
Times recently described how this trillion - dollar carry trade in U.S. government securities is setting up a very dangerous situation ….
Remarkably , the most aggressive buyers of US government debt during the past several months have been global banks domiciled in London and the Cayman Islands .
They borrow at 20 basis points ( a fifth of a percentage point ) and buy Treasury securities paying 1 % to 3 % , depending on maturity .
This is the famous “ carry trade ” , by which banks or hedge funds borrow short - term at a very low rate and lend medium - or long - term at a higher rate .
This works as long as short - term rates remain extremely low .
The moment that borrowing costs begin to rise , the trillion - dollar carry trade in US government securities will collapse .
But as long as the gravy train of the U.S.
Treasury carry trade continues , why should the big banks make risky loans to American businesses and consumers when increasing numbers of them are turning out to be deadbeats anyway ?
That is a good question .
Meanwhile , we have this sick situation where the Federal Reserve subsidizes the big banks and enables them to buy up a big chunk of the debt the U.S. government is constantly churning out .
Our national banking resources are increasingly being turned away from building up our once great system of free enterprise , and instead are being devoted to servicing the never ending spiral of government debt and funny money that we have created .
But a bunch of folks down on Wall Street are getting exceedingly rich from this little game , so they certainly are n’t going to complain about it .
And as long as the vast majority of Americans continue to stay in the dark about all of this , the bouncing ball will just continue to keep rolling .
Intense lightning storms mixed with ash clouds to electrify the night sky over Iceland 's Eyjafjallajökull volcano on Sunday .
Cheese is not something that people often think to make at home , but there is nothing in the world quite like fresh ricotta cheese .
Surprisingly easy to make , this staple ( in my house ) is above and beyond store - bought ricotta .
I often use this in our other staple , lasagna , and we even eat it plain in a bowl with a little salt and pepper , as we would eat cottage cheese .
Ricotta is one of the easiest cheeses to make at home as it requires no rennet ( special enzymes to curdle the milk ) nor does it require any aging or care .
It is the ‘ lazy person ’s ’ cheese , so to speak , but there is nothing lazy about how fast I eat it .
Ingredients
1 gallon whole milk
1 pint heavy cream
1 quart buttermilk
4 teaspoons salt
4 tablespoons lemon juice
You will also need a thermometer , sieve or colander , and some cheesecloth .
Directions
1. Combine the milk , buttermilk , cream , and salt in a non-reactive pan .
2 . Prepare the colander for the draining process by moistening a few sheets of cheesecloth and layering them in the colander .
This is where you will be placing the curds to drain excess whey .
I place the colander in the sink to drain .
3 . Attach the thermometer to the pan so that you may monitor the temperature .
4 . Heat the mixture on high , stirring occasionally to prevent any milk from scorching on the bottom of the pan .
5 . When the milk has reached about 175 degrees F , add the lemon juice and gently stir it in .
You will see curds start to form immediately .
Allow a few minutes for more curds to accumulate , stirring very gently on occasion .
6 . Using a skimmer or sieve , remove curds from the pot and place them in the cheesecloth lined colander .
The moisture level of the cheese will be determined by how long you let it drain .
I like a moist ricotta , so I let it drain about five to ten minutes , but for a more firm cheese , let the curds drain longer .
7 . When the curds have finished draining , remove them and eat immediately for the best ricotta you have ever tasted .
The cheese will also last a few days in the refrigerator in a sealed container .
I migrated one of my CPAN distributions to Dist : : Zilla yesterday .
This seems like a little thing , but all of the Dzil plugins I use in the distribution remove one small step from managing the distribution .
I do n't have to update version numbers .
I do n't have to update the README file .
I do n't have to worry about copyright information , or specifying dependencies , or keeping my metadata files up to date .
I do n't even have to use the PAUSE website to upload a new distribution .
In similar fashion , I migrated that distribution to Github .
Moritz Lenz had found and fixed a couple of bugs .
I 'd already set up the distribution such that test cases were reasonably easy to add , and the code was simple enough that the fixes were fairly obvious .
Moritz forked my distribution from Gitpan .
I had my own Git clone of that repo , where merging Moritz 's changes took a couple of commands .
Releasing a new version with those changes was almost immediate .
After that , I converted my personal SVK over SVN repository to Git , made my own Git repository on Github , and cherry - picked the commits from my original fork to my new repository .
I never lost history .
I never had to edit a conflict .
I never had to ask Moritz to resubmit a patch .
The only distribution editing I did was to remove unnecessary files from my repository and to ask Dzil to generate them .
I knew all of the existing behavior of my distribution continued to work , because all of the tests passed .
I knew my distribution would work properly with PAUSE and the CPAN because all of Dist : : Zilla 's tests worked .
I also know that if any problems arise , the difficulty of fixing them is solely the difficulty of finding and fixing the bugs , not of managing the process of fixing the bug and managing repositories or verifying previous behavior or wrangling uploads or editing metadata in files manually .
The distance between fixing a bug and distributing a new version to users has shortened , and that path is now smoother .
You do n't have to use Git or Github or Dzil or Perl .
Plenty of other good tools exist to manage complexity or to make complexity go away .
Yet is n't that what we should do as programmers ?
We find barriers and difficulties and obstacles and we eliminate or minimize them , not solely because the new versions have a novelty factor or have greater elegance and aesthetic appeals , but because the relentless process of simplifying removes artificial complexity and structural scaffolding that all too often distracts from the real problems we need to solve .
After all , Moritz and I want to publish an attractive , informative , readable , accurate book about Rakudo Perl 6 .
Software is just the means by which we do so .

Circulating photographs claim to depict large areas of volcanic stones floating on the ocean as well as the birth of a new volcanic island .
These rather compelling photographs have been circulating via email and social media since 2006 .
Brief Analysis
The claims in the message are true .
Although the images are certainly unusual , they are genuine .
Both the phenomena of the floating stones and the newly formed volcanic island have been well documented by a variety of reliable sources including NASA
Example
Subject : FW : AMAZING SIGHT IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC AMAZING SIGHT IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC
The yacht ‘ Maiken ’ was traveling in the south Pacific when the crew came across a weird sight .
It was sand in the water , and the sand was floating ON TOP of the waves …
Look at these photos and try to imagine the feeling , the thrill of experiencing this phenomenon close - up .
This is not a beach , it is volcanic stones floating on the water .
The trail left by the yacht … through the sand
And then this was spotted … just behind them … ash and steam rising from the ocean …
And , while they were watching …
A plume of black ash … A brand new island formed …
Awesome !
Can you imagine the thrill of being the first & only people to see a new island being created … where there was nothing before ?
Then , can you imagine thinking — “ Gee if I been a few minutes later , I might have gone up in that explosion of black volcanic ash when the eruption occurred ” —
Now there ’s a scary thought !!!
Detailed Analysis
This email forward arrives with a series of photographs that depict a yacht ’s encounter with a large area of floating volcanic stones and the apparent birth of a new volcanic island in the South Pacific Ocean .
Although the images are certainly unusual , they are genuine .
Both the phenomena of the floating stones and the newly formed volcanic island have now been well documented by a variety of reliable sources including NASA .
The images in the email were taken from a post on the blog operated by Fredrik Fransson and the crew of the yacht ‘ Maiken ’ .
In August 2006 , the Maiken was sailing in the South Pacific near Tonga when it came across a large area of floating volcanic stones ( pumice ) .
When lava with a high gas and water content erupts from a volcano and then cools it can produce pumice , a very light rock material filled with gas bubbles .
Pumice is the only kind of rock that can float on water .
A large mass of pumice floating on the ocean surface is known as a “ pumice raft ” .
The Maiken attempted to sail into this massive pumice raft but was soon forced to turn back :
And then we sailed into a vast , many miles wide , belt of densely packed pumice .
We were going by motor due to lack of wind and within seconds Maiken slowed down from seven to one knot .
We were so fascinated and busy taking pictures that we plowed a couple of hundred meter into this surreal floating stone field before we realized that we had to turn back .
Just as we came out of the stone field and entered reasonably normal water we noticed that there came no cooling water from the engine .
Several other vessels in the region at the time also observed large pumice rafts .
The day after their encounter with the pumice raft , the Maiken crew discovered the volcano itself :
A couple of hours ago we identified the active volcano as the one close to Home reef , and we are on our way there now to take a closer look .
We are two miles from it and we can see the volcano clearly .
One mile in diameter and with four peaks and a central crater smoking with steam and once in a while an outburst high in the sky with lava and ashes .
I think were the first ones out here so perhaps we could claim the island and name them ( ? )
The following satellite image published by NASA ’s Earth Observatory clearly shows a large pumice raft as well as the new island :

Google Earth users can download a file showing the new island via the Earth Observatory website .

Yesterday we brought you exclusive benchmarks showing the amazing speedups achieved by the Android team in Froyo 2.2 , and today we 're back with some more juicy info .
Today , TechCrunch finally broke the news of the USB Tether and WiFi Access point / mobile hotspot capabilities , built right into the core of Android 2.2 Froyo .
TechCrunch posted 2 pictures , which some claimed could be fake , and provided no further information .
I am here to tell you they are not fake , and to provide more exclusive pictures obtained by AndroidPolice.com .
I can also confirm that testing the WiFi AP / mobile hotspot feature was successful , with a couple of WiFi enabled devices hooked up to the said access point running on Froyo and all able to access the Internet just fine .
Of course , with the final release , things may change , and the carriers could try to disable the feature unless you pay a monthly fee ( we have a feeling Sprint will be doing just that ) , so we are not making any promises .
And now , as promised , here is the eye candy :
Edit : the SIM card was not inserted at the time of taking the above screenshots , which is why you are seeing the " missing SIM " icon .
It was inserted later for testing of the AP capabilities .
And here is a screenshot of a regular phone running 2.1 connected to the WiFi network broadcast by the Froyo device :
More info to come as it becomes available .
In the meantime , you can follow us on twitter at @AndroidPolice or subscribe to our RSS feed at https://www.androidpolice.com/feed.
P.S. It 's purely coincidental that the AndroidAP WiFi network name in the screenshot and AndroidPolice share the same " AP " initials - AP here stands for Access Point .
There are very few places where mods could stand side - by - side with rockers , hippies with skinheads , or emos with punks without the flicking of knives , the stomping of boots or the hoiking up of phlegm .
But these disparate and frequently warring youth tribes – not to mention the Teddy boys , psychobillies , new romantics , ravers , crusties , hoodies and nu-ravers – have at last achieved the kind of harmony on the internet that has all too often eluded them in the real world .
They live on , for ever young and stylish , in a new multimedia archive that aims to provide a definitive visual , verbal and musical history of the past 70 years of youth culture .
Among the thousands of images in the Photographic Youth Music Culture Archive are Parisian beatniks pontificating over coffee and cigarettes , rockers frozen in time at the Ace cafe in 1964 , sun-kissed hippies sucking earnestly on their joints , punk girls sitting in a burnt - out car , and ecstatic , exhausted acid house ravers heading for a crashing comedown .
Alongside the haunting hairstyles , the brothel creepers , the Doc Martens and the old - school trainers featured on the PYMCA Cultural Research site are lists of , and links to , the key songs , books and films of the time .
The site , which has been 10 years in the making , also features timelines of some of the big events of the decades : Christian Dior 's New Look , the publication of Dr No , the assassination of JFK , the end of the Vietnam war , the fall of the Berlin Wall , the release of Nelson Mandela , and September 11 .
The collection is swelled by video footage and essays from writers including Ted Polhemus , King Adz , Frank Broughton and Bill Brewster .
The aim is to provide subscribers to the site – be they universities , advertising firms or individuals – with a one - stop shop for information and material on the history of post - war youth movements .
The Joint Information Systems Committee , an independent advisory body that supports UK colleges and universities in the use of digital technologies , thinks the site could help students in disciplines such as fashion , marketing , anthropology , social sciences and history .
" It can be used in a variety of applications , " said Anna Vernon , Jisc 's licensing manager .
" Students could copy parts into their dissertations , presentations , into virtual learning environments or into a sketchbook to develop a concept . "
Although the internet is brimming with facts , figures , essays and photos , Vernon pointed out that not all of them were free – or freely available .
" It seems straightforward but it 's increasingly difficult for students to find and use legitimate sources of information , and by working with organisations such as PYMCA and librarians we make sure that digital content can be found and used by students across the UK . "
Those involved with the site , however , hope it will soon turn into something far more relevant than a simple record of which tribe used to ride down to the south coast to eat ice lollies and knock seven bells out of its rivals .
Ted Polhemus , an anthropologist who is interested in style and visual culture , thinks it will act as a conduit and a forum for youth cultures from around the world .
" In this country , there 's a kind of new imperialist cultural attitude about street style as a British phenomenon – that it 's something that comes from the UK or the US and that it 's something the rest of the world follows , " he said .
" But it 's now everywhere .
The wonderful thing is that in a year 's time , we 'll have been able to input information about youth culture from India and Indonesia and elsewhere where these things are bubbling up . "
The gothloli ( Gothic - Lolita ) subculture , which is already on the wane in Japan , is taking root thousands of miles away on the streets of Buenos Aires , said Polhemus , while street battles have broken out between the emos and punks of Mexico City .
" After the media shines a spotlight on it , it just withers and dies , " said Polhemus .
" But thanks to the internet , these things can filter back and influence other places .
PYMCA will work as a kind of hub to take these bits of information and feed them back so that they can be known about in other places . "
The author , who was a student in the 1970s , is delighted at academia 's changing attitudes to the affiliations and rivalries of the young .
" When I was studying anthropology at University College London in the mid-1970s , my professors were saying to me that I should be studying something important , not youth style , " he said .
" Now you get people doing PhDs on street style in Japan , so people are catching up . "
What happens next , said Polhemus , is anybody 's guess .
The unmediated and individualistic nature of the internet , coupled with young people 's increasing suspicions about the commercial world , has made youth culture gloriously unpredictable .
" There ain't going to be a next big thing because it 's all spinning off into a magnificent diversity for the first time in our tribe 's history , " he said .
" There 's an unprecedented degree of personal creativity that 's coming from anywhere and everywhere .
We are now in a truly global age where it 's being inputted from all four corners of the globe . "

Jenson Button
Jenson Button has admitted to the Mirror that his own laziness almost scuppered his Formula One career .
" Everyone has tough times in their career and I 've had my fair share , " Button said .
" For me it was 2001 and a lot of it was my own fault and the fault of the people I had around me . "
At the end of that year - his second in the sport - he was lambasted by then team boss Flavio Briatore after underperforming on the track and leading a playboy life off it .
The nadir came at Monaco when Button moored his new £ 2 million yacht in front of the paddock and filled it with bikini - clad girls .
" He was young , had too many distractions and no focus for the job along with too many managers , " Briatore said .
" You have to have patience for this job and , instead of spending more time with his engineers at the circuit , he wanted to rush away to get his picture into a lifestyle magazine .
But Jenson realised that was not the way to go .
The media told him he was perfect and he believed it . "
I can't imagine anyone works harder than me but fair play to them if they do
Button responded by firing his management team and knuckling down to the job in hand .
" When I came into F1 there were so many areas I did n't know about , " Button admitted to the newspaper .
" I was just very excited about racing against my heroes .
I did n't come in with my eyes wide open .
I had blinkers on .
You learn very quickly in this sport .
It 's not really the place to learn but I did it .
I had to .
That 's when I realised there was more to it than just driving the car .
" I thought I could just drive around those problems and did n't have to work on them .
Now I know you need to spend a lot of time with your engineers .
You need to change the car to make it your own , you need to spend time on your fitness .
" It was my mistake .
You learn from it , I am the complete opposite now .
I do everything I need to - plus a bit more I would say .
I can't imagine anyone works harder than me but fair play to them if they do . "
Hillary Clinton , America ’s secretary of state , was in Canada the other day .
She criticized Ottawa for not inviting Aboriginal groups to a meeting on the Arctic , and for not including the facilitation of abortion in the Canadian government ’s “ maternal health ” initiative to developing countries .
These might seem curious priorities for the global superpower at a time of war , but , with such a full plate over at the State Department , it ’s no wonder that peripheral matters like Iranian nuclear deadlines seem to fall by the wayside .
Stephen Harper , Prime Minister of Canada , took U.S. criticisms in his stride .
“ Whether it comes to our role in Afghanistan , our sovereignty over our Arctic or , ultimately , our foreign aid priorities , it is Canada and Canadians who will make Canadian decisions , ” he said .
Judging from the chill in the room at his and the Secretary of State ’s joint photo - op , the Canadian Arctic now extends pretty much to the U.S. border .
The Obama administration came into office promising to press the “ reset ” button with the rest of the world after eight years of the so - called arrogant , swaggering Texan cowboy blundering his way around the planet , offending peoples from many lands .
Instead , Obama pressed the ejector - seat button : Brits , Czechs , Israelis , Indians found themselves given the brush .
I gather the Queen was “ amused ” by the president ’s thoughtful gift of an iPod preloaded with Obama speeches – and , fortunately for Her Majesty , the 160 GB model only has storage capacity for two of them , or three if you include one of his shorter perorations .
But Gordon Brown would like to be liked by Barack Obama , and ca n’t understand why he is n’t .
There is much speculation on the “ root cause ” of presidential antipathy to America ’s formerly closest ally .
It is said his grandfather was ill - treated by the authorities in colonial Kenya in the 1940s , which seems as good a basis as any on which to reorder 21st century bilateral relations , or at any rate as good as the proportion of the Canadian overseas aid budget devoted to abortion promotion .
But I doubt insensitive British policing two - thirds of a century ago weighs that heavy on the president .
After all , his brother back in Kenya lives on 12 bucks a year , and that does n’t seem to bother him , so it ’s hard to see why ancient slights to his grandfather would – except insofar as they confirm the general biases of his collegiate Left worldview .
In that sense , those who argue that , having been born in Hawaii and been at grade school in Indonesia , he lacks the instinctive Atlanticism of his predecessors are missing the point .
Yes , he has no instinctive Atlanticism .
But that ’s not because of a childhood spent in the Pacific but because of an adulthood spent among the campus Left , from Bill Ayers to Van Jones , not to mention Jeremiah Wright .
That also conveniently explains not just the anti-Atlanticism but the anti-Zionism , at least until the scholars uncover some sinister Jewish banker in Nairobi who seized the family home after the braying Brit imperialist toff tossed Grampa Obama behind bars .
Perhaps a singing Mountie yodeling selections from Rose - Marie beneath his jailhouse window all night explains the president ’s revulsion to Canadian Arctic policy .
Perhaps the Gujarati fakir sharing his cell and keeping Grampa up all night with his snake charming accounts for Obama ’s 18 - month cold shoulder to India .
And you can hardly blame him postponing his trip to Australia given the lingering resentments after Grampa was bitten by a rabid wombat down by the billabong who then ran off with his didgeridoo .
Fascinating as these psychological speculations are , we may be overthinking the situation .
It ’s not just the president .
The entire administration suffers , to put it at its mildest , from systemic indifference to American allies .
It was n’t Obama but a mere aide who sneered to Fleet Street reporters that Britain was merely one of 200 countries in the world and should n’t expect any better treatment than any of the others .
It was n’t Obama but the State Department that leaked Hillary Clinton ’s dressing down of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu .
Ally - belittling comes so reflexively to this administration that it ’s now doing drive - by bird - flipping .
I doubt Secretary Clinton intended to change American policy when she was down in Argentina the other day and , out of the blue , demanded negotiations on the Falkland Islands .
I would imagine she is entirely ignorant and indifferent on the subject , and calling for negotiations seemed the easy option – works for Iran and North Korea , right ?
As to Canadian funding of Third World abortion , the secretary of state was simply defaulting to her own tropes :
If she sounds more like the chair of Planned Parenthood than the principal spokesman for American foreign policy , well , has n’t she always ?
In a 2003 autobiography almost as long and as unreadable as the health care bill , she offered little on world affairs other than the following insights : France ’s Bernadette Chirac is “ an elegant , cultured woman . ”
Nicaragua ’s Violeta Chamorro is “ an elegant , striking woman . ” Pakistan ’s Benazir Bhutto is “ a brilliant and striking woman . ”
Canada ’s Aline Chrétien is “ intelligent , sharply observant and elegant . ”
But Russia ’s Naina Yeltsin is merely “ personable and articulate . ”
Alas , since taking office , the Obama administration has n’t found Gordon Brown , Stephen Harper , Binyamin Netanyahu , Nicolas Sarkozy , Václav Klaus or Manmohan Singh the least bit elegant , cultured , striking , elegant , brilliant , elegant , striking , elegant , sharply observant , elegant , or even personable and articulate .
One of the oddest features of the scene is attributed to the president ’s “ cool , ” which seems to be the euphemism of choice for what , in less - stellar executives , would be regarded as an unappealing combination of coldness and self - absorption .
I forget which long - ago foreign minister responded to an invitation to lunch with an adversary by saying “ I ’m not hungry , ” but Obama seems to reserve the line for his “ friends . ”
Visiting France , he declined to dine with the Sarkozys .
Visiting Norway , he declined to dine with the king at a banquet thrown explicitly in Obama ’s honor .
The other day , the president declined to dine with Netanyahu even though the Israeli prime minister was his guest in the White House at the time .
The British prime minister , five times rebuffed in his attempt to book a date , had to make do with a perfunctory walk ’n ’talk through the kitchens of the U.N.
Obama ’s shtick as a candidate was that he was the guy who ’d talk to anyone anytime anywhere .
Instead , he recoils from all but the most minimal contact with the world .
John Bolton calls him “ the first post - American president , ” and is punctilious enough to add that he does n’t mean “ un- American ” or “ anti-American . ”
In his Berlin speech , he presented himself as a “ citizen of the world , ” which , whatever else it means , suggests an indifference to America ’s role as guarantor of the global order .
The postponement of his Australian trip in order to ram health care down the throats of the American people was a neat distillation of the reality of his priorities : a transformative domestic agenda must necessarily come at the price of America ’s global role .
One - worldism is often a convenient cover for ignorance :
You ’d be hard pressed to find a self - proclaimed “ multiculturalist ” who can tell you the capital of Lesotho or the principal exports of Bhutan .
And so it is with liberal internationalism :
The citoyen du monde is the most parochial president of modern times .

Seattle police beating caught on tape
By Jon Spencer
12 May 2010
After being suppressed by the local media for several weeks , a video surfaced on May 7 showing Seattle police using racist language while beating an innocent man held on the ground .
The incident comes barely a year after a similarly brutal assault was caught on tape ( See : Seattle , Wash . : Video captures attack on teenage girl at police station ) .
The video ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atni33H-5oA), taken by a freelance cameraman , shows two suspects detained by Seattle police .
One man is kicked and stepped on by officers while lying prone on the pavement .
Detective Shandy Cobane from the city ’s “ Gang Unit ” yells at the man , “ I ’m going to beat the f___ing Mexican piss out of you , homey . ”
He then proceeds to kick the man in the face .
A female officer , since identified as Mary Woollum , steps on the back of the man ’s knee with her full weight .
Although bloodied and obviously dazed , no effort was made to provide him with medical help .
The man was later released without being booked or charged .
Yesterday , civil rights leaders speaking at a news conference in the city described the attack as a hate crime and demanded that the Federal Bureau of Investigation launch a full inquiry into the matter .
On April 17 , Seattle police began an internal investigation into what happened but kept quiet about the incident , so as to keep it from becoming public .
At least one major media outlet in the Seattle area , local Fox news affiliate KCPQ - TV , assisted in the cover-up .
Initially refusing to air the video , the television station subsequently fired the cameraman when it was released by another news station .
In the aftermath of the video ’s ultimate airing by ABC news affiliate KIRO 7 , KCPQ - TV has been attempting to gain legal rights over the material , claiming the video belongs to them .
The cameraman , who insists that he was working off the clock when he shot the scene , publicly stated that he believes the FOX news affiliate refused to show the video in order to protect the police .
Neither of the two officers involved in the assault has been dismissed for their conduct .
Cobane was reassigned to another division .
It is unknown whether Woollum was similarly dealt with .
Seattle Police Chief John Diaz attempted to justify the officers ’ actions in an interview with KIRO 7 , insisting , “ In the heat of the moment , people make mistakes … .
I understand that . ”
He went on to claim that the city ’s law enforcement agency has “ a strong commitment [ to ] insuring that we hold all our officers accountable . ”
The city ’s Mayor Mike McGinn said he was “ disappointed ” with what happened .
However , in reply to a question by KIRO 7 about whether he was bothered by the efforts of the Seattle Police to keep the incident out of the public eye , the mayor simply stated , “ I have a very strong relationship with Chief Diaz . ”
The use of this kind of violence against suspects is not an anomaly .
Last March , revelations came to light that Sheriff ’s Deputy Paul Schene savagely beat an unarmed teenager in custody in King County , the regional municipality that includes Seattle .
Schene later claimed , in a legal proceeding that ended in mistrial , that he attacked the girl because he was afraid of her .
This latest incident of police brutality comes just weeks after the passage in Arizona of SB 1070 , a law that legalizes the profiling and persecution of undocumented immigrants by the police .
That legislation , variants of which are now being debated in state legislatures in other parts of the country , gives the police the right to stop people on the basis of the mere suspicion that they might be in the country illegally and arrest them if they are unable to produce , on the spot , the required documentation .
SB 1070 gives a green light to the targeting of Hispanics and all others deemed to be “ foreign looking ” by police officers .
It fosters and legitimizes the sort of brutal racism expressed in this latest police assault in Seattle .

KAWAT VILLAGE , 6 May 2010 ( IRIN ) - About 14 percent of households in Myanmar 's Cyclone Nargis - affected region are headed by women , mostly widows , according to a report published in March entitled Women 's Protection Assessments : Post Nargis . [ http://unic.un.org/imucms/yangon/80/110/home.aspx
The report said female - headed households make up the highest percentage of low income groups , and more than 80 percent of the women surveyed were in debt , having borrowed money from relatives , friends or moneylenders .
Sixty percent of female - headed households live in unsatisfactory shelters , it said , while children from these families often drop out of school for lack of cash .
" They face the additional burden of being the only adult in the family and are therefore more vulnerable in terms of poverty and protection compared with households with two adults , " Joern Kristensen , manager of the Recovery Coordination Centre , [ http://www.themimu.info/]
which oversees humanitarian and rehabilitation efforts in the delta , told IRIN .
" The main problem for women is that usually they can only engage in secondary income generating activities which do not generate enough income for the whole household to survive , " said Andrew Kirkwood , Myanmar country director of Save the Children .
[ http://www.savethechildren.org/countries/asia/myanmar.html]
Kirkwood said job opportunities were fewer than before Nargis because employers lacked the funds to pay casual workers .
Furthermore , the fishing and agriculture sectors , which used to support the area , have not fully recovered , so day labourers have limited job opportunities .
[ http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=89001]
Health care is another pressing need for women heads of household , especially older women , said Samantha Chattaraj of the Myanmar operations of HelpAge International .
[ http://www.helpage.org/Emergencies/Myanmarcyclone]
" When their health is not good , it can affect their livelihoods , so it 's also important to give health care to the female - headed households , " Chattaraj said .
In an effort to help women heads of household rebuild their lives , humanitarian agencies have prioritized them for assistance , and established nearly 1,300 women 's self - reliance groups and seven women - friendly centres offering psychosocial support , humanitarian kits , and skills training .
" There is a need to conduct further research and understand what sorts of jobs and livelihoods women heads of household - especially older women - prefer , so that we can help them effectively , " Chattaraj said .
Many women heads of household are in financial crisis and deep debt , and have had to sell their property to pay back moneylenders .
Kyin Myaing , 56 , sold her land to appease her debtor , but has more to pay .
" Soon , we 'll sell this house to pay back all the debt , and then move to Yangon for whatever jobs are available there .
We have to do this to survive , " said the mother of three , as she looked around her wood - and - bamboo house .
Those who have already sold their land or houses are being evicted by moneylenders .
" We 're now being forced to dismantle this house and vacate the land , " said 58 - year - old Mya Aye , the matriarch in a family of six .
Surrounded by her grandchildren , she sighed heavily and asked : " Where should we go then ? "

My goal in this post is to provide some pictures and statistics for one operation in the Marcellus Shale .
For those familiar with the drilling and hydrofracking , this may seem a bit basic .
Specifically the gas they are trying to access is in the Marcellus Shale .
The Marcellus Shale has become very popular because advances in horizontal drilling and hydrofracking have made it possible to access large amounts of gas trapped in unconventional shale plays .
Negative publicity has been just as noticeable , with many organizations claiming that the fracking procedures are reeking havoc on local watersheds .
Recently I had the opportunity to attend a tour of a natural gas well in Troy , Pennsylvania , courtesy of Talisman Energy USA .
Founded in 2002 as Fortuna Energy , Talisman Energy USA is a subsidiary of Talisman Energy Inc. , of Canada .
They are currently producing over 100 wells in New York and Pennsylvania with 200 miles of pipeline , and according to the information provided to us , they plan to invest over 1 billion dollars in Pennsylvania gas before the end of 2010 .
On the day I visited the well , the drilling company , Pioneer , was in the process of moving the drilling rig to drill a second horizontal well on this pad .
Pioneer uses a multi- well pad design that incorporates 4 to 6 horizontal wells per pad spaced 25 feet apart ( Figure 1 ) .
Each well extends roughly 5000 to 6000 feet into the ground and then extends about 1000 feet out in the horizontal direction .
Figure 1

Photo 2
Photos 1 and 2 : Pioneer Drilling Rig # 59 .
I visited on a day when the rig was being moved , so neither drilling nor fracking were being performed .
This explains why there is not much equipment on the drilling pad in Photo 1 .
The amount of equipment will increase during drilling and even more so during fracking as roughly 3 million gallons of water is used per well .
We were also told that the drilling time for each pad ( i.e. 4 to 6 wells ) is roughly 6 months , and the time it takes to frack the wells is roughly 3 months .

Photo 4
Photos 3 and 4 : 20 inch pipeline ( soon to be subterranean ) that will be used to transport gas from the wells to the compressor station .
Photo 5
Photo 5 : The compressor station .
This facility uses 3 compressors to elevate the pressure of the gas to 1200 psi so that it can join with the main gas pipeline in the region .
It has a capacity of 108 million cubic feet per day and sits on roughly 2 hectares ( 5 acres ) of ground area .
Anecdotal information :
My first question for the tour guide was “ how much gas are you producing per well and for how long will it produce at that level ? ”
The answer I received was between 1 – 6 million cubic feet per day and for 30 to 45 years .
I found this very interesting as TOD ’s Art Berman and my own analysis has shown that these type of drilling operations have very steep decline curves .
My own analysis shows that the average production from a similar well in the Barnett Shale decreases to the level of a stripper gas well ( 60 mcf per day ) in only 5 years .
Also , if Talisman has been drilling in the Marcellus for only 2 years , how do they know that production will last for 30 – 45 years ?
Clearly more research needs to be done in this area to determine the appropriate decline curves of Marcellus gas wells .

Photo 6 : Not to be without a sense of irony , a wind farm is located on the crest of the opposing hillside .
He looked like an easy target : a medical student sitting alone on a late - night train .
The three men sidled up to the German student and told him to hand over his wallet .
When he refused , they followed him off the train , trailing him as he walked past the hotel and pizza joint on Bringelly Road , Kingswood , in Sydney 's west .
When the student , who has asked not to be identified , turned down a dimly lit alley his pursuers thought their moment had come .
It had , but not in quite the way they expected .
COMPARE CHANGES IN U.S. RELIGIONS OVER 2 DECADES COMPARE CHANGES IN U.S. RELIGIONS OVER 2 DECADES
Join the conversation : Religion , spirituality & ethics | Reader forum : Your beliefs @FAITH_REASON ON TWITTER @FAITH_REASON ON TWITTER MADISON , Wis. ( AP ) 
A federal judge in Wisconsin ruled the National Day of Prayer unconstitutional Thursday , saying the day amounts to a call for religious action .
U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb wrote that the government can no more enact laws supporting a day of prayer than it can encourage citizens to fast during Ramadan , attend a synagogue or practice magic .
FAITH & REASON : Obama will still acknowledge it " In fact , it is because the nature of prayer is so personal and can have such a powerful effect on a community that the government may not use its authority to try to influence an individual 's decision whether and when to pray , " Crabb wrote .
Congress established the day in 1952 and in 1988 set the first Thursday in May as the day for presidents to issue proclamations asking Americans to pray .
The Freedom From Religion Foundation , a Madison - based group of atheists and agnostics , filed a lawsuit against the federal government in 2008 arguing the day violated the separation of church and state .
President Barack Obama 's administration has countered that the statute simply acknowledges the role of religion in the United States .
Obama issued a proclamation last year but did not hold public events with religious leaders as former President George W. Bush had done .
Crabb wrote that her ruling should n't be considered a bar to any prayer days until all appeals are exhausted .
U.S. Justice Department attorneys who represented the federal government in the case were reviewing the ruling Thursday afternoon , agency spokesman Charles Miller said .
He declined further comment .
Obama spokesman Matt Lehrich said in an e-mail to The Associated Press the president still plans to issue a proclamation for the next prayer day .
" As he did last year , President Obama intends to recognize a National Day of Prayer , " Lehrich said .
The American Center for Law and Justice , which represented 31 members of Congress who joined the federal government as defendants , called Crabb 's ruling flawed and promised to appeal .
" It is unfortunate that this court failed to understand that a day set aside for prayer for the country represents a time - honored tradition that embraces the First Amendment , not violates it , " ACLJ Chief Counsel Jay Sekulow said in a statement .
The Alliance Defense Fund , an Arizona - based group of Christian lawyers , issued a statement saying Crabb 's ruling undermines American tradition dating back to the nation 's birth .
Freedom From Religion Foundation attorney Richard Bolton did n't immediately return a message seeking comment .
Crabb wrote that her ruling was not a judgment on the value of prayer .
She noted government involvement in prayer may be constitutional if the conduct serves a " significant secular purpose " and does n't amount to a call for religious action .
But the National Day of Prayer crosses that line , she wrote .
" It goes beyond mere ' acknowledgment ' of religion because its sole purpose is to encourage all citizens to engage in prayer , an inherently religious exercise that serves no secular function in this context , " she wrote .
" In this instance , the government has taken sides on a matter that must be left to individual conscience . "

So apparently the strip two posts back was the 150th Optipess comic , and I did n’t realize this until now .
Oh well : Let ’s celebrate now with this 152nd comic featuring kids being burned alive !
The extradition of the computer hacker Gary McKinnon has been put on hold after the home secretary , Theresa May , agreed to an adjournment of a judicial review that was supposed to start within days .
The move will allow May to begin formal consideration of the medical evidence to see whether McKinnon is fit to be extradited .
If it is established that he cannot be allowed to go , it paves the way for a prosecution in the UK .
A Home Office spokesperson said : " The home secretary has considered the proposal from Gary McKinnon 's legal team and has agreed an adjournment should be sought .
An application to the court is being made today . "
McKinnon 's lawyer , Karen Todner , said she hoped May would make a decision on whether he was fit to be extradited in a matter of weeks .
Todner said : " The secretary of state , having recently taken office and having received further representations from the claimant 's representatives , wishes to have appropriate time fully to consider the issues in the case . "
She said she hoped the decision was " a signal of a more compassionate and caring home secretary " .
McKinnon 's lawyers were granted permission for a judicial review last week – having failed to win one last year – into whether a decision by the former home secretary Alan Johnson to allow extradition and trial in the US breached McKinnon 's human rights .
The judicial review was supposed to start next week and was virtually a last throw of the legal dice .
Its adjournment allows May to cast a fresh eye on what has turned into a cause celebre , and to make a close examination of the extradition agreement between the US and the UK .
Legal experts said May 's main difficulty would be to override her Home Office advisers .
" They will , perhaps , tell their minister that if she reverses the [ Jacqui ] Smith - Johnson decision , the Americans might take her to court for judicial review .
But this is unreal : the Obama administration is unlikely to challenge , on behalf of a local state prosecutor , a decision of the new British government , " Geoffrey Robertson QC wrote on the Guardian 's Comment is free website , this week .
McKinnon 's supporters believe the new coalition government is sympathetic to their cause as David Cameron and Nick Clegg have in the past publicly criticised plans to extradite McKinnon .
Last year , Cameron said any trial should take place in the UK .
He said there was " a clear argument to be made that he should answer [ any questions ] in a British court " .
McKinnon admitted to hacking into 97 computers in the US defence department and Nasa from his London flat , and said he was looking for evidence of UFOs between 2001 - 2 .
Despite a lengthy legal battle and strong public support for the Free Gary campaign , McKinnon has so far failed in his seven - year fight against extradition .
His supporters argue that McKinnon has Asperger 's syndrome and was driven only by an obsession with UFOs .
The US government argues that his hacking attempts were a deliberate effort to breach American defence systems .
McKinnon 's mother , Janis Sharp , called the development good news and said it was significant that the court process is now on hold .
" Overall I 'm cautiously optimistic , " she said .
" It 's a step in the right direction , but we really need to know that Gary will be staying here .
Only then can we relax .
In some ways this is almost the most difficult time .
I 've got hope for the first time and if that hope was dashed I do n't know what I 'd do .
" We 've had this hanging over us for eight years .
Some murderers get less than that .
All he was doing was tapping away on a keyboard in Crouch End , being curious . "
Sharp added that McKinnon was not in a good way : " He ca n't go out , watch anything about the case on TV .
He 's under the care of a psychiatrist . "
The controversial case has crossed the desks of six home secretaries .
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation ( NTT , Chiyoda Ward , Tokyo , President and CEO : Satoshi Miura ) has successfully demonstrated an ultra- high - capacity optical transmission of 69.1 terabits per second ( tera = one trillion ) over a single 240 km - long optical fiber .
( Figure 1 ) The 69.1 Tb/s transmission , based on the wavelength division multiplexing ( WDM ) of 432 wavelengths with a capacity of 171 Gb/s , is the highest ever reported in the optical transmission field , and is twice the previous record of 32 Tb/s .
The technologies used in this experiment will be useful for constructing future high - capacity optical backbone networks .
This result was reported on March 25 as a post - deadline paper at the Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exposition and the National Fiber Optic Engineers Conference ( OFC / NFOEC 2010 ) held in the USA .
1. Background
Data traffic on optical networks is increasing rapidly because high - volume content such as a high definition images is now frequently transmitted over the Internet .
NTT Network Innovation Laboratories ( hereafter , NTT Labs ) are researching and developing future optical backbone networks to cope with the rapidly increasing data traffic with which the data will be accommodated efficiently , and high - capacity , long - distance transmission will be realized .
NTT Labs has already achieved a 13.5 Tb/s optical transmission over 7,000 km .
2. Technical points
There are three key technical points .
( 1 ) Increased spectral efficiency using 16 QAM format ( 2 ) Novel demodulation algorithm without using extra overhead signal ( 3 ) Realization of ultra- wide band optical amplifier covering C and extended L bands
We used a 16 QAM format ( * 1 ) , which enables us to realize an ultra- dense WDM with a wavelength spacing of 25 GHz , in the transmitter , and novel digital signal processing technology ( * 2 ) in the receiver .
In the optical transmission section , we achieved low - noise , ultra - wideband amplification in the C and extended L bands ( * 3 ) and controlled the nonlinear effects inside the optical amplifiers .
With the 16 QAM format , the symbol rate ( * 4 ) is reduced to one - eighth of the transmission rate by combination with polarization division multiplexing ( * 5 ) , so that the electric interface speed is reduced and the optical spectral band ( * 6 ) is narrowed .
This leads to an increase in spectral efficiency to its highest reported value of 6.4 b/s/Hz in the 16 QAM format .
3 . Future schedule
NTT Labs aim to realize high - capacity and long - distance optical transmission based on rates of over 100 Gb/s per wavelength and over 10 Tb/s per fiber , and to construct an optical backbone network that is superior in terms of economy and quality .
4. Details of technology
( 1) Experimental setup
The 171 Gb/s signal per wavelength is generated by the combination of the 16 QAM format with polarization division multiplexing in the transmitter ( Figure 2 ) .
The symbol rate is 21.4 Gbaud ( one - eighth of 171 Gb / s ) .
The 16 QAM signal is produced by combining two QPSK signals with an amplitude ratio of 2:1 in the QAM modulator .
The bit rate of 171 Gb/s is that of the OTN ( * 7 ) frame , which includes the payload of 160 Gb/s , forward error correction and an overhead for management .
432 optical signals from 1527 to 1620 nm with a wavelength spacing of 25 GHz are multiplexed and a 69.1
Tb/s signal is generated .
Coherent detection and digital signal processing are used in the receiver ( Figure 3 ) .
The receiver sensitivity for coherent detection is more than 3 dB higher than that with the conventional direct detection of an NRZ signal .
A new algorithm without pilot - less processing ( * 8 ) was deployed to demodulate the 16 QAM signal .
The signal processing can also equalize the wavelength distortion caused by chromatic dispersion and the polarization mode dispersion that occurs during an optical transmission .
We transmitted the 69.1 Tb/s signal over 240 km using ultra- wide band amplification technology with an amplification band of 10.8 THz ( 1.35 times wider than the conventional band ) , which was composed of a C band of 4.4 THz and an extended L band of 6.4 THz .
We enhanced the signal - to - noise ratio by using distributed Raman amplification , and took measures to suppress the nonlinear effects that occurred owing to the increase in optical power inside the amplifiers .
The Q values and optical spectrum after the 240 km transmission are shown in Figure 4 .
All the Q values measured for the 432 wavelengths were over the Q limit .
( 2) Key devices
NTT Photonics Laboratories developed key components for this challenging experiment in cooperation with NTT Network Innovation Laboratories .
These components are a QAM modulator , a tunable laser , and a dual polarization optical hybrid .
The QAM modulator is a hybrid - integrated modulator composed of an LN lightwave circuit and a silica - based planar lightwave circuit ( PLC ) .
The 16 QAM signal is generated stably in the modulator .
A tunable DFB laser with a narrow line width ( 100 to 200 kHz ) is used as an optical source , and it can reduce the phase noise in coherent detection .
The dual polarization optical hybrid for coherent detection is based on a PLC and is useful for compact implementation .
Title of paper
" 69.1 - Tb/s ( 432 x 171 - Gb/s ) C- and Extended L - Band Transmission over 240 km Using PDM - 16 - QAM Modulation and Digital Coherent Detection "
Terminology
*1 : 16 QAM format
QAM is an abbreviation of quadrature amplitude modulation .
QAM carries information about both the amplitude and phase of the signal , which has two components each with a phase relation of 90 degrees ( in - phase and quadrature - phase ) .
One 16 QAM signal can transmit 4 bits .
* 2 : Digital signal processing technology
The technology whereby a received signal is converted to a digital signal , a distortion waveform is equalized electrically , and the phase of the original signal is determined .
When the above process is performed after the signal has been received with coherent detection , it is called digital coherent signal processing .
* 3 : C and extended L band
Wavelengths with low propagation losses are used in optical communication .
The C band is from 1530 to 1565 nm , and the L band is 1565 to 1625 nm .
However the practical L band is determined by the characteristics of commercial amplifiers and is generally about 4 THz ranging from 1570 to 1600 nm .
In the extended L band , this 4 THz band is extended to about 7 THz .
* 4 : Symbol rate
The speed per second when sending a code to a transmission line given in baud units .
The symbol rate is one - fourth of the transmission bit rate when a 16 QAM signal is used .
* 5 : Polarization division multiplexing
A multiplexing scheme in which information is carried in two polarization components of the propagation light ( x and y polarizations ) .
This technique can double the capacity provided by a single polarization scheme .
* 6 : Optical spectral band
The width of the spectrum when an optical signal is measured in the frequency ( or wavelength ) domain .
As the spectrum becomes narrower , the WDM that can be realized becomes denser .
*7 : OTN
OTN is an abbreviation for optical transport network .
The OTN has been standardized by ITU - T and offers a reliable optical network based on WDM systems .
* 8 : Pilot - less processing
A process whereby digital signal processing is carried out using only the received signal without any reference signals .
It is called blind processing .

There are concerns changes to skilled migration rules could further tarnish Australia 's reputation abroad with the revamp to leave thousands of foreign students in limbo .
Under the changes , the list of jobs used to select migrants is to be streamlined and reviewed annually , while potential new Australians will need to have better English - language skills .
As a result , about 20,000 people will have their migration applications cancelled and their fees refunded at a cost of about $ 14 million .
The changes also leave thousands of overseas students facing uncertainty with many to lose the chance to apply for permanent residency because the job for which they are studying will no longer be on the skilled list .
Students affected by the changes will be able to apply for a temporary skilled graduate visa to stay in Australia for 18 months while they gain work experience or seek sponsorship from an employer .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The unemployment rate for veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars reached 14.7 percent in March , according to the latest government statistics .
The number of unemployed veterans increased to more than 250,000 , up about 40,000 over the previous month 's figures , according to the Department of Labor Statistics .
Veterans groups say the figures are unacceptable .
" It 's unforgivable that new veterans are bearing the brunt of the economic downturn , " said Tom Tarantino , legislative associate for the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America .
" This is no way to welcome a new generation of heroes home . "
Unemployment rates for Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans have risen sharply in the past few years , according to Labor Department data .
The rate was 10.2 percent in 2009 , 7.3 percent in 2008 , and 6.1 percent in 2007 .
Paul Sullivan , director of Veterans for Common Sense , said these veterans are having difficulty finding work for several reasons .
" Sometimes the skills from the battlefield do n't transfer directly to civilian jobs , " he said .
He added that the military has a " spotty record " of providing transition assistance for soldiers leaving the military and returning to the civilian work force .
Other veterans groups agree .
" The current administration has greatly improved funding for VA programs , but clearly more needs to be done ... to ensure the needs of our veterans are met , " said AMVETS National Commander Duane Miskulin .
He said AMVETS will continue to press Congress for more help .
Tarantino said the Defense and Labor Departments " need to work harder with the veterans community to ensure that vocational skills and certifications earned in the military translate into marketable skills and certifications in the civil marketplace . "
As an example , he said , " Right now we have combat medics who are doing amazing feats of emergency medical care in the field .
When they get out , in most states , they 're not qualified to drive an ambulance . "
" They make great employees , " Sullivan said .
" They 're loyal , hard - working , and they 've worked in the hardest conditions imaginable . "

Andrew , I think we 're just seeing events from different perspectives , you from the development side and me from the users side .
I could have been more specific as I was referring primarily to the graphics presentation and " look and feel " of AngbandTk , not overall Vanilla UI issues .
And while the developers may have expended a lot of energy on the overall user interface , 3.1.1 really does n't look much different than 3.0.1 after the bigtile patch and the support for the Gervais tiles was implemented .
I suspect what you 're talking about are things like the SDL and Gtk ports and the mouse support .
While those are useful and important work for the developers ( and appreciated ) they really do n't change the look and feel very much .
Of course I do n't use those ports , just the Windows and X11 , so maybe I 've missed something there .
I remember being involved in a conversation on r.g.r.a 6 or so years ago concerning Vanilla graphics and UI issues .
I was one of a distinct minority advocating AngbandTk and the isometric graphics as a good example to be followed in the future , to try to make Angband look and feel more like the commercial games than it currently did .
At that time the response of the majority of the community was that they were n't interested in such but wanted the developers to focus on gameplay .
Many , if not most of the respondents to the thread seemed to be content to play with the ASCII characters .
I ’ve had a look at a few different go servers and clients , but not one of them ( including KGS ) was fully to my like .
I talked to wms ( owner and sole developer of KGS ) about the development of his server , but according to him it is unlikely that KGS is going to improve as quickly as I ’d like it to .
It is totally possible to fix many of the issues , as proven by a nice fellow Go player and programmer ( I ’m not sure if he wants to be named in public ) , who decompiled the KGS client and added a lot of really interesting features .
The huge list of missing features ( KGS Wishlist on Sensei ’s ) is just not justifiable .
So much for KGS .
There are multiple other Go servers around .
Firstly , there are the Asian - style servers Oro , Tygem and the like .
The main advantage of these servers boils down to their huge player base .
The main flaw is the , seriously , lousy programming of the clients .
The applications are , in comparison with KGS , absolutely terrible to use .
Secondly , there are servers like IGS .
Not a social place at all .
I met a lot of nice people on KGS , I barely spoke to anyone on IGS .
No fun .
I ’m not saying a Go server should replace ICQ / MSN , but it really should be possible to have a nice talk with people .
Maybe the most interesting servers are websites like DGS or OGS .
These servers got nice features by their web - based nature .
On the other hand , the interface is average or less , and it ’s kind of slow in every aspect .
Also not very social , especially since there is hardly any real - time chat .
So , while having a good reason to exist , it ’s not going to be the ultimate kind of server anytime soon .
We need desktop applications .
A ccording to the folks at the Eighth World Tomato Congress held in Toronto , Canada , approximately 35.8 million tons of ketchup were consumed worldwide in 2008 .
An Epicurious taste test designed to find the best brand of this wildly popular condiment yielded surprising results .
In our search for a favorite , we knew we wanted a smooth and full - bodied ketchup ( to delicately embrace fries ) but not an overly viscous one .
It also must have a good balance of sweet , sour , and salty flavors .
To find this ideal ketchup , we tasted 20 different varieties , all available at supermarkets or online .
The products included those marketed as organic , kosher , no - salt , reduced - sugar , 1 - carb , sugar - / calorie - free , unsweetened , and / or sweetened with agave .
Yes , we included the top two brand - name sellers , Heinz and Hunt's , as well as lesser - known and private label brands . *
Methodology :
In a blind taste test , six judges compared the appearance , flavor , and consistency of the ketchups ( judges tasted the ketchups both on bland water crackers and on French fries ) .
They then ranked them according to the standard Epicurious four - fork rating system ( four being highest ) .
One Epi Top
Pick emerged from the group , earning a four - fork rating .
Four others garnered recognition in their specific subcategories .
Best Overall Ketchup
Epi Top Pick : Hunt 's Tomato Ketchup ( $ 1.99 per 24 oz. plastic bottle )
Pros :
This ketchup 's boldly rich red color and its slick appearance had testers dipping their fries without hesitation .
" It has an obvious tomato flavor with a mild tang , and it 's not overly sweet , " remarked one tester about this well - balanced ketchup .
" It 's not watery and not too thick , " said another tester .
" This is undeniably the ideal classic ketchup , " said another .
Cons : Has 20 calories per tablespoon as opposed to the standard 15 found in most of the competition .
First Runner - up : America's Choice Tomato Ketchup ( $ 2.55 per 36 oz. plastic bottle )
Pros : Aside from being the least expensive of all the winners , this ketchup was noted for its " smooth " look and balanced " mild " flavor .
" Not too sweet and not too salty , " stated one taster .
" This one is so good that I 'd eat it with a spoon , " exclaimed another .
Cons : Many commented on its lack of tang .
Second Runner - up : Heinz Tomato Ketchup ( $ 2.19 per 14 oz. plastic bottle )
Pros : Noted for its glistening texture and fire - engine - red color , this " tomatoey " ketchup with " tomato soup " aromas was considered pleasantly tangy and sweet .
Cons : Relatively watery consistency .
Best Healthy Tomato Ketchup
Four of the ketchups we tested were marketed as either unsweetened , low - carb , low - salt , or made with reduced sugar .
Winner : Reduced - Sugar Heinz ( $ 3.59 per 14 oz. bottle )
Pros : Several judges appreciated this ketchup for its spiciness and thickness .
Cons :
The orangey - red coloring made this choice 's appearance somewhat unappetizing .
Best Organic Tomato Ketchup
Eight of the ketchups we tested were marketed as organic .
Winner : Organicville ( $ 4.99 per 24 oz. bottle )
Pros :
This ketchup 's appeal is based on a natural and fresh looking appearance .
" Its matte , nonreflective finish makes this one look like a dollop of puréed tomatoes , " noticed one taster .
" It looks and tastes healthy , " said another .
Cons : Most expensive of all ketchups tasted .
Some judges missed the standard ketchup viscosity and disliked its Worcestershire sauce–like flavor .

UPDATE : Elena Kagan 's thesis does not seem to have brought any clarity of thought .
Interpretations of it seem to depend on whether the phrase " those who " ( in " those who , more than half a century after socialism 's decline , still wish to change America [ in a radical way ] " ) means " people like my advisor Sean Wilentz and my brother " or " people like my advisor and my brother and me . "
I believe it is much more likely than not that " those who " carries the first meaning .
Remember , she was crafting the thesis to resonate with those who would grade it -- with Sean Wilentz and his colleagues .
I think it highly probable that if she had placed herself among " those who " she would have used a different phrase : " we who . "
I think that her takeaway from her thesis was Clintonian ( and Obamaian ) : radicals in America need to shut up , take their place at an oar , and row like hell for minor reformist victories .
The thesis is , I believe , mostly an argument against Glenn Greenwald and his fears that Elena Kagan is really John Roberts in disguise ...
From the introduction :
Ever since Werner Sombart first posed the question in 1905 , countless historians have tried to explain why there is no socialism in America .
For the most part , this work has focused on external factors -- on features of American society rather than of American socialist movements .
Socialists and non-socialists alike have discussed the importance of the frontier ... the fluidity of class lines ... the American labor force 's peculiarly heterogeneous character , which made concerted class action more difficult than it might otherwise have been .
In short , most historians have looked everywhere but to the American socialist movement itself for explanations of U.S. socialism 's failure .
Such external explanations are not unimportant but neither do they tell the full story .
They ignore or overlook one supremely important fact : Socialism has indeed existed in the United States ....
The Socialist Party increased its membership from a scanty 10,000 in 1902 to a respectable 109,000 in the early months of 1919 ... a party press that included over three hundred publications with an aggregate circulation of approximately two million ....
The success of the socialists in establishing a viable -- if minor -- political party in the early twentieth century suggests that historians must examine not only external but also internal factors if they hope to explain the absence of socialism from contemporary American politics .
The effects of the frontier , of class mobility , of an ethnically divided working class may explicate why the Socialist Party did not gain an immediate mass following ; they cannot explain why the growing and confident American socialist movement collapsed ....
We are , then , left with three ultimately inadequate explanations of the sudden demise of a growing socialist movement .
The otherworldliness of the socialists , the expulsion of Haywood in 1912 , the Russian Revolution of 1917 - - none will satisfactorily explain the death of social - ism in America .
What , then , was responsible ?
In attempting to answer this question , this thesis will focus almost exclusively on the history of the New York City local of the Socialist Party ....
The collapse of New York socialism , although sudden , had deep roots indeed .
From its first days , the New York SF was both divided within itself and estranged from many of its trade - union followers .
Among the party 's members , a right - left cleavage arose early - - a cleavage based not on the minutiae of dogma but on the very fundamentals of socialism itself .
What was the proper class composition of a socialist party ?
What trade - union and electoral policies should the party follow ?
What attitude should the party take toward distinctly non-radical reform measures ?...
At the end of 1918 , old disputes quickly reappeared , but this time in even fiercer form .
For years , large numbers of the SP 's members and large blocs of its trade - union support had expressed deep dissatisfaction with socialist leadership .
Now , the Russian Revolution set the spark ... and the Socialist Party burst into flames .
In 1919 , the SP split into two ....
Intra-party sectarianism had previously weakened the socialist movement ; inter -party sectarianism now finished the job ...

Atman in Sunyata and the Sunyata of Atman
An attempt to reconcile the alleged difference between Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta on the nature of the Self
by Bijoy H. Boruah ( 1 )
Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism are at loggerheads with one another on the metaphysical issue of the self or soul .
Whereas the former school of thought is credited with the belief in the existence of the Atmanor the soul as the core reality of the human individual , the latter school is famous for the theory of Anatman or denial of the existence of any self or soul substance .
In contemporary philosophical parlance , the Advaita Vedantin would be a realist about the self and the Buddhist an anti-realist about the same thing .
This is surely a radical ontological antinomy .
But what is surprising is that despite such an ontological antinomy the two systems of thought have a more or less common " metaphysic of transcendence " or a transformative teleology .
They each believe in the possibility of ultimate human liberation or enlightenment .
The ultimate liberation ( Moksa ) of Advaita Vedanta and the ultimate enlightenment ( Nirvana ) of Buddhism are in essence similar notions of attainment of salvation or final freedom from the quagmire of human bondage .
How would one reconcile the fact that the two systems share a basically similar metaphysic of salvation with the fact that they are arch opponents on the issue of the ontology of the self ?
What I have posed as a perplexing problem should be clear once it is realized that the question of the self is crucially related to the issue of ultimate liberation .
If liberation is attained in the form of self - realization or self - transformation , then whether one affirms or denies the existence of the self would seem to make a corresponding difference in respect of the possibility of ultimate liberation understood as self - liberation .
The perplexity is that both an anti-realist ( Buddhism ) and a realist ( Vedanta ) about the self are nonetheless convergent on the idea of the possibility of ultimate , self - transformative liberation .
Indeed , to converge on a common salvific teleology while the two parties hold onto the radically divergent ontological positions of self - denial and self - affirmation is to open up a curious philosophical situation that demands closer scrutiny .
The Buddhist position is intriguing precisely because it claims the possibility of emancipation without admitting that there is any self - same , enduring bearer of the emancipatory experience .
Ironically , self - extinction rather than self - existence is said to be a necessary condition for the possibility of emancipation .
But we may pause here to reconsider the meaning of the concept of self inquestion .
Does the sense of perplexity rest on an ambiguity of the word " self " as used by the opposing parties ?
Apparently , it would be absurd to profess total self - denial while admitting ultimate liberation because the experience of liberation , being enduring as well as unitary , presupposes an experiencer of some sort .
We would do well not to short - circuit the Buddhist position into plain absurdity and examine whether there really is no sense of self - affirmation in the overall metaphysical stance of Buddhism .
On the other hand , the Vedantic position on self - affirmation also needs to be subjected to a closer scrutiny in relation to its Buddhist opponent .
What needs to be examined closely is what really is affirmed when the Vedantin affirms the existence of the self .
What is the content of the self involved in Vedantic self - liberation ?
Why have I moved the matter towards a discussion of the content of the Vedantic self in relation to the no-self thesis of Buddhism ?
I have done so in view of the alleged dichotomy between the two systems of thought described in terms of positive ontology ( Vedanta ) and negative ontology ( Buddhism ) .
Vedanta is metaphysically Being - oriented , specifically the Being of Atman or the true individual self , which is ultimately identical with Brahman or the Absolute Reality .
Buddhism is metaphysically oriented to Nothingness or Emptiness , known as Sunyata , so much so that Absolute Reality is identified with Absolute Nothingness .
What I wonder is whether there can really be any substantive difference of specific content between a metaphysic of Being and a metaphysic of Nothingness , when both systems subscribe to an ultimate reality conceived in equally metaphysically absolutist terms .
The metaphysical " sphere " of absolute Being may coincide with that of absolute Nothingness , and there may not be " internal " content - specific difference between the two .
In keeping with the speculative remark I just made , I would now like to take up the Buddhist notion of Sunyata for a careful analysis .
Buddhists are arch anti-realists when it comes to the existence of anything that can be individuated .
Sheer impermanence and transitoriness of everything characterizes reality for them .
There is no thing and no self in such a reality of ceaseless flux .
Hence , according to Buddhism , a right understanding of the world and us in it would be not to reify anything into enduring individual entities or selves .
This is what gets expressed as the no-self or Anatman view .
One is therefore advised to empty oneself of the illusory representation of oneself as an enduring and distinct self .
Everything is devoid of any substantive essence .
In a sense , everything in reality is empty .
It might be helpful to think of emptiness or Sunyata , understood as Absolute Nothingness , as a cosmic " field , " and reality ultimately identified with this field .
Anything in reality would then be absolutely non-substantial , which implies that there would be no non-illusory substantive self - representation in this field .
Consciousness , which is the content of the so - called self and experience ( and may be the content of the cosmic field as such ) , would be absolutely empty of any ego - centric self - representation .
It would be " pure " consciousness , or consciousness per se .
Contrast this picture of Buddhism with the Vedantic depictionof reality .
Phenomenal reality , which is what appears as the world of sensible apprehension in all its multiplicity , is held to be a false projection of cosmic illusion , of Maya or Avidya .
All relationality amongst distinct individuals , the whole world as it appears to be distinct from oneself as subject in all its multifariousness , is unreal from the transcendental standpoint of Brahman .
True reality is Brahman , which is One , indeterminate , and all that there is .
Brahman simply is .
We , the so - called individual selves , are each essentially an atman .
Being an Atman , each of us is not really distinct from other individual selves ( or from anything else whatsoever ) .
As Atman , we are ultimately one with Brahman , which is tantamount to being one with reality as such .
Accordingto Vedanta , not to realize this oneness with Brahman , via the realization of our true essence as Atman , is to remain spiritually blinded by Avidya .
Liberation as self - realization is the realization of our ultimate identity with Brahman .
Short of our understanding of our Atman - essence we are each a Jiva , an individual ego distinct from other similarly " unrealized " individuals .
As Atman , none of us is really an individual self , but a universal self merging with the absolute universality of Brahman .
To come to have this realization is to attain Moksa .
As it stands , the Vedantic metaphysics is realist , i.e. realist about the self as Atman .
It is the " being " of the self , rather than nothingness or emptiness , which is clearly affirmed .
The Atman is regarded to be the truest , and only enduring , reality .
Vedanta therefore strikes us as a reality - affirming ontology in contrast to the reality - negating ontology of Buddhism .
For Vedanta , there is a reality with its positive identity once the illusory projection of a phenomenal world is transcended .
There is Atman- identical - with - Brahman to constitute Reality .
By contrast , the Reality of Buddhism is seemingly gratuitous because sheer emptiness is supposed to be coterminous with Reality .
Lacking in any positive content or identity , the Reality depicted by Buddhism would seem to make no room for the possibility of an enduring experience to count as an experience of emancipation .
When Buddhism and Vedanta are thus juxtaposed in a comparative perspective , the two systems present themselves in the form of a mutually exclusive relation .
An affirmation of the existence of Atman would presuppose a negation of the reality of Sunyata .
Conversely , identifying reality with the field of Sunyata would entail a denial of the existence of Atman .
So , either it is Atman without Sunyata , or it is Sunyata without Atman .
We must recall the earlier discussion that both Buddhism and Vedanta with their opposing ontological commitments nevertheless converge on the issue of salvation .
This means that Sunyatais no impediment to ultimate liberation .
And if the reality of Sunyata leaves no room for Atman , then it follows , by implication , that the non-existence of Atmanis also no impediment to ultimate liberation .
One might say here ( with a mildly reactive temperament ) that the metaphysics of ultimate liberation is severely underdetermined by the ontology of the self .
But is the question of the self --- its existence or non-existence --- so very neutral with respect to the possibility of liberation ?
At this stage I would argue in the direction of justifying a negative answer to the above question .
I would claim that self - reality is intimately connected to the reality of ultimate liberation .
But in claiming this I would in no way imply that the Buddhist way of conceiving of the possibility of liberation is fictitious .
Instead , my conclusion would be that true liberation or emancipation is as much grounded in a metaphysic of Sunyata as it is founded upon its counterpart metaphysic of Atman .
But , then , I shall have to disentangle the knotty problem of the antinomy between Buddhism and Vedanta discussed in the beginning of this essay .
I think that a reconciliatory philosophical reconsideration of the ancient debate between Buddhism and Vedanta would yield a picture in which the two systems would be seen as being complementary to each other .
With this intent I shall start from the Vedantic angle to show that the concept of Atman is compatible with that of Sunyata .
Granted the reality or existence of Atman , exactly in what form does it exist ?
Can we say that it exists as an individual entity of some sort ?
To so exist , it must satisfy certain criteria of individuation .
But , admittedly , there are no such criteria .
Not being Jiva , it is not an individual existing in relation to other individual entities .
This is tantamount to saying that Atman is not really an individual at all .
It has no relationality except its relation to Brahman , which is , after all , a relation of identity characterizing the non-duality between the two .
Can the Atman be described in terms of any attribute apart from its most general characterization as something of the nature of pure consciousness ?
And qua pure consciousness --- consciousness without any specific features --- Atman is better grasped as attributeless .
It is as though we can get a grip on the concept of Atman by subtracting from the " content - laden " concept of consciousness all contingent specificities attached to the concept .
Atman is consciousness absolutely purged of all factual specificities --- everything that consciousness accumulates during its involvement with the empirical world or Samsara .
If Atman is attributively free pure consciousness , and attribute - free consciousness entails consciousness not centred on any ego - specific point of view , then it is a " decentred " self inhabitating a " centreless " world .
Consciousness decentred is also consciousness universalized , and a self nourished by universalized , perspectiveless consciousness is evidently empty of all inner encumbrances that accrue to a self of centred consciousness .
At least , part of attaining ultimate liberation is this freedom from the contingencies of ego - centred consciousness .
One could say that one meaning of the Buddhist concept of emptiness is the idea of the self 's emptying itself of accumulations of inner traits born of ego - specific consciousness .
Once we conceive of the idea of a decentred self as having its life in a centreless world of ego - neutral consciousness , we get closer to the idea of Atman as identical with the universal consciousness of Brahman .
We may even think of the self 's progressive decentering of itself culminating in a form of transcendental subjectivity which is the perfection of centrelessness .
Such a perfectly decentred consciousness would then be a mirror image of Atman .
But a perfectly centreless consciousness would have to be absolutely devoid of perspectival partialities of ego-centric consciousness steeped in the " push and pull " of Samsara .
It would be emptied of the delimiting attributes of finitude to the extent of experiencing the intimations of infinity .
It would undergo a transformation of consciousness from its ego - specifically substantial mode to an ego - neutrally " insubstantial " mode of Nothingness .
We now have a picture of Atman that depicts the self as consciousness without any substantive content of empirically delimiting attributes .
This picture also seems to be akin to the Buddhist idea of nothingness or Sunyata .
Atman - consciousness is a kind of consciousness - as - nothingness in asmuch as it is empty of the attributes of ego - specific subjectivity .
Transcendence from the life of a Jiva to that of Atman requires that the self render itself into emptiness ( Sunyata ) as far as the perspectival subjectivity of the former mode of life is concerned .
It would therefore be no travesty of Vedantic truth to say that there is a great deal of Sunyata in the inner constitution of Atman .
The Vedantic self is nourished by metaphysical nothingness .
It is therefore no wonder that Samkara , the greatest protagonist of Advaita Vedanta , has been described as the Buddha in disguise .
Of course , one must not underplay the positive ontological connotation of Atman in a bid to overplay the metaphysical nothingness of Atman - consciousness .
While the Vedantic self must negate all its ego - specific substantiality and transform into consciousness - as - nothingness , it is precisely the fulfillment of this negation that the true affirmation of the positive existence or substantiality of the self as Atman consists in .
Nothingness therefore is one side of the coin of the Vedantic self , of which the other side is its ego - neutral or centreless substantiality .
Indeed , the substantiality of Atman is at its most pronounced in its potentiality to attain moksa .
What , on the other hand , about the alleged non-substantiality of ultimate reality as Nothingness or Sunyata ?
I think it would be equally wrong to overplay the negative connotation of the metaphysic of Sunyata to the point of losing sight of any affirmative connotation concealed behind that metaphysic .
For one thing , the admission of the potentiality to attain and experience Nirvana is a clear indication of the substantiality of Sunyata - based existence .
In this sense Sunyata evidently has an ontic import ; and it even suggests an ontology of self akin to that of Vedanta .
Buddhistic ultimate liberation --- the attainment of Nirvana --- is a substantial unitary transition from the unenlightened condition to the state of enlightenment .
The possibility of this transition bespeaks of the substantial presence of a shadowy self in the metaphysical vacuum of Sunyata .
Furthermore , Sunyata is not abhava or non-existence , but held to be the ultimate ground of everything , the utmost original condition of reality prior to all conceptualization and phenomenal distortion .
It is characterized as pregnant emptiness , vibrant void .
Cast in terms of consciousness , Sunyata is a state of pure consciousness that one would revert to if one were able to empty oneself of any illusory constructions or impressions of an unchanging or permanent reality , whether of things or persons .
This reversal to original subjectivity , which also has an ethical import , may be interpreted as one 's " becoming " Sunya or empty .
But " becoming " Sunya does not mean going out of existence .
Rather , one can truly be oneself , or become trulyself - aware , only by " becoming " Sunya .
Otherwise , one continues to be in an unawakened state --- to be under the spell of Avidya .
Can we not say , now , that the Buddhist awakening in " the field of Sunyata " is most akin to the Vedantic realization of the ultimate identity of Atman with Brahman ?
And is not Brahman --- the absolutely indeterminate ( Nirguna ) Ultimate Reality --- itself more like a " field of Sunyata , " the original ground of everything ?
It seems to me that these speculations about the " complementarity " between Vedanta and Buddhism are on the right track .
For such a reading of these two systems of thought helps us make more coherent sense of either position than what they seem to mean individually .
What , then , is the complementary light of Buddhism on our understanding of Vedanta ?
It is essentially this : Sunyata is the only ground reality for the life of Atman .
Atman without Sunyata would be like motion without energy .
In a similar vein , it can also be said that " becoming " Sunya or being in ( the field of ) Sunyata is virtually the same thing as being or " becoming " Atman .
It is important that we recognize the negative overtone of Sunyata and its cognate Anatman has , as its counterpoint , an affirmative undertone .
There is the negation of the unawakened self --- the self centred in an individualized field of consciousness and shackled to the perspectives tied to it .
This negation forms the basis for a spontaneous affirmation of becoming awakened or enlightened --- becoming a decentred self .
In essence , consciousness - as - Sunyata manifests itself in the form of consciousness - as - Atman .
What transpires from the above discussions is a thesis that is better characterized in terms of convergence of Buddhism and Vedanta than in terms of their complementarity to one another .
Of course each is a complementary perspective to the other in so far as our making coherent sense of either position is concerned .
What we gain from such a complementary understanding of the allegedly incompatible juxtaposition of these two ancient systems of thought is that their apparent difference betrays a profound underlying unity .
We have intimations of a " hidden " Atman of Buddhism on the one hand , and of the " silent " Sunyata in Vedanta on the other .
A deeper study of the Vedantic Atman - theory results in making the otherwise silent metaphysics of emptiness resonate with a persuasive explanatory voice , much as a scrutinizing look at the Buddhistic Sunyata - theory manages to get a glimpse of the shadowy presence of a full - fledged Atman that explains the possibility of enlightenment .
It is a welcome sign in contemporary scholarship to find Japanese Buddhism ( especially the Kyoto school of Zen Buddhism ) professing views that reflect the compatibility of Buddhist ideology with that of Vedanta .
Nishitani Keiji , a distinguished scholar of this school of thought , is emphatic on affirming the intimacy of the relation between Sunyata and the self .
Emptiness is said to be the " absolute nearside " of us .
Sunyata is the field of ecstatic transcendence and the " absolute nearside where emptiness is self . "
We are said to become truly ourselves when we are empty , i.e. when we become decentred selves in the field of nothingness .
There is thus a pronounced self - assertion set against Sunyata .
Interestingly , Nishitani turns to " The I - Thou Relation in Zen Buddhism " and analyzes the nature of this relation in a manner which is strikingly Vedantic .
He talks about this relation as " non-differentiated " , and adds that this " absolute non-differentiation belongs to the I itself , and it is the same for the Thou . "
The implication is that , once the self is in Sunyata , which is said to be its " home ground , " it truly becomes itself and then enters into the " I - Thou " relation with the distinctive attitude of " absolute non-differentiation . "
This is clearly indicative of the Advaita or non-dualism of Vedanta .
The non-duality of the I - Thou relation is emblematic of the ultimate non-duality of Reality .
In contemporary Indian philosophy we witness a neo-Vedantic portrayal of the I - Thou relation in a significantly different light .
Ramchandra Gandhi presents a highly interesting version of the I - Thou relation in the communicative framework of the addresser - addressee relation .
There is something uniquely sacrosanct about my addressing someone by using the personal pronoun You .
In being so addressed by me , you are called forth as just yourself , in your pure and simple personal identity , " untouched " by any contingent or de facto attributes which happen to be true of you .
To be identified as an addressee is , for Gandhi , to be regarded as a person per se , when the person is not conceived under any predicative - attributive frame of mind .
What Gandhi wants to show on the basis of the idea of a non-attributive , non-predicative mode of person - identification is the availability of the religious idea of a soul .
When any one is called forth pronominally , the person ( addressee ) is picked out by the caller ( addresser ) with an attitude of mind which is characterized as an attitude towards a soul .
Hence the idea of a soul is implicit in the attributeless mode of thought in which the I relates itself to the Thou .
What it is to be a soul is thus articulated through a serious exploratory analysis of the communicative concept of personal pronominal designation .
The Gandhian idea of a soul defined in terms of non-attributive person - identification can now be profitably linked with both Sunyata and Atman .
The addressee as a soul is very much modeled on what it is to be Atman .
For you to be addressed by me entirely non-attributively is to be thought of as a pure personal subject , much as for me to adopt the non-predicative stance towards you is to act as a decentred self .
One might say that this formulation of the I - Thou relation is a variation on the idea of inter-relations between Vedantic selves .
But it is also a variation on Buddhist Sunyata : for me to adopt thenon - attributive stance towards you is to place myself ( as well as you ) in the field of nothingness .
Unless I " become " empty or Sunya , I cannot absolve myself of my usual attributive - predicative mode of viewing you or anybody else , including myself .
What we are presented with here is a very fundamental human situation , a situation of human communion in its most primary modality : addressing .
I and Thou coexist in the unitary field of Sunyata , which is the attitudinal locus of non-attributive inter-personal regard .
When we both partake of the infinite field of absolute nothingness , there is no duality of I and Thou .
There is " virtual identity " instead , which means the relation is truly expressed as " I am Thou . "

* German sentiment falls on debt rescue package concerns
* IMF ’s Lipsky says global recovery needs policy support
* Weaker euro could boost exports , help growth
* EU cracks down on hedge funds
( Adds Greek and Italian fin . ministers , hedge fund move , ECB )
By Sakari Suoninen
MANNHEIM , Germany , May 18 ( Reuters ) - German investor sentiment fell sharply in May on concern growth will be stifled by a 750 - billion - euro ( $ 930 billion ) rescue package designed to calm market fears of a wave of Greek - style debt crises .
Tough conditions , similar to those imposed in International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) bailouts , have been set for euro zone states seeking shelter from markets anxious about their debt levels .
The closely watched ZEW analyst and investor survey saw medium - term growth down in Europe ’s biggest economy .
“ The EU rescue package will in the mid-term reduce budget deficits , but it will also dampen demand and mid-term growth will be dampened as well , ” ZEW economist Michael Schroeder told reporters .
[ nLDE64H12Y ]
EU finance ministers meeting in Brussels meanwhile overrode British objections and backed stricter rules on hedge funds as part of efforts to learn the lessons of the global financial crisis and create a more stable financial system .
[ nLDE64H14X ]
Greece blames hedge funds for exacerbating its borrowing problems by betting against its debt and wants them banned .
Italy ’s Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti for his part called for curbs on credit default swaps .
Eighty percent of the bloc 's hedge funds are located in Britain .
Any changes are likely to take effect around 2012 .

Greece was forced to seek a record 110 - billion - euro bailout this month as borrowing costs soared due to market fears it could default on its enormous debts .
But markets then focused on other vulnerable euro zone states , forcing the group ’s leaders to devise a $ 1 trillion safety net with the IMF to protect other vulnerable members .
The package prompted Germany , the biggest national contributor , to abandon 16 billion euros of tax cuts designed initially to lift its export - driven economy .
And with Spain and Portugal agreeing additional austerity measures to rein in their budget deficits , the fear is the drive to fiscal consolidation will slow growth -- which the European Commission already saw at just 0.9 percent in 2010 .
Reacting to the ZEW survey , Unicredit analyst Alexander Koch said increased savings efforts in neighbouring states would reduce the demand for German exports .
“ There the thumb screws are being applied to the budget : i.e. tax increases and spending cuts .
This dampens private consumption and public investment , ” he said .
U.S. President Barack Obama has discussed the debt crisis with European leaders and some U.S. analysts warn the U.S. economy , where GDP growth is forecast at 2.8 percent this year , could stall again if Europe ’s crisis fails to stabilise .
IMF First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky said the global economy “ remains sluggish , uneven and still in need of policy support ” .
“ As recent events in Greece have shown , risks remain considerable , ” he told a symposium in Tokyo . [ n TOE64H06 W ]
ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE , FISCAL REFORM
Euro zone states are trying to smooth out wrinkles in their rescue plan , which comprises standby funds and loan guarantees that governments can tap if shut out of credit markets .
Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said the talks would help markets realise that “ there is clear willingness and commitment on the part of the euro zone and non-euro zone to help those countries that are in need , as long as they do what is needed ” .
The European Central Bank meanwhile drained 16.5 billion euros from the commercial banking system on Tuesday to dull the potential inflationary impact of government bonds bought to support euro zone debt markets .

On Monday , euro zone ministers agreed to consider a proposal that broad macroeconomic outlines of national budgets be discussed in advance at the European level , with speedier penalty procedures for countries that breach EU budget rules .
“ It is essential now that we show we are serious about fiscal consolidation .
I could sense broad support for the Commission proposals ( on economic surveillance ) , ” said Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn .
The debt crisis and concerns over growth have hit the euro , which has fallen some 14 percent against the dollar this year .
It edged up from Monday ’s four - year low after officials said Greece had received a 14.5 billion euro tranche of its EU emergency loan , some of which would be used to repay in full an 8.5 billion euro bond maturing on Wednesday .

I have been so , so , SO sick ever since I returned from NYC .
I caught the nastiest cold I ’ve had in a long while .
When I ’m sick , I hardly eat .
Once I start to get my appetite back , the last thing I want to do is cook .
In fact , sitting on the couch and watching Star Trek ( more on that in a moment ) with my husband is about all I ’m up to .
That means the food I make needs to be easy , fast , light , and healthy .
Enter hasperat .
My new favorite sandwich .
The Star Trek fans among you will recognize the dish .
Hasperat is a spicy wrap , made with brine , that ’s often talked about and enjoyed by inhabitants of the planet Bajor .
That ’s about all the information given about it .
I ’m sure you all think I ’m crazy right about now .
Who makes imaginary food from Sci -Fi television shows ?
I guess I do ?
I ’ve only recently become a Star Trek fan , and ever since my husband and I started watching it , I thought it ’d be really fun ( if not hopelessly nerdy ) to create some alien food .
I ’ve considered Vulcan Plomeek Soup , Klingon Gagh , and Cardassian Yamok Sauce over asparagus .
When my husband came home from the store today with some tortillas , I knew that Bajoran Hasperat was the way to go .
Are you all still there , or have I… uh … alienated you ?
Oh boy .
Better get on with the recipe , huh .
I promise you ’ll like this sandwich regardless of your feelings about space travel , dilithium crystals , warp core breeches , holosuites , phasers , or the Dominion .
Hasperat is supposed to be really spicy and salty .
Those of you who do n’t like eye - watering food can easily make the mild version of this ( I just had it , and it was delicious ) , but the addition of horseradish flavored hummus , or tabasco sauce , would make a more authentic dish .
Well , if a recipe I made up to resemble imaginary food eaten by imaginary aliens on an imaginary planet can be called “ authentic ” .
Hasperat
For Two
2 10 ″ Wheat Tortillas
1/2 Cup Hummus
( Any flavor , plain or horseradish is nice )
1 Small Cucumber , sliced very thin ( about 1/2 cup )
1 Carrot , shredded ( about 1/3 cup )
1 1/2 Tbs Tamari ( or regular soy sauce )
1 1/2 Tbs Rice Vinegar
Black Pepper
2 Small Handfuls Baby Spinach
Hot Chili Sauce / Tabasco , optional
Using a mandoline , or your food processor , or a sharp knife , slice the cucumber very thinly and place in a large bowl .
Add the carrot .
Add tamari and rice vinegar and toss .
Let marinate 5 - 10 minutes ( or longer , if desired ) .
Warm your tortillas so they ’re pliable .
You can microwave them for a few seconds with a damp paper towel , heat them in a dry skillet , or ( my favorite ) hold them directly over the flame of your gas burning stove .
Spread the tortillas with hummus , 3 - 4 Tbs each , making sure you cover the entire surface .
This will help the sandwich stick together .
Arrange the cucumber slices in one layer , slightly overlapping .
Add carrot , and sprinkle some fresh pepper over the top .
Add a layer of baby spinach .
Roll up the wrap , tucking in the ends , and place on a hot grill pan to slightly warm and create pretty grill marks .
You can do this in a regular pan if you do n’t have a grill pan .
Slice and eat immediately .

We had all but forgotten about that cute little kid from Jerry Maguire .
But Ray Boyd came back into our lives last night after an emailer sent over a photo from the recent Playboy Golf shenanigans where ( real name ) Jonathan Lipnicki ( turns 20 in October ) had some fun with the ladies .
( Watch this .
It ’ll make you feel old . )
Anyway , this is n’t Jon ’s first rodeo with Hef ’s ladies .
This lucky shit turned one movie part into the greatest chick getting ventures in Hollywood history .
The very top photo is from the 2010 Playboy Golf tourney .
We ’ve also snagged two pics from the 2009 tourney where 18 - year - old Jon partied it up right alongside the Hef girls .
Let ’s see , at 18 we were just praying to get laid as a college freshman .
This kid walks into the Mansion and has the audacity to go with the undone smoking jacket .
Jerry Maguire money still must be good because Ray Boyd has n’t worked very much since 1996 .
A look at his IMDB shows that starring roles have been few and far between .
Stuart Little 2 was eight years ago .
Still , all that matters for a child actor is that one role that will forever be a panty dropper .
Jon is like a Doug Williams .
Doug was n’t a Hall of Famer but he has that Super Bowl ring .
You ’re never taking that away from him .
Jon has that dorky little cute kid role and he ’s going to use it , from the look of things , as a poon broom for years to come .
Congrats , kid .

A UK detention centre inmate has been caught offering tattoos using a machine he rigged up from a Sony Playstation .
The detainee stripped down a console and attached its motor to a ballpoint pen with its tip sharpened to drive ink into the skin , The Sun reported today .
The home - made gizmo was seized along with a tattoo magazine from the detainee 's room at Brook House Immigration Removal Centre near Gatwick , West Sussex .
Sources claim he charged other detainees to use it — but officials denied this .
A source said : " It was a truly bizarre piece of DIY , up there with some of the most extraordinary finds staff have made .
" When it was switched on it would move up and down like a real tattoo gun .
But you would have to be daring to want a tattoo from a machine like that . "
The Border and Immigration Agency said the device was seized during a routine check of rooms .
A spokesperson said : " No further action was taken , but staff have been made aware so they can be vigilant for anything similar . "
The centre holds 426 men — many awaiting deportation after jail for crimes in the UK .
They are allowed PlayStation 1 and 2 consoles , but not the PlayStation 3 model because it can connect to the internet .
Guards in US jails have found tattoo guns made from Nintendo consoles .

Other supporters of the program said Brown ’s support for the GE engine does not represent a shift on his campaign promises , because Brown believes the engine , notwithstanding the Pentagon ’s position , is critical to US national security .
Many in Congress have argued that establishing competition for the engine contracts could hold down costs in the future .
By lending his support to the GE backup engine , Brown is mirroring a longstanding position of the late senator Edward M. Kennedy , whose seat Brown filled after a special election in January .
The Pentagon since 2006 has said that the primary engine for the F - 35 , built by Pratt & Whitney , in East Hartford , Conn. , is sufficient , and that producing a backup model will siphon away money that could be spent on other defense priorities .
“ If Scott Brown helps out GE he will be doing exactly the opposite of what he said he would do when he ran , ’’ said Loren Thompson , a defense budget specialist at the Lexington Institute in Arlington , Va. , which is supported by multiple defense firms , including Pratt & Whitney .
“ This is yet another example of how ‘ fiscally responsible ’ lawmakers have a giant blind spot when it comes to defense spending in their districts , ’’ said Laura Peterson , a senior national security analyst at Taxpayers for Common Sense , a nonpartisan budget watchdog group that monitors earmarks .
“ His support was clearly driven by parochial concerns rather than financial ones . ’’
But spending critics say Brown is abandoning his personal pledge to battle pork barrel spending in Washington .
Brown , who landed a coveted spot on the influential Armed Services Committee , joins other Massachusetts politicians who in the past have successfully advocated for GE ’s jet engine , which could generate several hundred jobs at GE ’s engine plant in Lynn .
Brown “ was disappointed that the administration ’s budget cut funding for the Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine and will work with fellow members of the delegation to find a solution , ’’ the statement said .
Brown ’s office said in a statement to the Globe that the freshman senator believes “ this project benefits both our military and our state . ’’
It was Brown ’s first public statement on how he will vote on military spending matters .
The Bay State Republican ’s support for General Electric ’s bid to build a backup engine for the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter puts the new senator in the middle of a confrontation over congressional earmarks with the Obama administration , which has threatened a presidential veto if Congress inserts funding for the engine for the fifth year in a row .
WASHINGTON — Senator Scott Brown says he will fight to fund a multibillion - dollar weapons program that could generate jobs in Massachusetts but that the Pentagon insists it does not need , sparking criticism that Brown is breaking his campaign vow to rein in wasteful spending .
Brown was unavailable for an interview yesterday because he was traveling overseas .
Brown has hammered at the federal government for needlessly spending taxpayers ’ money .
In announcing his Senate candidacy last September , he criticized his Democratic opponents for “ pandering to the special interests , promising to support their pet project . ’’
“ That ’s not the way I operate , ’’ Brown said .
At a December press conference , Brown said that “ spending is out of control , ’’ and that “ government keeps getting bigger and bigger . ’’
And in January he called for a freeze in wages for federal workers “ until a plan is devised for controlling government spending and debt . ’’
His positions have attracted crucial political support .
One ad campaign , paid for by the US Chamber of Commerce , included the tagline , “ Scott Brown believes in fiscal responsibility . ’’
And one of Brown ’s political mentors , Senator John McCain of Arizona , a leading voice against GE ’s F - 35 backup engine who cosponsored unsuccessful amendments to kill it , has said he supported Brown because of his pledges to reduce needless spending .
“ He epitomized what the American people were saying , ’’ McCain said , introducing Brown to a crowd in Phoenix last month .
“ The American people were saying : ‘ Stop . . . .
We do n’t want out - of - control spending in our nation ’s capitol . ’’’
The fight over the backup engine , which remains in the design phase and is opposed by Pratt & Whitney , promises to heat up again this year .
GE and Pratt & Whitney have hired retired generals to lobby on their behalf , and GE has accused Pratt & Whitney of secretly funding a watchdog group that is highly critical of the GE engine .
Both Pratt & Whitney and the group , Citizens Against Government Waste , declined to say whether they have a financial relationship .
Thus far , the GE engine has received $ 2.4 billion for development work , much of it never requested by the Department of Defense .
Pentagon officials estimated in February that it would require an additional $ 2.9 billion over the next six years to continue development .
They also said they found no evidence to support assertions that giving the military two engines to choose from will drive down costs when the fighter aircraft fleet is built in large quantities .
Despite the negative reviews , the Massachusetts congressional delegation has been instrumental in keeping the program alive .
Kennedy was one of its biggest champions .
And Senator John F. Kerry , a Massachusetts Democrat , played a key role in securing nearly $ 500 million for the program last year , saying that it was critical to the local economy , and that having an alternate engine would foster much - needed competition in the Joint Strike Fighter program .
The program is the largest such program in history , with 2,443 planes set to be built by Lockheed Martin for the Navy , Air Force , and Marine Corps .
Kerry said he plans to push again to secure , or “ earmark , ’’ funding for the project .
“ I ’ve already been on the phone with the White House , [ Office of Management and Budget ] , and the Pentagon , ’’ he said .
Representative John Tierney , a Salem Democrat whose district includes the GE plant , has strongly defended the program .
GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said about 150 of the 2,500 jobs now working directly on the project are located in Lynn , with the rest at facilities in Indiana , Ohio , and elsewhere .
If the engine enters production , he said , Lynn ’s role would grow to at least 500 jobs , possibly as many as 1,000 .
The debate , however , is likely to hinge on how the military handles major contracts , not job creation .
“ Competition in defense contracting helps keep costs under control and realize savings over time , ’’ Tierney said .
“ Additionally , the risks are too great to have only one supplier of engines . ’’
He cited recent revelations that the Pratt & Whitney engine is experiencing cost increases and delays .
Other powerful lawmakers — including Representative Ike Skelton , a Missouri Democrat who chairs the House Armed Services Committee — also assert that the F - 35 program is simply too important to rely on a single engine manufacturer .
“ When 95 percent of the Department ’s fighters will be F - 35 variants by 2035 , this is not a question of pork , ’’ Skelton said at a recent congressional hearing .
“ It is a sincere concern for the success of the F - 35 program and for the benefits of competition . ’’
Yet the secretaries of defense in both the Bush and Obama administrations , and the military ’s top generals , have insisted for years that they simply cannot afford to finance development of a second engine .
“ We have reached a critical point in this debate where spending more money on a second engine for the [ F - 35 ] is unnecessary , wasteful , and simply diverts precious modernization funds from more pressing [ military ] priorities , ’’ William J. Lynn , the deputy secretary of defense , told Congress in a February memo .

Selective 5 - HT 2A agonist hallucinogens :
A review of pharmacological interaction and corollary perceptual effects
By James Kent
May 23 , 2008 - Beta Review
Abstract / Summary
The most potent tryptamine hallucinogens – such as DMT , psilocybin , and LSD – are all active at the 5 - HT 2A receptor subtype and all produce similar visual perceptual results that are immediately recognizable as uniquely psychedelic .
Although it is widely accepted that selective serotonin receptor subtype 2A agonism is directly responsible for producing the distinct hallucinations seen on a psychedelic trip , no single theory has yet explained why this is so .
Utilizing what we know about psychedelic tryptamine receptor interaction , sensory processing circuits in the neocortex , and EEG scans of psychedelics in action , this review will propose a novel multi-state theory of psychedelic action which invokes a variety of neural processing mechanisms , including phase - coupled neural oscillators ; network excitation , disinhibition , and destabilization ; recurrent feedback excitation ; and neural circuit spike synchrony and brainwave cohesion to close the knowledge gap between the pharmaceutical interactions of selective 5 - HT 2A hallucinogens , their direct effects on perception and consciousness at varying dose ranges , and their potential long - term adverse effects .
Keywords : hallucinogens , psychedelics , serotonin , 5 - HT 2A receptors , layer V pyramidal neurons , disinhibition , recurrent excitation , thalamocortical feedback loops , interareal feedback loops , corticocortical feedback loops , neural spike synchrony , asynchronous ESPCs , late ISPCs , phosphenes , neural oscillators , coupled oscillators , pharmacology , perception , consciousness , OBEs , NDEs , binding , cognitive theory .
Layer V Pyramidal Cells and 5 - HT 2A Mediated Feedback Modulation
The most potent and most visual of all hallucinogens are the psychedelic tryptamines , which have chemical structure similar to serotonin and have been shown to be directly active at the 5 - HT 2A receptor subtype , with slightly lesser affinity at the 2C subtype [ 1 ] .
Within the brain the highest density of 5 - HT 2A receptors are expressed on the dendrites of cortical Layer V pyramidal cells [ 2 - 3 ] , and the highest density of Layer V dendrites project upward into the dendritic arbors of cortical Layer I , the very outward surface of the cortex .
The dendritic arbors of the neocortex contain the highest density of neural receptors in the brain , and are responsible for top - down detail analysis of incoming sensory dat a [ 4 ] .
All layers of the neocortex interact with Layer I dendritic arbors – either sending or retrieving impulses in arboreal feedback loops – in order to maintain consistent sensory analysis of external reality from moment to moment .
Layer V axonal projections , which connect to lower areas of the brain as well as laterally across the entire cortex , are one of the primary conduits for binding information localized in one area of the neocortex to information localized in another area of the cortex .
Layer V pyramidal cells are unique in the cortex in that they mediate multiple pathways of feedback excitation in perceptual analysis .
For example , in the visual cortex alone Layer V pyramidal cells are responsible for synchronizing corticothalamic activity with the thalamic nuclei via descending axons ; they also mediate feedback excitation in interlaminar circuits via recurrent collaterals ascending back up through Layers I - IV ; they mediate reciprocal interareal connections via laterally branching arboreal and basilar dendrites ; and they mediate afferent corticocortical signal flow along the dorsal and ventral processing streams [ 5 - 6 ] .
To illustrate the importance of Layer V cells in mediating cortical signal flow and feedback , I offer this quote from Edward Jones on synchrony in thalamocortical circuits :
" The capacity of the layer V corticothalamic projection to bring activity in one cortical region to thalamic nuclei that project to adjacent regions , and even to distant regions located in other lobes of the cerebral hemisphere , could extend the binding process by providing a basis for unifying activity in the somatosensory and motor cortex during movement performance ( Ribary et al .
1991 ; Murthy & Fetz 1992 , 1996a , b; Sanes & Donoghue 1993 ) , and in parietal areas engaged in perception with that in frontal areas engaged in planning strategies for action ( Tononi et al. 1992 ; Lumer et al. 1997 ) .
Corticocortical connections undoubtedly play a prominent part here as well but they would run parallel to a system of corticothalamocortical loops in spreading activity across the forebrain . " [ 5 ]
It should be taken as evident that Layer V pyramidal cells are essential in mediating multiple layers of cortical and thalamocortical feedback in order to sustain brainwave cohesion and neural spike synchrony across the entire brain , a process referred to as sensory binding .
Given the various circuit functions of Layer V pyramid cells and the prevalence of 5 - HT 2A receptors mediating these neurons , the notion that 5 - HT 2A selective agonists can act as both cortical feedback amplifiers and / or interrupters at varying dose ranges is not only likely , it would also explain a wide range of perceptual effects associated with the classic psychedelic trip .
Circuit Excitation : Phosphenes , Asynchronous ESPCs , and Low - Dose Hallucinations
Since hallucinogenic tryptamines produce a variety of visual hallucinations at differing dose ranges it is helpful to break down these subjective results by dose range to gauge the level of cortical circuit excitation by corresponding perceptual effects .
Even at low doses the most commonly reported visual effects of tryptamine intoxication are pulsating or slowly - rotating closed - eye geometric mandalas , tunnels , and spider webs , also known as phosphenes .
Phosphenes are visual artifacts of the spatially organized neural transforms that take place between the spherically organized receptor cells of the retina and the grid - like columnar processing cells in the visual cortex .
This visual pathway transformation translates incomplete rings of color and intensity data captured along the retina into the fine lines , shades , and fills we perceive in waking consciousness , yet when the visual processing pathway becomes excited and neural coupling in the thalamocortical loop destabilizes , visual artifacts of these spatially organized networks appear spontaneously within our closed - eye field of vision . [ 7,8,9 ]
Figure 1 . Phosphenes and Excitation in Cortical Loops :
The above panels show bifurcating patterns in spatially oriented grid - like cortical networks ( a ) and ring - link retinal networks ( b ) .
The top panels show patterns arising from distance - dependent connections ; the bottom panels show distance - and orientation - dependent connections ( Bressloff , et. al ) .
Boris Gutkin describes the emergence of spontaneous geometric patterns due to excitation and instability in recurrent visual circuits thusly :
" Ermentrout and Cowan showed that spontaneous symmetry breaking in spatially organized cortical networks could account for coarse spatial activity patterns perceived during hallucinations .
More recently , Bressloff .
et al. have incorporated coupling between orientation - sensitive cells to explain other types of more complex hallucinatory patterns ...
Generically for a random symmetric network , we expect either a transcritical or pitchfork bifurcation leading to a single excited mode reflecting the organization of the random network .
If the effect of hallucinogens or other external stimuli is to produce an overall increase in excitability of the network , then is it possible that the background state can become unstable leading to a spontaneous pattern of activity reflecting the associative organization of the recurrent network . " [ 10 ]
Figure 2 . Spatial organization of retinal neurons .
On the right is the action of the retinocorticalmap on the funnel form constant .
On the left is the action of the retinocorticalmap on the spiral form constant .
For both images ( a ) represents the image in the conical visual field , ( b ) represents the flattened V1 map of the image .
( Bressloff , et. al ) .
In the framework of this discussion we will assume that the phosphenes seen during low - dose tryptamine sessions are the artifacts of visual pathway excitation and destabilization in thalamocortical feedback loop due to 5 - HT 2A receptor interaction , and that the likely origin of this destabilizing affect is the corticothalamic axonal projections from V1 ( visual cortex area 1 ) Layer V pyramidal cells .
Although this destabilizing effect could be due to simple 5 - HT 2A agonism or modulatory interruption at the presynaptic neuron , there is also evidence that this excitation may be due to an asynchronous release of glutamate from Layer V pyramidal cells , resulting in the generation of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents ( EPSCs ) following each axonal spike . [ 11 ]
This effect is presumably not entirely localized in the visual cortex , allowing for similar network - based tactile and audio hallucinations , such as tingling skin or buzzing and ringing in the ears , to begin overloading actual sensation .
These effects would all indicate a mild excitatory feedback cascade within the overall neural network , resulting in phantom network noise and an increase in respiration and stress hormones to support the growing neural energy output .
In addition to phosphenes and closed - eye geometric visuals , there are other general perceptual effects one would expect to see as a result of excitation and instability in visual thalamocortical feedback loops , such as strobing or pulsing of light intensity and the perception of halos and softening of contrast in line resolution around light sources .
The reactionary dilation of the pupil may also occur as an autonomic result of excitation and instability along the visual pathway .
There is also some evidence that reciprocal connections between areas V1 , V2 , and V3 in the visual cortex are responsible for discrimination between figure and background detail in depth perception [ 12 ] , and it is easy to understand how excitation or loss of coupling stability in these connections could lead to the animated shifting of depth and perspective of objects in the visual field , another classically reported effect of low - to mid- dose psychedelic trips .
Disinhibition and Low - Dose Perceptual Distortions
Beyond the flickering lights and geometric patterns seen in low - dose tryptamine hallucination , mid-dose psychedelic hallucinations generally involve open - eye fluid distortions in the rendering of line , shape , texture , and depth .
Subjects under a sub - peak dose often report seeing breathing walls , creeping carpets , melting textures , and flickering geometric patterns crawling over every surface .
These effects are all similar in that they represent a destabilization in the visual cortex 's ability to hold sharp line , contrast , and texture detail in visual memory , and demonstrate a clear drifting or leaking of contrast information both laterally and radially across the cortex .
This fluid - like drifting in the visual field is most prominent in the periphery where the retinal blind - spots are working with incomplete data to begin with .
Figure 3 . Akiyoshi Kitaoka " Rotating Snakes " illusion presents an example of radial drift illusion caused by line ambiguity in peripheral visual field .
Even though this image has been downsized and reproduced in black and white , if you stare at the center of this image the illusion of rotational drift in the periphery is obvious .
This illusion is most likely due to a bug in the cortical lateral line - resolution process which causes ambiguous data in the visual periphery to remain unresolved , thus lines cannot hold and instead creep and drift , creating the illusion of gradual radial movement .
This creeping of line and shade in the periphery is similar to animated hallucinations seen on a light psychedelic trip . [ 22 ]
Hallucinations of creeping line , depth , and shadow are most likely caused by a loss of lateral inhibition within circuits in the peripheral visual field , and we can only assume that 5 - HT 2A selective agonism is either directly or indirectly responsible for this disinhibition .
One would also assume that the level of disinhibition and lateral drift in the visual field would be proportional to the dose of hallucinogen , and this assumption is generally proved correct by individual reports of hallucinogenic use .
While at lower doses there may be only sight wiggling or drifting to the animation of line and depth , at higher doses the lines between otherwise solid forms may actually appear to melt and swirl into one another .
These classic psychedelic hallucinations are all attributable to lateral disinhibition and local bleed - over excitation in the visual field .
The loss of lateral inhibition may be attributable to the ESPCs caused by asynchronous glutamate leakage discussed earlier .
But in addition to this theory , Leonard Kass proposed what was termed the “ Presynaptic Uptake Blockade Hypothesis for the action of LSD ” in 1983 .
In short , Kass ' research led him to believe that LSD blocks presynaptic uptake of 5 - HT at the lateral inhibitory synapse , thus destabilizing lateral inhibition and allowing bleed - over excitation along the sensory processing pathways . [ 13 ]
Given the range of serotonergic functionality in the brain we must not ignore the possibility that 5 - HT 2A selective agonists may have multiple actions at multiple sites , serving to both dampen localized lateral inhibition while simultaneously promoting feedback excitation across the entire cortex .
This dualistic effect would become synergistic at higher doses , serving to boost overall brain excitation by flooding disinhibited networks with uninhibited or runaway feedback processing loops .
With sufficient loss of lateral inhibition in the visual cortex , even a small amount of perceived motion would cause a standing wave of recurrent excitation along the thalamocortical loop , leading to ghost - like afterimages which fade in the wake of moving objects .
This recurrent “ echo effect ” would presumably apply to all sensation introduced to the sensory processing system , not just visual , similarly explaining a wide variety of subjective effects .
Recurrent Excitation and Sub - Peak Hallucination
Disinhibition alone may account for a variety of psychedelic experiences , but if we are to follow the notion that Layer V pyramidal neurons are disinhibited and prone to excitability under the influence of selective 5 - HT 2A agonists , then we must step back and look to all the feedback connections these cells mediate in order to understand how disinhibition and recurrent excitation at this centralized pathway could potentially affect the entirety of consciousness .
The Thalamocortical Feedback Circuit
Layer V pyramidal cells mediate the thalamocortical feedback circuit via descending axons , making Layer V neurons the primary route of thalamocortical feedback circuit .
This feedback circuit is primarily used for top - down focus and attention - driven discrimination of incoming data sets .
We have already discussed what might happen if the coupling was destabilized in this circuit , including the emergence of phosphenes , frame flickering , frame rotation , and other simple frame translation errors .
The Interlaminar Feedback Circuit
Layer V pyramidal cells are responsible for mediating sensory feedback with the layers of cortex via ascending recurrent collaterals , making them the primary driver of the interlaminar feedback circuit .
This circuit is characterized by bottom - to - top vertical feedback between dendritic arbors in cortical Layer I and the inter - networked layers of II -V .
In the alert waking state immediate perception does not require much interlaminar feedback excitation .
Recent research has shown that the bulk of immediate sensory processing occurs as a constant stream of feed - forward sweeps and fills [ 15 ] .
Top - down feedback in this circuit only kicks in when a particular data set is ambiguous , salient , or requires more detail articulation .
Top down feedback excitation serves to narrow cortical focus in order resolve fine detail in salient data sets .
If this feedback circuit were excited by hallucinogens , there would be an overall increase in intensity , perceived importance , and data resolution on all incoming sensation .
If this feedback excitation were to occur while local interneurons were simultaneously disinhibited , sensory feedback processing would run the risk of over - articulating all incoming data into fractally receding groups of complex embedded patterns .
The imaginary extrusion of lines and the perception of deeply embedded fractal patterns in random textures is another classic mid- to high - dose psychedelic hallucination .
The Interareal Feedback Circuit
Within the visual cortex , Layer V cells mediate reciprocal connections with visual sub- processing areas , such as V1 , V2 , and so on , which allow for a variety of specialized interareal processes [ 12 ] .
Much like the interlaminar circuit , feedback excitation in this circuit would intensify depth and foreground - figure detail while simultaneously warping the perspective of visual space .
A loss of stability in this pathway could lead to fish - eye perspectives , with stationary objects in the visual periphery appearing to either lean forward or recede backward in fluid wave - like rhythms .
Similarly , depth perception would appear to recede off into infinity wherever light contrast was such that the ability to discriminate between foreground and background detail was lost .
The Corticocortical Feedback Loop
Moving onward from the visual cortex to higher processing centers along the visual pathway , Layer V pyramidal neurons are once again responsible for mediating corticocortical circuits along both dorsal and ventral streams , all the way up to the multi-modal sensory convergence areas in the pre-frontal cortex ( PFC ) .
Destabilization along this all - important binding pathway would allow for a multi- layered cascade of top - down excitatory feedback loops with extreme perceptual results .
This is where 5 - HT 2A selective agonists stop being strictly perceptual and begin to affect the entirety of consciousness .
Cross - lobe reciprocal pathways are essential for mediating our real - time multi-modal awareness of reality and the self .
When these pathways become excited and begin to destabilize the perceptual effect goes beyond visual hallucination and becomes profoundly disorienting .
A subject with heightened excitation along these pathways would experience very complex and disturbing changes in reality , such as visual frame - skipping ; memory loss ; memory gaps ; temporal distortion ; time lags ; obsessive thought loops ; logic traps ; the inability to match words to objects ; the inability to maintain a train of thought over a few seconds long before it repeats itself ; the simultaneous “ filling up ” or overload of all senses ; and the overwhelming urge to shut - down , hide , or recede from reality .
In contrast , once these cortical feedback circuits are fully interrupted and decoupled the subject loses all sense of self , time , and place ; becomes profoundly quiet and peaceful inside ; becomes infinitely large ; floats through an idealized spirit world ; and finds existential oneness with the universe .
This state is often referred to in psycho-mystical terms as ego - death , the no-mind state , or transcendence .
While in this state the subject is perfectly fine and appears to be meditating or in a light trance .
The subjective experience of this state is similar in many ways to classic descriptions of out - of - body ( OBEs ) or near - death experiences ( NDEs ) .
The subjective hallucinogenic and mystical effects of cortical decoupling are best demonstrated in emergent ketamine - induced states , where the visual cortex decouples from external reality and a boundless , formless dream - space appears to open .
The mystical effects of cortical decoupling are described in similar terms by stroke victims , epileptics , meditation gurus , drug users , and people who use other technology such as transcranial - magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) to interrupt phase - coupled cross -lobe activity .
At high doses 5 - HT 2A agonists can create similar decoupling results , yet not as quickly or drastically as the anesthetic ketamine .
With orally - ingested psychedelics the journey through excitation to network destabilization to feedback overload to complete decoupling is a long and arduous journey taking many hours to reach full effect .
In contrast , smoked or IV DMT administration can compress this process into about five minutes , with another ten or so minutes for the drug to metabolize and the process to entirely reverse itself .
This rapid shifting through multi-phase brain states in such a short period of time is perhaps why DMT is considered so dramatic .
Brainwave coherence and multi-phasic hallucinatory states
Generally there are two different types of high - dose psychedelic experience ; the closed - eye peak and the open - eyed peak .
The closed - eye peak is very similar to a trance or lucid dream state in which the subject reclines , relaxes , and experiences fluid , highly - detailed dream - like visions while still retaining some small sense of self and the waking mind .
The open - eyed peaking state is very similar to manic psychosis in which the subject loses touch with reality ; sees and hears fully - formed waking hallucinations ; becomes disoriented , manic , and paranoid ; and generally behaves irrationally and with exuberance .
In most clinical studies these open - and closed - eye states are considered to be the same ; they are both " hallucinatory " psychotic states .
However , there is a large difference between these states both practically and experientially , and this may lead to some confusion when attempting to analyze the " hallucinatory " brain state as if it were a single state .
In a paper on hallucinogen persisting perception disorder ( HPPD ) , Henry Abraham describes the differing states of regional brainwave coherence in open - and closed - eye states thusly :
" In the eyes - open state in HPPD subjects , widespread reduction of coherence was noted .
However , upon eye closure , the occipital region demonstrated augmented regional coherence over many frequencies but with reduced coherence of the occipital region to more distant regions ...
We speculate from coherence and known clinical and psychophysical data that , in HPPD , there is widespread cortical inhibition in the eyes - opened state , but localized and isolated occipital disinhibition upon eye closure , a state known to facilitate hallucinatory experiences .
An analogy is drawn to findings in the interictal and ictal epileptic focus .
In HPPD , we speculate that occipital EEG hypersynchrony resulting from increased regional coherence , when coupled with relative isolation of visual cortex , especially upon eye closure , facilitates hallucinations and illusions . " [ 16 ]
In other words , the closed - eye hallucinatory state is one of isolated occipital disinhibition where the visual cortex is allowed to " run free " with an uninhibited visual stream of consciousness , demonstrated by high - power regional coherence .
Conversely the open eye state inhibits this regional coherence and attempts to lock visual cohesion with other areas of the brain , allowing for more controlled focus of external sensory detail .
Generally speaking , loss of overall coherence in both of these states would lead to loss in the ability to hold proper multi-modal focus , causing low - level detail drifting and other similar perceptual ambiguities .
Because wiring up a subject with electrodes takes some amount of time , and because lying down and closing the eyes requires little or no physical activity ( which can disrupt EEG scans ) , most EEG studies of subjects under the influence of psychedelics have focused on this closed - eye hallucinatory state .
And much like a lucid dreaming trance state , we would expect the brainwave activity of the subject in the closed - eye hallucinogen peak to actually drop in power across all bands , which it appears to do in some studies . [ 17 ]
However , other studies show that alpha and theta brainwave activity actually increases localized in the visual cortex [ 18 ] , that blood - flow and neural firing rates increase in the prefrontal cortex and limbic complex [ 19 ] , and that brainwave coherence between occipital and other regions of the brain may actually spike up into the gamma range [ 14 ] .
All of these contrasting reports point to conclusion that the closed - eye hallucinatory state can be a meditative low - activity state , an engaged high - activity state , an emotionally salient state , and emotionally removed state , or a hyper - coherent state of multi-modal synesthesia .
The fact that a single drug or drug type can produce such contrasting but dramatic results in brain activity across multiple brain areas suggests a multi-action , multi-state model for psychedelic action consistent with the process of circuit excitation , network destabilization , cross- lobe decoupling , and subsequent re-coherence of brain activity based on the subject ’s unique behavioral state .
Runaway Feedback Excitation and Multi-Stable Phase States
In a multi-state model of psychedelic action based on lateral disinhibition and runaway feedback excitation , at high doses one would expect neural activity to feedback upon itself and naturally accelerate into higher and higher levels until the network tops out at peak performance , washes entirely white with glutamic overload , and subsequently decouples and down - regulates at a lower energy state .
This feedback overload state is consistent with subject reports of peak psychedelic experiences in which the subject “ whites out ” into a state of sensory overload .
While feedback overload may be inevitable and unstoppable in most high - dose trips , on smaller psychedelic doses the brain shows the unique ability to “ hold ” or “ lock ” high - energy phase states for extended periods of time before topping - out or down - regulating to levels approaching baseline .
To demonstrate how this process of high - activity neural synchronization might occur , I borrow the research from Erik D. Lumer , and will reprint some comments from his 1997 paper on neural synchrony in cortical loops :
" We showed that interareal corticocortical loops and corticothalamic loops are responsible for coordinating fast activities over widespread territories ( Lumer et al. , 1997 ) .
Interrupting activity along those loops dramatically reduced the amount of synchrony observed between cortical areas or between the cortex and the thalamus .
In the present work , by parametrically increasing the degree of activation of these loops , we saw that a critical amount of activity had to be reached in order to produce synchronous firing among neurons along these loops .
The sudden increase in the degree of synchrony and of the effectiveness of synchrony when the stimulus intensity reaches a certain level is associated with a sudden increase of the variance of neural activity .
This abrupt , nonlinear effect is characteristic of a non-equilibrium phase transition . " [ 5 ]
In other words , increased sustained excitation in any set of neurons along neural feedback loops will eventually reach a tipping point beyond destabilization which causes the neurons within the circuit to re-synchronize with the excitatory pulse - driver .
Thus , if low dose hallucinogenic states can be described in terms of excitation and destabilization of coupled feedback oscillators along cortical loops , a high - dose or peak psychedelic state may be described in terms of a phase - transition from a low - energy waking state to a high energy waking / dreaming state , a state which can be measured in terms of both raw neural spiking and overall brainwave activation and regional coherence .
If such an accelerated psychedelic brain - state existed , one would expect to see sharp areas of occipital gamma coherence when viewing EEG output of people having intense visualizations .
To demonstrate that this is an experimentally valid statement , I will offer the findings of DE Stuckey on his 2005 paper on the South American hallucinogen ayahuasca and EEG coherence in highly hallucinatory states :
" The most important findings were increases in global EEG coherence in the 36 - 44 Hz and 50 - 64 Hz frequency bands for both subjects .
Widely distributed cortical hyper - coherence seems reasonable given the intense synesthesia during ayahuasca experiences .
Other findings include increased modal EEG alpha frequency and global power decreases across the cortex in most frequency bands ...
We believe that finding increases in global gamma coherence during peak psychedelic experiences might contribute to the discussion of binding theory .
Also , in light of recent research with gamma coherence during advanced meditative conditions , our findings might further the comparison of shamanic psychedelic practices with meditation . " [ 14 ]
While this study demonstrates my point precisely , the science in this area is hardly conclusive .
Depending of the type of EEG analysis performed , brainwave results from differing studies can have ambiguous results , like the following ayahuasca EEG study from Erik Hoffmann :
“ Following three doses of the tea , the subjects showed strong and statistically significant increases of both EEG alpha ( 8 - 13 Hz ) and theta ( 4 - 8 Hz ) mean amplitudes compared to baseline while beta ( 13 - 20 Hz ) amplitudes were unchanged .
The strongest increases of alpha activity were observed in the occipital lobes while alpha was unchanged in the frontal lobes .
Theta amplitudes , on the other hand , were significantly increased in both occipital and frontal areas .
Our data do not support previous findings of cortical activation with decreased alpha and increased beta activity caused by psychedelics ” [ 18 ]
While these conflicting EEG studies can be confounding , all of these findings demonstrate that 5 - HT 2A hallucinogens operate as phase - state drivers which can excite , disrupt , and resynchronize the intensity and global coherence of activity in the visual cortex .
Slow wave theta binding increases in some cases , fast wave gamma binding increases in other cases .
All cases tend to emphasize the increase or decrease in cohesion and synchrony between the frontal and visual cortex , demonstrating the strength of the bond between visual information , self awareness , and our subsequent perception and beliefs about reality .
EEG Coherence , Phase - State Drivers , and Optimized Circuit Synchrony in Cortical Loops
So far in this discussion we have described the psychedelic state as a series of sliding transitions between excited , destabilized , decoupled , and hyper - stabilized states .
With so much going on in one pharmacological interaction it is easy to see why there are so many differing reactions to psychedelics ; some glowing and some horrific .
While the common wisdom in psychedelic circles is that “ dose , set , and setting ” create the difference between good trips and bad trips , I would like to offer a more subtle interpretation to this notion .
Dose is obviously important for selecting how far along the extreme of psychedelic consciousness you wish to go , but set and setting are only important to the extent that they facilitate the smooth transitions between the various multi-phasic brain states found within the trip .
What I am offering here is a model for measuring positive vs. negative psychedelic experiences based not on trip content but on the ease with which the subject can transition through excitation , destabilization , and decoupling to get to the all - important peak , or some similar hyper - coherent mind state associated with gnosis and mystical enlightenment , depending on what the subject seeks .
The set , setting , and ritual of shamanic practice is thus primarily to help subjects and groups seamlessly navigate these transitory states , making sure internal brain rhythms destabilize gracefully , decouple , and re-cohere at optimized phase states for extended periods of time .
This is typically done through ritual rhythmic activities such as drumming , clapping , chanting , music , and dance , all of which act as feedback pulse drivers for the hyper - coherent state .
Without the environmental stimulus of rhythmic pulse drivers , or in the presence of conflicting pulse drivers , the subject is likely to become disoriented , panic , recede , get stuck in a loop , remain disoriented and panicked , and never properly re-cohere at an optimized phase - state .
This is a perfect subjective description of a psychedelic “ bummer ” .
While much of this talk of phase state coherence is speculative and based on a handful of EEG studies , it should be noted that the plasticity of the psychedelic experience is a widely reported phenomenon .
A psychedelic experience can morph from a low activity state to a high activity state based solely on environmental factors , and rhythmic drivers like music , chanting , or the repetition of small thoughts or “ mantras ” can kick the brain ’s internal focus and imaging powers into overdrive .
It should also be noted that most psychedelic hallucinations , open - and closed - eye , are accompanied by a kind of rapid rhythmic flickering or pulsation .
The speed of this pulse – or “ frame update ” – directly corresponds to the intensity of hallucination seen , turning a slowly spinning spider web at low energy states into a rapidly swirling 3 - D landscape at high energy states .
Generally , the speed of the hallucinatory frame - rate corresponds directly to the primary rhythmic pulse driver , making fast - tempo trance music the preferred modern driver for achieving high - intensity visual hallucinations .
Conversely , ambient music with no drums is the preferred soundtrack for producing dream - like visions that rise and morph slowly like smoke on the breeze .
In both cases it is the music that drives visual synesthesia and eases the transition between excitation , decoupling , and subsequent re-synchronization .
HPPD , Chronic Disinhibition , and Maladaptive Neural Plasticity in Hebbian Complexes
While the multi-state model presented in this paper is merely speculation based on the best available data , it is plausible enough to consider what the short - and long - term adverse effects of this pharmacological action might be in subjects exposed to repeated high doses of psychedelic tryptamines .
Besides the “ bummer ” , which we have already discussed , the initial assumption would be that if the subject eventually “ winds - down ” from the hyper - coherent state into a more normalized baseline state , that the effects of the drug should be 100 % reversible .
However , we know this is not always the case .
The most documented long - term side - effect of psychedelic use is hallucinogen persisting perception disorder ( HPPD ) , sometimes called post - hallucinogen perceptual disorder ( PHPD ) , which is the persistence of low - level hallucinations described as closed eye geometric patterns and the “ wiggling ” or “ drifting ” of line and depth detail long after the drug has been metabolized , sometimes lasting weeks to months after a single psychedelic session .
Another more mythical and less documented side - effect of psychedelic use is the “ flashback ” , or a spontaneous short - duration daydream of hallucinatory content while otherwise sober ; like mini-psychedelic episode lasting no more than a few seconds , similar to déjà - vu .
Lesser studied adverse side - effects of frequent psychedelic use include the adoption of eccentricities in belief and behavior , occasionally to radical extremes .
And in very rare cases psychedelics are the mitigating factor in pushing psychotic personalities over the edge , causing breaks from reality and persistent delusional and / or megalomaniacal ideation .
The conditions in the paragraph above are all well - known and documented adverse side - effects of psychedelic use , but until now there has been no underlying model of pharmacological action that attempts to account for the range of all these various abnormalities , beyond the ambiguous concession that psychedelics can sometimes “ mess things up ” in your head somehow .
Yet I assert that that multi-state model of psychedelic action can shed light on all of these disorders , and can in turn lead to logical pathways for treatment and early intervention .
5 - HT Mediated GABA inhibition and HPPD
In the case of HPPD it seems clear that persistent localized disinhibition in visual circuits is the logical culprit ; technically described as the loss of the ability to hold sharp contrast intensity in the visual field .
This is the very definition of destabilization ; lateral inhibition has been overridden to the point of creating infinite perceptual ambiguity .
While the science in this area remains unresolved , a likely target for this interaction would be in persistent recurrent feedback offsetting GABA B inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ( IPSPs ) at the lateral - inhibitory synapse .
From a paper on the subject by Zhengwei Shao and Andreas Burkhalter :
“ Feedback stimuli of a wide range of intensities increased the rate of ongoing neuronal firing .
Thus , when forward and feedback inputs are simultaneously active , feedback inputs may provide late polysynaptic excitation that can offset slow IPSPs evoked by forward inputs and in turn may promote recurrent excitation through local intracolumnar circuits .
This may provide a mechanism by which feedback inputs from higher cortical areas can amplify afferent signals in lower areas . ”
What is being suggested here is that rhythmic top - down feedback can override localized tonic inhibition and amplify recurrent feedback of sensory signal .
Not only does this top - down model of recurrent excitation overriding localized tonic inhibition fit with the multi-state model presented here , it also provides a pharmacological basis for describing the perceptual symptoms of HPPD .
If the localized IPSPs in the central columnar layers can be offset by simultaneous polysynaptic excitation from both forward and feedback inputs , any drug which strengthens the pulse coupling between forward - feedback polysynaptic recurrent pathways could override the capacity for slow GABA B IPSPs to inhibit the recurrent impulse .
The persistence of this effect after intoxication wears off may be due to purely neurotoxic means – such as the corruption of 5 - HT mediated inhibitory interneurons by cellular damage or stress - induced down - regulation at 5 - HT 2A uptake sites – or in chronic HPPD cases it may be the result of psychedelic - induced neuroplasticity reinforcing late polysynaptic excitation of intracolumnar circuits .
Pulse - Driven Phase Coupling and Flashbacks
While the psychedelic flashback itself is an elusive beast , we know enough about it to make some assumptions based on the multi-state model presented here .
Like déjà vu , the flashback is the instinctual subconscious recognition of a pattern or form which evokes hallucination or the hyper - coherent state of psychedelic consciousness .
Assuming that various states of consciousness can be construed in terms of the pulse - driven couplings of various brain areas , it can be said that psychedelics “ introduce ” the brain to novel patterns of pulse - driven couplings , creating wholly novel and unique brain states .
Once familiar with these new “ psychedelic ” brain patterns anything that evokes these patterns is instantly recognized as “ psychedelic ” , thus creating a memory or flashback of that unique archetypal state .
The hyper - coherent phase - state created by psychedelics does not happen spontaneously in human consciousness ( though the argument could be made in the case of sleep deprivation and extreme manic - psychosis ) , but the memory of that induced state may be enough to invoke a slight shift in waking phase state close enough to recall some small echo of the experience .
Persistent Psychedelic - Induced Delusional Psychosis
There ’s no doubt that the worst - case - scenario of a psychedelic experiment is that the subject never comes back the same , and is somehow irreparably changed or damaged by the process .
While it is widely recognized that this is a very real possibility , no good explanation for this phenomena is ever offered other than “ pre-existing psychotic tendencies ” .
While this explanation may be accurate it tends to pin the blame on the victim and never attempts to describe the mechanics underlying the catalyst for such a dramatic change .
It is sadly lacking as workable theories go .
Within the multi-state model of psychedelic action presented here it seems obvious that there are multiple pathways through which an individual may induce a kind of permanent psychosis or delusional belief system that persists long after the drug is metabolized .
The first and most obvious conclusion is that the subject ’s pre-existing psyche was simply fragile , and the psychic trauma of the psychedelic experience blew a gasket in the network somewhere .
While this is convenient it does n’t answer the hard questions of what differentiates a robust psyche from a fragile psyche , and what actually “ breaks ” during the process of psychedelic activation .
It could be argued that persistent overloading , decoupling , and “ re- booting ” of the entire cortex puts a strain on the network that , over time , degrades the brain ’s ability to retain global cohesion in a normal waking state .
This could be defined as a kind of network burnout resulting in scattered and un-focused personality disorders .
If network burnout were the culprit , one would expect the results to be reversible through sustained abstinence , but since there are few studies in this area these speculations remain unresolved .
But there is another more complex piece to this puzzle that cannot be entirely overlooked , and that is the notion that persistent psychedelic delusion is not due to network burnout or damage due to neurotoxicity , but is instead due to runaway synaptic growth along eccentric logic and memory pathways , similar to what would be seen in cult deprogramming and brainwashing subjects .
While the premise of psychedelic neural damage is politically convenient for the anti-drug lobby , the argument for maladaptive psychedelic neural growth is a much trickier issue from every angle .
The sinister use of psychedelics in brainwashing and cult deprogramming has been understood for many decades now , but nowhere is it asserted that psychedelics can promote plasticity and new synaptic growth along logic and memory pathways .
The efficacy of psychedelics as brainwashing , mind control , or cult - induction tools may come precisely from their unique ability to decouple the cortex and retune it with novel pathways .
In psychedelic therapy the process of undoing maladaptive pathways is called “ catharsis ” ; the process of wiring novel pathways out of the psychedelic experience is called “ integration ” .
In psychedelic literature the process of doing this to the self is called “ metaprogramming ” .
In each of these instances psychedelics are used to remove previous associations and re-train new beliefs and behaviors .
If we are to take for granted that psychedelics facilitate this process of synaptic plasticity , then it must be presumed that this very process can be used to imprint and reinforce positive as well as delusional and maladaptive belief systems over time .
In the case of maladaptive psychedelic programming , one would expect to see the subject crafting self - referential occult belief systems based on ambiguous or archetypal symbols over a period of many months , weeks , or years .
These occult belief systems would become more complex over time , relying on a hyper - articulated network of connections between language and symbol systems , thus creating eccentric logic pathways that grow so tangentially elaborate they eventually eclipse common rationality .
A person suffering from this syndrome may also exhibit messianic or megalomaniacal tendencies , such as the belief that their occult system was derived from divine origin , along with the urgent need to spread a paradoxical prophecy of doom and transcendence .
This syndrome is not symptomatic of neural damage or breakage , it is symptomatic of wholly unique logic pathways forged through obsessive self - referential feedback ideation , facilitated and reinforced through repeated high - dose application of selective 5 - HT 2A agonists .
In Conclusion
Psychedelics represent many things to many people .
They are both the worst demon of the anti-drug movement and the highest - angel of the pro-drug movement .
This is not without cause .
If we are to take the multi-state model seriously and view psychedelics as gateways to open - ended mind - states based solely on dose - range and environmental rhythmic modulators then it is implicit that these chemicals are utilitarian in achieving recreational , mystical , and plasticity - induced neural programming results in almost all human subjects .
The fact that these molecules occur in nature is a testament to the fundamental chemical similarities of all organic neural logic pathways as well as the open - ended mechanical capacities of neural networks and thus our own imaginations .
By embracing the multi-state model of psychedelic action we must recognize as a species that these chemicals are essential to the growth and evolution of our neural hardware , but can paradoxically induce psychosis and reinforce delusional belief systems when used imprudently or to excess .

The following call was issued by the Conference of the Democratic Left , a left unity project in South Africa .
It first appeared at the Conference of the Democratic Left web site .
* * *
A call to a national people ’s conference against capitalism and for democratic left politics
A Call for united anti-capitalist action …
This is a call to come together in unity in a Conference Against Capitalism and for Democratic Left Politics .
1 . The world is in crisis
Global capitalism threatens our world with disaster .
If it is left to plunder the natural resources of our planet and pollute the atmosphere , the oceans and the soil , life itself will be under grave threat .
The current global economic crisis represents the exhaustion of a system that is driven by profit and competition .
The basic tenet of capitalism is to grow endlessly with no regard to natural limits , to concentrate wealth in the hands of a few .
It explains why wherever we look we see the crisis and decay of the system : be it financial , energy , food , environment , cultural and social .
War , global warming and health pandemics threaten the annihilation of humanity within a couple of generations .
This is equally true for South Africa .
In spite of the break with apartheid and the establishment of political democracy , the situation for the working people and the poor gets worse .
This is because the same crisis - ridden model of development is imposed .
The high levels of corruption accompanying the transition from apartheid must be seen not just as greed but an outcome of the failure to redistribute wealth .
Government tenders and patronage are the vehicles for accumulation by a minority in the face of the extreme monopolisation of the economy .
Polokwane [ the African National Congress national conference that replaced President Thabo Mbeki with Jacob Zuma ] does not signal a break with a system that has seen a rise in social inequality , social decay and a resurgent social conservatism in the form of ethnic politics , xenophobia , attacks on women and reproductive rights , homophobia , religious fundamentalism , etc .
Internationally :
60 million workers are likely to lose their jobs this year
50 million more people in the ‘ Third World ’ are likely to be plunged into poverty
In South Africa :
More than 500,000 jobs have been lost since the start of the recession in October 2008 ;
We have become the most unequal society in the world ;
We exceed the world in violence against women and children ;
Despite building of houses , more than 2 million families lack decent housing , the same number as in 1994 ;
We have one of the highest HIV / AIDS infection rates in the world .
The promise of a better life for all has not been realised .
As long as the ANC government refuses to confront capital and redistribute wealth , poor communities will continue to be down - trodden .
The rise of a new global left in the context of the World Social Forum , the emergence of left parties ( socialist , green ) in Latin America and Europe and new anti-capitalist social movements challenge our dogmas .
Another South Africa and another world , free of violence and exploitation , is possible .
We have to overcome our disillusionment in the politicians and policy makers .
The future rests in the hands of the working class , the dispossessed , the unemployed , the youth , women and rural people as well as radical intellectuals .
But only if we wrestle for power and the right to shape a new agenda rooted in the power of a gigantic movement resting on independent autonomous mass organisations of working people .
We must struggle to give meaning to the slogan “ we are our own liberators ” .
2. Build a platform of struggle and politics of the people !
In a number of forums where the acute problems confronting our people are being discussed the idea that we must draw together left and progressive forces into a united front to confront the ravages of global capitalism is growing .
In this task of shaping a new agenda that can make a radical break with disaster capitalism 60 activists from trade unions , social movements and a wide range of radical political organisations and currents came together in October 2008 to begin this process .
It was agreed to work towards developing a new programmatic platform of action on an anti-capitalist basis for democratic left politics
The intention is to create a platform that can :
Build a political consensus on the challenges posed by the current international and national situation ;
Take forward national and international struggles ;
Work towards developing a grassroots democratic eco-socialist , feminist , political program ;
Develop strategies for overcoming race , gender , age , sexual orientation and other divisions within South African society and particularly amongst the working class ;
As a means of uniting and strengthening the ability of the working class and progressive social forces to struggle around the issues affecting them .
We must struggle to rekindle the mass movement of the 1980s which brought apartheid to an end .
We recognise that the conscious forces of transformation are still weak , but believe that such actions can eventually unite class struggle forces in all working - class movements not least from the Congress of South African Trade Unions ( COSATU ) and the South African Communist Party ( SACP ) .
The Conference of the Democratic Left is not an event and neither is it about merely sharing intellectual ideas .
What is envisaged is :
A process of bottom up deliberation , debate in which voices from below shape outcomes and collective action .
The organising of the Conference of the Democratic Left is about creating local forums , provincial forums and a national platform .
The Conference of the Democratic Left is merely one moment in an exciting , vibrant and self - organised process .
This is a conscious political initiative informed by a recognition that we all fought for the liberation of South Africa .
The Conference of the Democratic Left is an affirmation of democratic pluralism and is a process which seeks to elaborate political objectives , practices , alternatives and new ways of engaging in left politics .
It aims to create a united front around a programme of action while preserving the autonomy of constituent organisations .
We engage in this process humbly and with modesty , conscious that we do not have all the answers to the complex challenges facing humanity .
4. National and provincial convening committees
The Conference of the Democratic Left will be convened from March 20 – 22 , 2010 .
An interim national convening committee has been established , and provincial convening committees are in the process of being established .
These are facilitation structures which will further evolve through adding members in the context of the process .
CALL TO PARTICIPATE
You are invited to participate in the forums and platforms of this initiative convened by the coordinating structures .
Convening Committee members will be coming to you , in communities , in factories and farms – in social movements , unions , religious organisations and community groups as we go forward to the National Conference of the Democratic Left to hear your voices and to be influenced by you .
The National Conference of the Democratic Left aims to become a vehicle for the self - organisation of the excluded , the exploited , the discriminated and poverty - stricken majority in South Africa ( including all progressive strata ) with the power to radically transform South Africa along eco-socialist and participatory democratic lines .
Begin at the bottom left
By Mazibuko K. Jara
March 12 , 2010 --
For someone like me , nearly a year of a Jacob Zuma presidency would be an easy , triumphant moment to ask the South African Communist Party ( SACP ) and Cosatu whether the Zuma path to power was worth it .
But this would amount to cheap politicking and lead nowhere .
But there is an important lesson : change cannot ever be the outcome of the big man .
Fundamentally it is a product of the way in which power is configured in a society .
The Zuma path was not about the reconfiguration of capitalist power or a break with ex-president Thabo Mbeki 's neoliberal and technicist approach .
In pursuing the Zuma path both the SACP and Cosatu had a blind spot : they ignored a basic issue concerning the conditions under which political elites in capitalist societies have been forced to advance developmental programmes .
The removal of Mbeki has not changed the framing pre-1994 property relations .
Change in personnel at the top is useless in dealing with class power that is rooted in the monopoly ownership of the economy , the power of financial capital , the exploitation of cheap black labour and a permissive state .
As Adam Habib put it to Amandla : " Individuals , wherever they are , simply reflect the institutional constraints of the balance of power within … society " .
Indeed , the removal of Mbeki could have opened up a space to create the political conditions conducive to thoroughgoing change if a mass movement built around basic demands and transformative policies had accompanied it .
Even going forward , the SACP - Cosatu focus remains on " keeping our man " in the job .
Still absent in their strategy is a willingness to consider a political project outside the ANC .
The past 11 or so months of a Zuma presidency have shown us a government that is not about to challenge the inordinate power of capital .
This can be seen on so many fronts : a commitment to two - tier labour - market policies ; a lack of responsiveness to the needs of local communities ; a foreign policy aligned to global corporate interests , such as at the Copenhagen climate change negotiations ; and in the countryside entrenching the power of undemocratic tribal authorities at the expense of the rights of modern citizenship and , particularly , the rights of women .
Within a neoliberal framework , the global crisis has also cut Zuma 's space to manoeuvre .
But that cannot be an excuse as Mbeki faced similar pressures , and the discrediting of neoliberalism offers space for alternative policies .
This past year has also shown us a besieged , unstrategic and unstable ANC - SACP - Cosatu alliance leadership .
Even in subjective terms , the negative psychology of such an encircled political leadership reinforces its lack of political will and incapacity to build popular power , undo the neoliberal economic policies of the Mbeki era and energetically drive a genuinely transformative agenda .
Meanwhile , capital has not rested -- it has continued to act on and through the state to block any post -Polokwane transformational momentum that may have been flickering .
As part of its strategy , capital can actually afford to have an SACP and Cosatu blowing hot and cold -- in reality they are co-opted into what remains a neoliberal government .
To illustrate this : the potentially transformative National Health Insurance proposal is now tilted towards becoming an accumulation site that could address the profit crisis facing private hospitals and medical aid schemes instead of delivering a universal , decommodified and quality public health system .
Another glaring example concerns the continued power of the coal industry to determine our energy policy .
Such a subversion is possible largely because , at critical times in the post - Polokwane period , key moments and platforms in which to mobilise and harness the voices , interests and power of the popular forces were lost .
In addition the space has increased for the political elite to ride shamelessly on mass support to open the doors of wealth accumulation wider -- as can be seen in the defence of ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema as a deserving black businessman .
The Zuma path represents a serious strategic shortcoming on the part of both the SACP and Cosatu .
Objectively , the trajectory of the Zuma path has fashioned the political role of the ANC to be about managing a more legitimate capitalist society and state , while keeping the SACP and Cosatu onside .
A populist ANC in rhetoric and yet conservative in its economic policies is consistent with this objective .
This is an ANC that will rant and rave rather than unlock a radical programme of redistribution .
This critique is not to deny the ANC - led alliance 's potential still to advance its social delivery programme , which would improve the dire conditions of the people .
Although such a legitimate programme is important and should be supported , it would still fall far short of the very necessary anti-systemic transformation of the social , economic and political foundations of this society .
Outside the ANC - led alliance , the post -Polokwane scenario has also underlined the broader weakness of the left and the mass movement .
Mass protests largely amount to winning piecemeal concessions from the state rather than creating political conditions conducive to thoroughgoing change .
There is still no other left - wing political pole that could contribute to the building of a mass movement that would challenge crisis - ridden capitalism and struggle for a feasible , socialist alternative .
In the face of all this , it is not left - wing infantility to underline the need for a serious class project that would begin at the bottom and be a vehicle to meet immediate demands and build a mass movement for transformative policies .
No matter what the balance of forces is inside the ANC - led alliance , without such a project there will be no social force with the weight and voice to block compromises with capital and secure radical changes in favour of the working class .
As any trade unionist knows : " What you have not won on the battle­field , you are unlikely to win at the negotiating table . "
If anything , this is the language that the SACP and Cosatu should have no difficulty recalling and heeding .
The future demands a course of struggle that goes beyond the limitations of the Zuma path .
[ Mazibuko K. Jara was recently expelled from the SACP and is part of the conveners of the Conference of the Democratic Left .

J’ai assisté aujourd ’hui à une excellente présentation sur le thème « TIC et handicaps » par un groupe d’élèves de première année de Télécom ParisTech [ 1 ] .
Lors de l’exposé est apparu un point qui a particulièrement retenu mon attention : alors que le site public de Télécom ParisTech a été conçu avec comme objectif l’accessibilité aux déficients visuels , l ’intranet de l’École , pour sa part , méconnait totalement cette problématique .
Par exemple , l’emploi du temps des élèves ( ainsi que celui du personnel enseignant ) n’est disponible qu’à travers une page WWW dans laquelle toute information sémantique est absente .
Les tableaux qui s’y trouvent servent autant à la mise en forme qu’à la mise à disposition des données elles - mêmes .
Cette situation serait beaucoup moins problématique si les données étaient accessibles sous forme structurée , apte à être intégrées dans un mashup adapté aux différents handicaps .
Si , par exemple , l ’interface de Twitter ne convient pas à certaines personnes , il est facile d’en extraire les données pour rendre cette interface plus conviviale comme le fait Hootsuite ou pour l’intégrer dans un système de lecture automatique .
Pour cela , Twitter fournit , après authentification , les données brutes sous forme exploitable , permettant ainsi de créer de la valeur ajoutée tout en utilisant leur service .
Chacun est libre de transformer et de présenter l’information sous la forme qui lui convient , sans avoir besoin de déconstruire du code HTML pour en extraire l’information qui y a été noyée de manière plus ou moins élégante .
En tant qu’enseignant , le calendrier comprenant l’ensemble de mes cours , géré et tenu à jour par l’inspection des études , m’est totalement inaccessible de manière programmatique .
Je peux certes demander une version iCal au coup par coup , mais celle - ci ne sera pas intégrable dans le logiciel de mon choix , car les changements faits dans mon calendrier professionnel n’y seront pas synchronisés .
Pour la même raison , mes collègues non-voyants ne peuvent pas intégrer ces informations dans un logiciel équipé d’une interface vocale , les données risquant de devenir obsolètes sans qu’ils en soient avertis .
Autant je peux comprendre que la refonte totale d’une interface pour la rendre accessible aux différents handicaps soit une opération financièrement lourde et difficile à mettre en œuvre dans un délai court , autant la mise à disposition des données brutes sous la forme de pages XML disponibles après authentification permettrait aux personnes intéressées de développer de leur côté , sans aucune interaction avec l’équipe en charge de l’intranet de l’École , leur propre interface de visualisation des données et cela au moindre coût .
La génération de ces pages XML qui n’intégreraient aucun élément de mise en page est une opération simple qui pourrait être mise en place dans un délai très court et permettrait immédiatement la réalisation de ces mashups .
Les élèves pourraient alors synchroniser leur emploi du temps avec Google Calendar , pourraient dans le cadre de projets scolaires développer de nouveaux modes d’accès à l’information compatibles avec les contraintes liées au handicap , les enseignants pourraient importer leur emploi du temps dans des services d’aide à la détermination de dates de réunions tels que Doodle ou Tungle sans avoir à ressaisir ces informations avec les risques d’erreurs afférents , ou sans avoir à les exporter à une date donnée avec la possibilité que l’information ne soit pas à jour .
Je sais que certains élèves , habitués aux sites WWW collaboratifs et aux réseaux sociaux , réclament un tel accès .
Je pense que c’est un processus indispensable pour que l’information ne soit plus enfermée , sous une forme inexploitable aux personnes atteintes de certains handicaps , derrière un site qui insiste pour présenter les données d’une manière unique et intangible .
J’espère qu’on arrivera à faire bouger les choses .

Top Three Reasons to Upgrade to .NET 4.0 Today Startup Time for IronPython 2.6.1 for .
NET 4.0 is 30 % Faster
Where exactly is this improvement coming from ?
Well we do n't know quite yet .
Our first bona fide .NET 2.0 SP1 versus .
NET 4.0 IronPython perf suite run occurred less than two weeks ago !
An educated guess is that at least a small portion of this improvement stems from the fact that Microsoft .
Scripting .
Core.dll is actually part of the .NET 4.0 framework .
Any ways , you can see more of the performance characteristics of IronPython running under both these .NET releases
Beautiful is better than Ugly and Simple is Better than Complex
The screenshot above shows a small C# snippet of code utilizing a Python module both as a .
NET 3.5 application ( top ) and as a .NET 4.0 application ( bottom ) .
Both of these snippets have been diffed to highlight differences in red .
It should be blindingly obvious that the bottom snippet is far more readable due to the use of C# 4.0 ’s new dynamic type .
What the hell ’s an “ IDynamicMetaObjectProvider ” supposed to be any ways ?
In any event , our DLR and IronPython hosting APIs are adhering more to the
Python and Ruby Play Nice Together
In the Command Prompt session above , I ’ve created a trivial Ruby class , RubyPC , which provides a factorial method , fact , in rbfactorial.rb .
From there , I started an IronPython interactive session and directly called into the rbfactorial Ruby script via our clr builtin Python module .
Let ’s see you do that from other implementations of Python : -)
IronPython 2.6.1 for .
NET 4.0 and IronRuby 1.0v4 are the first two major releases of these dynamic languages that share the same Dynamic Language Runtime pedigree .
The end result of this is that they interop together quite nicely out of the box with one small caveat : you just need to copy “ IronPython - 2.6.1-Src\IronPython-2.6.1\Co nfig\Signed \App.config ” from the source or binary zip file releases to “ %ProgramFiles % \IronPython 2.6 for .NET 4.0\ipy.exe.config ” and / or “ %ProgramFiles % \IronPython 2.6 for .NET 4.0\ipy64.exe.config ” .
This configuration file tells IronPython which version of IronRuby it needs to load , and we simply forgot to include this file in the IronPython MSI installer .
NOTES Remember to uninstall any IronPython .NET 4.0 CTPs before uninstalling .NET 4.0 Betas / Alphas/etc

Creating right click with the help of jquery is real easy and can be implemented very quickly .
While trying for my one of the project , I made one and sharing it today .
.
Why not to check DEMO before moving on .
.
Step 1 : Creating HTML
Simply copy and paste the html next to the div to be right clicked .
In this example we have ( id=” rightclickarea ” )
< div id =" rightclickarea " >
Right click inside bordered container </ div > < div class = " vmenu " > < div class= " first_li " >< span>
Open</span></div> < div class= " first_li " >< span >
Open in new tab</ span></div> < div class= " sep_li " ></div > < div class= " first_li " >< span > Quick Preview </ span > < div class= " inner_li " > < span>Dossier </ span > < span> Channel 1</span > < span> Channel 2</span > </div> </div > < div class= " first_li " >< span > Preview </ span > < div class= " inner_li " > < span>Channel 1</span > < span> Channel 2 </span > </div> </div > < div class= " first_li " >< span >
Edit</span></div> < div class= " first_li " >< span >
Event Log</ span></div > < div class= " sep_li " ></div > < div class= " first_li " >< span>New</span></div> < div class= " first_li " >< span> Assignments</span > < div class= " inner_li " > < span> Assignement 1</ span > < span> Assignement 2</span > </div> </div > < div class= " first_li " >< span>
Assets</span > < div class= " inner_li " > < span> Asset 1</ span > < span> Asset 2</span > < span>
All Assets</ span > </div> </div > < div class= " first_li " >< span > Preview</ span></div>
< div class = " sep_li " ></div > < div class= " first_li " >< span > Move to</span> < div class= " inner_li " > < span> Folder name </ span > </div> </div > < div class= " first_li " >< span >
Others</span > < div class= " inner_li " > < span>Mark as Read</ span > < span> Mark as Unread </ span > < span> Trash </ span > < span> Archieve</ span > < span>Commite </ span > < span>Release</ span > </div> </div> </div >
.
Step 2 : Add Style to stylesheet
Now add following css to your stylesheet :
.vmenu { border : 1 px solid #aaa ; position : absolute ; background : # fff ; display : none ; font - size : 0.75em ; } .vmenu . first_li span { width : 100 px ; display : block ; padding : 5 px 10px ; cursor : pointer } .vmenu .inner_li { display : none ; margin - left : 120 px ; position : absolute ; border : 1 px solid #aaa ; border - left : 1 px solid #ccc ; margin - top : - 28 px ; background : # fff ; } .vmenu .sep_li { border - top : 1 px ridge #aaa ; margin : 5 px 0 } .vmenu . fill_title { font - size : 11px ; font - weight : bold ; / height : 15 px ; / overflow : hidden ; word - wrap : break - word ; }
.
Step 3 : Add Jquery script
And finally , add following lines just inside head tag of your HTML :
< script type = " text/ javascript " src = " http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js " ></ script > < script type = " text / javascript " > $ ( document ) . ready ( function ( ) { $ ( & #039 ; #rightclickarea & # 039 ; ) . bind ( & #039 ; contextmenu & # 039 ; , function ( e ) { var $ cmenu = $ ( this ) . next ( ) ; $ ( & # 039 ;< div class = " overlay " ></ div >& # 039 ; ) . css ( { left : & # 039 ; 0 px & #039 ; , top : & #039 ; 0 px & #039 ; , position : & #039 ; absolute & # 039 ; , width : & #039 ; 100 %& #039 ; , height : & #039 ; 100 % & #039 ; , zIndex : & #039 ; 100 & # 039 ; } ) . click ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .
remove ( ) ; $ cmenu . hide ( ) ; } ) . bind ( & #039 ; contextmenu & # 039 ; , function ( ) { return false ; } ) .
appendTo ( document .
body ) ; $ ( this ) . next ( ) . css ( { left : e. pageX , top : e. pageY , zIndex : & # 039 ; 101 & # 039 ; } ) . show ( ) ; return false ; } ) ; $ ( & #039 ; . vmenu .
first_li & # 039 ; ) . live ( & #039 ; click & # 039 ; , function ( ) { if ( $ ( this ) .
children ( ) . size ( ) == 1 ) { alert ( $ ( this ) . children ( ) . text ( ) ) ; $ ( & #039 ; . vmenu & # 039 ; ) . hide ( ) ; $ ( & #039 ; . overlay & # 039 ; ) . hide ( ) ; } } ) ; $ ( & #039 ; . vmenu .
inner_li span & # 039 ; ) . live ( & #039 ; click & # 039 ; , function ( ) { alert ( $ ( this ) . text ( ) ) ; $ ( & #039 ; . vmenu & # 039 ; ) . hide ( ) ; $ ( & #039 ; . overlay & # 039 ; ) . hide ( ) ; } ) ; $ ( " .first_li , .sec_li , .inner_li span " ) . hover ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .
css ( { backgroundColor : & #039 ; # E0EDFE & #039 ; , cursor : & #039 ; pointer & # 039 ; } ) ; if ( $ ( this ) .
children ( ) . size ( ) > 0 ) $ ( this ) . find ( & #039 ; . inner_li & # 039 ; ) . show ( ) ; $ ( this ) . css ( { cursor : & #039 ; default & # 039 ; } ) ; } , function ( ) { $ ( this ) . css ( & #039 ; background - color & # 039 ; , & #039 ; #fff & # 039 ; ) ; $ ( this ) . find ( & #039 ; . inner_li & # 039 ; ) . hide ( ) ; } ) ; } ) ; </ script >
.
Here is DEMO
.
That 's all !
Cheers !!
DETROIT -- Steve Yzerman has left , but the management team that helped build the Detroit Red Wings into perennial Stanley Cup contenders will remain intact for at least several more years .
The Red Wings are close to signing general manager Ken Holland and assistant GM Jim Nill to long - term contract extensions , club senior vice president Jimmy Devellano said Tuesday .
“ You can be rest assured they ’re closing in on long - term extensions , ’’ Devellano said .
“ They ’ll be around a long time .
“ They ’ve done such a good job and we ’ve looked after them . ’’
Holland and Nill both have one year remaining on their current contracts , but the organization was eager to make sure both stick around for a while .
Devellano said the parameters are in place , only some minor details need to be finalized .
“ I love it here , love the organization .
The ownership has been incredible to work for , ’’ Holland said .
“ We ’re in the process of working to a conclusion .
We ’re not there yet , but I do n’t see any reason why it wo n’t happen . ’’
Holland , 54 , has been with the organization for 27 years , the past 13 as GM .
In that time , the Red Wings have won more Stanley Cups ( three ) and regular - season games ( 588 ) than any other NHL franchise .
They also have won four Presidents ’
Trophies ( top overall record ) and nine Central Division titles since Holland took over in July 1997 .
Nill , 52 , has been the assistant GM for 12 seasons .
He oversees the drafting and development of prospects .
Nill ’s extension , just like his current contract , does not contain an escape clause allowing him to pursue a general manager ’s job with another team .

English ivy reaches out
English ivy can climb up almost anything , from the trunks of enormous trees to the smooth walls of houses .
Now scientists have found out exactly how the plant does it .
Rather than simply using a glue - like substance to attach itself to vertical surfaces , ivy uses a complex , energy - efficient system to anchor itself onto house fronts , tree bark and rocks .
Details of the discovery are published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface .
Root cause " Formerly it was believed that English ivy just glues itself with its roots onto substrates and that was the whole story , " says PhD student Bjorn Melzer who undertook the study as a member of the plant biomechanics group at the University of Freiburg , Freiburg , Germany .
This attachment system also works if the plant is dead .
Therefore it makes no sense to cut ivy
Mr Bjorn Melzer
Plant Biomechanics group at the University of Freiburg , Germany
The researchers , from the University of Freiburg and the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology , Germany , used new imaging techniques to analyse the attachment process of English ivy in detail for the first time .
They found the plant uses a more complex system , climbing in multiple phases .
First , the plant makes initial contact with the object it will climb .
This then triggers the second phase , when the plant 's roots change shape to fit the surface of the structure they will climb .
The roots alter their arrangement to increase their area of contact with the wall .
Small structures called root hairs grow out from the root , coming into contact with the climbing surface .
The plant then excretes a glue to anchor it to the substrate .
Finally , the tiny root hairs fit into tiny cavities within the climbing surface .
There , they dry out , scrunching into a spiral - shape that locks the root hair into place .
The ivy 's attachment is further strengthened by hook - like structures that grow on the tips of the root hairs .
Diagram of a fresh root hair and drying root hair in climbing surface cavity .
" Because the hairs are fixed on both ends the shortening process pulls the root a bit further towards the climbing surface and fastens the connection , " Mr Melzer explains .
" This attachment system also works if the plant is dead , " he says .
" Therefore it makes no sense to cut ivy , wait for a while and then pull it off your house front , the plaster will still be ruined . "
PLANT POWERS
Watch plants climbing towards the light Richard Hammond 's Invisible Worlds : Super high speed plants Vine seeds become ' giant gliders '
The team used an environmental scanning electron microscope ( ESEM ) to observe how live root hairs shortened into a spiral as they dried .
" Our study is the first which had a look at the complete form , structure , and functional relationship of the English ivy attachment process , " Mr Melze told the BBC .
" The plant actually uses a quite complex and energy - efficient system to anchor itself . "

There are a few tutorials for this in Photoshop and Illustrator , but I have n’t found any for the GIMP , so I attempted it myself !
It is a fairly simple method and easily done with great results !
1. Starting
Firstly choose your portrait – the less detail in the photograph the better the results !
Open in GIMP
Duplicate Original 4 times
Then Add Alpha Channel to all layers
2. Threshold ( ~ = APPROX . )
On First layer – Go , Colors –>
Threshold
layer – Go , Set to ~ 25 as shown :
as shown : REPEAT for each layer :
for each layer : Second Layer : set to ~50
: set to Third Layer : set to ~ 100
: set to Fourth Layer : set to ~ 130
3 . Blur ( This will make it smoother ) ( ~ = APPROX . )
Now , for all layers again :
again : Go , Filters –> Blur –> Gaussian Blur
Set to ~2.00 , ~2.00 ( any more and they ’ll be large white outlines later )
( any more and they ’ll be large white outlines later ) ( Speed up the process by selecting your layer –> go , Filters –> Repeat ‘ Guassian Blur ’ , Ctrl F )
4. Remove Background
Grab the Selection Tool
Select the parts you do n’t want to include :
Delete them from all layers ( keep selection , then select layer – Press Delete )
)
The most detail will be on the Fourth Layer :
5 . Delete the rest
Grab the Color Selection Tool
Select the white parts of each layer
of each layer Press Delete ( You need to select the white parts for each layer , otherwise you ’ll delete other things )
6. Adding Colour
Select Layer – Right Click –> Alpha to Selection
First layer : Strip Pattern ( download my version here ) ( goes in Pattern Folder of GIMP Folder )
: Strip Pattern ( download my version here ) ( goes in Pattern Folder of GIMP Folder )
For the Strips to fit nicely you may need to scale down the image ( ~350 ) or edit the .pat file !
Apply a little blur if you like !
Select Layer – Right Click –> Alpha to Selection

A NASAL spray made of the hormone vasopressin improves men ’s ability to recognise the emotions of both happy and angry – but not neutral – faces .
Related “ cuddle chemical ” oxytocin improves bonding .
So does vasopressin , but it also drives less cosy aspects of social behaviour , such as aggression .
So Adam Guastella at the University of Sydney in Australia compared the ability of 24 men given the spray to recognise neutral , angry and happy faces with peers given a placebo spray ( Biological Psychiatry , DOI : 10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.03.014 ) .
“ There may be an application in people with inadequate recognition of social cues , ” Guastella says .
British Airways cabin crew voted this week to strike over staffing levels on flights .
Here , one crew member , who asked to remain anonymous , explains the reasons why .
I was so proud to work for British Airways when I joined 13 years ago .
It was an excellent airline .
It is only in the last three years that everything has gone downhill .
I am not proud to work for it any more .
Flights are taking off and landing , and everyone is being fed .
When those doors shut and we are stuck in a metal tube with 300 people , the company knows we will always do whatever it takes to get the job done .
If we do n't , it is only we who suffer .
But staffing levels are down to the bone – on long - haul flights , crew have been cut from 16 to 14 .
We are at the receiving end of more abuse because passengers can't understand why the in - flight service is slower .
We have had a lot more passengers saying , " I do n't know how you do it , " because it is noticeable just how much we are having to do .
I try to avoid working in business class now because one crew member has been cut there so it is now the slowest service .
But the airline needs those business class passengers .
We used to serve up the hot meal and drink in two - and - a - half hours .
Now it is taking three - and - a - half .
It is worse when something goes wrong .
We have numerous problems with our in - flight entertainment system .
When it works , it 's superb .
But it keeps breaking down and takes time to get fixed .
I 'm not happy about striking for 12 days over Christmas .
I hope people realise we are not doing this for the sake of it .
None of us are over the moon about the timing but we have been forced into it .
The union suggested cost - cutting measures and this dispute could have been settled months ago but BA dragged its heels .
It 's not just a case of fighting for one or two crew members who have been taken off flights – we are fighting for all our terms and conditions , our livelihoods .
I do n't have any respect for BA chief executive Willie Walsh whatsoever .
It is said average cabin - crew wages are £ 35,000 but my basic pay is still only £ 14,000 .
On top of that , when I am on duty , I get allowances for breakfast , lunch and supper .
These depend on which country you work in – you do n't get much in India .
About 10 % of my total salary is extra payment for working long hours – 15 or 16 - hour days .
Take 1,000 BA crew together and their average wage would be £ 25 - 28,000 .
I know people who work for Iberia , Lufthansa and KLM and they get paid more and get more days off .
The claim that we are paid twice what Virgin staff receive is not accurate .
They receive food allowances in cash .
When you take these into account , they earn almost as much as we do .
It is very demoralising .
On my last flight , we were all complaining to each other and wondering how we were going to get this or that done in time .
I have had enough .
I am actively looking for another job .

VOTERS have reported being turned away from polling stations in Liverpool .
The disgruntled residents were told to come back later in the Wavertree constituency because officials had run out of ballot papers at polling booths in Dunbabin Road , Childwall and Dovedale Primary School .
It appears Liverpool council had underestimated the turnout for the hotly contested seat .
A fierce pre-election campaign has been waged between Liberal Democrats candidate Colin Eldridge who wants to win the seat from Labour ’s Luciana Berger .
A single criminal operation was responsible for two - thirds of all phishing attacks in the second half of 2009 and is responsible for a two - fold increase in the crime , a report published this week said .
The Avalanche gang is believed to have risen out of the ashes of the Rock Phish outfit , which by some estimates was responsible for half the world 's phishing attacks before fizzling out in late 2008 .
Driving the success of both groups is their use of state - of - the - art technology for mass - producing imposter websites and distributing huge amounts of crimeware for automating identity theft .
" Avalanche uses the Rock 's techniques but improved upon them , introducing greater volume and sophistication , " the report , released by the Anti-Phishing Working Group , stated .
Central to Avalanche 's success is its use of fast - flux botnets to host phishing sites .
The use of peer - to - peer communications makes it impossible for a single ISP or hosting provider to to pull the plug on the infrastructure .
The gang also excels at launching attacks from a relatively small number of domain names that often appear confusingly identical to each other , such as 11f1 iili.com and 11t1 jtiil.com .
Those abilities also fuel the success .
There were 126,697 phishing attacks during the second half of 2009 , more than double the number in the first half of the year or from July through December of 2008 , the APWG report said .
Avalanche , which was first identified in December of 2008 , was responsible for 24 percent of phishing attacks in the first half of 2009 and for 66 percent in the second half .
From July through the end of the year , Avalanche targeted the more than 40 major financial institutions , online services , and job search providers .
Curiously , Avalanche may turn out to be a victim of its own success .
" During an Avalanche campaign , it was not unusual for the target institutions , the relevant domain name registrar (s ) , a domain name registry , and other responders and service providers to all be aware of the campaign and working on mitigation at the same time , " the report stated .
" As a result , Avalanche attacks had a much shorter average uptime than non-Avalanche phishing attacks , and community efforts partially neutralized the advantage of the fast - flux hosting . "
White hats briefly shut down the Avalanche infrastructure in mid November , and ever since then phishing attacks generated by the group have dropped precipitously .
Last month , the gang launched just 59 attacks , each one with a separate domain .
A PDF of the report is here . ®

Obama extends health care rights to gay partners
In a move hailed as a step toward fairness for same - sex couples , President Barack Obama is ordering that nearly all hospitals allow patients to say who has visitation rights and who can help make medical decisions , including gay and lesbian partners .
The White House on Thursday released a statement by Obama instructing his Health and Human Services secretary to draft rules requiring hospitals that receive Medicare and Medicaid payments to grant all patients the right to designate people who can visit and consult with them at crucial moments .
The designated visitors should have the same rights that immediate family members now enjoy , Obama 's instructions said .
It said Medicare - Medicaid hospitals , which include most of the nation 's facilities , may not deny visitation and consultation privileges on the basis of race , color , national origin , religion , sex , sexual orientation , gender identity or disability .
The move was called a major step toward fairness for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender Americans .
" This is a critical step in ending discrimination against LGBT families and ensuring that , in the event of a hospital stay , all Americans have the right to see their loved ones , " said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif .
The new rules , Obama said , should " guarantee that all patients ' advance directives , such as durable powers of attorney and health care proxies , are respected , " and that patients ' designees be able to " make informed decisions regarding patients ' care . "
Some gay advocacy groups say Obama has moved too slowly to fulfill campaign promises to expand their civil rights .
The nation 's top military leaders recently said it is time to end the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy that has kept gays from serving openly in the armed services .
The Human Rights Campaign , which backs gay rights , called Obama 's decision an " important action " that was inspired in part by a New York Times article about a lesbian couple in Miami .
They were kept apart while one lay dying in a hospital despite having an " advanced health care directive " asking for full visitation rights for each other .
" Discrimination touches every facet of the lives of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people , including at times of crisis and illness , " said HRC President Joe Solmonese .
" The president 's action today will help ensure that the indignities " suffered by the Miami patient and her children will not happen to others .
In his statement , Obama said : " Every day , all across America , patients are denied the kindnesses and caring of a loved one at their sides — whether in a sudden medical emergency or a prolonged hospital stay .
Often , a widow or widower with no children is denied the support and comfort of a good friend . "
He added : " Also uniquely affected are gay and lesbian Americans who are often barred from the bedsides of the partners with whom they may have spent decades of their lives — unable to be there for the person they love , and unable to act as a legal surrogate if their partner is incapacitated . "
Without the expanded visitor - designation rights , Obama said , " all too often , people are made to suffer or even to pass away alone , denied the comfort of companionship in their final moments while a loved one is left worrying and pacing down the hall . "
The Associated Press
A VICTORIAN man has lost a four - month battle to gain access to early drafts of a report on internet filtering that was used by the Federal Government to justify pressing ahead with its controversial web censorship plan .
The ISP Content Filtering Pilot Report , released in December last year , found it was possible to accurately block access to a list of banned web pages without major impact to internet speeds .
It was based on the results of a trial of filtering products with nine internet service providers ( ISPs ) , conducted for the Government by Enex TestLab .
However 37 - year - old electronic design engineer Cameron Watt , from Sunbury , northwest of Melbourne , believes the report did not include enough detail about how the tests were conducted .
" The final document I think lacks the detail I would have expected to be in there and the detail of previous ISP filtering tests , " Mr Watt told news.com.au .
" ISP filtering is a fairly serious change in the way the internet has been dealt with by governments , especially in Western democracies , and I see it as something that needs robust public debate . "
Five days after the report was released , Mr Watt lodged a Freedom of Information request with the Department of Broadband , Communications and the Digital Economy to access documents containing results of the trial .
The request was quashed by the department last month .
Among the documents requested by Mr Watt were drafts of the individual results for each ISP that participated in the trial , as well as draft versions of the consolidated results .
One of the draft versions of the consolidated results , dated last August , is marked as " anonymised " and is 36 pages longer than the 98 - page report released to the public , according to information made available during the request process .
In a statement of reasons given for blocking Mr Watt 's request , the department said the drafts contained commercially sensitive information and releasing them could harm its relationship with the internet industry .
" Protection of confidential material was a key element in the decision - making of several parties to participate in the pilot , " the department said .
" Disclosure of confidential information accessed through the pilot and in preparation of the pilot report would cause a significant breach of trust .
" This may also inhibit the department 's future access to such industry participation and expose the Commonwealth to litigation seeking substantial damages . "
The department originally estimated the cost of processing Mr Watt 's request at between $ 5524.12 and $ 7071.87 , but charged him only $ 337.50 after its decision .
The department said even if names of participants were removed from the drafts , savvy readers may still be able to piece together the details .
" Information was presented in these draft documents in order to facilitate cross-reference and analysis in a way that was never intended to be reproduced in the final version , " it said .
" This creates a high probability that , even should the names of third parties be removed , informed parties will infer or deduce specific results and potentially lead to erroneous interpretations or conclusions . "
The department said the drafts were also exempt because they contained details of its internal deliberations .
" The disclosure of those deliberations would be against the public interest , " it said .
A spokesperson for Communications Minister Stephen Conroy said the decision to block Mr Watt 's request had been made after consultations with trial participants .
" A number of ISPs that participated in the pilot , some filter vendors and Enex , expressed concerns about the release of some or all of these working drafts because they contain material that is commercial - in - confidence , " they said .
However the spokesperson said it was up to individual participants whether to release their own results : " Individual ISPs or filter vendors can release material relevant to them if they wish . "
Responding to Mr Watt 's concerns about the level of detail contained in the final report , Senator Conroy 's spokesperson said it was not possible to make comparisons to previous internet filtering tests .
" The report followed the live pilot trial which was specifically related to the Government 's ISP - level filtering policy , " they said .
" Previous testing commissioned by the Howard government looked at issues not related to the policy , including dynamic filtering technologies . "
Mr Watt is a member of online rights group Electronic Frontiers Australia , one of the most vocal critics of the Government 's internet filtering plan , which would see ISPs like Telstra and Optus forced to block access to a secret list of banned web pages .
Mr Watt said the request was carried out " at arm 's length " from the group and was funded privately .
The department accepted a request by Mr Watt for internal review of the decision earlier this month .
" That review is currently underway , " said Senator Conroy 's spokesperson .
The Government is expected to introduce legislation for its filtering plan later this year .

Here 's some more possible corruption that could be huge , notice Hannity has the word " Freedom " in his charity ( lol ) : Fox News commentator Sean Hannity is routinely mocked by the left for his conservative positions , but now he has become the target of far more serious accusations from a fellow - conservative .
Columnist and blogger Debbie Schlussel claimed on Friday that Hannity is profiting from a charity that raises money for severely injured US soldiers and the children of troops killed in action , and she described the Freedom Alliance as " a huge scam . "
" Less than 20 % --- and in two recent years , less than 7 % and 4 % , respectively --- of the money raised by Freedom Alliance went to these causes , while millions of dollars went to expenses , including consultants and apparently to ferret [ sic ] the Hannity posse of family and friends in high style , " Schlussel writes .
" And , despite Hannity ’s statements to the contrary on his nationally syndicated radio show , " she continues , " few of the children of fallen soldiers got more than $ 1,000 - $ 2,000 , with apparently none getting more than $ 6,000 , while Freedom Alliance appears to have spent tens of thousands of dollars for private planes . "
Schlussel cites an anonymous source who she says told her that the promoter of Hannity 's fundraising " Freedom Concerts " figured the cost of a Gulfstream jet , a " fleet " of luxury SUVs , and high - end hotel suites for Hannity 's entourage as amounting to over $ 200,000 per event .

Of course Breitbart " missed this one " !!!
He thinks people are stupid and wo n't notice .
Like all those people do .
Like we do n't notice the GOP set records for using Reconciliation , then cry about it , and I can go on and on and on .
That 's what they are all about .
They 're hypocrites .
They know it , they 're just trying to hide it .
Actually , Breitbart purposely misses things like this .
That 's his job .
That 's why people like him can't be taken seriously .
He 's not a serious " journalist " , he 's a shill with a cause and agenda with zero integrity .
The entire FOX " news " network does this , that is why they can't be taken seriously .
Republicans also do n’t care when their own rank hypocrisy is revealed in the “ liberal media ” — when there are balanced reports , for example , that they used the same arcane rules with wild abandon when they controlled Congress .
The Republican base will never learn about their own pols ’ hypocrisy because these voters have been trained to get their “ news ” exclusively from right - wing propaganda outlets like Fox News and hate radio , where untidy facts like these will never be mentioned .

And how much do you want to bet that most , if not all , of the people stuffing U.S. taxpayer - provided money into duffel bags were Republicans , who rushed to the war zones to make their fortune , part of which they 'd funnel back into the coffers of the Republican Party as repayment to the Bush / Cheney administration and the neo-cons for making their war - profiteering possible .
Kind of like what happened after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast , after which the criminal Bush / Cheney administration directed most , if not all , taxpayer - provided reconstruction funds to Republican companies and individuals .
Kind of like fourth - rate Republican lawyers at the DOJ , Goodling and Sampson , scrapping the Hatch Act so they could hire only right - wing litmus - passing Republicans to DOJ positions with a clear conscience ... which is strange because for a criminal Republican to have a clear conscience they must first have a conscience .

Money also disappeared in truckloads and by helicopter .
The CPA reportedly distributed funds to contractors in bags off the back of a truck .
In one notorious incident in April 2004 , $ 1.5 billion in cash that had just been delivered by three Blackhawk helicopters was handed over to a courier in Erbil , in the Kurdish region , never to be seen again .
Afterwards , no one was able to recall the courier ’s name or provide a good description of him .
Paul Bremer , meanwhile , had a slush fund in cash of more than $ 600 million in his office for which there was no paperwork .
One U.S. contractor received $ 2 million in a duffel bag .

RIOTS , petrol bombs , tear gas and strikes greeted the Greek 's government 's latest attempt to persuade its citizens of the merits of reducing the country 's budget deficit .
In Athens demonstrators stormed up to the very steps of the parliament building , where an austerity plan was about to be debated , calling on the parliamentary “ thieves ” to come out .
Three people were killed when protesters set fire to a bank building on Wednesday May 5th .
Hours later , with tear gas drifting through the adjacent square , parliamentary leaders held a brief , sombre exchange on the signficance of the deaths , vowing to protect the principle that protest must be peaceful .
Many citizens agreed that it was a sad moment for the birthplace of democracy .
Yet Athenians were also saying , with wistful smiles , that it had been a good party while it lasted .
The backdrop to the riots was that , in a mixed mood of resignation , black humour and bitterness , Greeks were bidding farewell to a decade in which everything good and bad about their country grew feverishly .
There were sporting and cultural extravaganzas , starting with the 2004 Olympics .
Archaeological sites were spruced up , new buildings erected .
The middle class grew larger and more sophisticated .
And many people at the lower end of the pile breathed a bit easier , if only because immigrants from poorer places came to harvest their olives and work in their restaurants .
At the same time , Greece 's worst habits — the plundering of state coffers , the hiring of cronies , the abuse of public office , impunity for the powerful — were multiplied on an ever larger scale .
A handful of Cassandras said it would end in tears but , while the party lasted , nobody listened .
Now , with the announcement on May 2nd of loans from the IMF and the European Union worth a total of € 110 billion ( $ 144 billion ) , plus an austerity plan , the party is well and truly over .
Indeed , the riots will usher in what promises to be the rockiest period in the recent history of Greece .
By slashing pay in the public sector , raising taxes and ( hesitantly ) starting to reform the labour market , the plan aims to reduce the budget deficit from 13.6 % of GDP in 2009 to less than 3 % by 2014 .
But it will deepen the recession that is already hitting Greece , with a drop in GDP in 2010 of at least 4 % , and a further fall expected in 2011 .
George Papandreou , Greece 's Socialist prime minister , can count on a degree of understanding among half the electorate ( not all of them voters for his own party ) that the country faces a moment in which wrenching change is the only alternative to outright disaster .
He can also take comfort because the centre - right opposition , New Democracy , is in quarrelsome disarray as the full extent of its mismanagement in 2004 - 09 becomes obvious .
But will that be enough ?
Even those who accept that Greece 's problems are largely self - made feel depressed about an austerity plan that seems to offer so little hope even for the medium term , and will punish many hard - working and modestly - paid Greeks .
And there is a hot - headed minority , at least , that does not believe the government when it says it had no choice .
Mikis Theodorakis , Greece 's most famous composer , expressed the visceral reaction of many when he said the crisis was probably a plot by dark forces in the United States and other capitalist centres to subdue proud , independent nations .
Crazy as such talk may sound to euro - area governments that feel they have strained every muscle to save Greece from collapse , it will convince some people in a country where conspiracy theories ( and indeed , conspiracies ) have a long history .
Greek politics still includes a Communist Party that is rigorously Stalinist ( it damns Khrushchev as a liberal backslider ) and commanded 8 % of the vote in the past two parliamentary elections .
There is an emerging party of religious - nationalist far - rightists under the acronym LAOS ( the Greek word for people ) , which has tried to gain respectability by accepting the need for tough measures , but still stands to gain from the general ferment .
So do groups of malcontents even further removed from the political mainstream .
Not for the first time , the IMF and EU will be cast as lightning - rods for xenophobic anger .
In the radical press and on the internet , the IMF is being called a junta , comparable to the colonels who took power in 1967 with the connivance ( most Greeks believe ) of the United States .
That Greece invoked IMF help in late April , just after the anniversary of the April 21st 1967 coup , is seen by many in the Helleno - blogosphere as confirmation that the country faces a new period of foreign - backed despotism .
Such talk resonates in Greece .
Throughout its 200 - year history , the role of foreign powers has generated red - hot passion .
Protagonists in Greece 's internal quarrels have long invoked external assistance , while furiously denouncing any foreign help given to their rivals .
During the right - left civil war of 1946 - 49 , each side reserved particular loathing for its foe 's foreign backers , American or Soviet .
Dimitris Livanios , a historian , says that idea of a manipulating “ foreign finger ” is a recurring motif in Greek affairs .
The unprecedented prosperity enjoyed by most Greeks over the past decade helped to disguise some sentiments that were never far below the surface : ultra-leftism ( including the violent sort which spills over into terrorism ) , ultranationalism and xenophobia .
Such feelings may now be unleashed .
The government claims some successes in rounding up a small ultra-leftist group of urban guerrillas called “ Revolutionary Struggle ” .
But there are palpable fears that austerity and riots will spawn a new generation of self - styled Robin Hoods practising both political and criminal violence .
Tied to the mast
Meanwhile , cooler - headed Greeks are wracking their brains for ways to regain the economy 's lost competitiveness and make better use of Greece 's abundant human and natural assets .
Much of the growth over the past decade reflected the windfall of cheap euro interest rates , which stoked an exuberant consumer market , complete with smart cars , foreign travel and personal trainers .
All this activity will contract sharply now .
Harsh new taxes on business included in the government 's austerity plan may kill the entrepreneurial spirit of those bold enough to try new things .
New taxes on business and property will also limit the attractiveness of state assets that the government may want to sell to raise revenue , notes Stefanos Manos , a former finance minister .
There is also a well - founded suspicion that light - fingered bureaucrats and greedy politicians , the very people who caused the crisis , will not be held to account .
President Carolos Papoulias , a soft - spoken leftist whose office is meant to be above politics , reacted to the austerity plan with a one - sentence call for people who robbed the state coffers to be punished .
Many agreed .
“ The wage and spending cuts will be implemented with great efficiency , but with our chaotic justice system , the pursuit of tax - dodgers and bribe - takers will just run into the sand , ” predicted an Athenian architect .
“ It 's all very well for Papandreou to compare himself to Odysseus making a long , heroic voyage , ” read one e-mail doing the rounds between Athenian offices this week .
“ But Odysseus had a miserable journey and he lost all his companions .

At street level , sentiments are even less poetic .
“ We do not recognise this debt , ” was the slogan of the militant trade unions , from teachers to dockers , that went on strike this week .
The number of Greeks who believe in Bolshevik - style autarky may be small .
But the idea of working hard for years to win an IMF / EU certificate of good behaviour holds little appeal .
Either in fear or in hope , many Greeks detect a breakdown of a political system , over a century old , in which two political groups ( notionally of the centre - left and the centre - right , but both given to patronage and graft ) progressively exhaust the national exchequer by outbidding each other .
After the post - party riots , it is anybody 's guess what might take its place .

Via : USA Today :
Beef containing harmful pesticides , veterinary antibiotics and heavy metals is being sold to the public because federal agencies have failed to set limits for the contaminants or adequately test for them , a federal audit finds .
A program set up to test beef for chemical residues “ is not accomplishing its mission of monitoring the food supply for … dangerous substances , which has resulted in meat with these substances being distributed in commerce , ” says the audit by the U.S. Department of Agriculture ’s Office of Inspector General .
The health effects on people who eat such meat are a “ growing concern , ” the audit adds .
The testing program for cattle is run by the USDA ’s Food Safety and Inspection Service ( FSIS ) , which also tests meat for such pathogens as salmonella and certain dangerous strains of E. coli .
But the residue program relies on assistance from the Environmental Protection Agency , which sets tolerance levels for human exposure to pesticides and other pollutants , and the Food and Drug Administration , which does the same for antibiotics and other medicines .
Limits have not been set by the EPA and FDA “ for many potentially harmful substances , which can impair FSIS ’ enforcement activities , ” the audit found .
The FSIS said in a written statement that the agency has agreed with the inspector general on “ corrective actions ” and will work with the FDA and EPA “ to prevent residues or contaminants from entering into commerce . ”
Even when the inspection service does identify a lot of beef with high levels of pesticide or antibiotics , it often is powerless to stop the distribution of that meat because there is no legal limit for those contaminants .
In 2008 , for example , Mexican authorities rejected a U.S. beef shipment because its copper levels exceeded Mexican standards , the audit says .
But because there is no U.S. limit , the FSIS had no grounds for blocking the beef ’s producer from reselling the rejected meat in the United States .
“ It ’s unacceptable .
These are substances that can have a real impact on public health , ” says Tony Corbo , a lobbyist for Food and Water Watch , a public interest group .
“ This administration is making a big deal about promoting exports , and you have Mexico rejecting our beef because of excessive residue levels .
It ’s pretty embarrassing . ”

To feed an exploding global population , scientists have called for a doubling of food production over the next 40 years .
Genetic manipulation might seem the best way to quickly boost characteristics essential to plant growth and crop yields .
New findings from different laboratories , however , suggest that fungi , bacteria and viruses could be an exciting alternative to increase agricultural productivity .
Scientists have long known that microbes can work symbiotically with plants .
For instance , mycorrhizal fungi , which are associated with 90 percent of land plants , extend from roots to bring in moisture and minerals in exchange for plant carbohydrates .
But microbes have recently been found among plant cells themselves and seem to confer benefits , such as more efficient photosynthesis and increased ability to fix nitrogen from the air .
In fact , Mary E. Lucero , a biologist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture ’s Jornada Experimental Range in Las Cruces , N.M. , believes that plants actively recruit these microbes rather than simply being passive hosts for them .
In the lab , Lucero has given this recruitment a hand by transferring fungi from four - wing saltbush to grama grass , which is important for grazing cattle .
The fungi - infused grass grew larger and produced more seed , probably by improving nutrient uptake and water usage , she speculates .
Lucero also points out that harnessing microbial help for capturing nitrogen could reduce the need for chemical fertilizers .
“ It is far easier , more efficient and less expensive to inoculate a plant with a beneficial fungi than to come up with a genetically modified species , ” she remarks .
Rusty Rodriguez , a microbiologist with the U.S. Geological Survey ’s Biological Resources Division in Seattle , is trying to tackle another agricultural demon : excessive heat .
In experiments to improve the ability of tomato plants to resist high temperatures , he inoculated them with fungi taken from plants near hot springs in Yellowstone National Park .
The result : tomatoes that can grow at 148 degrees Fahrenheit .
“ That ’s about the internal temperature of a medium cooked prime rib , ” Rodriguez notes .
Furthermore , by isolating a virus in the fungus , he discovered a three - way symbiosis that was required for thermal tolerance .
“ Without the virus the plants could handle only about 100 degrees F , ” Rodriguez says .
The fungus and virus also conveyed heat tolerance to rice and wheat , a process that could not only boost yields but also help crops fend off the effects of climate change .
Analyzing plants from beaches , deserts and polluted areas , Rodriguez has also isolated microbes that help plants resist salt , drought and heavy metals .
Curiously , the same fungi taken from plants living in unstressed areas did not confer tolerance .
“ It has to be the right microbe from the right habitat , ” Rodriguez says .
Choosing microbes from heat - stressed areas could boost rice production , which drops 10 percent for every 1.8 degrees F of warming .
Once acquired , however , stress - tolerant microbes can be passed in seed coatings to the plant ’s progeny .
Christopher L. Schardl , a plant pathologist at the University of Kentucky who studies certain species of tall fescue grass , observes that the mutualism between microbes and plants has agricultural drawbacks , too .
Many microbes in plants produce biologically active alkaloids , which repel insects , birds and herbivores .
In fact , in the early 1950s grazing livestock picked up a disease related to alkaloids in grass known as fescue toxicosis .
It can induce tremor and stupor , as well as an aversion to further grazing .
“ It costs the livestock industry about $ 1 billion a year , ” says Schardl , adding that producers raising grass - fed cattle are now sowing cultivars with nontoxic fungi .
Identifying plant microbes is not easy , because microbial cells are embedded in plant tissue .
Lucero uses scanning electron microscopy and new pyrosequencing techniques to identify the DNA of microbes in plant tissue .
The intensive effort , Rodriguez believes , will pay off by helping farmers meet future food demands .
Modifying traits genetically is expensive , does not always work and generates a fair amount of consumer backlash .
Improving crop production with the plant ’s own microorganisms might be more successful on a host of fronts .
Says Rodriguez : “ We ’re trying to duplicate the way it works in nature — using not genes but entire genomes from the plant ’s own microbial community . ”

MIAMI ( Reuters ) - A U.S. judge has agreed to referee a dispute among Florida political activists over who can use the phrase “ Tea Party ” in their name .
A trial has been scheduled to begin on December 6 in U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach , Florida , in a lawsuit that questions whether anyone has a trademark or intellectual property right to the “ Tea Party ” name .
Hundreds of groups call themselves part of the Tea Party movement whose name alludes to the 18th century U.S. revolt against tea taxes and British colonial rule .
They usually oppose big central government , deficit spending and President Barack Obama , but there is no hierarchy or formal affiliation among them .
While Tea Partiers generally oppose federal government intervention , they have turned to the federal court to resolve a dispute that arose after Fred O’Neal , a central Florida lawyer and longtime anti-tax crusader , registered the “ Tea Party ” as a Florida political party in August .
O’Neal said the name is an acronym for the “ Taxed Enough Already ” party and that he hoped to recruit candidates to run against both Democrats and Republicans .
Nearly three dozen people and groups who called themselves part of the Tea Party movement filed suit against O’Neal and two associates in January , accusing them of trying to “ hijack ” the movement and confuse the public .
“ They ’re trying to promote candidates that we would n’t support , ” said plaintiff Everett Wilkinson , who has been active in Tea Party events and groups .
“ The people trust us more than the political parties .
We work hard to keep that trust . ”
The plaintiffs said O’Neal ’s group is a “ fake ” Tea Party , a claim he scoffs at .
“ I looked for the rule book but I never found it , ” O’Neal said on Tuesday .
“ I do n’t know what it takes to be an authentic Tea Party versus a fake Tea Party . ”
IS IT A PLOT ?
The plaintiffs , many of whom have “ Tea Party ” as part of their group names , said they feared O’Neal would sue them for trademark infringement or violation of intellectual property rights .
Florida law says the names and symbols of registered political parties cannot be used without permission of the party ’s executive committee .
Each side also questioned the other ’s political motives .
Tea Party supporters lean Republican -- 59 percent of Republicans support the movement compared with 36 percent of independents and only 9 percent of Democrats , according to a March poll by Harris Interactive .
Wilkinson contends that O’Neal is plotting to run third - party candidates in order to split the Republican vote and help elect liberal Democrats .
O’Neal contends the Republican Party is behind the lawsuit against him and is trying to shut down his political party because “ they do n’t like the idea of having to compete for fiscal conservative voters . ”

Dictators get a bad rap these days .
People think that being a dictator is all about crushing your enemies , oppressing the masses and carrying out ethnically targeted genocide campaigns , but it is n’t .
There ’s more to being a dictator than bullying and brutality .
In fact , most dictators are actually pretty fun guys .
Some of them , on the other hand , are just plain bonkers .
Let ’s take a look at the brighter side of some of history ’s most bizarre and cruel men .
Here are some fun and interesting facts about dictators .
1. Idi Amin
Idi Amin Dada , a former heavyweight boxing champion , was the military dictator and self - appointed president of Uganda during the 1970s .
When he took control of the small African country back in 1971 the people hailed him as a hero .
However , they could not have know what kind of man their glorious General would prove himself to be .
Maybe the pressures of leadership got to him because pretty soon he began to act very strangely indeed .
Of all Amin ’s larger than life characteristics , his ego is perhaps the most famous .
He awarded himself many titles and honors , eventually styling himself as ‘ His Excellency , President for Life Field Marshall Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin Dada , VC , DSO , MC .
Lord of all the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular ’ .
This made him one of the most powerful men in the world , in his own mind at least .
But there was one title he did not award himself – that of king .
This is not to say that he did not wish to be a king , however .
He is rumored to have sent a love letter to Queen Elizabeth II of England , proposing marriage and even that he be made King of Scotland .
This is a strange thing for any man to do , especially one known to have despised the British .
Of course , Queen Elizabeth did not return Amin ’s affections .
Perhaps she was turned off by the knowledge that he was a polygamist , amongst other things .
He is known to have married at least six women throughout his life , one of whom was found dead , her body horrifically mutilated , after falling pregnant to another man .
Amin is also thought to have fathered as many as 43 children .
Since Amin ’s death in exile rumors have been abound that he enjoyed eating the flesh of his enemies , however , there is very little evidence to suggest that this is true .
2. Adolf Hitler
Adolf Hitler is one of the most infamous names in history .
The dictator and Furer of Nazi Germany is remembered as one of the most nefarious characters ever to wear a moustache .
As a ruthless dictator and mass murderer , he is considered by some to have been the embodiment of evil .
Yet despite this – or perhaps because of it – he is also the most caricaturised and ridiculed historical figures of all time , appearing in more comedy shows and cartoons than Count Dracula and George Bush combined .
We consider this to be a form of punishment , assuming that such a serious and egotistical man would hate being mocked and belittled so .
However , this could not be further from the truth .
Hitler was a great lover of comedy , the slapstick shenanigans of English comic Charlie Chaplin in particular .
When Chaplin released his feature film ‘ The Great Dictator ’ , in which he impersonated and publicly ridiculed the Furer , Hitler was not insulted in the least .
In fact , he was said to have been amused and flattered by the performance .
Add his winning sense of humor to the fact that he was also a vegetarian and an amateur painter , and you start to realize that Hitler was n’t such a simmering pot of hatred and evil as history has made him out to be , more of a self - deluding , misguided , genocidal buffoon .
It is also thought that his failings as an artist may have been a causal factor of his genocidal tendencies .
When VanGogh was frustrated he cut off his own ear , Hitler exterminated six million Jews instead .
So what about the rumors that Hitler only had one ball ?
Well , opinion seems to be divided on this .
Many historians believe that this little nugget was nothing but propaganda and that it was first introduced into the public consciousness by way of the popular song , originally entitled ‘ Goering has only got one ball ’ .
However , there is evidence that Hitler did suffer a groin injury during the First World War and that his left testicle was indeed removed by army medics .
3. Josef Stalin
Almost as bad as those of Hitler , the crimes committed by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin are often forgotten in the Western world .
During his great purge , nearly two million people were killed with many more being deported or sent to the torturous gulag detention camps .
But while that statistic might have looked impressive on Stalin ’s resume it tells us little about what he was like in person .
Here are some things you probably do n’t know about Josef Stalin .
First of all , did you know that Josef Stalin was n’t his real name but a pen name ?
With his real name being unpronounceable he took to using this pseudonym back in the days when he was a political activist , possibly in an attempt to hide his Georgian roots .
It means ‘ man of steel ’ .
After his rise to power , popular nicknames for Stalin in the Soviet Union included ‘ Papa Stalin ’ and ‘ Little Father of the Peoples ’ , owing to the fact that he was only 5 foot 4inches tall .
President Truman once described the despot as a ‘ little squirt ’ .
Personally , I would n’t have called him this to his face ; Stalin was notoriously sensitive about his height , having several portrait painters shot for failing to capture his godliness .
If this was n’t enough of a handicap for a dictator , a carriage accident in his youth had also left his left arm shortened and stiffened at the elbow , while his right hand was thinner than his left and frequently hidden .
Despite being a grumpy little man , Stalin was also the man behind the most wicked practical joke ever played .
Being a very private man he gave the order that no person should enter his bed chambers on pain of death .
Later , while in his chambers he decided to test whether his guards had listened to this instruction .
Pretending to scream in pain he called for the guards stationed outside the door .
Fearing that their leader was in trouble the guards burst into the room .
Stalin had them executed for failing to follow his standing orders .
This little prank soon backfired , however , when Stalin suffered a seizure while alone in his bedroom .
The guards were too afraid to enter , finding him hours later laid in a puddle of stale urine .
He died three days later .
4. Benito Mussolini
Another of the famous world war II dictators , Mussolini was the leader of Italy ’s National Fascist Party and Prime Minister of Italy .
His full title was ‘ His Excellency Benito Mussolini , Head of Government , Duce of Fascism , and Founder of the Empire ’ , but he also held the rank of First Martial of the Empire .
While some consider Mussolini to have been Italy ’s answer to Hitler , opinions are conflicted on this matter .
While he was instrumental in the formation of the Fascist ideology and was politically allied with Nazi Germany he is said to have disliked Hitler immensely .
He is also said to have had many Jewish friends and to have been opposed to the holocaust .
He initially favored siding with France against Germany but would seem to have fallen in with the wrong crowd .
An interesting fact about Mussolini is that he loved eating raw garlic , despite suffering from a painful stomach ulcer , and believed that it was the elixir of life .
And the award for most pathetic dictator goes to …
5. Saparmurat Atayevich Niyazov
Saparmurat Niyazov , President for life of Turkmenistan from 1990 to 2007 , is one of the least famous dictators of all time , partly because few people in the Western world even know where Turkmenistan is .
He did n’t invade his neighboring countries , commit mass murder or do any of the things that usually win dictators the international recognition they crave .
Like most dictators , however , he was absolutely bonkers .
Another thing he had in common with other dictators is the irresistible urge to rename things , towns , and cities in particular .
Niyazov , however , went one step further , changing the names of the days of the week and renaming calendar months after heroes of the state .
He even changed the word for bread , naming it after his beloved mother .
What a softie .
Of course , Niyazov did more than rename things .
He also introduced sweeping medical and social reforms , closing all hospitals outside of his capital and firing 15,000 public health workers .
Also closed were all of the country ’s internet cafes and all rural libraries .
In 2006 one third of all Turkmenistan ’s elderly had their pensions canceled and were ordered by Niyazov ’s government to pay back the previous two years payments .
The resulting deaths through poverty , sickness , and starvation may have been in the tens of thousands if not more , but Niyazov refused to admit that his policies had any ill effect on the populous .
Amongst Niyazov ’s most ridiculous laws was the ban on beards , make - up for newsreaders , recorded music and the exclusion of dogs from the capital city .
Apparently he did n’t like the way they smell .
Northwestern University 's Victor Shih has described China 's banking system as plagued by ' endless moral hazard . '
Financial institutions are n't just sometimes too big to fail , they can also be too small to fail too , or simply just barred from failure for the sake of it .
What makes the problem intractable is that it's in everyone 's near - term interest to keep playing ball .
FinanceAsia :
Shih refers to the situation as a moral hazard because he believes that no matter how much trouble a bank may get itself into , or whether it is in the wrong , the central bank will bail it out .
This differs from Western markets , where there is much more accountability in the governance system and it is still possible for a big bank to go bankrupt .
In the short - term , Shih believes it is difficult to imagine a financial crisis in China .
" Crises are caused by a sudden withdrawal of liquidity due to the lack of confidence in the market , " Shih said .
" With common knowledge of this ultimate backstop , actors in the system will rarely panic . "
We realize that most TMG readers have known about these problems before , but we feel Mr. Shih provides an interesting framework for understanding the situation when he describes it as an endless cycle of ' borrower - banker - regulator ' collusion .
He also provides a nice concrete example involving the manager of a national bank being paid ' special bonuses ' to fund a local government 's favored projects :
One example of this became known in 2008 when it emerged that Liu Changming , head of Bank of Communications ( Guangdong ) , had made Rmb10 billion of loans over four years .
This was almost a sixth of all loans that were payable at the branch .
Changming formed shell companies to borrow large sums from the bank , which he then lent to various businesses at high interest .
In the end , he racked up almost Rmb5 billion in non-performing loans .
The peculiar twist to this story is that when a Ministry of Finance ( MOF ) auditor found the irregularities in Bocom 's books , the local prosecutor 's office arrested the auditor for taking a bribe .
Eventually , the central government stepped in and ordered the MOF and the police to pursue the case .
In the long - run though , it had very little impact on the tightening of accountabilities .
Shih noted that regulators now allow Bocom to roll over the bad loans and value seized assets optimistically to cover up the non-performing loans .
What this demonstrates is that when a safety net is all - encompassing it can lead to a misallocation of capital as the state guides cash flows in order to satisfy policy objectives .
This anecdote shows how even when a problem is found , it is simply covered up and remains hidden in the books .
Even when it is found it is n't fixed .
It 's like everyone is in on the ruse , and yet is playing the opposite part as the fool at the same time .
The near - term upshot of this all , according to Mr. Shih , is that the threat of a sudden crisis any time soon is actually small given substantial capacity for the system to keep sheltering financial players and burying bad loans .
That 's probably the major macro take - away from his view .
The long - term - broken system lends substantial near - term stability which Mr. Shih seems to believe can be sustained for now , despite his criticism .
That 's what makes the China bubble so tricky to play .
It 'd be all too easy if broken systems broke down when they should .

Surprise ! ‘ Firefly ’ Creator Joss Whedon To Direct ‘ The Avengers ’
When it comes to fanboys , no one is better suited for any job you can think of than Joss Whedon .
The writer / creator / producer of Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Angel , Firefly , and Dollhouse has developed an army of followers who will love him to the end of time .
Marvel Studios has apparently realized this faithful following and how much Whedon is just a geek and fanboy himself .
According to Deadline Hollywood , the maker of epic comic book movies is in final negotiations with Whedon to direct The Avengers , which is the film that will bring all of these massive characters and storylines into one film .
This comes as a major shock to most people .
While Whedon is a genius writer , he has only directed one feature in his career — 2005 ’s Serenity .
He has , on the other hand , directed many television episodes , including 22 episodes of Buffy , 7 episodes of Angel , 3 episodes of Firefly , 3 episodes of Dollhouse , and even episodes of both The Office and Glee .
Oh , and let us not forget Dr. Horrible ’s Sing - Along Blog .
While this news is now coming out , credit must be given to IESB , who first caught wind of Whedon being a top choice of Marvel .
Unfortunately , that report fell on April 1st , and as you might imagine , many just walked right past it as just another ridiculous and fabricated report — just another reason why April Fools is the most annoying day of the year for people who actually care about the news .
No details are really known about where Whedon will go with the movie , but I have to think this is a good move .
Jon Favreau was clearly the best choice , but since he was not available , I like that Marvel wants to go somewhere else .
Whedon will have an unbelievable task in front of him ; with this movie taking Favreau and Robert Downey Jr.‘s Iron Man character , Louis Leterrier ’s Incredible Hulk , Kenneth Branagh and Chris Hemsworth ‘s Thor , and Joe Johnstson and Chris Evans ‘ Captain America and putting them all into one single film , the newbie director will have to find a way to make a great comic book film while still staying true to the storylines and characters that all of these other immense talents have built up .
Try standing in those shoes .
What Should I Do ( feat .

Out Of Here
Think About It
Shows the differences in the life experience of three male babies from three different social classes .
One young man succeeds his father as president of the family manufacturing company .
Another , a middle - class white - collar worker at the same company , leaves the town of his birth and moves to New York City where he becomes a respected advertising art director , thus rising in social status .
A third , born into the working class , trains as a mechanic and holds an influential job at a service station .
The sociological tone of the film does not mask a sobering narrative of the limitations that social class divisions inflict on all Americans .
Shows the difference social class makes in the lives of three high school boys .
Explains how one boy is able to raise his social status .
Ken Smith sez :
If this film was designed to stimulate thought , it succeeds .
We follow the lives of three small town high school buddies ; " Gil Ames " who is rich and happy ; " Dave Benton " who is poor and doomed ; and " Ted Eastwood , " who is middle class and doomed .
Gil is sent to an Ivy League school ( where he meets " men of his own kind " ) , returns home wearing a bow tie , and takes over his father 's very profitable business .
Dave gets married , has lots of kids , and winds up working in a gas station .
Ted wants to be an artist , but he falls in love with " Mary " and becomes a white collar bookkeeper .
Mary , however , wants a man with a bigger bank account , so she dumps Ted , who then decides to move to Manhattan and " make something " of himself .
After many years of hard work as an advertising artist and art director , Ted lands a painfully dull white collar job in an advertising agency and gets to play golf with rich men .
This is " vertical mobility , " the narrator explains , " particularly characteristic of the United States . "
Ted returns home wearing a snappy hat , but Mary has married Gil , and both really do n't want anything to do with him .
This film was produced to explain basic concepts of sociology , but ends up presenting a rather dark view of social class and mobility in America .
Some of it ( especially the railroad station scene ) appears to have been shot in and around Convent Station , N.J .
Sociological discussion of ascribed status , achieved status , vertical mobility and horizontal mobility in America .
We follow the lives of three men from high school on through their professional lives .
Rather pessimistic conclusion on the possibilities of movement across class boundaries .
" These three babies are equal under the law , but they are not equal in terms of class ... "
This sociology lesson breaks educational film taboo by speaking directly about social class , shocking the ears with its frankness .
But what a bleak film !
Beginning with shots of newborn babies in a maternity ward , it follows three boys ( Dave Benton , a working - class kid ; Ted Eastwood , a middle - class boy ; and Gil Ames , the son of a factory owner ) all the way to adulthood , showing how their destinies are largely determined by the class into which they are born .
Dave Benton finds a job right after high - school graduation , gets married and fathers a large family .
Gil Ames goes to an Ivy League university ( where he can meet " men of his own kind " ) and returns home to take over his father 's factory .
But the film devotes most of its attention to middle - class Ted Eastwood , who wants to be an artist but can't afford to take the risk of passing up a steady job .
Ted grows increasingly frustrated with his boring white - collar job and his limited options .
The final straw is when he loses his upper - class girlfriend to Gil .
Feeling trapped for life , Ted moves to New York and becomes a commercial artist .
The film then shifts into a kind of implicit celebration of upward mobility , American - style .
Ted becomes a great success in New York , the great melting pot .
In a passage remarkable at once for its delicacy and candor , the narrator remarks : " Class lines are drawn differently in a large city like New York , although they are still there .
Here professional standing , power and wealth are of great importance .
It is possible for members of socially prominent families , theater people who may have come from the lower class , and successful businessmen of the middle class to mix socially , and Ted is an accepted member of the group . "
But when Ted returns home to visit his parents , he reverts to his previous status , " still the nice kid from the wrong side of the railroad tracks , no matter how successful he is . "
Though there is nothing really radical about Social Class in America ( its matrix of social class is derived from sociological , rather than Marxist categories ) it was highly unusual for educational films in this period to openly discuss the limits of mobility in our society .
In a time filled with noises of boom and prosperity , the mass media was generally silent on the subject of ceilings and barriers .
As a technical film for the education of sociologists , this movie was freer to define the categorical limits of our freedom .

" He knows now that to her and Gil , he 's still the nice kid from the wrong side of the railroad tracks , no matter how successful he is .
His achieved status is higher than that of his father 's because he has a profession .
But that status depends on a place .
In this case , New York . "

Subject : Identifying places in this movie
As mentioned in the shot list , the rail station is in Convent Station , NJ , where I grew up .
Also , I believe I can recognize Madison High School , stores around the Green in Morristown , including Bambergers , and the the hospital where the boys are born is Morristown Memorial .
I was born one year before this was made .
I think the world depicted in the film matched the world around me .
I knew people very much like the ones shown .

Subject : The 50s Graham W. : I did , in fact , graduate from high school in 1966 .
But my two older brothers ( the ones who earned PhDs ) graduated in 1957 and 1958 , respectively .
They were the first in our extended family ( including numerous aunts , uncles , cousins , etc. ) to attend college .
Interestingly , most of their high school friends
went on to college too and , like my brothers , were the first from their families to continue their educations beyond high school .
So I really think the shackles of social class truly began to erode in a significant way during that decade --- and accelerated through the 60s , as you note .
BTW , in mentioning that my Dad was a tool and die maker , I did not mean to imply in any way a lack of respect for the skill involved .
He was very skilled and often let me come to the tool room of the company where he worked on Saturday mornings to watch him work .
I marveled at his ability to take a blueprint and a block of steel and fashion it with intricate care to create an elaborate die .
But it was nevertheless a blue collar job , albeit a skilled one , with all that implied for social standing .
It was never a question in our home whether we kids would attend college --- it was a given .

Subject : @ donwert -- Right , the whole theme of ' Social Class in America ' , ' 57 , is relentlessly grim .
You 're right , the whole theme of this film , ' Social Class in America ' ( 1957 ) , is relentlessly grim , also it 's depressing and fatalistic .
Moreover , you point to your family as having successfully broken out of a not so acceptable social class for a better one , thus implying the film does n’t really reflect reality .
You 're correct , but in 1957 things were very different and the picture the film paints of the mid 1950s is reasonably factual although for emphasis its case is somewhat overstated .
As a ' 48 baby - boomer , you will have graduated from high school about 1966 .
The mid to late 1960s were worlds apart from 1957 in just so many ways : the social revolution of the early 1960s -- changes in attitudes to sex , class , egalitarianism etc. , the Vietnam War , the draft ( in a time of war ) , fundamental changes in civil rights , Kennedy , Johnson etc .
By the time you 'd graduated from college , we'd had the moon landings , the anti Vietnam War demonstrations -- a huge social upheaval in and of itself -- flower power and the hippie movement and of course Woodstock .
And no one can forget the student riots around the world , especially in Paris .
Other than in times of all - out war , there are not many periods in history where attitudes have changed so dramatically in just a single decade .
The staid 1950s depicted in this picture , thankfully , had gone by the mid 1960s and I 'm sure you 'd benefited from it .
A hypothetical is not proof but it would be a reasonable bet to say that had you kids left school in 1957 things most likely would have been much harder for you .
For starters , statistically your father 's income a decade earlier say in 1951 - 52 probably could n't have supported all of you kids right through high school , as the benefits of the post - war boom would n't be fully realized for another decade , concomitantly neither would the income of the average worker .
( By 1960 , the average income had increase very substantially over that of the early 1950s )
Clearly , you are a very talented lot , and my sincere congratulations to you for your success -- as it 's always great to see talent succeed , however , had the year been 1957 then perhaps not all of you would have done so well .
It is not my aim to criticize your comment , rather your experience provides a brilliant segue into a discussion that contrasts the 1950s and '60s .
This film , although depressing and exaggerated , is an excellent snapshot of those times ; it conveys a stuffy formal milieu that would n't have been tolerated by the kids of a decade later .
For example , the party scene at Dave Benton 's home has all males dressed in a suit and tie , a decade later they 'd all have been in jeans -- not to mention the young having long hair !
That you teenagers of the mid 1960s seem to be unaware that social mobility was supposed to be an obstacle in life amply demonstrates that a radically different zeitgeist by then had taken hold .
By the mid 1960 's , teenagers were n’t questioning whether their future was to be determined by the socially accepted strictures of circa 1957 , rather , they simply ignored * them .
Finally , I must say that being tool and die maker is not something of which to be ashamed ; it is the pinnacle job of the metal industries ( outside professional mechanical engineers -- but then they do n’t get their hands dirty ) .
Tool and die making is precision work and at its high end it involves great skill , expertise and considerable experience .
Perhaps your father 's talents and skills passed onto you kids and that you are too close to events to appreciate it .
Today , our society greatly undervalues people who have talent and who can work skilfully with their hands and it does so at its peril .
Now , we are almost totally dependent on Asian workers outside the country to provide those skills for us .
( No , I 'm not a tool and die maker , however once I did study metal and woodworking and I 've briefly worked in machine shops .
Electronics is my profession , so I do n't get my hands dirty either but I take my hat off to those who do . )
I 'm going to rate this film high , not for content which is only mediocre , but as a 50 - plus year old historical snapshot that even today still provides us with ideas to think about .

* My family was between working and middle class and I can honestly say as a teenage baby - boomer that the concept of class restricting what I would do with my life never even entered my head .
Nevertheless , I was aware of the class structures of my parents ' era .
To me , class was a quaint , somewhat strange notion of one 's parents , it was n't cool or egalitarian .

A 1957 film showing the personal limitations due to family class structure in this country ( Stronger in small towns than in the big cities . )
Today , it is less prevalent , but with monopolies becoming powerful again , and prices increasing at a higher rate than wage raises , one wonders what will happen .

In a rich man 's world Very odd - in - stomach movie about 3 boys and how their social class will lead them for the rest of their lives ,
The rich baby will always be rich , the poor one will always be poor , the middle - class baby though , in his twenties , moves up in the world , but is treated as middle class at home .
Pshaw at that I say !
Impress the middle class people at home !
And watch out for rich kids , they 'll steal your woman away !
Very odd and strange actually .
While some of it may be true , this film I believe is of the minority and not the majority ( but I could be wrong ) .

Poor Ted Eastwood .
He is born into a middle class society and Mary , the hot stuck up rich girl , will have nothing to do with him because he is below her .
Ted has dreams of pursuing a career in art .
His father talks him out of it saying that " security lies in business and white collar work " .
So good ol Ted becomes a book keeper alongside his dad at the local corporate slave office .
Unhappy with the life he is stuck with he goes out on a limb by moving to NY and eventually he improves his social status by becoming a successfull art director .
Now when he goes home he 'll be able to get with Mary .
WRONG !!
Aside from the fact she is now married to some upper class schmuck we still know Ted wo n't be gettin any on the side because he wasnt born into thier elite club .
You can't polish a turd so to say .
Meanwhile the lower class fiqure who works at the gas station is churnin out babies like there is no tommorow !!

Subject : Aspiring for Vertical Mobility
A look at three boys in small town America in the 1950s .
GilbertÃÂs dad owns the local factory ; heÃÂs upper class .
TedÃÂs dad works for GilbertÃÂs dadÃÂs company and is middle class .
DavidÃÂs dad has an unskilled job and heÃÂs lower class .
Since this is the fifties , the only people whose social class matters are white men .
There is only one woman in the film , Mary .
Mary rejects TedÃÂsheÃÂs upper class and heÃÂs not ( we know sheÃÂs upper class because she has her own carÃÂunusual for young women in the fifties ) .
Ted moves to New York and becomes an art director at an ad agency and , as the film puts it , makes a ÃÂhorizontal move to achieve vertical mobility .
ÃÂ
In other words , he raises his social standing by moving away .
In New York he can move between the different social classes , but once heÃÂs back in his small town heÃÂs still plain old Ted .
David becomes a skilled auto mechanic and probably does pretty well for himself , despite the fact that his job has less prestige than TedÃÂs .
Gil , the only one of the boys to go to college , comes home to run the family factory .
The America we see in this film is one in which towns have factories that produce goods and employ the local citizens .
TedÃÂs dad didnÃÂt go to college , yet heÃÂs still middle class .
A high school graduate could still earn a decent living then and be considered a member of the middle class .
Ted ends up running the art department at a New York ad agency simply as a result of taking night classes .
For some white men at least , there was more social mobility than there is today .
The film mentions that social class also has to do with ÃÂnationality , religion and raceÃÂ but we donÃÂt see anyone other than WASP white men in this film .
Presumably , the children of immigrant parents , non-whites and women were so socially marginalized in the fifties that their social class was negligible in the eyes of the larger society ( and the producers of this film ) .

Krugman wrote a piece in the New York Times Magazine ( Sept. or Oct. 2002 ) noting that income inequality is growing again in the U.S. , in a big way .
We are entering a new guilded age like we had in the early decades of the 1900s .
This movie was filmed when our nation enjoyed comparative equality , but you just have to look at CEO compensation to know we 're moving further and further away from that .
I 'm no communist , but I feel that democracy is undermined when a tiny number of people wield vast power .
All of the current administration 's cabinet are millionaires .
Are they representing my interests ?

1. " hate boss " Hopefully your asshole boss will be OK with your public posts about how much you hate them ?
2. " weird rash " This one 's mostly about babies , but there are some choice oversharers in here too .
4. " one night stand " There 's a much higher number of people who are looking for a one night stand on Facebook than people who have successfully had them .
Which is depressing .

Are they not Facebook friends with their boyfriends ?
Or is this how they communicate ?

The lure of computer drills like Brain Age is hard to resist : play a reasonably compelling set of games for a few hours a week , and train your brain to perform better , much in the same way that hitting a gym works for athletes .
And the experience is generally great — for most users , performance numbers do improve .
But a question has lingered over this genre of software like a dark cloud : do these tests actually improve general mental performance , or are you just learning to perform a limited set of drills better ?
To get an answer , a group of researchers in the UK crowdsourced the audience of a science - themed TV show , and set them to work training their brains .
Among that crowd , performance on the specific training exercises shot up , but there was little spillover into even closely related skills .
Because the impact of brain training might be small , the research team involved needed a large population of test subjects .
So they turned to the audience of the TV show Bang Goes The Theory , and asked them to visit a website to participate in the study .
Over 50,000 people responded , and over 11,000 of them actually completed the study .
At the start , participants were given a set of tasks that measured their baseline skills in four areas of mental function : reasoning , verbal short - term memory , spatial working memory , and paired - association learning .
The participants were then split into three groups .
One was asked to log on three times a week and complete a set of drills similar to those seen in brain - training software , including tests of short - term memory , attention , mathematics , and spatial processing .
A second experimental group performed tasks that emphasized more general reasoning skills , like planning and problem - solving quizzes .
The control group was n't trained at all ; they were simply asked to find the answers to trivia questions , and were allowed to use online resources to do so .
After six weeks , the benchmark tests were repeated .
As expected , when it came to the actual tasks that were being trained on , the test scores shot up .
For the two experimental groups , the effects were substantial .
When increases were compared to a baseline of 1.0 , the magnitude of the improvements ranged from 0.67 all the way up to 1.63 .
Even the control group got better at handling trivia questions .
But outside the specific areas of training , things were n't so rosy .
Both experimental groups saw improvements in their test scores over the six - week period , but the authors describe the changes as ranging from " small " to " very small " ( for the latter category , the 95 percent confidence interval generally overlapped with zero , indicating no improvement ) .
Worse still , the control group saw similar improvements — those answering trivia questions actually outperformed the second experimental group by improving in a greater number of categories .
" These results provide no evidence for any generalized improvements in cognitive function following brain training in a large sample of healthy adults , " the authors conclude .
The authors spend a large portion of the paper considering whether their study design is sufficiently similar to the procedures used in brain - training software to draw general conclusions .
Not surprisingly , they argue yes .
The areas they chose to work with overlap with the ones used by software , and their drills did result in significant improvements .
At the same time , their tests of performance are very sensitive , since they 're used diagnostically to check for signs of mental decline in patients with neurological illnesses .
The tests can also pick up subtle changes induced by small doses of drugs .
The paper wraps up with an attempt to put things in perspective .
Over the six weeks involved , the memory drills enabled people to improve handling numbers by a total of three percent .
" Assuming a linear relationship between time spent training and improvement , it would take almost four years of training to remember one extra digit , " the authors argue .
And , more depressingly , the trivia control group improved by two percent .
The one aspect that does n't come up in the discussion is the fact that some people may have jobs or hobbies that rely specifically on the skills that could be improved , like spatial reasoning .
Although it 's obviously beyond the scope of this work , it would seem to be worth testing whether improved scores on these tests would translate to improved performance on real - world activities that incorporate elements of the training .
In any case , if you find brain training enjoyable , there 's certainly no reason to stop , although you should be realistic about your expectations .
And , if you like Trivial Pursuit , it 's probably nice to know that it 's just as effective .

This warrants a new post as far as I ’m concerned , mostly because the original post is getting buried in updates and will soon drop below the fold .
Microsoft has just announced it will support VP8 in HTML5 video in Internet Explorer 9 , but only if the user has the DirectShow filter installed .
Update : Yes , the updates keep on coming .
Zencoder has added support for VP8 .
Update II : Zencoder ’s side project , video.js , offers a player that can fallback between h.264 , OGG and VP8 on most browsers .
Support for Android browsers is underway too .
Update III : The H264 supporters ’ hardware argument for mobile is sounding moot too , since ARM explains on its blog that mobile devices with Cortex - A8 and Snapdragon processors “ will be able to take advantage of WebM ” through those chips ’ NEON SIMD engine .
This is a major shift from what Microsoft said before about HTML5 video in Internet Explorer 9 .
When the company detailed its HTML5 video support , the company was very adamant in that it would go all - in on H264 .
It would be the only video codec supported by Internet Explorer 9 , no matter which codecs the user had installed .
Most likely pressured by the prospect of a VP8 / WebM-only YouTube , Microsoft has now given in .
“ In its HTML5 support , IE9 will support playback of H.264 video as well as VP8 video when the user has installed a VP8 codec on Windows , ” writes Dean Hachamovitch , General Manager , Internet Explorer .
This puts support for VP8 / WebM in Internet Explorer 9 on the same level as support for H264 , with the only caveat being that Windows ships with H264 out of the box , whereas support for VP8 / WebM has to be installed separately by the user .
This leaves only Apple ’s Safari out of the loop .
While Google announced plugins for Gstreamer , and has already made the DirectShow filters available , there ’s no peep yet about QuickTime plugins ( Safari ’s video falls back on whatever QuickTime can decode ) .
It will likely be up to a third party or Apple itself to implement support for VP8 in QuickTime .
Times are getting interesting .
A team of amateur sky watchers has pierced the veil of secrecy surrounding the debut flight of the nation ’s first robotic spaceplane , finding clues that suggest the military craft is engaged in the development of spy satellites rather than space weapons , which some experts have suspected but the Pentagon strongly denies .
Last month , the unmanned successor to the space shuttle blasted off from Florida on its debut mission but attracted little public notice because no one knew where it was going or what it was doing .
The spaceship , known as the X - 37B , was shrouded in operational secrecy , even as civilian specialists reported that it might go on mysterious errands for as long as nine months before zooming back to earth and touching down on a California runway .
In interviews and statements , Pentagon leaders strongly denied that the winged plane had anything to do with space weapons , even while conceding that its ultimate goal was to aid terrestrial war fighters with a variety of ancillary missions .
The secretive effort seeks “ no offensive capabilities , ” Gary E. Payton , under secretary of the Air Force for space programs , emphasized on Friday .
“ The program supports technology risk reduction , experimentation and operational concept development . ”

BOSTON — According to official MLB statistics available as of press time , struggling Red Sox designated hitter David Ortiz is hitting only .200 and has tallied a paltry four home runs and 11 RBIs thus far in 2010 .
Sources close to the team noted that , just FYI , Ortiz is being paid $ 13 million per year to do nothing but hit .
Advertisement
Moreover , as long as sources happen to be on the subject , Ortiz is carrying an on - base percentage of .274 and a slugging percentage of .412 for an OPS of .685 , which ranks him at roughly 60th in the American League .
Basically , witnesses said , this means Ortiz has earned $ 165,214 per hit this season , which is something to think about for sure .
Once again , sources stated , Ortiz only gets paid to hit .
Just hit .
Nothing else .
So those familiar with the Red Sox organization are completely clear , baseball insiders said , the Dodgers ' Andre Ethier is leading the NL with a .385 batting average , has 37 RBIs , and is second in the majors with 11 home runs .
It also bears mentioning , they continued , that he plays a position in the outfield , is a 2009 Silver Slugger Award winner , writes the food blog Dining With ' Dre , and does all of this for $ 7.25 million per year less than David Ortiz .
Advertisement
Sources also confirmed that Milwaukee 's Ryan Braun is right behind Ethier , hitting .359 with 28 RBIs , for only $ 1.3 million , if you can see where sources are going with that .
Personnel close to the Red Sox front office noted yesterday that Ortiz is being paid one - twelfth of the team 's total payroll , adding that they were just saying , is all .
In addition , those who wonder if you can see a trend developing here at all reported that the Texas Rangers , currently in first place in their division , will spend just over $ 55 million on payroll this year , which is only a little more than four times what Ortiz costs Boston .
Advertisement
Flustered Red Sox officials , who are reportedly " very familiar " with these numbers , have on multiple occasions been overheard to say — usually with a fair amount of groaning , sighing , and wall - punching — that there are 12 teams without a single player earning $ 13 million this season , including Pittsburgh , San Diego , Arizona , Oakland , Florida , Cleveland , Washington , Cincinnati , Kansas City , Milwaukee , Tampa Bay , and Baltimore .
And one can't help but notice , sources confirmed , that Tampa Bay is currently in first place in the AL East .
Advertisement
Observers were forced to admit , however , that , okay , so far in May Ortiz has put up an OPS of .999 and has seven RBIs .
But for a $ 24.5 million platoon DH ?
Are you freaking kidding them ?
I mean , baseball insiders said , come on , people : The 2009 American League MVP , Twins catcher Joe Mauer , is earning half a million less than Ortiz , for Christ 's sake .
Advertisement
In addition , and not that it really has anything to do with anything , but damn , they noted , the WNBA team salary cap is $ 775,000 , so by himself Ortiz will earn nearly one and a half times what an entire professional sports league will be paid this year .
And not for nothing , reporters were told , they could n't help noticing that David Ortiz earns $ 12,964,000 more than Uniontown , PA high school history teacher Mark Davis , who , according to students and principal evaluations , is successful and inspiring at his job every single day .

Highly placed baseball officials speaking on condition of anonymity have got to tell you that , if it were their money , they would have fucking cut the guy a year ago .
Three men have been jailed in China 's Fujian province after posting material online on behalf of a woman trying to investigate her daughter 's death .
Fan Yanqiong , Wu Huaying and You Jingyou were found guilty of slander and harming state interests , in a trial which attracted protests outside court .
They had posted videos online in which the woman said her daughter died after being raped by thugs linked to police .
The police had said the woman died due to complications with a pregnancy .
Fan was given a two - year jail term while Wu and You received one year each at the trial in Fuzhou city , said their lawyer , Liu Xiaoyuan .
' Laughable '
Mr Liu said the three men had been helping Lin Xiuying to put pressure on the authorities to reopen the investigation into her daughter 's death in 2008 .
Ms Lin had accused the police of protecting a criminal gang she believed had gang - raped her daughter .
It was not clear who the three were accused of slandering .
" The court said the three people 's actions have seriously affected the interest of the state , which is laughable , " said Mr Liu .
" It infringes on the people 's freedom of speech , which is the legal right of citizens , " he told the Associated Press news agency .
Hundreds of internet users from across China had travelled to Fuzhou to show their support for the activists .
Witnesses said they waved banners and sang songs , while many also blogged from the scene or sent messages through the Twitter micro-blogging site .
China has some 400 million internet users but online material is heavily censored for political and moral content .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai twice threatened to quit politics and join the Taliban if the West continued to pressure him to enact reforms , legislators said Monday .
Karzai issued the threat during a private meeting with Afghan lawmakers on the weekend .
People at the meeting said they thought Karzai 's comments were aimed at hardline members of parliament .
The comment is the latest in a string of outbursts that have drawn criticism from foreign backers .
Last week , Karzai accused the UN and the international community of carrying out a " vast fraud " as part of a plot to deny him re-election .
White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs called the latest Karzai remarks troubling .
" On behalf of the American people , we 're frustrated with the remarks , " he told reporters on Monday .
The comments came to light as Karzai paid a visit to the Kandahar City area south of Kabul .
It was his first visit to the volatile south in almost 15 months .
Karzai criticized for violence
The Afghan president toured one community where dozens of residents died in an explosion several weeks ago .
Local residents said they lived in constant fear and sharply criticized him for not doing enough to stop the violence .
Later , community leaders told Karzai they were worried about NATO 's planned spring offensive , when troops are expected to launch the largest operation in the eight - year - old war against the Taliban .
But Karzai told the local leaders there would n't be an offensive .
" Our partners are here to help , but we run this country as Afghans , " Karzai said .
A U.S. general who was with Karzai at the meeting remained silent .
NATO forces are under intense pressure to minimize civilian casualties , because the deaths of innocents undermine Karzai 's precarious hold on power and boost support for the insurgency .
On Monday , NATO confirmed that international soldiers were responsible for the deaths of five civilians in February , including three women .
NATO also announced Monday that its soldiers killed 10 militants in an early morning raid on a compound near the Pakistani border .
No civilians were harmed , the military organization said .

Arctic non-warming since 1938
The Catlin Arctic Survey arrived at the North Pole this week .
Described as three of ‘ the world ’s toughest ’ explorers , Ann Daniels , Charlie Paton and Martin Hartley reached the Geographic North Pole at on 12th May , ending a grueling 60 - day trek across the floating sea ice of the Arctic Ocean …
They made it with only hours to spare before a Twin Otter plane was scheduled to land on the ice to collect them .
Congratulations to them on completing a difficult journey against the Beaufort Gyre .
They can now compare their Oceanic pH data vs. the non-existent database from past years , and predictably conclude that pH might be lower than it used to be – due to CO2 .
Figure 1 : Beaufort Gyre
The spring melt season continues to eat away at the periphery of the ice pack .
The animation below ( made from Cryosphere Today images ) shows the changes since the first of the month .
Figure 2
As you can see , not much has changed during the last two weeks .
The image below , made from NSIDC images , shows areas of anomalously high extent in green , and anomalously low extent in red .
Figure 3
As in past weeks there is excess ice in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk , and a deficiency in the Barents Sea – which are all always ice free during the summer anyway .
To keep the death spiral in perspective , the image below ( made from Cryosphere Today images ) compares mid-September 30 % concentration ice from the years 2009 and 1990 .
Red shows areas of ice loss since 1990 and green shows areas of ice gain .
I ’m guessing that the Arctic will probably not be ice free by 2013 , as predicted by researchers at the Naval Post - Graduate School .
Figure 4
The image below shows mid-September ice gain from 2007 - 2009 in green , and loss in red .
Figure 5
There continues to be a significant divergence in the extent graphs .
Norsex in red is close to the 30 year mean , while NSIDC ( blue ) DMI ( stippled ) and JAXA ( green ) are closer to two standard deviations from the mean .
The deficiency is almost entirely located in the Barents Sea , as seen above in Figure 3 .
Figure 6
The modified NSIDC image below shows ice loss since early April in red .
Figure 7
The modified NSIDC image below compares April 14 2007 and 2010 ice .
Areas in green have gained ice since 2007 , and areas in red have lost ice since 2007 .
Figure 8
It is still too early in the year to see much interesting .
Still about six weeks before significant melting begins in the interior of the Arctic .
Stay tuned .

Update at this link : Escort tells paper Rekers is homosexual
Comedy Central ’s Stephen Colbert took on prominent anti-gay psychiatrist George Rekers Wednesday night , who was caught by a Miami newspaper taking a ten - day European sojourn with a male escort from RentBoy.com .
Colbert said he was “ applauding ” the anti-gay activist for “ publicly condemning man-love , while privately being man ’s best friend . ”

Referring to Rekers ’ response that he needed the escort to help him carry his luggage , Colbert quipped : “ Technically , I think he was looking for someone to hoist his sack . ”
The late - night comedian even remarked that much of his crew was from RentBoy.com , a site that advertises slender male callboys — “ for rent . ”
Video of Colbert ’s segment appears below .
From RAW STORY ’s earlier report :
A Christian leader and prominent neuro - psychiatrist who co-founded the Family Research Council with evangelist James Dobson took a ten - day European vacation with a callboy he met through RentBoy.com and was caught in an airport with the escort by a Miami newspaper .

The escort said he had met George Rekers , professor of Neuropsychiatry and Behavioral Science at the University of South Carolina , on RentBoy.com .
Rekers , when confronted , did n’t deny that he ’d met the callboy online , but said he had hired him to help him carry his baggage and did n’t learn he was generally hired for “ private company ” until mid-way through his European vacation .
“ I had surgery , ” Rekers told Miami ’s New Times , “ and I ca n’t lift luggage .
That ’s why I hired him . ”
( The paper noted that it did n’t stop him from pushing a “ tottering ” pile of luggage through Miami International Airport . )
More from our earlier report follows .

The callboy , identified by a pseudonym , told the New Times ‘ Penn Bullock and Brandon Thorp that Rekers claim that he did n’t know his “ line of work ” seemed spurious .
“ He should ’ve been able to tell you that , ” he said .
“ But that ’s up to him . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
According to Penn and Thorp , the slender , 20 - year - old escort ’s profile advertises his “ smooth , sweet , tight ass ” and “ perfectly built 8 inch cock . ”
RentBoy.com ’s profiles are not indexed by Google .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ It is clear that Rekers has baggage and certainly needs help , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â said Wayne Besen , a prominent opponent of the “ ex - gay ” movement and director of the nonprofit Truth Wins Out .

The paper printed emails exchanged between the professor and the escort prior to their trip .
Rekers co-founded the conservative and anti-gay Family Research Council with Rev. James Dobson in 1983 .
“ I ’d like to propose another trip to Rome , Italy , for a week or more , ” Rekers purportedly wrote in an Mar. 21 email obtained by New Times .
“ This is so exciting to have a nice Travel Assistant and traveling companion !
Wow !
I ’m so glad I met you . ”
“ I called and talked to the reservation guy in London and reserved a room with two twin beds , ” Rekers allegedly remarked in a later email .
Rekers is a prominent advocate against gays in Florida , where he resides .
He testified against Florida allowing gay couples to adopt , asserting that children of gay couples “ living with a practicing homosexual in the adoptive home , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â are especially Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ vulnerable to psychological damage and an increasing inability to adapt . ”

A commenter on a California Catholic daily , which reported the findings of Rekers ’ investigations into gay adoption , remarked , “ The active principle in these children ’s stress is the fact that their welfare comes in dead last in the homosexual lifestyle – it is oriented toward grooming them for traumatic early sexualization and exploitation by adults . ”
The escort told New Times that Rekers is “ primarily a family man , ” despite their European jaunt .
“ You do n’t understand how much this guy honestly cares about taking care of kids , ” he was quoted as saying .

In the first article of this series , we discussed the problems humans have converting omega - 3 ( n - 3 ) fats from plant sources , such as flax seeds and walnuts , to the longer chain derivatives EPA and DHA .
In the second article , we discussed how excess omega - 6 ( n - 6 ) in the diet can block absorption of omega - 3 , and showed that the modern , Western diet contains between 10 and 25 times the optimal level of n - 6 .
In this article we ’ll discuss strategies for bringing the n - 6 to n- 3 ratio back into balance .
There are two obvious ways to to do this : increase intake of n - 3 , and decrease intake of n - 6 .
Many recommendations have been made for increasing n - 3 intake .
The important thing to remember is that any recommendation for n- 3 intake that does not take the background n- 6 intake into account is completely inadequate .
It ’s likely that the success and failure of different clinical trials using similar doses of EPA and DHA were influenced by differing background intakes of the n - 6 fatty acids .
In the case of the Lyon Diet Heart Study , for example , positive outcomes attributed to ALA may be related in part to a lower n- 6 intake ( which would enhance conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA ) .
This explains why simply increasing intake of n - 3 without simultaneously decreasing intake of n - 6 is not enough .
Bringing n - 3 and n - 6 back into balance : easier said than done !
Let ’s examine what would happen if we followed the proposed recommendation of increasing EPA & DHA intake from 0.1 to 0.65g/d .
This represents going from eating virtually no fish to eating a 4 - oz .
serving of oily fish like salmon or mackerel three times a week .
The average intake of fatty acids ( not including EPA & DHA ) in the U.S. has been estimated as follows :
N - 6 linoleic acid ( LA ) : 8.91 %
N - 6 arachidonic acid ( AA ) : 0.08 %
N - 3 alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) : 1.06 %
Keep in mind from the last article that the optimal ratio of omega - 6 to omega - 3 is estimated to be between 1:1 and 2.3:1 .
Assuming a median intake of n - 6 ( ALA + LA ) at 8.99 % of total calories in a 2,000 calorie diet , that would mean a daily intake of 19.9g of n - 6 .
If we also assume the recommended intake of 0.65g/ d of EPA and DHA , plus an average of 2.35g/d of ALA ( 1.06 % of calories ) , that ’s a total of 3g/d of n - 3 fatty acid intake .
This yields an n - 6 :n - 3 ratio of 6.6:1 , which although improved , is still more than six times higher than the historical ratio ( i.e. 1:1 ) , and three times higher than the ratio recently recommended as optimal ( i.e. 2.3:1 ) .
On the other hand , if we increased our intake of EPA and DHA to the recommended 0.65g/d ( 0.3 % of total calories ) and maintained ALA intake at 2.35g/d , but reduced our intake of LA to roughly 7g/d ( 3.2 % of total calories ) , the ratio would be 2.3:1 – identical to the optimal ratio .
Further reducing intake of n - 6 to less than 2 % of calories would in turn further reduce the requirement for n - 3 .
But limiting n - 6 to less than 2 % of calories is difficult to do even when vegetable oils are eliminated entirely .
Poultry , pork , nuts , avocados and eggs are all significant sources of n - 6 .
I ’ve listed the n - 6 content per 100g of these foods below :
Walnuts : 38.1g
Chicken , with skin : 2.9g
Avocado : 1.7g
Pork , with fat : 1.3g
Eggs : 1.3g
It ’s not too hard to imagine a day where you eat 200g of chicken ( 5.8g n - 6 ) , half an avocado ( 1.1g n - 6 ) and a handful of walnuts ( 10g of n - 6 ) .
Without a drop of industrial seed oils ( like safflower , sunflower , cottonseed , soybean , corn , etc. ) you ’ve consumed 16.9g of n - 6 , which is 7.6 % of calories and far above the limit needed to maintain an optimal n:6 to n:3 ratio .
Check the chart below for a listing of the n - 6 and n - 3 content of several common foods .
Ditch the processed foods and cut back on eating out
Of course , if you ’re eating any industrial seed oils you ’ll be way , way over the optimal ratio in no time at all .
Check out these n- 6 numbers ( again , per 100g ) :
Sunflower oil : 65.7g
Cottonseed oil : 51.5g
Soybean oil : 51g
Sesame oil : 41.3g
Canola oil : 20.3g
Holy moly !
The good news is that few people these days still cook with corn , cottonseed or soybean oil at home .
The bad news is that nearly all processed and packaged foods contain these oils .
And you can bet that most restaurant foods are cooked in them as well , because they ’re so cheap .
So chances are , if you ’re eating foods that come out of a package or box on a regular basis , and you eat out at restaurants a few times a week , you are most likely significantly exceeding the recommended intake of n - 6 .
Two other methods of determining healthy n- 3 intakes
Tissue concentration of EPA & DHA
Hibbeln et al have proposed another method of determining healthy intakes of n - 6 and n - 3 .
Studies show that the risk of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) is 87 % lower in Japan than it is in the U.S , despite much higher rates of smoking and high blood pressure .
When researchers examined the concentration of n - 3 fatty acids in the tissues of Japanese subjects , they found n - 3 tissue compositions of approximately 60 % .
Further modeling of available data suggests that a 60 % tissue concentration of n - 3 fatty acid would protect 98.6 % of the worldwide risk of cardiovascular mortality potentially attributable to n -3 deficiency .
Of course , as I ’ve described above , the amount of n - 3 needed to attain 60 % tissue concentration is dependent upon the amount of n - 6 in the diet .
In the Phillipines , where n- 6 intake is less than 1 % of total calories , only 278 mg /d of EPA & DHA ( 0.125 % of calories ) is needed to achieve 60 % tissue concentration .
In the U.S. , where n- 6 intake is 9 % of calories , a whopping 3.67g/ d of EPA & DHA would be needed to achieve 60 % tissue concentration .
To put that in perspective , you ’d have to eat 11 ounces of salmon or take 1 tablespoon ( yuk ! ) of a high - potency fish oil every day to get that much EPA & DHA .
This amount could be reduced 10 times if intake of n - 6 were limited to 2 % of calories .
At n- 6 intake of 4 % of calories , roughly 2g/d of EPA and DHA would be needed to achieve 60 % tissue concentration .
The Omega - 3 Index
Finally , Harris and von Schacky have proposed a method of determining healthy intakes called the omega - 3 index .
The omega - 3 index measures red blood cell EPA and DHA as a percentage of total red blood cell fatty acids .
Values of > 8 % are associated with greater decreases in cardiovascular disease risk .
( Note that n- 6 intake was not considered in Harris and von Shacky ’s analysis . )
However , 60 % tissue concentration of EPA & DHA in tissue is associated with an omega - 3 index of between 12 - 15 % in Japan , so that is the number we should likely be shooting for to achieve the greatest reduction in CVD mortality .
The omega - 3 index is a relatively new test and is not commonly ordered by doctors .
But if you want to get this test , you can order a finger stick testing kit from Dr. William Davis ’ Track Your Plaque website here .
It ’ll cost you $ 150 bucks , though .
What does it all mean to you ?
These targets for reducing n - 6 and increasing n - 3 may seem excessive to you , given current dietary intakes in the U.S. .
Consider , however , that these targets may not be high enough .
Morbidity and mortality rates for nearly all diseases are even lower for Iceland and Greenland , populations with greater intakes of EPA & DHA than in Japan .
All three methods of calculating healthy n - 3 and n - 6 intakes ( targeting an n - 6: n - 3 ratio of 2.3:1 , 60 % EPA & DHA tissue concentration , or 12 - 15 % omega - 3 index ) lead to the same conclusion : for most people , reducing n- 6 intake and increasing EPA & DHA intake is necessary to achieved the desired result .
To summarize , for someone who eats approximately 2,000 calories a day , the proper n - 6 to n- 3 ratio could be achieved by :
Making no changes to n- 6 intake and increasing intake of EPA & DHA to 3.67g/d ( 11 - oz . of oily fish every day ! )
Reducing n - 6 intake to approximately 3 % of calories , and following the current recommendation of consuming 0.65g/d ( three 4 - oz .
portions of oily fish per week ) of EPA & DHA .
Limiting n- 6 intake to less than 2 % of calories , and consuming approximately 0.35g / d of EPA & DHA ( two 4 - oz . portions of oily fish per week ) .
Although option # 1 yields 60 % tissue concentration of EPA & DHA , I do n’t recommend it as a strategy .
All polyunsaturated fat , whether n- 6 or n - 3 , is susceptible to oxidative damage .
Oxidative damage is a risk factor for several modern diseases , including heart disease .
Increasing n - 3 intake while making no reduction in n - 6 intake raises the total amount of polyunsaturated fat in the diet , thus increasing the risk of oxidative damage .
This is why the best approach is to limit n- 6 intake as much as possible , ideally to less than 2 % of calories , and moderately increase n - 3 intake .
0.35g /d of DHA and EPA can easily be obtained by eating a 4 oz .
portion of salmon twice a week .

A non-random sample of my tech friends shows that not many have heard of memristors ( though I do suspect vote tampering ) .
I 'd read a little about memristors in 2008 when the initial hubbub about the existence of memristors was raised .
I , however , immediately filed them into that comforting conceptual bucket of potentially revolutionary technologies I did n't have to worry about because like most wondertech , nothing would ever come of it .
Wrong .
After watching Finding the Missing Memristor by R. Stanley Williams I 've had to change my mind .
Memristors have gone from " maybe never " to holy cow this could happen soon and it could change everything .
Let 's assume for the sake of dreaming memristors do prove out .
How will we design systems when we have access to a new material that is two orders of magnitude more efficient from a power perspective than traditional transistor technologies , contains multiple petabits ( 1 petabit = 128TB ) of persistent storage , and can be reconfigured to be either memory or CPU in a package as small as a sugar cube ( in a stacked configuration ) ?
I do n't know , but it 's worth thinking about , especially if you want to ride the wave of the next decade 's technological revolution ( Bell 's Law of Computer Classes ) .
If you are looking to get ahead of the next revolution this just might be it .
And as almost always revolutions are based on building a new material based on a fundamental discovery of how the world works .
The memristor is such a material and discovery .
I will do a lot of " not pretending " in this article .
I wo n't pretend I actually understand what memristors are or how they will change everything .
But since the purpose of this blog is to explore scalability issues , I think it 's worth taking a sip or two of the memristor kool - aid and see where it might take us .
A Memristor is Like a Pipe ( seriously )
Here 's a simple analogy defining a memristor from How We Found the Missing Memristor :
A memristor is a pipe that changes diameter with the amount and direction of water that flows through it .
If water flows through this pipe in one direction , it expands ( becoming less resistive ) .
But send the water in the opposite direction and the pipe shrinks ( becoming more resistive ) .
Further , the memristor remembers its diameter when water last went through .
Turn off the flow and the diameter of the pipe ” freezes ” until the water is turned back on .
That freezing property suits memristors brilliantly for computer memory .
The ability to indefinitely store resistance values means that a memristor can be used as a nonvolatile memory .
For a more technical take on how a memristor works watch Finding the Missing Memristor .
The video is excellent .
It has three sections .
The first part of the video recounts the fascinating story of Leon Chua 's discovery of the memristor , the fourth circuit element , in the 1960s .
Williams says Chua is to circuit theory what Albert Einstein is to relativity .
Chua postulated that the memristor existed based on symmetry .
The resistor , capacitor , and inductor existed so there should be a fourth box to fill out the square .
I imagine the process something like how missing elements in the periodic table were predicted to exist by looking at gaps in the table .
A fifth Cylon was also predicted , but that turned out to be a completely different show .
At this point the memristor was still theoretical .
What was needed was a blue fairy to bring this Pinocchio to life .
That part in the story is played William and is the subject of the next part of the video which details how Williams and his team at HP Labs not only invented a working memristor , but also took the next step and invented a system architecture for making real field deployable products .
The third section is a mind blowing exploration of what applications might be possible using memristors .
It Replaces RAM , Flash and Disk
Memristors are nano devices that remember information permanently , switch in nanoseconds , are super dense , and power efficient .
That makes memristors potential replacements for DRAM , flash , and disk .
Williams projects that we 'll reach the end of our ability to scale RAM , flash , and disk in the next few years .
Fortunately for us the memristor is here to save the day :-)
Memristors have the power and speed of the DRAM cell and the ( potential ) lifetime of a hard disk .
Currently the memristor has a lifetime greater than flash , but they are working to extend that .
In five years memristors could completely replace DRAM and disk and eventually CDs and DVDs .
It is a universal non-volatile memory .
The characteristics of memristors are such that you have to rethink the whole compute and storage paradigm .
How will it change your designs if you can have large enough amounts of SRAM like storage on the microprocessor such that you do n't need DRAM ?
What if you can put huge amounts of storage near the processor and have enough bandwidth to exchange huge amounts of data ?
All at low power ?
Yet , until memristors are many times more durable , they can never replace DRAM and SRAM , they will become a flash only replacement .
It Requires Change
People love progress but they hate change .
Memristors require change .
They are not a plug compatible technology .
You can't just drop a memristor chip or RAM module into an existing system and have it work .
It will take a system redesign .
The question is when will the pain point in industry be sufficient to cause a migration to a new technology ?
It 's hard to tell as the competition will be fierce , but maybe we 'll see memristors first used in a relatively standalone next generation product , like a new smart phone that will leapfrog the iPhone .
It will be difficult to compete with Apple , Google , Amazon or other entrenched players while playing on an even field , so someone will definitely be eager to throw in a little disruptive technology into the mix to see what shakes loose .
It is Big
How much storage are we talking about on a single chip ?
With an invention they hail as important as the memristor is a new architecture that allows the stacking of multiple crossbar memories on top of each other .
This allows multiple petabits of memory ( 1 petabit = 128TB ) to be addressed in one square centimeter of space .
To get a feel for how much memory this is consider 1 terabyte is equal to 128 DVDs or 250,000 4 Meg images .
We are talking about a lot of power efficient storage in a very little space .
Just in time to handle new machine generated data sets that will blow away today 's largest data warehouses .
It Computes
So far this is a good market , own the memory hierarchy .
But wait , there 's more !
Memristors are not just stuck in they past , they do n't just remember , they can perform logic !
I find this completely strange .
We 're not used to our memory also acting like a CPU .
But it turns out memristors naturally implement something called material implication logic , which can be interconnected to create any logical operation , much the same way NAND gates were used to build early supercomputers because they were easier to build .
Williams addresses the functional completeness problem in the video by showing how NAND can be derived from material implication and false .
How this works I 'm not completely sure , but it is a sufficient basis for executing programs and that 's what matters .
So what we have now is a material that can be dynamically configured on the fly to act as either memory or CPU .
It Flattens the CPU Memory Hierarchy Divide
With memristors you can decide if you want some block to be memory , a switching network , or logic .
Williams claims that dynamically changing memristors between memory and logic operations constitutes a new computing paradigm enabling calculations to be performed in the same chips where data is stored , rather than in a specialized central processing unit .
Quite a different picture than the Tower of Babel memory hierarchy that exists today .
It Learns
They are also exploring the emulation of brains because the properties of the memristor apparently mimic neurons and can learn without supervision .
Synapses and axons are both effectively memristors .
I have a feeling the brain is a little more complicated than that , neurons are n't just analog devices , they are essentially little molecular computers , but it 's a fascinating direction .
It Talks Using Light
The kryptonite for large pools of storage is moving chunks of data around fast enough so cooperative work can be done .
The performance bottleneck is in the interconnects , when data has to flow over wires .
To get around the tyranny of the wire HP is working on an optical backplane using photonic interconnects .
Every time a bit has to travel more than a 100 microns it will travel as a pulse of light .
Over the next 10 years they project memristors + on chip photonic interconnects will improve the overall computational throughput of a computer system by two orders of magnitude per unit of power , far outpacing what Moore 's law and transistors can accomplish .
It Does n't Exist
Yes , there 's a lot of hype about memristors , but there also seems to be a lot of confidence memristors will be real viable products .
But for now they do n't exist .
And we do n't know a lot about memristors : unit cost ; IO /s per device ; performance on sequential / random access operations and read / write loads ; reliability ; error rates ; ease of system integration ; persistence lifetime ; ease of programming ; access times ; instructions per clock cycle ; power use ; density .
There 's a lot we do n't know yet , but I 'm cautiously optimistic , especially if you are looking to what 's next on the horizon .
HP can already make memristors that beat Flash : lower power , more durable , smaller , and faster .
And it 's still early days .
What Can We Do With These
Things ?
People much smarter than myself will figure out how to really use these things , but a few possibilities do come to mind .
It 's not easy to project the impact of memristors beyond the obvious because memristors challenge our common sense notion of system costs and capabilities .
We are used to managing for scarcity , but with memristors we have material abundance .
It may take a different way of thinking to fully exploit memristors .
An example in how our thinking often has to change with new technologies is the use of sharded counters to reduce write contention when scaling on a BigTable type infrastructure .
No doubt memristors will require more profound changes .
In Distributed Computing Economics Jim Gray lays out a model for thinking about the components of a distributed system , the cost of each component , and how their ratios and relative costs can be used to guide architecture decisions .
The components in the model are : networking , computation , database access , and database storage .
Mr. Gray discusses problems in terms of the size of the network input , the size of the network output , the amount of CPU required for a computation , and the required bandwidth .
For example , the ideal mobile task , because of restricted bandwidth in a mobile network , is a problem that requires small network inputs , small network outputs , and lots of CPU .
The examples given are cryptographic search and Monte Carlo simulations .
SETI uses a petabyte of network bandwidth at a cost of about $ 1 million to access $ 1 billion of “ free ” CPU for a ComputeCost : NetworkCost ratio of 10,000:1 .
This is a good deal because SETI is so compute intensive .
Web apps tend to be network or state intensive so wo n't work as mobile applications .
More examples are given of different workloads .
The conclusion is :
Put the computation near the data .
The recurrent theme of this analysis is that on - demand computing is economical only for very CPU - intensive ( 100,000 instructions per byte or a CPU - day - per- gigabyte of network traffic ) applications .
Pre -provisioned computing is likely to be more economical for most applications — especially data - intensive ones .
The problem is without a commercially available device it can't be clear how to characterize system components or assign costs , but can we still make a guess how memristor based devices would fit into Mr Gray 's model ?
With petabits of persistent storage , colocated CPU and data , configurable numbers of dedicated CPUs , fast on device communication , presumably fast inter - device communication , and slow WAN communication , we have what appears to be the equivalent of a largish cluster in a sugar cube sized device , maybe a data center will fit in the form factor of a brick .
Without the high speed high bandwidth interconnects though these devices will stay relatively specialized because otherwise we wo n't be able to service high request loads .
A big concern is we have no feel for the latency characteristics of these devices .
Many applications are highly latency sensitive , so their latency characteristics will have a big impact .
So it seems like we 'll have an all purpose device that can handle small to large data input sizes , small to large output sizes , and small to large computational demands .
But we still have the slow WAN divide .
Many of the techniques for bridging data centers will still survive , but what will be different is that the size of the problems that can fit on a single system will grow immensely .
This is the ultimate scale - up solution to scaling woes .
Designing for memristors may be a bit like the radical shift in our sense of space , time and causality that accompanied the move from classical Newtonian physics to the relativistic quantum perspective of Modern physics .
Our common sense notions of classical physics dissolve and are replaced by what ?
What will systems and algorithms look like when our core assumptions have shifted so radically ?
RAM is the New Disk
This is an obvious one .
Even before 2006 , when Jim Gray declared RAM is the new disk , many latency sensitive applications had moved their databases into RAM .
The reasons are obvious : RAM is fast , disk is slow , disk is effectively sequential , RAM is random , RAM is colocated with the CPU , disk is far away .
The largest amount of RAM you can get on Amazon 's EC2 is 68.4 GB .
Systems capable of 128GB of RAM are now common and inexpensive .
For a price 256GB , 512GB and even 1TB RAM systems are available today .
And if you have Mariana Trench deep pockets a 128TB monster system can be yours .
So if your database fits in available RAM or can be partitioned across multiple boxes , and there 's enough processing power to handle your app , and there 's enough bandwidth to move all your data around , then RAM can already be your new disk .
What has kept in - memory databases from taking over the world of database management ?
Often problems are simply larger than than can fit in RAM , so a scale - out approach is required , and disk is by far the cheapest source of mass storage .
And if you optimize for disks relatively fast streaming speeds , as do algorithms like MapReduce , then very large , well performing systems can be built on disk .
Not so useful for low latency applications however .
RAM is also still expensive in large quantities , you also require double the number of systems for redundancy , and for a lot of people it 's just too different .
Petabits of persistent memory storage attack these weaknesses and make in - memory databases a compelling value proposition .
At this point why would you not want to keep your database in - memory ?
Well , what we do n't know about these systems is greater than what we know , what is the real : cost per GB , size , power usage , sequential read and write speed , random read and write speed , persistence life time , IO/s , clock cycles per instruction ?
But if these parameters come in as hoped then the face of application architectures will truly change .
RAM , flash , and disk are all unified and all databases are effectively in memory .
That would change things up and level the technological playing field .
You would n't have to be Google to implement truly large systems .
Locality is King
The is somewhat obvious too and revolves around the idea that when networks are expensive moving your computation close to storage is the optimal architecture .
Again Jim Gray makes the world clear , from Distributed Computing Economics :
Today there is rough price parity between ( 1 ) one database access , ( 2 ) ten bytes of network traffic , ( 3 ) 100,000 instructions , ( 4 ) 10 bytes of disk storage , and ( 5 ) a megabyte of disk bandwidth .
This has implications for how one structures Internet - scale distributed computing : one puts computing as close to the data as possible in order to avoid expensive network traffic .
That 's 2006 .
As early as 2003 , in this ACM Queue article , Mr. Gray predicted :
Something that I ’m convinced of is that the processors are going to migrate to where the transducers are .
Thus , every display will be intelligent ; every NIC will be intelligent ; and , of course , every disk will be intelligent .
I got the “ smart disk ” religion from you , Dave .
You argued that each disk will become intelligent .
Today each disk has a 200 - megahertz processor and a few megabytes of RAM storage .
That ’s enough to boot most operating systems .
Soon they will have an IP interface and will be running Web servers and databases and file systems .
Gradually , all the processors will migrate to the transducers : displays , network interfaces , cameras , disks , and other devices .
This will happen over the next decade .
It is a radically different architecture .
Transducers change data in some way .
Functions running on processors implement the transducer logic .
So data must be fed to processors .
Processors are so fast they spend most of their time waiting on RAM , moving data across a network to feed a processor would be a complete waste .
So you want your data as close to the processor as possible in order to get the most throughput for the least cost .
We 've seen this trend take root over the years .
To scale , Google stores data across an uncountable number of disks using a distributed file system .
Their storage problem is solved , but how will Google perform calculations on all that data ?
They could have a compute grid in which a cluster of CPUs run programs that access records over a distributed file system .
This approach brings all that data over the network , which is what we want to avoid .
So Google invented MapReduce .
What MapReduce does is move computations in the form of code to the nodes where the data is stored .
So the " transducers " are running as close as they can to the data stored on disk .
Only after the data has been filtered and manipulated does the data cross the network for further processing .
While Mr. Gray 's vision of transducers everywhere has n't come true yet , we do see signs of it happening with the advent of flash storage .
Flash is so fast it stops making sense to seek data on a flash device , move it to the CPU , run a computation , and write back the result .
Why not ship the function down to the flash devices and have the flash run the computation ?
This is a scenario contemplated by the folks at RethinkDB , who are building a database specifically optimized for SSD .
In - memory databases are of course the ultimate example of moving computation to the data .
The CPU has fast access to the RAM .
No waiting for disks at all .
With memristors , and let 's just say we now are using the memristors only as storage , we now have very large quantities of data directly accessible to the CPU .
This effectively cuts out the need for MapReduce at a low granularity .
Now let 's take advantage of the fact the memristors can be configured as CPUs .
This is as close as computation and data can possibly get .
Applying Functions to Data in Parallel
Bradford Cross from Flightcaster spoke recently at a Hadoop Meetup .
He talked candidly and in some detail about their experiences trying to use Hadoop , Cascade , and other technologies to implement flight prediction algorithms .
At the end of the talk Bradford said one thing that really stuck with me , in summary he said all they are trying to do is apply functions to data , it should n't be this hard .
When I look at memristor 's ability to dynamically configure memory and logic devices on the fly , what I see is the perfect device for applying functions to data in massively parallel configurations .
The potential for exploiting parallelism here is awesome .
As an example , let 's consider the movie Avatar , a completely digital movie which reportedly requires over 1 petabyte of storage .
I do n't know if a movie of this type is still chunked up in frames , maybe it 's just one time varying equation these days , but let 's say it 's still a series of a certain number of frames per second .
Processing that amount of data would take a good size cluster .
Now let 's imagine laying each frame in one long array .
Interestingly , the preferred data structure for scientific data is the array .
Each of the array cells is effectively parallelized .
Now lets place transforms for each frame in series for each array cell .
The first transform would operate on the frame and transform it in place , or maybe write it someplace new , then the next transform operates , and so on .
You 've just transformed the entire petabyte of movie frames in the snap of a finger .
All those frames can be processed in parallel because you effectively have a dedicated CPU per frame and the CPU is colocated with the data .
In my mind programs become much more geometric , much more structural in nature .
More like laying ASICs across a space than logically coupling functions via a message bus .
Applications are currently seek limited .
By shifting to a closer faster RAM solution the potential is to make applications CPU limited , but with the ability create CPUs and operate them in parallel we should not be CPU limited either .
I 'm the opposite of an algorithms guru , but it seems to me there will be a great need to invent efficient algorithms that take advantage of the special properties of memristors .
An algorithm like dynamic programming , which is a popular problem solving approach that solves complex problems by breaking them down into simpler steps , might really benefit from being implemented on memristors .
Is this how memristors really work ?
I 'm not sure , but I have n't seen anything that says that 's not how they work and that 's how they appear to work to me .
And if they work this way the potential is amazing .
Let your imagination run a little .
Imagine , for example , running an image recognition algorithm on all your images at once .
And you know AI has to figure in here somewhere .
There 's a new trend in Machine Learning called Deep Learning , which moves us one step closer to AI , that uses dense matrix operations operating on hundreds of millions of variables .
Sounds like something memristors might make manageable .
Another interesting angle to think about is shown in Comparing genomes to computer operating systems in terms of the topology and evolution of their regulatory control networks .
They compare the transcriptional regulatory network of bacterium with call graph of the Linux kernel .
Other than being just cool , it showed that human generated code changes more at the bottom of the call graph than at the top .
The bacterium changed more at the top than at the bottom .
Human thinking works top down , emphasizing reusability , biology works bottom up , emphasizing robustness .
Will long lived programs in a materially abundant world shift more towards the biological model ?
A Better FPGA ( Field Programmable Gate Array )
This is also an easy call , given the ability of memristors to act as CPUs .
Currently the processor hierarchy moving from most specialized to most general looks like : ASIC ( Application Specific Integrated Circuits ) , FPGA , microprocessor .
For a great talk on how memristors can implement FPGA like devices take a look at the video Hybrid CMOS - Memristor Reconfigurable Logic .
ASICs directly wire logic into hardware .
Your 10 Gigabit ethernet interface , for example , will be a specially designed ASIC because a general microprocessor wo n't be fast enough and it will cost too much at volume .
ASICs are completely designed for one purpose and one purpose only , they can't do anything else .
Of all options ASICs are the fastest , densest , lowest power , have the highest upfront cost , and the cheapest per unit cost .
But if you make just one little mistake your ASIC will have to be respun at considerable time and expense .
This is a startup killer .
Get your ASICs wrong and you are dead , which is why VCs like funding software , it 's safer .
Microprocessors are the most general option .
They interpret instructions step by step as dictated by a program .
Microprocessors are universal so the cost can be spread out over many units , they are the least dense so they take a lot of space , and they use the most power .
But their flexibility makes them the most practical option for system designers , even though you would rather not use them if you did n't have to .
As a system designer you want low cost , high integration , and low power usage , but this is beyond the capability of the small guy so microprocessors are the default option in many cases .
For example , if you are making a sprinkler system controller that uses wifi for networking , most of your expense will be in the separate components parts , which raises the price out of reach of a mass market .
This is the primary reason most consumer products suck .
To get them cheap enough so that people will buy and still leave a healthy profit margin you have to design dirt cheap and dirt stupid systems .
FPGAs occupy a middle ground .
FPGAs are a collection of gates and that can be selectively connected by programming to build processors and custom hardware .
Once programmed computations run fast .
Using FPGAs it 's possible to build parallel hardware that produces high parallel throughput .
FPGAs are flexible and efficient .
They are attractive for a lot of applications and are less dense than ASICs because 90 % of logic is in the programmable interconnect .
Compared to CMOS , a technology used for constructing microprocessors , memristors can be made far denser , and they can be stacked .
Compared to FPGAs memristors can be made two orders of magnitude denser .
Once upon a time I worked on an ATM switch where the key idea was to create blades that had FPGAs which were programmed on the fly to support different interface flavors .
It was a really good idea .
It would make so many things simpler and save the immense risk and expense of developing a series of ASICs .
Unfortunately it did n't really work .
FPGAs were slow to program and the blades were still expensive .
It was more cost effective to commit the capex upfront to design and build special purpose ASICs and separate boards around them .
Will memristors shift the capex to opex equation in the same way we 've seen the cloud flip the capex of buying machines upfront to the opex of leasing on demand ?
Will memristors make it possible to make highly integrated devices that have fewer component parts and use lower power ?
If the technology holds true , it could revolutionize how embedded systems are built .
Low Power Sensors
Building on the previous section which played with the idea that memristors could be used to build highly integrated low power devices without the risk and expense of creating ASICs , if this were true it could finally usher in the era of sensors .
Currently sensor devices are too big , too expensive , ca n't communicate worth a dang , and use too much power .
Until we find a new way to build sensors the promise of sensor technology will remain unfulfilled .
But watch out if we can unite supercapacitors , energy scavenging , low power devices , and high component integration ( do I really need a separate wifi chip ? ) .
Sensors will explode .
Hardware Piracy
An interesting implication is that once hardware moves into the digital domain we 'll have the same copyright and theft issues that we have with music and other valuable digital data .
If I can read your memristor device I can simply recreate your designs on my own device .
This is both good and bad in the complicated and confusing way all these issues are .
I 'd hate to get a DMCA take down notice on my smart grid :-)
Evolution of Control Structures
Ninety - five percent of DNA was once thought to be junk .
Now we know what junk DNA are really controls for turning on and off genes , often in response to external environmental events .
Genes are really just data whose expression is under the control of other sections of DNA .
Does n't it make you think that if evolution has focussed 95 % of DNA on control that it might be important ?
We do n't think about control that much .
We focus all our efforts on data .
I do n't know how , but in my gut I think the memristor could shift the computing emphasis as much to control as data .
And no , I do n't really know what that means .
The Ambient Cloud
In Building Super Scalable Systems : Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud I developed the concept of the Ambient Cloud as an execution platform running on top of a massively distributed collection of compute resources constructed from wherever they can be found .
Without an independent cloud infrastructure developers will have to align themselves with major vendors in order to planet scale .
Memristors make the Ambient Cloud even more attractive as the resources available on an internet of memristor devices will be truly staggering .
Writing applications on top of that infrastructure will give developers a very low cost structure and the ability to build planet scale applications , all while staying independent and capable of attacking new opportunities .
That 's truly inspiring .

e Bay seller “ bflash ” is selling a veritable Flash Museum on eBay .
In what he has dubbed the World ’s Largest Flash Collection , he has for sale over 300 rare Flash items , some of which I was n’t aware even existed .
bflash breaks it down for us :
When you think about the large Superman , Batman or even Wonder Woman collections and items that are out there , then you consider how few Flash items there are , it ’s pretty amazing to think that there are over 250 separate and “ Flash - only ” pieces here and available all at once .
This collection has been amassed over 40 years .
Each decade and era of the character are represented : 1940 ’s , 50’s , 60’s , 70’s , 80 ’s , 90 ’s and now .
Let ’s take a look at this massive lot :
* Click on the thumbnail to see a larger image *
Quite the amazing haul .
The Buy It Now price is $ 12,500.00 and the starting bid is $ 1,000 with a Reserve in place .
When a eBay seller puts a Reserve on an auction it means that the sale item has to reach a certain amount before it can actually be called yours .
bflash notes that the Buy It Now price is much less than the reserve , and well worth it :
Along with the expected toys , action figures and posters , there are several “ very high value ” items included : a 1942 Pinback ( excellent ) , a 1961 Vissari Halloween costume ( MIB ) , a 1946 Wheaties Giveaway Comic ( Fine – Very Fine ) , a 1965 Ben Cooper Halloween Costume ( MIB ) , a 1967 Hasbro Justice League – Flash board game ( MINT ) and Kenner Super Powers Prototypes and “ test shot ” , just to name a few .
Also , in the collection are items from the 1989 - 91 TV show – scripts , cast and crew items and advertising pieces .
These sought - after items more than justify the Buy It Now price .
Personally I have my eye on that Tiger Flash LCD Video Game from the early nineties , but unfortunately he does not sell items individually .
The entire collection has to be purchased all at once and the Buy It Now price of 12 k does not include shipping , although he does offer Local Pick Up. Glen Antonio had an idea about Flash collectors teaming up to purchase it and divvying up the loot accordingly .
Who ’s down ?
There is a complete list of the items on the auction page and a rough youtube video of the collection HERE .
The auction ends in 4 days and 19 hours so that gives us a little time to have a yard sale and take out a second mortgage on the house .
I would seriously have to sell every item in my Flash Collection just to afford this and that might not even be enough .
If one of you guys ends up buying this , please let me know .
I ’m desperate for that Tiger Game .
Good Luck bidders and Keep it Flashy ,

It seems that every game brings another milestone for New Jersey Devils ’ goalie Martin Brodeur .
Tonight was no different .
Brodeur won his 600th game , stopping 19 shots to blank the Atlanta Thrashers , 3 - 0 .
Brodeur ’s shutout was the ninth of the season and 110th of his career .
It was the goalie ’s second consecutive shutout .
The team defeated the Carolina Hurricanes , 4 - 0 , Saturday night .
“ I knew I had a chance to hit it [ 600 wins ] , but the big one was 552 and now everything is gravy , just kind of raise the bar for everybody else , ” Brodeur said .
“ I play a lot of games , so they expect you to win if you want to do well here in New Jersey . ”
Dean McAmmond opened the scoring at 15:18 of the first period .
McAmmond worked a give and go with Dainius Zubrus , dropping a pass in the right circle and heading toward the net .
Zubrus put a backhanded shot on net , and McAmmond tipped it past goalie Johan Hedberg for his seventh goal of the season .
Zach Parise upped the Devils lead to two 51 seconds into the second period .
Defenseman Paul Martin fired a shot on net from the point .
Parise , stationed at the front of the net , tipped the shot past Hedberg ’s glove for his 37th goal of the year .
Travis Zajac increased the lead to three 10 seconds into the period .
Zajac won the opening faceoff and sent the puck to Martin Skoula .
Skoula ’s pass sent Zajac into the Thrasher ’s zone on a 2 - on - 1 with Parise .
Zajac took a shot that beat Hedberg through the pads for his 24th goal of the season .
Tonight ’s game also marked the first time Ilya Kovalchuk visited Phillips Arena since his trade to the Devils .
Kovalchuk and defenseman Anssi Salmela were sent to the Devils for Niclas Bergfors , Johnny Oduya and prospect Patrice Cormier .
After the trade , Thrasher ’s general manager Don Waddell revealed Kovalchuk declined offers of 12 years , $ 101 million and seven years , $ 70 million .
Fans held signs saying “ You lie ! ” and “ Kovalbum ” .
The left - winger was booed on his first shift , and the fans booed him every time he touched the puck .
“ It was funny with all the signs , ” Brodeur said .
“ I said to him , ‘ People either like you or hate you here . ’
He had some , ‘ I love you ’ and some ‘ I hate you . ’
I was laughing bit . ”
Devils coach Jacques Lemaire could tell Kovalchuk was nervous .
“ He was a little nervous .
I could sense that , ” Lemaire said of Kovalchuk .
“ That ’s why I did n’t start him .
It would not have been good for him . ”
“ Half the fans were booing , half were cheering , ” Kovalchuk said .
“ That ’s nice .
It happens all the time . ”
Kovalchuk failed to record a shot on goal and was held off the scoresheet in the victory .
With the win , the Devils clinched home - ice advantage in the first round .
With Pittsburgh ’s 6 - 3 loss to Washington , New Jersey moved into sole possession of the second seed in the Eastern Conference and first in the Atlantic Division .
Atlanta ’s loss put an end to their fading playoff hopes .
The 10 - year old franchise has missed the playoffs nine times .
Game Notes :
Three of McAmmond ’s seven goals this season have come against the Atlanta Thrashers … Pierre - Luc Letourneau - Leblond picked up an assist on the first goal .
It was only his second point in 25 games this season … Devils ’ defenseman Mike Mottau missed the game to rest .
Rookie defenseman Mark Fraser played in his place .

Even though casualties are rising in fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno - Karabakh , the two sides are resisting pressure to start talks to end the latest round of conflagrations over the disputed South Caucasus region .
Four days after a decades - long territorial dispute prompted the heaviest fighting between Azerbaijan ’s military and Armenian - backed forces in years , Yerevan and Baku continue to accuse one another of being responsible for the war .
The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that Armenia continued shelling the city of Terter , located along the contact line in Karabakh .
“ Units of the Armenian Armed Forces have been conducting artillery shelling of the city of Terter , ” it said .
“ According to preliminary information , some damage was done to civilian infrastructure , there are injuries . ”
Put another way , 1 in every 8 Americans uses a food bank to make ends meet , the survey said .
More than one - third of those surveyed said they would not have been able to pay for basics like rent , utilities and medical care without relying on food banks to offset the cost of their meals — and more than a third said at least one person in their household was working .
“ It is not just the unemployed that are going hungry , ” said Vicki B. Escarra , chief executive of Feeding America .
Wal - Mart began taking on hunger as a cause in 2005 , when it distributed 9.9 million pounds of food to food banks ; last year , it provided 116.1 million pounds of food .
The company also has donated the services of its staff to help food banks improve lighting and refrigeration and develop ways to increase the amount of fresh food on their shelves .
“ We ’ve learned a lot about this problem and the kinds of things we can do to help , ” Ms. McKenna said .
“ We ’ve learned , for instance , that there is a huge gap in terms of the protein and fresh produce that food banks can deliver , so we ’ve learned how to fast - freeze things like meat and dairy .
You ca n’t put 100 pounds of bananas on a truck that is n’t refrigerated and expect them to be edible for long . ”
Almost one - third of the food Wal - Mart is donating this year will be fresh , and one of the first cash gifts out of the new grant will go to increasing the number of refrigerated trucks delivering food to food banks .
“ These are the types of resources we do n’t get much from other sources , ” Ms. Escarra said .

The headaches signaling destruction of your brain cells have ceased after you finally ditched your portable phones , cell phone , Bluetooth and wireless routers and disabled your wireless laptop , Kindle and iPad .
And everyone on your block 's resting easier after stopping that new cell tower from going in down the street .
So why are you still microwaving your meals ?
Just because these drastic devices are found everywhere does not make them safe .
Over 90 % of American homes use microwave ovens to hurry preparation of fresh and processed meals .
Along with cell phones , portable phones and wireless routers , the regular hum of microwave ovens bathes nearly every household in North America with pulsating waves of electro magnetism that drown the subtle electro - chemical whisperings within and between our tissues and cells .

It 's not smart to repeatedly zap these fundamental electrical exchanges of life - energy and thought .
Often built - in on top of stoves , the invisible emissions from a microwave oven radiate at head level .
Aging door seals leak microwaves , while electromagnetic fields ( EMF ) bypass built - in shielding to irradiate rooms .
Canadian EMF radiation specialist Chris Anderson has measured emissions from the modern ( and no longer used ) microwave oven in his kitchen in a bedroom more than 30 feet away .
He freaks out when he sees pictures of children pressing their faces to the glass watching genetically modified popcorn pop .

Dr. Edward Fujimoto has also gone on network TV urging viewers to avoid microwaving food in plastic containers ; as well as meals like TV dinners , instant ramen and soups in plastic - coated packages .
Do n't pour boiling water into them , either .
Food fats , high heat and plastics release dioxins into food .
Just a smidge less catastrophic than plutonium ( the deadliest poison on this planet ) , dioxins of Agent Orange infamy cause birth deformities in pregnant women and cancer in just about everyone else - especially breast cancer in women whose lymphatic waste eliminators are also shut down by eating microwaved food .

Saran wrap and its imitators also drip chemicals into microwaved food that can cause cancer and sterility .
This was known 10 years ago , when 10th grader Claire Nelson teamed with the FDA - affiliated National Center for Toxicological Research in Arkansas .
Testing four different plastic wraps , Nelson and her scientist helpers found DEHA migrating into microwaved food at levels 10,000 - times FDA permissible levels .
They also identified Xenoestrogens being released from microwaved plastic wraps into food and the people eating it .
Xenoestrogens are linked to breast cancer in women and plunging sperm counts in men .
[ Options May /00 ]
The FDA ignored their findings .
Even though the chemical DEHA used to make plastic flexible is officially considered a carcinogen , the federal corporate protectors have carefully avoided studying the effects of microwave cooking on plastic - wrapped food .
Which must be why a typical online recipe urges : " Wrap peeled or unpeeled sweet potatoes loosely in plastic wrap and microwave 10 to 15 minutes or until tender . "
PLASTIC PEOPLE
Even microwaving bare - naked vegetables is dangerous .
Once upon a time quite recently , 20 volunteers divided into two groups fasted for 10 days before eating the same foods .
The only difference was the veggies eaten by one group were steamed ; the others microwaved .
After 10 days , stool samples were taken .
Group A had normal poop .
The microwave munchers in Group B produced some truly weird shit - with a " plastic texture " .
Medical scans showed the enzymes and proteins in the microwaved food they 'd consumed so molecularly disfigured , they could neither be recognized nor absorbed by their bodies .
Ultrasound analysis of 10 troubled tummies also showed plastic particles from the plastic - walled microwave ovens stuck to all 10 colons !

The CDC estimates 1.4 million salmonella cases occur there annually , killing at least 600 people .

It turns out that just like modern cell and portable phones , microwave ovens operate at 2.45 Gigahertz .
This means that the electromagnetic waves from these appliances whip every cell within range back - and - forth 2.45 billion times every second .

No cell membrane can withstand such wicked whiplash .

From 1957 until the end of the Cold War , Soviet researchers analyzing microwaved foods kept finding very strange molecules .
They learned that :
· Microwaving meat causes formation of a well - known carcinogen .
· Microwaving milk and cereal grains converts some of their amino acids into carcinogens .
· Thawing frozen fruits converts their nutrition into carcinogenic substances .
· Extremely short exposure of raw , cooked or frozen vegetables converts their plant alkaloids into
carcinogens .
Russian researchers also discovered decreased nutritional values up to 90 % in all foods tested .
Any remaining vitamins and essential minerals became indigestible .
Adding to their growing panic , the molecular alterations in microwaved food also cause the lymphatic system to malfunction , sharply reducing the ability of the body to protect itself against the cancerous growth triggered by microwave cooking .
Digestive and excretory systems also spasm , trying to deal with unnatural substances never encountered during three - millions years of hominid evolution .

The first food deliberately microwaved in the USA was popcorn .
The second blew egg all over an experimenter 's face .
On October 8 , 1945 Raytheon filed the first U.S. patent for Spencer 's microwave cooking process .
The prototype sold to restaurants was called the Radarange .
It stood nearly six feet tall , weighed 670 pounds , and sold for the equivalent of $ 20,000 in today 's dollars .
In 1967 , Raytheon introduced the first countertop domestic microwave oven .
It cooked hamburgers in 35 seconds flat , and cost around $ 3,100 in today 's equivalent dollars .
By 1975 , sales of microwave ovens in the USA exceeded those of gas ranges .
More than three decades later , microwave madness continues to sweep American households .

BRAINWIPED
If people around you are acting brain damaged , it 's because they are .
Nearly 50 years ago , Russian scientists discovered " brainwave disturbance " in " persons exposed to microwave emission fields . "
Within minutes , this electromagnetic interference leads to memory loss and inability to concentrate .
Depression , " incoherent thoughts " and interrupted sleep often follow .
But what really blew their minds was that eating microwaved food also " shorts out " electrical impulses in the brain and de-magnetizes brain tissue - leading to the same memory loss and attention disorders , increased irritability , depression , disconnected thoughts and sleep disturbances sparked by microwave fields .
The Russians further found that the resulting " degeneration and circuit breakdowns of electrical nerve impulses " from microwaves and microwaved food also occurs in the central and autonomic nervous systems that govern virtually every activity in the human body .
Reporting their clinical findings in 1975 , scientist I.R. Luria sealed the fate of microwave ovens throughout Mother Russia when he noted how " these effects can cause virtually irreversible damage to the neuro - electrical integrity of the various components of the nervous system . "
After thoroughly roasting microwave ovens , Dr. Luria concluded : " Ingestion of microwaved foods is clearly contraindicated in all respects . " [ " Radiation Ovens : The Proven Dangers of Microwaves " by Anthony Wayne and Lawrence Newell , lawgiver.org ; " The Hidden Dangers of Microwave cooking " by Samantha Gilman ]
The Soviet Union banned microwave ovens in 1976 .
( The life - saving prohibition lasted until the late 1980's , when communism morphed into consumerism under Gorbachev .

So what the fudge is happening to microwaved food ?
When a microwave oven violently vibrates food and water molecules apart - and then randomly fuses bits back together , the bizarre new compounds scream " Alien invaders ! " to any body ingesting them .
This is why broccoli cooked in a microwave not only loses up to 97 % of its cancer - fighting antioxidants - but also triggers a sharp spike in cholesterol .
Intended to shield tissues from compounds no longer recognizable as food , this " bad " cholesterol combines with junk food - fueled obesity to produce America 's Number
One terrorist killer : Heart disease .

[ Science News Apr 25/92 ; Pediatrics Apr/92 ]
At the same time , an RN trained in Level Three Neonatal ICU reported attending lectures and viewing " signed documents " pertaining to a " massive cover up " regarding early " use of microwaves in warming human blood , human breast milk and the deaths resulting from such ignorance . "
She went on to relate how the " Stanford University NICU specialists forewarned our own ( Neonatal ) NICU specialists , in a very hush - hush manner , not to use microwave oven heated anything in relation to feeding an infant ...
We were informed in a hushed manner that several infants that had received microwave heated milk had died . "
The nurse also attended " a lecture in Australia where Dr. Hans Hertel 's research had been more freely discussed . "
[ " The Hidden Dangers of Microwave ( Radiation ) Ovens " Faithful Covenant Foundation ]
THE SWISS CONNECTION
Dr. Hertel is said to be " an intense man , driven by personal knowledge of violations of nature by corporate man and his state - supported monopolies in science , technology and education . "
While working as a food scientist for many years with a Swiss food company operating internationally from Basel , he was fired for questioning processing procedures that denatured food .
This providential termination freed Hans Hertel to join colleague Bernard Blanc as the first food scientists since Barbarossa to investigate microwaved food .
" I am striving to bring man and techniques back into harmony with nature , " Hertel later explained , before joining seven other volunteers in a two - month experiment that saw blood samples taken after every microwaved meal .
Reviewing their data , the Swiss researchers found that the nutrients in all microwaved milk and veggies were not only destroyed , but caused significant changes in the blood chemistry of their consumers .
" Structures of molecules are torn apart , molecules are forcefully deformed and thus becomes impaired in quality , " Hertel hectored .
Abrupt changes following the consumption of microwaved food include a decrease in HDL ( good cholesterol ) and a sharp rise in LDL ( bad cholesterol ) .
There are also significant decreases in red blood cells carrying oxygen to tissues , as well as infection - fighting white blood cells .
These are often signs of " poisoning and cell damage , " Hertel and Blanc noted .
The Swiss sleuths were further dismayed to find cholesterol counts shooting up sharply following the consumption of microwaved vegetables as the body sought to " wall off " the unidentifiable invaders .
Describing how gene - splicing geneticists use microwaves to weaken cell membranes , Dr. Hertel explained how the life - giving electrical charge in cells is neutralized by microwaves , suppressing their natural repair mechanisms and leaving them " easy prey for viruses , fungi and other micro- organisms . "
" The oxygen of water molecules reacts most sensitively , " he also found .
This is especially disturbing , since human bodies are mostly comprised of water and require full oxygenation for good health .
Hertel blew his warning whistle when he saw that instead of excreting water , cells exposed to microwaved food produce cancer - enhancing carbon dioxide , hydrogen peroxide and carbon monoxide .
As soon as Hertel and Blanc published their results in the Journal Franz Weber in the spring of 1992 , the powerful Swiss Association of Dealers for Electro - Apparatuses for Households and Industry strong - armed a Bern court in Bern to issue a " gag order " against them .
Blanc recanted .
Dr. Hertel was convicted of " interfering with commerce . "
Ignoring the irony of its ruling , the court further declared : " The defendant is prohibited , under punishment of up to F5,000 , or up to one year in prison , to declare that food prepared in microwave ovens is dangerous to health and leads to pathologic troubles as also indicative for the beginning of a cancerous process . "
Hertel defied the court .
" They have not been able to intimidate me into silence , and I will not accept their conditions , " he declared .
" I have appeared at large seminars in Germany , and the study results have been well - received .
Also , I think the authorities are aware that scientists at Ciba - Geigy [ the world 's largest pharmaceutical company , headquartered in Switzerland ] have vowed to support me in court . "
[ Search for Health Spring / 92 ; Journal Franz Weber # 19 ; Leading Edge International ]
In August , 1998 , the Swiss court decision was reversed , when the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg ruled that the earlier Swiss " gag order " forbidding Hans Hertel from declaring that microwave ovens pose human health risks contravened Hertel 's right to freedom of expression .
The Euro court ordered the Swiss government to fork over 40,000 Swiss Francs in compensation for Hertel 's legal costs .
UNSAFE AT ANY SETTING
" What studies exist are all bad news for microwaving - they universally describe some type of damage , " states MD Allan Spreen .
[ " Micro Management " Jan 27/03 ]
In May 2001 , PhD Lita Lee " observed in the blood chemistries and the rates of certain diseases among consumers of microwaved foods " :
* Lymphatic disorders leading to decreased ability to prevent certain types of cancers .
* Increased rates of cancer cell formation in the blood .
* Increased rates of stomach and intestinal cancers .
* Higher rates of digestive disorders and a gradual breakdown of the systems of elimination .
CALL A KOPP
Forensic researcher William Kopp now states : " The effects of microwaved food by - products are long term , permanent within the human body .
Minerals , vitamins , and nutrients of all microwaved food is reduced or altered so that the human body gets little or no benefit , or the human body absorbs altered compounds that cannot be broken down . "
There is no qualifying " maybe " concerning this Kopp 's conclusions : " Eating microwaved food causes loss of memory , concentration , emotional instability , and a decrease of intelligence , " he declared .

TEDDY BEARS WITH CLAWS
People cling to their microwaves as if they can't remember ever having lived without one .
Trying to educate users on microwave hazards , says Chris Anderson , is " like trying to snatch a teddy bear from a frightened child . "
But each exposure to cell phones , portable phones , wireless gadgets and microwaved food , " adds another brick to your load . "
Anderson 's advice from Electrosmog Solutions : " Keep it natural and you 'll keep it natural because we 're natural beings .
BAKED , TOASTED AND BROILED
The excellent news is that prudent prevention is as close as saying , " nyet " to microwaved foods .
While eating a microwaved meal on extremely rare occasions will probably do less harm than stressing out about it , using a microwave oven for much or most of your home cooking is a ticket to trouble .
I prefer to activate my convection oven instead .
It 's nearly as quick .
And the meals it produces are cooked better , taste better - and are better for me meals cooked in karmically - comprised ovens .
Do yourself a favor , " suggests Jim Carey .
Cut the cord close to the cabinet and toss your microwave into the recycle box .
" When you need to heat something , heat it in a toaster oven or a stovetop pan .
Avoid Teflon and non-stick surfaces , of course .
Better yet , strive to eat more of a raw , unprocessed diet .
That where you 'll get the best nutrition .
" Blend up some smoothies .
It 's faster than microwaving .
You can heat food quickly in a convection oven .
You can also easily heat up food by using a saucepan .
If someone is coming home late , and you want to give them warm food when they arrive , put a saucepan lid over the food while it is on a plate .
Put the plate of food on a simmering saucepan of water .
It will stay warm without drying up . " [ newstarget.com ]

A new fossil turtle species discovered in a Colombian coal mine had a shell as thick as a 400 - page book , which may have protected it from crocodiles and the world 's biggest known snake .
Scientists from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the Florida Museum of Natural History uncovered the Cerrejón coal mine .
The 60 - million - year - old fossilized shell found there was almost 1.5 inches thick and over 3 feet across .
The scientists named the species Cerrejonemys wayuunaiki after the language of the local Wayuu people .
The giant snake that lived alongside this is called the Titanoboa cerrejonensis .
Fossils of the snake , also discovered in Colombian coal mines in the same area as the turtle , show that it grew to be between 40 and 50 feet long .
The longest known living snake species , Python reticulatus , has been measured at 29 feet long .
" The fossils from Cerrejón provide a snapshot of the first modern rainforest in South America – after the big Cretaceous extinctions and before the Andes rose , modern river basins formed and the Panama land bridge connected North and South America , " Carlos Jarmillo , staff scientist at the Smithsonian who studies the plants from Cerrejón , said in a press release April 5 .
Two more new fossil turtle species have turned up in the mines and will be described by Edwin Cadena of North Carolina State University , first author of the C. wayuunaiki paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology .
" I hope this will give us an even better understanding of turtle diversity in the region and some important clues about the environment where they lived , " Cadena said in the press release .

Archaeologists say they may have found proof of the oldest and most southerly human habitation in the world at the site of a major road project in Tasmania .
Archaeologists and Aboriginal heritage officers have been removing sediment from eight trenches along the Jordan River levee at the Brighton roadworks site , north of Hobart .
Initial findings suggest the sediment is between 28,000 and 40,000 years old , making it the oldest , most southern site of human habitation in the world .
It is believed up to 3,000,000 artefacts could be buried there .
Dozens of protesters have been arrested and 19 people have been charged over protests aimed at trying to stop the roadwork in recent months .
Fiona Newson from the Tasmanian Aboriginal Land and Sea Council says the Tasmanian Goverment needs to take the latest report from archaeologists seriously .
" We 're talking about a worldwide significant site in regards to the scientific values and heritage values , " she said .
" It would be a total waste and not a good look on Tasmania if they were going to destroy it . "
With the State Government in caretaker mode , Infrastucture Minister Graeme Sturges has been cautious in his response .
" We will certainly follow the required process and we will acknowledge and respect the findings of the report , " he said .
" Bear in mind we 're to receive the final report in about a week and we will follow due process in regard to this matter . "
World heritage push
The Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre 's Michael Mansell says the site is tremendously significant and wants it put on the World Heritage List .
" The bottom line is that nothing must go within a bull 's roar of the site , " he said .
" I do n't think there 's any doubt that the Federal Government has to be involved anyway because there 's a strong belief that this area should now be declared a world heritage listed place . "
Mr Mansell says Aborigines want the Premier to apologise for the treatment of protesters at the Brighton bypass site .
" I think in the circumstances the Premier owes an apology to those Aboriginal people who always said , ' What is there is terribly significant and must be preserved at all costs ' , " he said .
" An apology I do n't think would be astray . "
Archaeologists working on the project hope the site will be protected .
Head archaeologist Robert Paton is excited by the preliminary findings .
" The dates that we 've got so far , the readings , they 've been nice and statistically tight , and that suggests to me they 're probably correct , " he said .
" To have the opportunity to work on that site with the Aboriginal community , it 's been a pretty exciting time for everyone . "
A Lebanese television psychic sentenced to death for “ sorcery ” in Saudi Arabia was granted a stay of execution on Friday , his lawyer told The BBC .
Until he was arrested in 2008 while on a pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia , Ali Sabat was the host of a satellite television program in which he promised to give “ advice and predictions about the future , ” to callers from around the Arab world to his studio in Beirut , as Britain ’s Channel 4 News explained in a report on his case on Thursday .
( That report , embedded above , includes scenes from Mr. Sabat ’s show and of his televised confession which was broadcast in Saudi Arabia . )
The television psychic was popular in Saudi Arabia and was reportedly recognized by members of the country ’s religious police — officially known as the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice .
According to Amnesty International , Mr. Sabat was sentenced to death in Medina in November , “ after secret court hearings where he had no legal representation or assistance . ”
The human rights group also reported that “ on March 10 , a court in Medina upheld the death sentence .
The judges said that he deserved to be sentenced to death because he had practiced ‘ sorcery ’ publicly for several years before millions of viewers . ”
The court added that his execution would act as a deterrent to what it called the increasing number of “ foreign magicians ” coming to Saudi Arabia .
Office of Attorney May al - Khansa , via Associated Press
May al - Khansa , a lawyer working for Mr. Sabat in Lebanon , raised an alarm about Mr. Sabat ’s possible execution this week when she said on Wednesday that she had been told he would be beheaded “ within 48 hours . ”
On Friday , though , Ms. Khansa told The Associated Press that Lebanon ’s justice minister had informed her that Mr. Sabat “ would not be executed in Saudi Arabia today — the day executions are typically carried out in the kingdom after noon prayers . ”
Since Saudi authorities do not always give notice of executions , and have not responded to requests for comment from foreign media organizations , the apparent delay in Mr. Sabat ’s execution has yet to be confirmed .
Ms. Khansa told a BBC radio program that she had been told that he was still alive on Friday , “ But after that I do n’t have an answer as to if he will be alive or not .
Time is passing and if they do n’t kill him this Friday maybe next Friday . ”
In a television interview with the BBC , she appealed to Saudi Arabia ’s king to recognize that “ Ali Sabat is not a criminal . ”
In Beirut , Meris Lutz of The Los Angeles Times wrote that the case might be more about Saudi politics than law .
One Lebanese legal expert who is familiar with Saudi law and politics described the case against Sabat as a “ muscle show ” by conservatives who may be seeking to embarrass reformist leaders such as King Abdullah .
“ I do n’t know on what grounds they arrested him , since he did n’t commit [ the crime ] in Saudi , he ’s not a Saudi citizen , and it was n’t directed against Saudi , and usually one of these criteria must be fulfilled , ” the expert said , asking that her name not be published because she travels to Saudi Arabia .
Ms. Lutz added that the legal expert suggested that Mr. Sabat might have been given the harshest possible sentence because he is a Shiite Muslim .
The idea of growing bamboo sparks both intrigue and fear in gardeners .
We 've all heard about bamboo running amok , making the term ' invasive ' seem tame , but we 've also seen a lot of garden magazines with photos of gorgeous golden , striped , and even black , rustling , graceful , plants , that would look wonderful in our gardens .
Is it worth the risk ?
There is a real chance that bamboo planted in your garden could become uncontrollable .
Non-native plants can behave erratically , depending on the climate , conditions and care they receive , but there are more and more reputable bamboo dealers who are marketing clumping varieties of bamboo , suitable for growing in various areas .
For the most part , you still have to mail order bamboo plants , since the bamboo sold most commonly in nurseries is the most easily propagated type - aka , invasive .
Bamboo
Bamboo is a grass ( subfamily Bambusoideae within the family Gramineae ) .
It can range in size from a few inches to over 100 feet and can grow a foot or more a day .
Bamboo is one of the most useful plants grown in the world .
It 's used as food , building material , animal fodder , ornamentation , and screening .
Bamboo plants are recognizable by their nodes , the joints between the hollow segments of the branch or culm .
The easiest way to classify bamboo is to divide it into runners and clumpers .
Botanical names can vary from region to region as much as common names , making it confusing to try and sort out what type of bamboo you have .
Err on the side of caution when planting any bamboo and always install some in - ground barrier immediately :
Clumping Bamboo : Clumpers or sympodial bamboos will expand , just like any other plant .
However , it tends to stay in one place , slowing widening from its center , rather than reaching out and popping up throughout the garden and lawn .
Most are perennial down to USDA Hardiness Zone 4 , making them very adaptable garden plants .
Running Bamboo :
This is what makes gardeners run for cover .
Running or monopodial bamboos spread by underground rhizomes and can cover great distances quickly .
Since they are all connected as one plant , it becomes impossible to kill without removing every last piece of rhizome .
However , the rhizomes grow at a depth of only 2 to 18 inches and can be contained with 2 to 2 1/ 2 ft. plastic edging buried around the circumference of the plant .
Use a good edge .
Any cracks or seams in the edging will allow rhizomes to get through .
Most of the temperate , cold hardy bamboos are runners .
( Temperate bamboos are used to a period of cold weather dormancy and may suffer leaf drop if you try to grow them indoors . )
What To Consider Before Growing Bamboo
Most bamboos prefer full sun and a soil pH of around 6.0 to 6.2 .
Newly planted bamboo requires regular watering , to become established and to send out new culms .
Lack of water is the biggest problem with growing bamboo .
However , the soil needs to dry out between watering , because standing water will also inhibit growth .
Bamboo does n't like competition from weeds .
Taller bamboo should be staked , to prevent it from uprooting .
Bamboos are evergreen and will lose and replace leaves as they grow .
Since bamboos are grasses and are grown for their foliage , you should feed with high nitrogen fertilizer .
Mulching will help control moisture and will protect cold - hardy varieties in winter .
Pruning Bamboo
Bamboo culms do not live forever , and some pruning should be done annually to remove old or damaged culms .
Pruning does not hurt the plant .
Cut back to just above a node , to avoid a stub .
Problems with Growing Bamboo
Bamboo Mite :
This pest is similar to spider mites , in that it sucks the juices from leaves , but the bamboo mite only creates webbing within the yellow striation along the parallel veins of the bamboo leaf .
Yellow streaking will slowly expand and spread .
New bamboo plants should be thoroughly inspected before being planted in the garden or near other bamboos .
If an infestation occurs , insecticidal soap will offer some control , but it is hard to reach the mites under their webs .
The use of a systemic miticide may be necessary .
Mealybugs : Mealybugs are part of the scale group of insects .
They attach themselves to plants , often at hard to reach joints and often protect themselves with a cottony or shell - like covering .
This makes them hard to kill with a contact insecticide .
The Bamboo Society of America recommends the use of Cygon ( dimethoate ) , if necessary .
Suggested Bamboo Varieties for the Garden

12 'H x 12 'W
Fargesia nitida " Great Wall "
Considered a fountain bamboo .
The emerging culms are covered in bluish - white powder and do n't leaf out until the following spring .
This branchless , leafless appearance gives it the ' fountain ' shape throughout the winter .
Extremely cold hardy .
Clumper .
Zones 4 - 9
Full Sun to Partial Shade
18 ' H x 12 ' W
Pleioblastus fortunei " Litte Zebra "
Green and white striped leaves make a bright groundcover under trees and shrubs .
Can also be grown successfully in containers and indoors .
Phyllostachys nigra " Black Bamboo "
New culms start green and turn black in the sun .
Runner
Zones 6 and up
Full Sun

If you 're still intrigued , but hesitant , try growing bamboo in a container .
Even in a container , you should keep close tabs that the roots do n't find their way out of a drainage hole and into the ground .
The first commercial to offer advice on abortion services will be screened on British TV next week , campaigners said today , provoking an enthusiastic welcome from advocates of women 's sexual health , and outrage from anti-abortion groups .
The advert from Marie Stopes will be screened on Monday , offering what the organisation says will be " clear , non-judgmental information " on unplanned pregnancies and abortion services .
" Last year alone we received 350,000 calls to our 24 - hour helpline , " said Dana Hovig , Marie Stopes 's chief executive .
" Clearly there are hundreds of thousands of women who want and need sexual health information and advice , and access to services . "
Marie Stopes says it aims to provide women with information rather than to promote abortion or any other choice .
But the decision to screen the advert was described as " grotesque " by Michaela Aston , a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion campaign group Life .
" I can only express utter disbelief that this is being allowed , given the opposition to abortion advertising expressed during the recent public consultation .
To allow abortion providers to advertise on TV , as though they were no different from car companies or detergent manufacturers , is grotesque , " she said .
The advert will be shown at 10.10 pm on Channel 4 and is based around the slogan " Are you late ? "
The Advertising Standards Authority said non-commercial providers of sexual health services , such as Marie Stopes , had been permitted to advertise on UK television for some time .
" If viewers have concerns about the content or scheduling of the ad , the ASA is able to consider complaints once the ad has aired .
However , we can not act on objections that viewers might have about the service being advertised at all , " said a spokesman .
Marie Stopes said it took the decision to screen the commercial after a study found fewer than half of UK adults knew where to go for specialist advice about an unplanned pregnancy other than their GP .
It also found that 76 % of adults believed adverts for services offering advice on unplanned pregnancy should be allowed on television at " appropriate times " .
Darinka Aleksic , campaign co-ordinator for Abortion Rights , said the advert was an " important breakthrough " in the support services on offer to women " .
But the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children said it was seeking advice over the advert 's legality .

For over a decade , accountant Walter Burien has been trying to rouse the public over what he contends is a massive conspiracy and cover - up , involving trillions of dollars squirreled away in funds maintained at every level of government .
His numbers may be disputed , but these funds definitely exist , as evidenced by the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports ( CAFRs ) required of every government agency .
If they do n't represent a concerted government conspiracy , what are they for ?
And how can they be harnessed more efficiently to help allay the financial crises of state and local governments ?
The Elusive CAFR Money Burien is a former commodity trading adviser who has spent many years peering into government books .
He notes that the government is composed of 54,000 different state , county , and local government entities , including school districts , public authorities , and the like ; and that these entities all keep their financial assets in liquid investment funds , bond financing accounts and corporate stock portfolios .
The only income that must be reported in government budgets is that from taxes , fines and fees ; but the investments of government entities can be found in official annual reports ( CAFRs ) , which must be filed with the federal government by local , county and state governments .
These annual reports show that virtually every U.S. city , county , and state has vast amounts of money stashed away in surplus funds .
Burien maintains that these slush funds have been kept concealed from taxpayers , even as taxes are being raised and citizens are being told to expect fewer government services .
Burien was originally alerted to this information by Lt. Col.
Gerald Klatt , who evidently died in 2004 undermysterious circumstances , adding fuel to claims of conspiracy and cover-up .
Klatt was a an Air Force auditor and federal accountant , and it's not impossible that he may have gotten too close to some military stash being used for nefarious ends .
But it is hard to envision how all the municipal governments hording their excess money in separate funds could be complicit in a massive government conspiracy .
Still , if that is not what is going on , why such an inefficient use of public monies ?
A Simpler Explanation I got a chance to ask that question in April , when I was invited to speak at a conference of Government Finance Officers in Missouri .
The friendly public servants at the conference explained that maintaining large " rainy day " funds is simply how local governments must operate .
Unlike private businesses , which have bank credit lines they can draw on if they miscalculate their expenses , local governments are required by law to balance their budgets ; and if they come up short , public services and government payrolls may be frozen until the voters get around to approving a new bond issue .
This has actually happened , bringing local government to a standstill .
In emergencies , government officials can try to borrow short - term through " certificates of participation " or tax participation loans , but the interest rates are prohibitively high ; and in today 's tight credit market , finding willing lenders is difficult .
To avoid those unpredictable contingencies , municipal governments will keep a cushion of from 20 % to 75 % more than their budgets actually require .
This money is invested , but not necessarily lucratively .
One finance officer , for example , said that her city had just bid out $ 2 million as a 30 - day certificate of deposit ( CD ) to two large banks at a meager annual interest of 0.11 % .
It was a nice spread for the banks , which could leverage the money into loans at 6 % or so ; but it was a pretty sparse deal for the city .
Meanwhile , Back in California
That was in Missouri , but the figures I was particularly interested were for my own state of California , which was struggling with a budget deficit of $ 26.3 billion as of April 2010 .
Yet the State Treasurer 's website says that he manages a Pooled Money Investment Account ( PMIA ) tallying in at nearly $ 71 billion as of the same date , including a Local Agency Investment Fund ( LAIF ) of $ 24 billion .
Why is n't this money being used toward the state 's deficit ?
The Treasurer 's answer to this question , which he evidently gets frequently , is that legislation forbids it .
His website states : Can the State borrow LAIF dollars to resolve the budget deficit ?
No. California Government Code 16429.3 states that monies placed with the Treasurer for deposit in the LAIF by cities , counties , special districts , nonprofit corporations , or qualified quasi - governmental agencies shall not be subject to either of the following : ( a ) Transfer or loan pursuant to Sections 16310 , 16312 , or 16313 .
( b ) Impoundment or seizure by any state official or state agency .
The non-LAIF money in the pool can't be spent either .
It can be borrowed , but it has to be paid back .
When Governor Schwarzenegger tried to raid the Public Transportation Account for the state budget , the California Transit Association took him to court and won .
The Third District Court of Appeals ruled in June 2009 that diversions from the Public Transportation Account to fill non-transit holes in the General Fund violated a series of statutory and constitutional amendments enacted by voters via four statewide initiatives dating back to 1990 .
In short , the use of these funds for the state budget has been blocked by the voters themselves .
Bond issues are approved for particular purposes .
When excess funds are collected , they are not handed over to the State toward next year 's budget .
They just sit idly in an earmarked fund , drawing a modest interest .
What 's Wrong with This Picture ?
California 's budget problems have caused its credit rating to be downgraded to just above that of Greece , driving the state 's interest tab skyward .
In November 2009 , the state sold 30 - year taxable securities carrying an interest rate of 7.26 % .
Yet California has never defaulted on its bonds .
Meanwhile , the too - big - to - fail banks , which would have defaulted on hundreds of billions of dollars of debt if they had not been bailed out by the states and their citizens , are able to borrow from each other at the extremely low federal funds rate , currently set at 0 to .25 % ( one quarter of one percent ) .
The banks are also paying the states quite minimal rates for the use of their public monies , and turning around and relending this money , leveraged many times over , to the states and their citizens at much higher rates .
That is assuming they lend at all , something they are increasingly reluctant to do , since speculating with the money is more lucrative , and investing it in federal securities is more secure .
Private banks clearly have the upper hand in this game .
Local governments have been forced to horde funds in very inefficient ways , building excessive reserves while slashing services , because they do not have the extensive credit lines available to the private banking system .
States cannot easily incur new debt without voter approval , a process that is cumbersome , time - consuming and uncertain .
Banks , on the other hand , need to keep only the slimmest of reserves , because they are backstopped by a central bank with the power to create all the reserves necessary for its member banks , as well as by Congress and the taxpayers themselves , who have been arm - twisted into repeated bailouts of the Wall Street behemoths .
How the CAFR Money Could Be Used Without Spending It California , then , is in the anomalous position of being $ 26 billion in the red and plunging toward bankruptcy , while it has over $ 70 billion stashed away in an investment pool that it cannot touch .
Those are just the funds managed by the Treasurer .
According to California 's latest CAFR , the California Public Employees ' Retirement Fund ( CalPERS ) has total investments of $ 360 billion , including nearly $ 144 billion in " equity securities " and $ 37 billion in " private equity . "
See the State of California Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30 , 2009 , pages 83 - 84 .
This money cannot be spent , but it can be invested -- and it can be invested not just in conservative federal securities but in equity , or stocks .
Rather than turning this hidden gold mine over to Wall Street banks to earn a very meager interest , California could leverage its excess funds itself , turning the money into much - needed low - interest credit for its own use .
How ?
It could do this by owning its own bank .
Only one state currently does this -- North Dakota .
North Dakota is also the only state projected to have a budget surplus by 2011 .
It has not fallen into the Wall Street debt trap afflicting other states , because it has been able to generate its own credit through its own state - owned Bank of North Dakota ( BND ) .
An investment in the State Bank of California would not be at risk unless the bank became insolvent , a highly unlikely result since the state has the power to tax .
In North Dakota , the BND is a dba of the state itself : it is set up as " the State of North Dakota doing business as the Bank of North Dakota . "
That means the bank cannot go bankrupt unless the state goes bankrupt .
The capital requirement for bank loans is a complicated matter , but it generally works out to be about 7 % .
( According to Standard & Poor 's , the worldwide average risk - adjusted capital ratio stood at 6.7 per cent as of June 30 , 2009 ; but for some major U.S. banks it was much lower : Citigroup 's was 2.1 per cent ; Bank of America 's was 5.8 per cent . )
At 7 % , $ 7 of capital can back $ 100 in loans .
Thus if $ 7 billion in CAFR funds were invested as capital in a California state development bank , the bank could generate $ 100 billion in loans .
This $ 100 billion credit line would allow California to finance its $ 26 billion deficit at very minimal interest rates , with $ 74 billion left over for infrastructure and other sorely needed projects .
Studies haveshown that eliminating the interest burden can cut the cost of public projects in half .
The loans could be repaid from the profits generated by the projects themselves .
Public transportation , low - cost housing , alternative energy sources and the like all generate fees .
Meanwhile , the jobs created by these projects would produce additional taxes and stimulate the economy .
Commercial loans could also be made , generating interest income that would return to state coffers .
Building a Deposit Base
To start a bank requires not just capital but deposits .
Banks can create all the loans they can find creditworthy borrowers for , up to the limit of their capital base ; but when the loans leave the bank as checks , the bank needs to replace the deposits taken from its reserve pool in order for the checks to clear .
Where would a state - owned bank get the deposits necessary for this purpose ?
In North Dakota , all the state 's revenues are deposited in the BND by law .
Compare California , which has expected revenues for 2010 - 11 of $ 89 billion .
The Treasurer 's website reports that as of June 30 , 2009 , the state held over $ 18 billion on deposit as demand accounts and demand NOW accounts ( basically demand accounts carrying a very small interest ) .
These deposits were held in seven commercial banks , most of them Wall Street banks : Bank of America , Union Bank , Bank of the West , U.S. Bank , Wells Fargo Bank , Westamerica Bank , and Citibank .
Besides these deposits , the $ 64 billion or so left in the Treasurer 's investment pool could be invested in State Bank of California CDs .
Again , most of the bank CDs in which these funds are now invested are Wall Street or foreign banks .
Many private depositors would no doubt choose to bank at the State Bank of California as well , keeping California 's money in California .
There is already a movement afoot to transfer funds out of Wall Street banks into local banks .
While the new state - owned bank is waiting to accumulate sufficient deposits to clear its outgoing checks , it can do what other startup banks do - borrow deposits from the interbank lending market at the very modest federal funds rate ( 0 to .25 % ) .
To avoid hurting California 's local banks , any state monies held on deposit with local banks could remain there , since the State Bank of California should have plenty of potential deposits without these funds .
In North Dakota , local banks are not only not threatened by the BND but are actually served by it , since the BND partners with them , engaging in " participation loans " that help local banks with their capital requirements .
Taking Back the Money Power
We have too long delegated the power to create our money and our credit to private profiteers , who have plundered and exploited the privilege in ways that are increasingly being exposed in the media .
Wall Street may own Congress , but it does not yet own the states .
We can take the money power back at the state level , by setting up our own publicly - owned banks .
We can " spend " our money while conserving it , by leveraging it into the credit urgently needed to get the wheels of local production turning once again .

Will a New Bill to Boost U.S. Tourism Help or Hurt ?
New legislation would impose a $ 10 fee on foreign travelers , establish board .
March 1 , 2010  --
The U.S. travel industry is hoping to get a face - lift with the help of a government bill that creates a national tourism board , funded in part by a new fee on foreign travelers , but some are questioning whether the measure will inadvertently hurt the tourism industry .
President Obama in the coming days is expected to sign the " Travel Promotion Act , " a bipartisan bill that passed the Senate last week by an overwhelming majority .
The bill would impose a $ 10 fee on travelers who do not need to pay for a visa to enter the United States .
That money , along with private sector funding , would be used to fund the non-profit " Corporation for Travel Promotion , " an 11 - member board that will develop ad campaigns to encourage tourism to the U.S.
Many foreign countries have such boards that try to lure visitors with exotic campaigns -- think " Incredible India . "
In the United States , all states have their own tourist boards but it 's never been tried nationally .
" The United States is the only industrialized nation without a comprehensive outreach effort , " said Caroline Beteta , chair of the U.S. Travel Association and president of the California Travel & Tourism Commission .
" This truly is the most comprehensive broad reaching piece of legislation that just wo n't affect the travel industry , but the entire economy of America . "
Stay Up to Date on the Latest Travel Trends From ABC News on Twitter .
But others are unsure if the program -- and the $ 10 fee -- will have the kind of impact that the tourism industry is banking on .
" It 's absolutely counterintuitive , " said Steve Lott , a spokesman for International Air Transport Association , which represents the airline industry .
" To us , we 're saying we 'd love to see more people visit the United States , but we 're going to charge you more for the privilege of entering the country , " he added .
" We are in favor of increased tourism and visitation ... but let 's look at our priorities .
We do n't think that videos and billboards are necessarily a priority .
Instead , we should be focusing on how to make customs and immigration easier for people . "
Critics charge that at a time when international travelers are hesitant to visit the United States because of stringent security measures , the legislation is unnecessary .
Tourism professionals counter by saying the program is essentially designed to spread more awareness about security and travel procedures , and it will help rather than deter visitors .
" The problem is the United States has the reputation of being among one of the most unfriendly countries when it comes to international visitors , so this almost seems like one more way we are unwelcoming , " said Bjore Hanson , an associate professor at New York University .
" But I also think it 's well understood , if there were ever a fee to be charged ... every country understands the need of budgets . "
Other critics say are opposed to the idea of a national tourism board , given that states have their own boards .
" You already have very strong chambers of commerces and tourism groups for destinations , and those , I think , do a very good job ... in general , of promoting their destination , " said Brett Snyder , president of Cranky Concierge air travel services .
" In a way , this is going to be duplicating some efforts on things that are already happening at the local and regional level . "
But the program 's supporters say the new board will promote cooperation rather than competition .
" We need an umbrella approach .
The U.S.A. brand is silent in this effort .
By leveraging a U.S.A. brand , we are going to be that much more effective , " Beteta said .
International travel to the United States remains below 2001 levels .
Last year was the eighth straight year in which overseas arrivals fell short of pre-Sept. 11 levels , according to the U.S. Travel Association .
Canadians remain the top international visitors to the United States , but with the new program , the tourism industry is hoping to tap into burgeoning markets , like Brazil , China and India .
New Tourism Bill Practical or Political ?
Republicans who held up the bill in the Senate argue that it is nothing more than government interference in the tourism sector .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , who is locked in a tough re-election campaign and represents Nevada , a prime destination for tourists , billed it as legislation that would spur jobs .
With health care and now jobs on the forefront , the current Congress has largely sidestepped legislation related to travel .
The FAA Reauthorization Act , which passed the House in May , is stuck in the Senate .
The bill calls for modernizing the air traffic control system by funding the " NextGen " system , improving aviation safety and capacity , and adding more passenger rights .
" As far as we 're concerned , there 's more work to be done , " said Colin Tooze , vice president of government affairs at the American Society of Travel Agents .
Not to mention , the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) is still missing a chief .
Obama 's nominee , Erroll Southers , withdrew his name from the post after heavy criticism from Republicans .
It remains to be seen whether the new tourism bill results in a significant upturn in tourism .
The domestic travel industry , which has tirelessly pushed for the bill 's passage , estimates that it would draw an additional 1.6 million new visitors and $ 4 billion in consumer spending annually .
For politicians , it 's the other math that counts more .
The program is estimated to create new jobs -- although the number has n't been specified -- and reduce the federal budget by $ 425 million .
At a time when the deficit is at a record high and lawmakers are struggling to come up with ways to reduce the budget , this bill sinks in well for campaign posturing .
The fee is expected to raise $ 100 million per year from foreign travelers and a matching amount from the private industry for a total of $ 200 million to fund the board and its promotional campaign .
" This is an easy thing to sell to your constituents because it costs you nothing .
It costs foreigners something , " Snyder said .

French for " to dredge , " a dragée ( pronounced " dra-zhay " ) traditionally refers to a colorful covered candy with a hard outer shell and softer center , often used for decoration in addition to eating .
These days , the word is used loosely for most small coated candies , from Jordan almonds to candy - and chocolate - coated sunflower seeds .
Dragées can also describe the tiny metallic sugar spheres used to top holiday cakes and cookies .
Can you think of any modern - day candies that are dragées ?

Some highlights :
You might have heard we passed a health care bill .
And some Republicans have suggested that the bill contains a few “ secret ” provisions .
That ’s ridiculous .
There are n’t a few secret provisions in the health care plan .
There are like hundreds .
And tonight , in the interest of transparency , I ’d like to share a couple .
Let ’s see here .
This provision is called the “ Bay State of Denial . ”
It reads , “ This bill shall cover short - term memory loss related to the passage of Massachusetts health care reform . ”
Good news ,
Mitt , your condition is covered !
This next provision is called the “ Jersey Shore - Up . ”
It reads , “ The following individuals shall be excluded from the indoor tanning tax within this bill : Snooki , J- Woww , the Situation , and House Minority Leader John Boehner . ”
This provision ought to put a common misconception to rest .
It says right here : “ If you do not like the ruling of your death panel , you can appeal it . ”
…
Some of you are seasoned veterans who have been on the political beat for decades .
Others here tonight began their careers as bloggers not long ago .
But I think it ’s fair to say that every single reporter in this room believes deeply in the enterprise of journalism .
Every one of you , even the most cynical among you , understands and cherishes the function of a free press in the preservation of our system of government and our way of life .
And I want you to know that for all the jokes and occasional gripes , I cherish that work as well .
In fact , tonight , I wanted to present you all with a bipartisan , Congressional resolution that honors all those wonderful contributions that journalists have made to our country and our world .
Unfortunately , I could n’t break the filibuster .
And the winner of the night :
A man died after unwittingly drinking liquid cocaine concealed in a rum bottle , a court has heard .
Lascell Malcolm , 63 , a father of two , accepted the bottle as a gift from a friend who did not realise she had been used as a drugs mule , jurors were told .
Martin Newman , 50 , is alleged to have given the bottle to Antoinette Corlis who flew into Gatwick in May 2009 .
Mr Newman , of Romford , Essex , denies manslaughter and importation of drugs at Croydon Crown Court .
Cocaine poisoning On Wednesday the court was told Ms Corlis and her friend , Michael Lawrence , met Mr Newman as they checked in for a flight from St Lucia to Gatwick .
The pair agreed to carry two bottles of Bounty rum after Mr Newman claimed he had exceeded his baggage allowance .
A mixture of such toxicity that a teaspoonful could kill anyone who consumed it
Oliver Glasgow , prosecuting
But on arrival at Gatwick , Mr Newman was held up by customs officials , and Mr Lawrence , who was due to catch a connecting flight to Switzerland , gave one of the bottles to Ms Corlis , who was collected by Mr Malcolm .
When Mr Malcolm , a taxi driver , refused to accept payment for the journey , Ms Corlis gave him the bottle instead .
The following day , Mr Malcolm died of a heart attack caused by cocaine poisoning .
The reason for Mr Malcolm 's death did not come to light until grieving relatives decided to drink a toast after discovering the bottle at his home .
Deadly toxicity Oliver Glasgow , prosecuting , said Mr Malcolm 's nephew , Charles Roach , and friend , Trevor Tugman , spat out the liquid but collapsed a short time later and were rushed into intensive care at Middlesex Hospital in London .
Mr Glasgow said : " It did not take long for people to identify the defendant 's bottle of Bounty rum as the source of the cocaine poisoning that all three victims had sustained .
" Subsequent analysis of the contents of the bottle established that 246g [ 8.7 oz ] of cocaine had been dissolved into the rum , which resulted in a mixture of such toxicity that a teaspoonful could kill anyone who consumed it . "
Jurors were told that police contacted Mr Lawrence in Switzerland , urging him to hand in the bottle of cocaine .
Mr Glasgow said two more passengers from St Lucia had also brought bottles into the UK but charges against them were dropped .
No evidence was heard on Thursday because of legal argument .
The case continues .

Blizzard is pushing to turn the new and improved Battle.net , which will eventually contain its entire catalog , into a strong platform for both gaming and social networking .
Its latest move : Facebook integration .
" The first step in the integration will enable StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty players to quickly add Blizzard gamers who are friends on Facebook to their Battle .
net friend lists , facilitating their social gaming experience on the service , " Blizzard explains .
This functionality will be added to the beta " in the near future , " and more uses for your Facebook account will be revealed at a future date .
Blizzard wants you playing , and perhaps even buying , games on Battle . net .
An easy way to make you feel comfortable with the service is to have a simple way to populate it with your friends and family .... and Facebook integration certainly does that .
Using Facebook to organize your World of WarCraft Guild or schedule raids could actually be an attractive feature .
What else is coming from this partnership ?
We 're going to have to wait and see , but Blizzard needs to tread softly ; Facebook applications can go from useful to annoying very quickly .
Officials wonder if maybe the environment could find some time in its busy schedule to refreeze a few glaciers .
WASHINGTON — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency called a press conference Monday to publicly denounce the environment for blatantly refusing to pull its weight in mankind 's ongoing efforts at ecological conservation .

" For 40 years , we have worked tirelessly to ensure the health and safety of our natural environment , " a visibly angered EPA administrator Lisa Jackson told reporters .
" But this can only work when it 's a give - and - take .
If the environment wo n't even meet us halfway by regenerating a rain forest or two , or pumping out some clean air and water every once in a while , then what 's the point of us trying ? "
Added Jackson , " I 'm as committed to saving the earth as anyone , but for crying out loud , when is the earth going to hold up its end of the bargain ? "
Advertisement
According to an EPA report , most of the environment 's day - to - day processes can be categorized as rude and inconsiderate , in particular its selfish overreliance on " absolutely , perfectly clean soil " for sustainable growth , and its continual inability to act in good faith and adapt to rising carbon dioxide levels .
Nature 's " big thank - you " for mankind attempting to reduce CO2 emissions through cap - and - trade programs .

The EPA also accused the environment of creating more work for the overburdened agency by stubbornly refusing to break down and absorb plastic and other synthetic materials , and producing rare species that can only survive in very specific , excessively fragile ecosystems .
" We 're putting in a lot of effort here with recycling and hybrid cars , so a little reciprocity from the environment would be appreciated , " Jackson said .
" God forbid the oceans replenish their own fish .
And would it really be so much trouble for the earth 's collective biospheres to pitch in and come up with a clean fuel alternative for use in our homes and vehicles ?
It 's the environment 's glaciers we 're busting our asses trying to save , after all . "
Advertisement
Continued Jackson , " The environment needs to realize that mankind may not always be around to clean up its messes . "
Based on recent projections pointing to a high rate of extreme weather and accelerated climate change , EPA scientists have concluded that the least the environment could do is cut back on natural disasters , and perhaps try to grow some crops to help save the 1 billion people who go starving every day .

A nice new waterfall here and there reportedly would n't hurt either , officials said .
" I think everybody is getting a little fed - up with the hurricanes , earthquakes , and tsunamis , " EPA engineer Thomas Bergman said .
" Not to mention UV rays and acid rain .
And , not to be petty , but shark attacks ?
Mankind does n't have enough on its plate already without having to worry about getting eaten alive by killer sharks ?
I 'm sorry , but that is just unacceptable . "
Advertisement
Added Bergman , " The environment may be in peril , but it has no right to treat us like animals . "
In an impassioned final warning , Administrator Jackson announced that if the environment did not start helping to stave off global catastrophe soon , it could face " serious repercussions " from humanity in the coming years , including massive Styrofoam - cup usage , oil spills , and exponentially higher emission rates .

" It becomes very frustrating when you give , and you give , and you give , and you get nothing in return , " said Jackson , holding back tears .
" And after you 've exhausted yourself from all that giving , you leave work and have two measly hours of sunlight before it gets dark or starts pouring down rain on you out of nowhere .
It 's like the environment does n't even care .
And what 's with the leaves everywhere ?
Every fall , with the goddamn leaves !
What are we , your servants ?
We 're supposed to pick up after you ?
Jesus , if I find one more leaf or fallen branch clogging up my gutters , I swear to God , I 'm going to snap . "
" Stupid environment , " Jackson added .
" Sometimes I wish it would just go away . "
The work of nannies , in - home caregivers , housekeepers , and other domestic laborers is amongst the most undervalued and under - regulated industries in the United States — a legacy of slavery , Jim Crow , and the undervaluation of “ women ’s work . ”
In the contemporary context , domestic workers ( who are almost all immigrant women of color ) routinely face low pay and long hours , and are denied health care and sick leave .
Too often they endure racial / ethnic discrimination , physical and other forms of abuse , and many find themselves the victims of human trafficking and modern - day slavery .
Fifteen years ago , the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action was adopted by the governments of 189 countries around the world , universally recognizing that women ’s rights are human rights .
During the first two weeks of March , the 54th Session of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women ( CSW ) undertook its review of the platform ’s implementation .
We felt this was a crucial moment to call attention to the failure of the U.S. and other governments to comply with their obligations under international human rights law to address the abuse , exploitation , and enslavement of domestic workers , one of the most critical women ’s human rights issues we face today .
On March 11 , the ACLU and partner organizations , Domestic Workers United ( DWU ) ; Andolan : Organizing South Asian Workers ; the National Domestic Workers Alliance ( NDWA ) ; DAMAYAN Migrant Workers Association ; and the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund ( AALDEF ) , sponsored a documentary screening and panel discussion about the human rights abuses that domestic workers face .
Behind Closed Doors , produced by filmmakers and activists Pracheta Sharma and Jessica Hopper , provided a captivating picture of the vulnerability and ill treatment that South Asian domestic workers experience in New York .
( From left to right ) Selene Kaye , Araceli Martínez - Olguín , Linda Oalican , Barbara Young , Priscilla Gonzalez , Ivy Suriyopas , Nahar Alam , Jessica Hopper , Pracheta Sharma
After the film , several panelists shared their personal stories , which were exceptionally powerful .
The testimonies were at once unique and part of a shared experience .
Barbara Young , a nanny from Barbados and member of DWU ’s Steering Committee , Linda Oalican , a domestic worker from the Philippines and founding member of DAMAYAN , and Nahar Alam , a former domestic worker from Bangladesh and executive director of Andolan , remarked on the indignities they bore as domestic workers after migrating to the U.S .
Alam stated ,
I had always thought that the United States was a place where anyone could get a job and be safe , but I think that depends on who you are .
I am a woman , an immigrant , a Muslim , and when I came to this country I did n’t speak enough English … and that ’s a problem .
I worked at a garment factory and then I worked as a domestic worker ….
I suffered with both jobs .
No getting paid properly and being abused .
The speakers also emphasized the crucial role domestic workers play in creating employment opportunities for others .
Oalican explained ,
Amid the global recession , New York City continues to be the center of the world economy , but it can not be without the labor of women domestic workers .
We perform the necessary labor to make other work possible for American businesses and professionals .
We do the very basic and vital work for any economy — taking care of the next generation , the elderly , the homes , cooking food and doing the laundry .
But even in New York , our labor remains unrecognized , unprotected , and devalued .
Worldwide there are tens of millions of women and girls employed as domestic workers .
In the New York metro area alone , there are more than 200,000 domestic workers ; 93 percent are women , 95 percent are people of color , and 99 percent are immigrants ( see Home Is Where the Work Is . ) .
These statistics reinforce the fact that the exploitation , abuse , and enslavement of domestic workers is directly related to discrimination based on sex , race , class , and immigration status .
As Young explained , “ Domestic work is rooted in slavery ” and the devaluation of domestic work in the U.S. is a direct result of that history and of deliberate decisions “ when [ federal labor ] laws were made , [ to ] exclude domestic workers . ”
Furthermore , the isolated and often informal nature of domestic employment makes workers particularly vulnerable to human rights abuses .
The most extreme form of abuse , human trafficking , is an unfortunate reality for some domestic workers in the U.S. Ivy Suriyopas , a staff attorney with AALDEF , and Araceli Martínez - Olguín , a staff attorney with the ACLU Women ’s Rights Project , shed light on the particular vulnerability of domestic workers who are trafficked to the U.S. by foreign diplomats .
Diplomatic immunity bars these workers from claiming their legal rights in court and , as a result , gives diplomats a free pass to mistreat them deliberately and without penalty .
Suriyopas and Martínez - Olguín also highlighted policy , advocacy , and litigation efforts to combat trafficking by diplomats , including the creation of a pamphlet to inform workers of their legal rights and protections before they even come to the U.S. , and an amicus brief submitted by the ACLU and AALDEF in support of a domestic worker who was trafficked to the U.S. by a Kuwaiti diplomat .
Priscilla Gonzalez , Director of Domestic Workers United , ended the panel on a hopeful and galvanizing note :
Domestic workers have been organizing and the domestic workers movement is building momentum and it ’s becoming a force to be reckoned with , which is great news and a long time coming .
DWU , Damayan , Andolan , and NDWA are at the forefront of the movement to pro­tect the human rights of domestic workers and revalue their labor , which is rapidly gaining momentum with the proposed Domestic Workers ’ Bill of Rights in New York and similar legislation in California .
NDWA is also advocating for the federal Department of Labor to update its regulations to respond to the particular conditions that domestic workers face , and working to get the International Labour Organization to pass international standards for domestic workers across the world .
If successful , these efforts will finally guarantee domestic workers the rights , dignity , respect , and recognition that they have been denied for too long .
As Gonzalez told the audience , it ’s time to “ bring the sector out of the shadows . ”

All my life I 've done mental arithmetic the ' wrong way ' : I 've calculated from left - to - right , instead of right - to - left .
So when I do something likeI 'll see thefirst and then the .
This even applies when there 's a carry and I 'll do something likeas .
I do the same thing for multiplication as well .
Turns out I 'm not so weird after all ( well , apart from the finding doing mental arithmetic fun bit ) .
I 've been reading Secrets of Mental Math : The Mathemagician 's Guide to Lightning Calculation and Amazing Mental Math Tricks and the author , Michael Shermer , is just like me : he works from left - to - right .
He , like me , has found this to be a good system because it lets you discard digits early and not hold some enormous calculation in your head .
For example , in the calculationyou can immediately say " four hundred " before doing the rest of the sum .
This seems to free up headspace ( at least for me ) and let 's me do the rest of the calculation .
I 'd do it like this :
The books is filled with tricks for doing all sorts of mental calculations , including a nice section about estimation ( I 've always been an estimator ) and working out things like tips and sales taxes .
But the most fun part to me was a trick to let you do two - digit squares in your head really , really fast .
Quick , what 's .
Of course , the brute force way to do that is to calculatewhich is a bit of a pain because it involves doing something like .
But there 's a much faster way .
Observe that .
Since you probably know thatthis means you have to calculatewhich is relatively easy because the multiplication involves a multiple of ten which means it 's reallyand then add a zero .
So the rule is that if you want to square numberyou first round it to the nearest multiple of 10 , called that , and then calculate ( i.e. round the same amount in the opposite direction ) .
You calculateand add back the square of the amount you rounded by , , which will be 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 or 25 .
This works becauseExample : iswhich is fairly easy to do in your head .
And naturally the same trick works no matter how many digits you have , it 's just that the multiplication gets harder .
The trick is especially impressive / easy with numbers near 100 because the multiplication becomes dead easy .
For example , iswhich you ( or at least I ) can almost instantly see is

BBC is airing a fantastic special about life with large breasts called My Big Breasts and Me .
This documentary follows the lives of three women who feel uncomfortably defined by their naturally large bust size .
One is terrified of having breast reduction surgery but with her breasts causing her chronic back pain she knows it may be her only option .
Another hopes that alternative therapies and an exercise regime will downsize her chest ; and the third , a 19 year old fashion student , struggles to be taken seriously in a world where she feels only women with ’ small boobs ’ can look attractive .
Interesting Facts : British women have the biggest breasts in Europe and the average bra size is increasing each year .
The average breast size in the UK is between 36C to 34E compared to 10 years ago when it was a much smaller 34B .
Nearly 80 % of women are wearing the wrong bra size and need a proper fitting .
Breast reduction operations have gone up a whopping 19 % in 2006 compared to 2005 .
Half of women in the UK would consider plastic surgery while another 36 % would consider a breast operation .
It is estimated that 26,000 women had a breast enlargement in 2006 .
Thousands of teenagers – some as young as 13 years old – are now going under the knife in order to reduce their bust size and “ fit ” in .
The girls who work here at Hiddenfeet found the story of the young fashion student to be especially profound .
For years now we have been working hard to show the world that large breasts are beautiful .

What Do We Know About Mustard Man ?
As far as we can ascertain , there was a Meet Jamiroquai contest on muchmusic ( the Canadian version of MTV ) where people had to send in pictures of their ' funkiest ' poses in order to win .
Most entries had people posing in 70's gear , but this guy took the wording quite literally , sending in as he did this photo of himself being not only funky , but also yellow , tangy and somewhat pungent .
We have no word on whether or not he won , but the query we sent via muchmusic.com received the following reply from the producers of the show :
" Thanks for your interest , unfortunately we are not able to supply any personal information about contest entrants . "

Amateur astronomers believe they have located the X - 37B US military unmanned spaceplane , which was launched into orbit on a classified mission a month ago .
We now know where , but not why or what .
According to the authoritative skygazers ' site Heavens - Above , the X - 37B is in an orbit angled up 40 degrees from the Equator , meaning that it passes regularly over all nations between southern Europe and South Africa and corresponding portions of south Asia , Australia , Latin America and much of the USA .
The little spaceplane is at a height of approximately 400 km above Earth .
The X - 37B is operated by the US Air Force and its mission , budget and other particulars are classified , or " black " .
Nonetheless , various facts about the project are known as it began life as a NASA programme .
The X - 37B takes off inside a fairing atop a normal disposable launch stack , in this case an Atlas V from Cape Canaveral a month ago .
It is much smaller than a space shuttle , but like the shuttle has delta - shaped wings which should offer similar " cross range " abilities during re-entry - that is the X - 37B could potentially make a landing somewhere well off its orbital track .
Another difference from the Shuttle is that the little robot wingship has a deployable solar array rather than fuel cells for electric power generation , and the air force has stated that it can remain in orbit for up to 270 days .
The planned duration of the current mission has n't been revealed .
Then the X - 37B also has a powerful thruster and substantial propellant tanks , which indicates that it may be intended to change orbit quickly and / or frequently - it will certainly be no surprise if at some point the sky - watchers lose track of it again .
The US air force has refused to discuss the X - 37B 's mission in any detail , though spokesmen have emphasised its usefulness as a testbed for developing space technologies and also for trying out rapid - response and quick turnarounds with runway - landing spacecraft .
A second X - 37B has already been ordered .
The secrecy has led to much speculation regarding the little craft : that it may be intended to service or deploy the planned new " fractionated " mini - sat clusters , or as a way of rushing custom spy packages into space in response to emerging crises .
No obvious mission would seem to require the X - 37B 's delta wings and the cross - range re-entry capability they appear to offer , however .
A lifting - body or stub wing design would have been able to carry more payload and still make a runway landing - just not one well off the craft 's orbital track .
This has led us here on the Reg space - war desk to wonder whether there might just be plans in some quarters for crafty one - orbit flights like the " Mission 3A / 3B " planned for ( but never actually executed by ) the space shuttle - details here .
Such missions would allow the X - 37B to escape the notice not just of amateur skywatchers , but also of foreign powers with space - tracking capabilities .
It 'll probably be a long time before any details emerge , however . ®

All the research on the effectiveness of different kinds of therapy shows that what matters is not the form of the therapy but the nature of the relationship between the therapist and the client .
Clients are rarely interested in the theory of therapy that the therapist espouses .
What they want is a relationship with a person who is genuinely interested in them , and who is able to become a reliable point in the client 's empty and chaotic internal landscape .
In group therapy the group itself becomes the reliable point .
People who do n't understand what therapy is about and who want to believe that they 're superior to those in need of help often use pseudo - medical terms like " addictive personality " .
Nobody has a personality , addictive or otherwise .
" Personality " is an abstract noun which refers to an individual 's more or less regular ways of thinking and acting .
These ways of thinking and acting change with time and circumstances .
Every action has a purpose .
The actions we call addictions have two possible purposes .
The first is to give us a break from the reality of our life .
Some people relax in the afternoon with coffee and chocolate cake , and some people have a gin and tonic at the end of their working day .
These kinds of addictions are rarely called addictions because everyone has this kind of addiction .
As TS Eliot said , " Humankind can not bear very much reality " .
The second purpose of addictions is to act as a defence against memories and feelings that threaten to overwhelm the person 's sense of being a person .
This is illustrated in the testimonies by men who , as children , were sexually assaulted by Catholic priests .
Here the men talk about their heavy drinking and about being depressed , both of which are defences against being overwhelmed by memories and feelings .
In their descriptions of the assault they told how totally helpless they felt in the hands of a man who , as well as inflicting pain , warned them that God would punish them if they told what had happened to them .
They were also told that what was happening to them was their own fault .
When our sense of being a person is in danger of being overwhelmed , we feel that we are about to be wiped out as a person .
We shall become a no - thing .
This is utterly terrifying .
If we have considerable self - confidence , we can tell ourselves that we shall survive this experience , but , if we see ourselves as unacceptable , even wicked , we feel that we are always in danger of being destroyed as a person .
We can try to blot out our memory of the terror by consuming alcohol , but , no matter how much we drink , it is never enough .
Or we can blame ourselves for what has happened to us , and thus become depressed .
We can then drink to blot out the pain of being depressed .
Alcoholism and depression are only two of a number of desperate defences that we can use to try to fend off the fear of being annihilated as a person .
Whatever defence we unconsciously choose to use , the only way to eradicate the need for a desperate defence is to arrive at the position where you value and accept yourself .
In a good therapeutic relationship the client has the opportunity to come to value and accept himself , and to use this to create the courage to face what he needs to face in his life .
In chronic illnesses like diabetes , epilepsy and cystic fibrosis where the physical basis of the disease has been clearly demonstrated , individuals will readily learn to manage their illness if they value themselves and are determined to be as healthy as possible and lead as normal a life as possible .
The AA philosophy that teaches that alcoholics have a chronic illness which renders them incapable of looking after themselves , and so they must submit themselves to a higher power , prevents them from being able to value and accept themselves .
Resolving not to drink again has saved the life of many people , but this is like the situation where a sailor manages to get from his wrecked ship to rocks above the stormy sea but lacks the courage to cross the rocks to solid land .

Looks like the $ 18 million temporary Transbay Terminal in downtown San Francisco , which has been mostly done for months , will finally be ready to board its first passengers in August .
The question is , how did the largely outdoor bus stop - originally intended to be used for five years , but which now may be needed for seven - wind up costing as much as a small office building ?
Transit officials chalk it up to the price of new construction , including :
-- $ 4.5 million for the structures , mostly to house Greyhound .
-- $ 2.2 million for power and lighting .
-- $ 2 million for paving and sidewalks .
-- $ 1.5 million for canopies .
Toss in furniture , signage , traffic signals and a few other extras , and it adds up to a very expensive bus stop .
Incidentally , AC Transit and Muni balked at jumping to the new location until they got a clear signal that the move will , indeed , be temporary - and that a $ 4.5 billion permanent terminal will in fact be built .
AC Transit boss Mary King said they finally got all the assurances they requested this past week - but not every rider is on board .
Glen Schembari of San Mateo , who works right across the street from the temporary terminal , said he had been looking forward to the opening until cash - strapped SamTrans eliminated all but one of its express buses into San Francisco .
Now , he said , " I take BART . "
Hall pass :
The primary for state schools superintendent is shaping up as a three - way spending race between some of the biggest special - interest education groups around .
To date , the California Teachers Association has pumped $ 616,000 to elect state Assemblyman TomTorlakson , D - Antioch .
State Sen. Gloria Romero , D - Los Angeles , has the backing of Edvoice , the charter school lobby , and had received more than $ 110,000 in contributions from charter fans including the Fisher family ( of Gap fame ) and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings .
Meanwhile , Larry Aceves , the former president of the Association of California School Administrators , has gotten $ 239,000 from - who else - the school administrators .
Merritt 's merits :
They 've already received $ 208,000 in help from the city in the past few months to help pay off their creditors - now the owners of Oakland 's landmark Merritt Restaurant and Bakery are poised to get another $ 150,000 taxpayer loan to try to revive their sagging business .
With the blessing of Mayor Ron Dellums , the City Council 's economic development committee voted 3 - 1 last week to approve the small - business loan to owners Charles Griffis and his wife , Patricia Tyler - Griffis .
The full council will take up the issue Tuesday .
Councilman Larry Reid , who supports the bailout , says the Merritt Bakery on East 18th Street " is one of our last standing institutions ... and for a lot of seniors in and around the area , that 's the only place they know of . "
Reid and others acknowledge the money itself - a combination of federal and local dollars - wo n't stop the hemorrhaging .
So they also want the city to come up with technical assistance and a solution to the owners ' long - running parking battle with the next - door Albertsons supermarket .
Griffis blames the city for allowing the grocery store to be rebuilt at twice the size , and insists : " If you wreck my car , it 's incumbent on you to fix it . "
Even if , in Griffis ' case , he happens to drive a Ferrari .
FYI : The suspect arrested for allegedly throwing a 57 - year - old woman to the ground from a Muni platform in the Bayview in March is over 6 feet tall and weighs about 180 pounds .
He was released from Alameda County lockup on Jan. 21 with a monitoring bracelet on his ankle because he was facing robbery and burglary charges .
When he failed to show up in court on Feb. 25 , a warrant was issued for his arrest .
All this , and he was just 14 years old .
Ticket to ride : Muni chief Nathaniel Ford said fare - evasion patrols will be back on the buses within 60 days .
Ford pulled the cops after meeting a few weeks back with Mission District activists in Supervisor David Campos 'office .
At the meeting , Ford and Police Chief George Gascón listened to a litany of complaints about the police presence , the $ 75 fine for evading a fare and the police asking for IDs when writing up the tickets .
So Ford pulled the cops to give them " cultural sensitivity " training and to mount an informational campaign for riders .
" I just thought it was prudent to stop the program until we could do some more outreach , " Ford said - 60 days ' worth .
We 'll see .

The scandal enveloping Korea 's professional Starcraft scene appears to be worse than first believed , with eleven gamers under investigation amid allegations that gambling organisations have been running a " training institute " to lure players into illegal match - fixing .
Advertisement
As we reported last month , an investigation has uncovered widespread corruption in the upper echelons of Korea 's pro gaming circuit , with many of the nation 's top gamers accused of throwing matches in exchange for cash .
Advertisement
Eleven " athletes " are currently under investigation for throwing eleven matches between 2006 and 2008 , with illegal gambling cartels handing the players between USD $ 1,760 - 5,730 as " compensation " for losing a match most would have expected - and bet on them - to win .
In addition to the gamers , three online gambling companies are also under investigation , after it 's emerged that they had not only brokered the deals , but had been operating a " training institute for professional gamer hopefuls " , which doubled as a recruitment hub for fixing matches .

Astronomers reported today that they 've detected phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus , a possible biosignature of life on the planet .
The researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , University of Manchester , and their colleagues published the news in Nature Astronomy and in another paper submitted to the science journal Astrobiology .
From the New York Times :… READ THE REST
A 17 - year - old was found with nearly $ 40,000 worth of marijuana taped to his body in Douglas on Sunday , officials said Monday .
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers were screening travelers at the Douglas Port of Entry at about 6 p.m. when they noticed the teen wearing baggy clothing , according to a news release .
When the officers began to question him and check his identification , the boy appeared nervous , the release said .
Officers became suspicious and searched the teen .
They found eight packages of marijuana taped to his torso and inner thighs .
Officials said the boy , who was identified as a resident of Phoenix , was held for questioning and turned over to the Douglas Police Department .
By Simon Johnson , co-author of 13 Bankers
Here ’s where we stand with regard to democratic discourse on the future our financial system : leading bankers will not come out to debate the issues in the open ( despite being approached by reputable intermediaries after our polite challenge was issued ) – sending instead their “ astro turf ” proxies to spread KGB - type disinformation .
Even Larry Summers , who has shifted publicly onto the side the angels ( surprising and rather late , but welcome anyway ) , cannot – for whatever reason – bring himself to recognize the dangers inherent in our unstable and too - big - to - manage banks .
Or perhaps he is just generating excuses that will justify not bringing the Brown - Kaufman amendment to the floor of Senate ?
So let ’s take it up a notch .
I strongly recommend that the responsible congressional committees request and require all assistant secretaries at the US Treasury ( and other relevant political appointees over whom they have jurisdiction ) to appear before them early next week .
The question will be simple : Please share your calendar of meetings this weekend , and provide us with a complete accounting of people with whom you met and conversed formally and informally .
The finance ministers and central bank governors of the world are in Washington this weekend for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund .
As is usual , the world ’s megabanks are also in town in force , organizing big meetings and small dinners .
Through these meetings dutifully troop US treasury officials , providing in - depth and off - the - record briefings to investors .
Banks such as JP Morgan Chase and the other top tier financial players thus peddle influence , leverage their access , and generally show off .
They accumulate information from a host of official contacts and discern which way policymakers – their “ good friends ” – are leaning .
And what is the megabank whisper mill working on ?
Ignore the “ economic research ” papers these banks put out ; that is pure pantomime for clients - to - be - duped - later .
I ’m talking about what they are telling the market – communicated in specific , personal conversations this weekend .
They are telling people that , based on their inside knowledge , Greece and potentially other eurozone countries will default on their debt .
Perhaps they are telling the truth and perhaps they are lying .
Most likely they are – as always – talking their book .
But the question is not the substance of their whisper campaign this weekend , it is the flow of information .
Have they received material non-public information from US government officials ?
Show me the calendar of the top 10 treasury people involved , and then we can talk about whom to summon from the private sector to testify – under oath – about what they were told or not told .
There is no question that the megabanks derive great power and enormous profit from their web of official contacts .
We should reflect carefully on whether such private flows of information between governments and “ too big to fail ” banks are entirely suitable in today ’s unstable financial world .
Large global banks make money , in part , through nontransparent manipulation of information – this is the heart of the SEC charges against Goldman Sachs .
But the problem is much broader : the Wall Street - Washington corridor is alive and well on its way to another crisis that will empower , enrich , and embolden insiders ( public and private ) while impoverishing the rest of us .
The big players on Wall Street are powerful like never before – and they use this power to press for information and favors from sympathetic ( or scared ) government officials .
The big banks also appear hell - bent on abusing that power .
One consequence will be further destabilizing global financial markets – watch carefully what happens to Greece , Portugal , Ireland , and Spain at the beginning of next week .
It is time for Congress to step in with a full investigation of the exact flow of information and advice between our major megabanks and key treasury officials .
Start by asking tough questions about exactly who exchanged what kind of specific , material , market - moving information with whom this weekend in Washington .
( CNN ) --
Three Israeli choppers with 15 soldiers aboard and several commando boats were involved in a skirmish with activists on a flotilla seeking to defy an Israeli blockade and deliver aid to Gaza , a senior military official said Monday on condition of anonymity .
Nine people were killed in the resulting violence early Monday as Israeli troops attempted to stop the flotilla .
An Israeli commando said upon descending into a boat with ropes , he was immediately attacked by a group of people .
" They beat us up with metal sticks and knives , " he said .
" There was live fire at some point against us ...
They were shooting at us from below deck . "
Some of the soldiers were tossed from the top deck to a lower deck by the activists , and jumped in the water to save themselves , he said .
Activists grabbed soldiers and tried to hold them hostage , stripping them of their helmets and equipment , he said .
About 30 activists , all speaking Arabic , carried out the attack , he said .
Activists have said the Israeli soldiers opened fire on unarmed civilians .
Neither account could be independently verified by CNN .
Collection of the Supreme Court of the United StatesSupreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens announced his long - expected retirement Friday , meaning we can expect another testy / goofy / ” contentious ” confirmation process in the Senate this summer .
Stevens ’ retirement means a few other things too :
1 . The court loses an environmental rock star .
Stevens , appointed by Gerald Ford in 1975 , amassed an impressive record on environmental protection cases .
He consistently upheld the ability of federal agencies to regulate pollution , as Dan Farber details on Legal Planet .
In the influential Chevron v. NRDC ( 1984 ) , he wrote the majority opinion defending government agencies ’ ability to interpret ambiguous legislation , which enabled the EPA to set effective clean - air standards .
His crowning environmental achievement was writing the majority opinion in Massachusetts v. EPA ( 2007 ) , which ruled that heat - trapping pollutants endanger public health and the EPA has an obligation to regulate them .
( The Obama EPA is working on it . )
But Stevens ’ influence as the court ’s longest - serving member went beyond his votes .
Wrote The New York Times , “ beneath his amiable manner lay a canny strategist and master tactician , qualities he used to win victories that a simple liberal - conservative head count would appear to be impossible . ”
Whichever new guy or gal Obama chooses wo n’t be able to immediately replace that .
2 . The new justice will be a key vote on critical environmental cases .
( You do n’t get scoops like that just anywhere ! )
The state of Texas has already sued the EPA for seeking to limit CO2 emissions .
The National Association of Manufacturers , the American Petroleum Institute , and other manufacturing groups say they will do the same .
Any climate action the EPA undertakes will face a torrent of litigation .
Same for any climate / energy legislation , should it ever pass out of Congress .
You can expect at least some of these key cases to eventually be argued in front of the highest court in the land .
3 . Bad timing for a clean - energy bill , unless it ’s already screwed .
The summer confirmation process adds to an already cramped Senate calendar , which wo n’t make things any easier for a climate / energy bill ( or financial regulation or immigration reform ) .
And potential energy deal - broker Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee , so he ’ll be spending time on confirmation hearings and dealings .
Then again , time may have already run out for a climate / energy bill in 2010 .
Once a bill is finally introduced ( soon , they say ) , it will face five to six weeks of EPA review .
That puts things perilously close to midterm election season , when lawmakers become even more skittish about tackling major legislation .
“ I do n't want to go to class today , ” complains the tall girl in black tights and a smock top upon arriving at Heydon Park Secondary School .
“ All right , Jessica — maybe Mr. Thomas needs some help in the kitchen , ” suggests principal Iwona Kurman .
Her ash - blond hair just so , stylish in a grey sweater set with ruffles and dark slacks , Kurman is greeting students in the foyer .
This is something she does each morning as the yellow buses roll in just before 9 .
She knows every student 's name — and story .
“ Hello miss , I brought my permission form , ” one girl chirps as she rushes past .
“ Good for you — you do n't want to miss White Pine Camp , ” Kurman admonishes , referring to the school 's popular three - day trip in June .
“ My sister needs a TTC ticket to go to a job interview this afternoon .
Miss , can I get one ? ”
“ Okay , you see me later , ” Kurman says .
As the foyer empties , girls in the school 's co-op program gather by the front door for a trip to a nearby seniors ' home , where they will read to residents .
But Chantal — a 16 - year - old with Down syndrome — is missing .
Kurman nods knowingly .
“ I 'll find her .
I 'll check the washrooms . ”
And so begins another typical day at Toronto 's only single - sex public high school .
“ In all the talk about a possible boys school , no one seems to realize that we have been here forever , ” Kurman says .
“ And what we do here is very special . ”
Heydon Park has existed since 1962 but dates back to 1923 , when Toronto 's public school board opened two vocational schools — one for girls and another for boys — on the grounds of Huron St. Public School in the Annex .
It is unclear when the boy 's school folded .
But in 1926 , the girl 's school moved to the former Anglican Orphan 's Home on Dovercourt Rd. , south of College St. It was named Edith L. Groves Vocational School for Girls after a former school board trustee who had a passion for helping girls with special needs .
In 1962 , the school was rebuilt and renamed Heydon Park Secondary School .
It moved to its current D'Arcy St. location near the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2000 when the Dovercourt site closed .
About one - third of the school 's 200 students have mild intellectual disabilities , including a dozen girls who have Down syndrome .
Autism , Asperger 's syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome are other common conditions .
The rest of the student body is made up of girls with average intelligence who are considered “ high risk ” due to learning disabilities , mental health issues or behaviour problems .
Many come from troubled families and tough neighbourhoods .
Three are pregnant , a dozen are Children 's Aid Society wards , and some have suffered sexual or emotional abuse and been exposed to violence and even murder in their homes .
Many would be bullied , ostracized or just lost in a regular high school — if they attended at all , Kurman says .
Unless a surname is given , all the first names in this story have been changed .
In addition to regular high school credit courses , Heydon Park offers an array of non-credit courses including hospitality , child care and cosmetology .
An industrial kitchen teaches food preparation and provides a daily hot lunch for students and staff .
All of the girls can attend until they are 21 .
The intellectually disabled girls are placed at Heydon Park by the board 's special education department .
The rest are referred by their elementary or high school .
But some find the school on their own .
Two years ago , three Afghan sisters called Kurman to say their family would n't let them attend a co-ed high school and begged her to let them come to Heydon Park .
“ They found us on the Internet , ” she says .
“ Of course I let them come . ” Kurman suspected one of the sisters was in her mid-20s .
“ But I knew if I did n't accept them all , I would lose the 15 - year - old . ”
Later , the CAS became involved when the 15 - year - old confided that her family was forcing her to marry a man in the United States whom she did n't know .
Although some are reluctant to attend a girls - only school , most end up embracing it .
“ I love it , ” says 17 - year - old Milena , who is completing her second year .
“ It 's good because there are no guys to distract you so you can get your education over with .
It 's very laid - back and relaxed and all at your own pace . ”
Milena is taking parenting , nutrition , drama and cooking .
After high school she says she 'd like to go to university or college to study politics , ultrasound technology or pathology .
Kurman , 51 , grew up in Communist Poland where the disabled were shut away in institutions , schools were strictly academic and authoritarian teachers brooked no debate .
She escaped to Fredericton in 1981 and was working on her master 's in geology when she discovered a love for teaching — and switched to education .
She moved to Toronto in 1988 to look for work .
In 2003 , after 15 years of teaching high school science and serving as vice - principal at two schools , Kurman was offered the VP position at Heydon Park .
She has been principal for four years .
“ Many people warned me against coming here with my academic background , ” she says .
“ But I love it .
I just love these girls .
“ Teaching at Heydon Park is like being a locksmith , ” she continues .
“ You are constantly designing keys to figure out how to reach these students and keep them engaged . ”
But finding resources and giving them the support they need is always a struggle , she says .
“ You have to be a good teacher to teach here , because you create your own material , ” says Kurman , whose tiny stature and soft accent belie a tough - as - nails demand for excellence in her staff .
“ You have to have energy , patience and creativity .
And I 'm very lucky to have this in my staff . ”
“ When a student tells you to f--- off , you have to be able to accept that student back in the class , ” she says .
“ You can get away with being mediocre in another school .
But not here . ”
Kurman recounts the story of Amanda .
The troubled teen was sent to the office for answering a question in class with : “ Why should I bother to tell you , you f---ing b---ch ? ”
Kurman asked Amanda why she responded that way .
“ I was very angry .
You would n't understand . ”
Kurman pressed ahead .
“ That 's right .
I do n't understand .
So help me .
What 's going on ? ”
Amanda began to tell Kurman how she missed her father , who had been deported due to an immigration problem .
Kurman listened and related it back to the classroom incident .
“ So you are n't angry with your teacher , ” Kurman offered .
“ I was just angry . ”
“ But being angry does n't give you permission to say those things , ” Kurman continued .
“ I could apologize , ” Amanda said , finally .
Kurman : “ Yes .
You could .
Would you like to ? ”
And so Kurman called the teacher and Amanda apologized .
She was back in class the same day .
In any other school , she might face suspension .
“ It 's continuous counselling — it 's being a parent , which I love , ” says Kurman , who has a son completing medical school in Poland and a daughter studying biomedical science at the University of Guelph , as well as two step - sons : one a doctor and the other a nuclear medicine technician .
“ But it 's hard to become a parent at this stage , ” she acknowledges .
“ They have already been hurt so many times . ”
There have been some incredible success stories .
One girl had a co-op placement with the security detail at a hospital .
During her placement , she observed several job interviews for a vacant position .
When the student was asked for her impressions of the candidates , her response showed such powers of observation , the hospital ended up hiring her for the post , Kurman says .
Two years ago , student Krystal Nausbaum , who has Down syndrome , landed a starring role in an ABC made - for - TV movie , The Memory Keeper 's Daughter .
She has been accepted into Humber College 's Community Integration Through Co-operative Education program next fall and hopes to take film and television courses .
A 2009 graduate is playing semi-professional women 's hockey and has her eye on a spot on Canada 's Olympic team .
Cathy Mallove 's 15 - year - old daughter , Rebecca Geffen , is thriving at Heydon Park .
Rebecca has Prader - Willi syndrome , a rare genetic disorder characterized by an insatiable appetite and often accompanied by learning , social and motor problems .
She has attended neighbourhood schools in self - contained classes for students with intellectual disabilities since Grade 6 .
But Mallove was worried about sending her daughter to a mainstream high school .
She chose Heydon Park for the security and sense of community it offers .

“ It 's not a prissy girls ' school , ” says Mallove .
“ There is complexity about the population .
It 's the real world .
Rebecca is here because she has to live in the world . ”
But there 's a sense of understanding and solidarity that the real world often lacks .
“ Rebecca looks at the high - risk girls and gets them , ” Mallove says .
In fact , Mallove thinks the “ special ed ” girls understand their high - risk classmates better than anyone .
“ They start out not very friendly , but they are really very friendly , ” Rebecca tells her mother .
“ They do n't smile very much , Mom .
But they are very smart . ”
Heydon Park offers many of these tough girls the chance to be leaders and role models for students like Rebecca , says Mallove .
Where else would they get to be captain of the basketball team ?
Student council president ?
Or star of the school show ?
But there is heartbreak too .
Back in the principal 's office , Kurman prepares for a parent meeting .
The student functions at the Grade 1 or 2 level .
In addition , she is autistic and cries every day .
“ It 's very difficult when parents can't accept their daughter 's limitations , ” says Kurman .
“ It 's very stressful for the student when their parents insist on enrolling them in credit courses when it 's just not appropriate .
This is a girl who thrives in the non-credit courses .
It 's very sad to see . . . ”
Mallove understands .
“ When parents hear their son or daughter has a disability , it 's a loss , ” she says .
“ And it continues to be a loss .
Many parents and kids have n't dealt with that loss .
“ But once you let go of the kid that you thought you were going to have , it 's quite liberating .
For some parents , moving their daughter into a school for difficult kids is a leap . ”
Mallove , who is chair of Heydon Park 's parent council , says the differences extend to the parents , too .
There are the generally well - educated , middle - and upper - middle class parents dealing disabled children .
And there are the parents living in poverty , violence and disadvantage struggling to handle difficult children .
Mallove recalls the weeks she spent with Rebecca in the neonatal ICU ward next to many such parents with their preemies and underweight newborns .
“ I watched as these babies were discharged to homes with no food and no social service support . . .
Then they show up in the school system . ”
Heydon Park tries to bridge that divide every day .
“ When you grow up in a middle - class home , disability is the only problem , ” Kurman says .
“ Both parents are educated .
There is structure , support .
But that 's just what these other girls lack .
It 's what we try to provide . ”
At lunchtime , Kurman stops in hospitality teacher Mario Thomas ' kitchen to grab a plate of lasagna and salad the girls have made .
“ How are you doing Jessica ? ” Kurman asks the at - risk girl , who did n't want to go to class this morning .
“ Great , miss , ” she answers , stirring a pot of simmering tomato sauce .
“ You 're going to love the lasagna . ”
“ I 'm sure I will . ”
In the gym , Suzanna , a girl with Down syndrome , is breakdancing to the soundtrack of High School Musical , playing through her iPod headphones .
Her eyes light up when she sees Kurman .
“ This is for you Miss Kurman .
Watch . ”
Kurman waves her arms in the air and shakes her hips in encouragement as Suzanna boogies with abandon .
Across the street , a 16 - year - old who is already a mother to a 2 - year - old boy smokes with her friends .
The girl 's mother cares for the boy while she is in school .
Kurman tells them it is not healthy to smoke .
“ Well , miss , at least it 's not weed , ” one of them offers .
“ Yes , well , there 's that , ” Kurman says , not missing a beat as she summons them back to class .
One girl who lives in a group home went missing for two months last spring .
Police eventually found her outside Toronto and brought her back .
Kurman believes the student was the victim of a sexual predator .
She shudders .
Another student was involved in a fight outside the school .
She assaulted a girl with a broken bottle and was arrested .
But she 's back in school and working on her anger issues .
At the end of the day school social worker Irene Au-Yeung arrives to take Juliana to Surrey Place children 's mental health centre for a psycho-educational assessment .
The girl has already missed two appointments .
“ I 'm driving her there , ” Au - Yeung says .
“ Otherwise , she would n't go . ”
Au -Yeung believes the 19 - year - old may have an intellectual disability .
A diagnosis will give her access to an income through the Ontario Disability Support Plan , supportive housing and an adult protective services worker when she leaves Heydon Park .
“ This is not just a school , this is a safe place , ” Au - Yeung says .
“ Here they get attention , they learn , they get food , bus tickets , parenting , social interaction . ”
Au - Yeung can't imagine what would happen to Juliana and many other girls without Heydon Park .
“ They may not ever go to class , ” she says , “ but I 'm glad they are here . ”
Kurman is glad too .
“ Many of these girls travel two hours every morning to come here , ” she says .
“ There should be a school like this in every corner of the city .
And the boys should get one too . ”

UPDATE : We ( ozzeh , joshua , shadowmite and I ) just put the teaser site together for the EVO root .
More info coming soon : http://unrevoked.com
I ended up with a Sprint HTC EVO 4G after Google I /O .
It ’s a pretty fantastic phone , even though it ’s something of a kitchen sink .
By a happy coincidence , I ended up reconnecting with some of my buddies from the old mobile hacking days who were looking to root it .
With a few hours effort and a three person team ( credit to ozzeh and Joshua Wise ! ) , we managed to get the standard su tool installed .
This sort of disassembly and hacking really brought back memories .
Shadowmite introduced me to mobile phone hacking back in the day .
Back then we were doing stuff like porting Linux to the device and hacking the bootloader .
In any case , here ’s some screenshots .
We ’re not releasing any details on the root hack yet :
At this time , we believe that this specific exploit cannot be applied to Incredible .

" He moved one hand , took her two wrists and pinned them behind her , under his arm , wrenching her shoulder blades . "
So goes one of Ayn Rand 's sex scenes — are young objectivists learning to condone rape ?
Advertisement
In her fascinating post on the topic , the Washington City Paper 's Amanda Hess quotes the following passage from The Fountainhead :
She tried to tear herself away from him .
The effort broke against his arms that had not felt it .
Her fists beat against his shoulders , against his face .
He moved one hand , took her two wrists and pinned them behind her , under his arm , wrenching her shoulder blades .
… She fell back against the dressing table , she stood crouching , her hands clasping the edge behind her , her eyes wide , colorless , shapeless in terror .
He was laughing .
There was the movement of laughter on his face , but no sound .
… Then he approached .
He lifted her without effort .
She let her teeth sink into his hand and felt blood on the tip of her tongue .
He pulled her head back and he forced her mouth open against his .
Advertisement
What 's interesting here is n't the writing — leaden , as was Rand 's wont — but the reactions of some of the young people who read it and other works by Rand .
Hess talks to Angela Huynh , now 24 , who read The Fountainhead at 19 .
She says ,
Yes , there are elements of nonconsensual sex in that scene , but I was aware of Dominique 's feelings towards Roark and to me , she internally agreed to it .
I guess in the way that a lot of females may enjoy ‘ rough ' sex and want domination behind closed doors .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Huynh 's concept of " internal agreement " jibes with how many Randians view the scene .
Hess writes that Rand herself once said , " If it was rape , it was rape by engraved invitation . "
And Joshua Zader , founder of objectivist social network and dating site the Atlasphere ( which we wrote about in 2008 ) , says ,
Mamas , Do n't Let Your Daughters Date Objectivists

It was a welcomed rape is what it was .
It was a rape where both people wanted that sort of contact .
… Now , one hopes that not too many people would actually go out and treat a woman that way .
Advertisement
Of course , " welcomed rape " and " rape by invitation " are both contradictions in terms , but it 's worth asking whether Rand 's books inculcate teens with a view of sexuality based on violent male domination .
Kate , now a 22 - year - old college student and ex-Randian , says ,
[ I ]t's a little disconcerting that at 12 , 13 years old , I was stamping myself with this complete and total interest in submission , when I did n't have any experience with sex at all .
It 's an interesting seed to plant in a teenager 's mind that that 's how sex operates .
Advertisement
Kate says she now dislikes Rand 's philosophy and those who believe in it — but that she might return to the books " just purely for the pornographic effect . "
And 24 - year - old Angela Huynh felt lasting effects from The Fountainhead :
It changed the way I viewed men .
The way they are supposed to be .
Their motivations .
It also made me look for raw dynamics when it comes to relationships .
Advertisement
Everything we read at an early age affects us , and sexual material probably doubly so , and it's no surprise that Rand 's words have stuck with their readers well into adulthood .
The question is , are their effects damaging ?
If Randians really believe there 's such a thing as " welcomed rape , " the answer is obvious .
But what if The Fountainhead merely " plants a seed " in readers ' minds , much as any other book might ?
Should we worry if that seed is a rape fantasy ?
On the one hand , many men and women do fantasize about violent sex without acting or seeking it out — and those in the BDSM community can channel an appetite for dominance and submission into consensual sex .
Just because you dream about having your wrists pinned behind your back does n't make you a rape apologist .
On the other hand , what 's a little sad about the sex scene above is how run -of - the - mill it is .
So many of the sexual narratives teens are offered — on TV , in movies , in popular books , in ( mainstream ) porn — involve either implicit or explicit male domination .
Stories of female domination , of enthusiastic consent , of anything outside the male - aggressor - female - capitulator paradigm , are way less likely to plant their " seeds " in our nascent sexualities because they 're just so much rarer .
I would n't suggest anyone not read Ayn Rand — for one thing , that 's the number one way to make something more attractive — but I do wish the stories available to kids who are curious about sex were a little more various .
And better written .

â€ œThe Fed should have tightened earlier to avoid a festering of the housing bubble early on .
The Fed is facing a nightmare now : the recession will come and easing will not prevent it.â€ Nouriel Roubini , â€ œFed Holds Interest Rates Steady as Slowdown Outweighs Inflationâ€ , Wall Street Journal
Iâ€™m really baffled by the e-mails Iâ€™ve been getting lately .
A lot people have been blasting my predictions that the housing bubble will burst in 2007 and trigger a deep and painful recession .
They point to the Commerce Deptâ€™s recent report that â€œnew home sales rose 4.8 % in December after 7.4 % increase in November.â€ 
The tone of these e-mails is always the same : â€ œNeener , neener , neenerâ€ ¦you goofed up , you numbskull .
Admit you were wrong.â€ 
The implication appears to be that the housing bubble is some kind of left - wing conspiracy conjured up by paranoid loonies .
While that does fit my Bio. to some extent , the housing bubble is not a conspiracy theory and thereâ€™s overwhelming proof that the aftershocks will be excruciating .
Donâ€™t forget , the â€œhappy talkâ€ in the real estate section of the newspaper is designed to soothe jittery nerves and help sales , not give the reader an accurate picture of a market which is sinking quickly .
In fact , the hoopla over the â€œrise in new homes salesâ€ ignores the â€œrealâ€ story which appears in many of the same articles ; that is , â€ œ
In 2006 existing home sales declined by 8.4 % , the biggest drop in 17 years , and new homes sales fell by a whopping 17.3 % , the largest in 16 yearsâ€ .
This is the real scoop although it is predictably hidden in the fine print .
It signals the beginning of a long , downward spiral which will increase unemployment , shrink GDP , and send millions of homeowners into foreclosure and out onto the streets .
True , I donâ€™t have a crystal ball and Iâ€™m not proficient at reading the entrails of dead animals , but I have put together some of the relevant facts and I think they make the case more convincingly than the cheerleading realtors who appear in the Sunday newspapers .
I should add , though , that all this misplaced joy about the Commerce Dept.â€™s numbers has convinced Wall Street that the housing bust is just about over and that the economy will continue to strengthen .
That is a very bad sign because it means that the Federal Reserve probably wonâ€™t lower rates when it meets later this week .
The downside of the Fedâ€™s decision is that the 30 year mortgage rate is inching higher ( 6.33 % ) and is bound to put even more downward - pressure on new home sales .
Some of Wall Streetâ€™s heavy - hitters know that trouble is brewing and are finally putting out the red flags .
2 weeks ago Goldman Sachs indicated that â€ œthe US Federal Reserve will need to slash rates 3 times this year as the housing slump goes from bad to worse and the American consumer begins to buckleâ€ .
( Ambrose Evans - Pritchard â€ œUS Housing Bust getting worseâ€  )
â€ œWe believe that housing will soon become the â€˜straw that breaks the camels backâ€™ , said David Kostin , the investment bankâ€™s strategist .
Goldman Sachs said homeowners had treated windfall gains from rising house prices as if they were â€˜recurring incomeâ€™ using home equity withdrawals to subsidize over - stretched lifestyles .
This artificial boost to spending has already dropped from 7 % to 4 % of GDP over the last year , and is likely to halve again in 2007 .
Mortgage equity withdrawal will fall from 13 % of â€˜discretionary household cash flowâ€™ in 2006 to 7 % this year , causing spending power to contract for the first time since the dotcom bustâ€ .
Clearly , the wiz -kids at G - Sachs are not taken in by the 4.8 % jump in new homes sales in December .
They see the dark clouds forming on the horizon and are anticipating the approaching recession .
The mainstream media are starting to be more forthright , too .
CNN
Money reported last week :
â€ œAmericans continue having difficulties paying their mortgage obligations , with December foreclosure rates above the 100,000 mark for the 5th straight month .
The number of homeowners entering some stage of foreclosure process in December was 109,000 â€¦up 35 % from December 2005 according to Realty Tracâ€ .
It sounds grim , but the worst is yet to come .
Jim Willie at the goldenjackass.com provided this bleak look at the current housing market :
â€ œBeazer Homes stuck a hot poker in the heart of the dimwitted optimists who believe the housing market has stabilized .
Their spokesman said , â€ ˜We have yet to see any meaningful evidence of a sustained recovery in the housing marketâ€™ .
To back that statement up , they reported new orders were down 55 % from a year ago , and their cancellations are running at a horrendous 43 % rate .
People might sign contracts based on hearing the media news , and cancel those same contracts on a contrast with reality checks .
The Dec. existing homes sales came in at minus0.8 % , the largest decline in 24 years dating back to 1982 .
The official data contained a contraction which went overlooked on the shallow voices on CNBC .
The data claims that inventory levels fell by 7.9 % at the same time that sales fell in a big way .
Well , perhaps the inventory levels do not factor in the cancellations .
( They do not ) Bear in mind that 3 large homebuilders in recent weeks announced a collective $ 1.2 billion in land option losses .
The pain has not nearly ended for housing .â€ 
The signs of a major economic downturn are everywhere for those who chose to look beyond the cheery predictions in the real estate section of the news .
Next year , an estimated $ 1 trillion of ARMs ( Adjustable Rate Mortgages ) are due to â€œresetâ€  which will cause stiff increases in monthly mortgage payments .
Weâ€ ™re bound to see a steady rise in defaults as well as a boost in new claims for personal bankruptcy .
This downward cycle is just beginning .
In 2006 , a mere $ 300 billion in ARMs reset pushing overleveraged homeowners to the brink of insolvency .
Imagine what will happen in 2007 when $ 1 trillion of these explosive loans comes due .
And , of course , as more people are unable to hang on and their homes go into foreclosure ; inventory will continue to skyrocket .
Peter Schiff of europac.net summarized the situation this way :
â€ œThe recent jump in bond rates suggests that things are about to get much worse for the housing market .
Since January 5th interest rates have risen by over 30 basis points and gold has risen over $ 40 per ounceâ €
¦My guess is that rather than a bottom of the housing market , bond investors around the world are beginning to appreciate the inflationary implications of a real estate crisis .
A substantial decline in real estate prices will either produce a severe recession on its own or exacerbate one that arises from other factors .
In either case the result will likely be the Fed coming to the â€œrescueâ€ with inflationary monetary policy .
Inflation will push long - term rates higher , causing more loans to default .
With credit destroyed and home equity and jobs lost , foreign creditors will rush for the exits sending the dollar into a tailspin .
The Fed will be forced to buy all of the paper foreign lenders no longer want and that savings - short Americans cannot afford .
Domestic money supply will explode sending consumer prices soaringâ€ .
Schiffâ€™s calculations are exactly right ; a recession is just one effect of the deflating of housing bubble .
The other effects are even more serious ; the anticipated â€œflightâ€ of foreign capital from US markets and an impending currency crisis which is liable to dethrone the greenback as the worldâ€™s reserve currency .
The source of our current problem is complex ; deriving mainly from artificially low interest rates , currency deregulation ( which has helped to create the enormous account imbalances ) and shoddy lending practices .
Presently , Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass ) who is the new chairman of the House Financial Services Committee is leading the charge to enact â€œnationwide lending standards to protect consumers from deceptive unfair and predatory mortgage practices .â€ 
Frank intends to pass legislation that will put more pressure on lenders to make sure that borrowers fully understand the requirements of their loans and ensure that they are financially capable of making regular payments when their loans reset .
( increase )
But Frankâ€™s attempts at consumer protection through â€œsuitability standardsâ€ are too , little too late .
Mortgage debt has increased $ 4.5 trillion in just 6 years .
As interest rates rise and ARMs reset thereâ€™s no chance of a â€œsoft landingâ€ .
By the end of 2007 we should have a much better idea of the magnitude of the damage .
Frank is right , though , much of the dilemma stems from goofball loans cooked up by mortgage lenders trying to bulk up their commissions .
For example :
In 2000 , a mere 2 % of borrowers took out â€œnontraditional mortgagesâ€ .
( That is , mortgages that allow borrowers to pay only the loan interest or just a part of the interest each month without paying anything on the principal )
In 2006 , that number jumped to 35 % of all new mortgages !
Also , Piggyback loans ( which allow people to borrow the money for a down payment ) currently represent 25 % of all new mortgages .
Think about that !
The down - payment used to be proof that a loan - applicant was credit - worthy or financially responsible .
Now , mortgage lenders have abandoned that standard in order to generate more loans .
Finally , sub - prime loans now represent 20 % of all new mortgages , whereas , in 2000 , sub - primes were only 5 % of total loans .
These are the loans which are made to people with bad credit who typically pay considerably higher rates of interest .
According to the New York Times , nearly 20 % of these sub - prime borrowers will default in the next few years pushing 2.2 million borrowers into foreclosure .
Lenderâ€™s are also at risk from loans which donâ€™t require strict documentation of income .
In fact , 62 % of all mortgage originations go to people who simply state their earnings on the loan application without providing any proof from IRS records .
Thatâ€™s why they are commonly referred to as â€œliarâ€™s loansâ€ .
A recent survey found that over half of mortgage - applicants ( who donâ€™t produce verification of their income ) exaggerate their earnings by more than 50 % !
It is expected that many of these borrowers have purchased homes that are way beyond their means and will have a difficult time avoiding foreclosure once their ARM reset .
Liarâ€™s loans are just one of the many ticking time - bombs which now litter the entire mortgage industry .
In the last 7 years the total value of real estate in the US has increased by a mammoth $ 11 trillion ; the greatest expansion of personal debt in history .
This monstrous new liability has continued to bloat despite nationwide wage stagnation and declines in real wealth ( as per personal savings )
It is purely the result of seductively - low interest rates and reckless lending practices .
As Bill Fleckenstein says in his article â€ œFace it :
The housing bust is hereâ€ , most of the blame can be pinned on the Federal Reserve and their profligate monetary policies .
â€ œAlan Greenspan managed to make folks lives ultimately even worse , in attempting to bail out his equity bubble with a real estate bubble , â€ Fleckenstein avers .
â€ œLetâ€™s never forget who the un-indicted architect of this mess was : Alan Greenspan and the other merry pranksters at the Fed .
Of course , these folks didnâ€™t learn anything from the equity mania , and who will turn out to have gotten themselves trapped in the housing mania , really have only themselves to blame .
As I have been warning for at least a couple of years now , all of this was going to be wonderful until it wasnâ€™t .
That moment in time is upon us.â€ 
But whatâ€™s the point of recriminations and finger - pointing ?
The fact that we were all taken to the cleaners by the crafty bastards at the Federal Reserve wonâ€™t help us now .
The best plan is to figure out a way to get out of debt while preparing for the eventual crash .
Sooner or later , weâ€ ™re all going to be forced by circumstances to live within our means .
As for the notion that the housing bubble is a â€œleft wing conspiracyâ€ ; hereâ€™s a summary from the far - right â€ œWeekly Standardâ€  which draws many of the same conclusions :
â€ œJust as cheerleaders of the high tech bubble of the late 1990s developed ever more creative explanations for why traditional metrics of valuing stocks no longer applied , the same has been true during the housing bubble .
Housing bulls point to immigration , building restrictions , Baby Boomer demand for second homes , and other seemingly plausible justifications for skyrocketing home prices .
But examining the value of housing using time tested and common sense metrics such as price - to - income and priceâ € “ to - rent ratios suggest the gains in the bubble areas canâ€™t be explained by economic fundamentalsâ€¦ .
People are buying in the face of sky - high prices because theyâ€™ve seen many of their friends or relatives make a fortune in real estate ; besides ( they tell themselves ) no one knows real estate prices never fall .
As with the stock market during the tech bubble , many are basing purchasing decisions not on underlying value , but on what they think they can sell a property for in the futureâ € ” the very definition of a speculative bubbleâ€ ¦
Even flat home prices would therefore slow economic growth unless other parts of the economy rapidly accelerate .
But a hard landingâ€ ” meaning a recessionâ € ” is a real risk .
If home prices fall modestly , millions of homeowners will see their equity wiped out .
Many of those with the least amount of equity , as weâ€™ve already shown , are going to face significant increases in their monthly payments .
So what has been a virtuous but unsustainable cycle for the economyâ€ ” higher home prices , more borrowing against home equity , higher spending , increased job creation , even higher home pricesâ€ ” could easily reverse and become a vicious cycleâ € ” higher monthly payments , declining home prices , less spending , job losses , foreclosures , even lower home prices .â€ ( â€ œHousing Bubble Trouble :
Have we been living beyond our means ?

Itâ€™s better to look beyond the Pollyanna prognostications of the Commerce Department and the National Association of Realtors .

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed Monday Israel 's entrance into the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development saying it was a " seal of approval " which would attract many financial investors .

" Joining [ the OECD ] is like receiving a university degree , " Netanyahu said .
" Just as it is significant to have a degree from the Technion , for example , when entering the job market , entering [ the OECD ] will open doors and provide access to many fields .
It 's a seal of approval . "
Earlier Monday , the 31 members of the OECD unanimously voted in favor of accepting Israel as a member of the group , a senior Jerusalem source said .
In a special press conference , Netanyahu discussed the importance of the admittance into the Paris - based international economic group and noted several economic realities in Israel which the government would focus on improving .
" There is still too much centralization in the private business sector , " Netanyahu said of Israel 's economy , adding that " we intend to act adamantly to diminish this centralization . "

Netanyahu added that Israel was in the worst place in the world regarding bureaucracy , and said that " we are in a category of our own when it comes to bureaucratic complications . "
" Our goal is to climb to the 15 leading economies in the world for their gross national product , " Netanyahu said .
Israeli officials have said acceptance would be an important stamp of approval for the country 's economy , boosting its credit rating and strengthening ties with foreign investors .
Three OECD members - Switzerland , Ireland and Norway – had previously expressed reservations about Israel 's membership .
They have focused on the settlements , which Israel does not treat as a separate economic entity .
All new members require the approval of all 31 members .
Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman welcomed Israel 's acceptance into the prestigious economic organization , and said that it was " a stamp of approval for the country 's economy and its achievements in technology . "
" The resolution was unanimous , despite attempts by anti-Israel entities to prevent the acceptance of Israel into the OECD , " Lieberman said in a statement , adding that " the fact that the attempts failed is proof of Israel 's solid standing with the international community , and that it is recognized for its achievements , despite the fierce incitement against it in every conceivable arena : political , security or economic . "
Foreign Ministry officials earlier said that Palestinians had intensified their efforts to keep Israel out of the organization in recent days , saying that Israel infringes on Palestinians ' human rights and violates OECD values .
Israel says Palestinian Prime Minister Salem Fayyad called many of the leaders of OECD countries over the past day to argue against Israel 's acceptance .
One of the Palestinian arguments is that Israel provided false financial data by not separating out the data related to the settlements .
Israel had launched a campaign of its own to bolster support for its membership .

X -ray apparently of Osayed Qadus ' head showing a bullet lodged inside ( Source : Btselem )
The Israeli military has disciplined four officers involved in two clashes with West Bank protesters in which four Palestinians civilians were killed .
The events leading up to the shootings , less than 24 hours apart , " could have ended differently " , a military statement said .
Three officers have been reprimanded by military chiefs and one officer involved has been demoted .
But an Israeli rights group says the army inquiry does not go far enough .
Btselem is waiting for the results of a military police investigation into one of the incidents and pressing for another criminal investigation to be opened , a spokeswoman for the organisation said .
" The process that has been completed by the Israeli Defence Force is an internal operational debrief .
The question we 're raising is if these people were killed unlawfully , the proper avenue is a criminal investigation , " said Sarit Michaeli of Btselem .
' Rebuke '
The investigation into the incidents near the Palestinian villages of Iraq Burin on 20 March and in Awarta the day after was carried out by Israel 's top military officer , Chief of General Staff General Gabi Ashkenazi .
The chief of the general staff determined that the events could have ended differently from a professional standpoint and the difficult results could have been prevented
IDF Statement Row grows over West Bank deaths Israel blames troops for deaths
He has reprimanded the two commanding officers of the units involved .
One was was identified as Colonel Itzik Bar of the Shomeron Regional Brigade .
The other was only identified only as the " commander of the Nachshon Battalion " .
The demoted officer involved in the Awarta killings was only identified by his former rank of first sergeant .
A deputy company commander also faced a " rebuke " for his role in the incident at the Awarta checkpoint , the statement said .
" The chief of the general staff determined that the events could have ended differently from a professional standpoint and the difficult results could have been prevented , " the statement said .
Latest statement The Israel Defense Forces troops were deployed to Iraq Burin to prevent demonstrators getting to the Israeli settlement of Bracha .
A military police investigation is continuing into two of the killings
The IDF said in its latest statement that the squad had been cleared to use rubber - coated bullets against the protesters , who had , according to the IDF , thrown fire bombs at the unit .
Later , brothers Mohammed and Osayed Qadus died from wounds they sustained from shots fired by the IDF .
The Qadus family told the BBC in the days after the deaths that both youths were on their way home from college , and were not taking part in the protests , when they were shot .
An x-ray of what was said to be 15 - year - old Mohammed Qadus ' skull , released by human rights group Btselem , showed what appeared to be a bullet lodged in his brain .
But the IDF statement said they could not establish the veracity of the x-ray .
" The IDF could not verify the autopsy and could therefore not confirm that the rioters were in fact hit by live rounds , " the statement from the IDF said .
They said a military police investigation had been opened and is continuing .
" The investigation shows that the incident could have ended differently and with better results and seemingly could have avoided harm to civilians , " the statement said .
' In danger '
In Awarta the next day , the IDF statement said , soldiers opened fire on two Palestinian men who had " begun acting suspiciously " at a checkpoint .
One then attacked soldiers with a bottle .
The internal investigation becomes a forum for them to corroborate their testimonies , if indeed they acted unlawfully then talking amongst themselves is not the right way
Sarit Michaeli
" According to the general officer commanding 's investigation , one of the soldiers felt his life was in danger and fired at the Palestinian . "
A second man raised what was described as " a sharp object " and was also shot dead by the soldiers , the army investigation said .
It is not clear what the " sharp object " was .
" While the soldier , believing his life was at risk , acted subjectively , the chief of the general staff holds the officers responsible for training their soldiers to act in difficult operational situations . "
In the aftermath of the incident , local Palestinians told the BBC the two men were arrested before they were killed , on the basis of a phone call a village elder says he received from the military saying they were being held , before later hearing that they had been shot dead .
The military has demoted one of the soldiers manning the checkpoint , but a criminal investigation by military police has not been launched into the events at Awarta .
Btselem said that the military " operational debrief " which led to the disciplinary action might harm prospects for a criminal prosecution in the case of Iraq Burin .
" The internal investigation becomes a forum for them to corroborate their testimonies .
If indeed they acted unlawfully then talking amongst themselves is not the right way , " said Ms Michaeli said .

However he does , there is one certainty :
At the end of the third inning , a capacity crowd will rise and cheer the veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq in attendance .
Forty years ago , during Vietnam , veterans would have been booed .
As Americans commemorate Memorial Day , the culture has come a long way in celebrating the warriors , whatever one thinks of the war .
Veterans returning from Vietnam were called baby killers and war criminals ; Adm .
Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , remembers feeling uneasy wearing his uniform in public .
Today , veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq are celebrated at sporting events , in Memorial Day parades and by politicians of all persuasions .
The Department of Veterans Affairs ’ budget has doubled in the past eight years , and is up almost a third from three years ago .
Top officials from the administration of President Barack Obama — Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , Admiral Mullen and Eric K. Shinseki , the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs — win plaudits from the veterans ’ community .
This was n’t the case with several of their predecessors .

A chat with Tommy Chong , Tommy Chong interview , Cheech and Chong , Hey Watch This , Up In Smoke
Interviews Home / Movies Home / Bullz - Eye Home
Cheech and Chong are back , man !
Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong had been threatening a reunion for several years , but it was n’t until 2008 that the duo transformed their vague assurances into a full - fledged tour .
For those who were unable to catch the so - called “ Cheech & Chong Light Up America ” tour ( its name adjusted accordingly for other countries , of course ) , the guys captured one of the evenings on film and have just released it on DVD as “ Cheech & Chong ’s Hey Watch This , ” which is being appropriately advertised as “ their first joint venture in 25 years . ”
I ’d originally been booked to talk to both Cheech and Chong , but having been in the midst of battling an allergy attack which necessitated an unexpected trip to the doctor for some antibiotics , it seemed very possible that I might miss my window to talk with them at all .
When I finally made it back it onto the call , however , I learned that Cheech Marin had gone MIA long before our scheduled interview slot .
“ Something came up , ” I was told , “ and he ’s unavailable for the rest of the day . ”
It was a little disappointing , sure , but …hey , look , man , it ’s still Tommy Chong .
That ’s , like , almost better , you know ?*
* WARNING : You may need to be high to agree with this premise .
Tommy Chong : Bullz - Eye.com , huh ?
Good name !
Bullz - Eye : ( Laughs )
Thanks !
Well , I just finished watching “ Hey Watch This , ” and it was a lot of fun to see you guys back in action again .
TC : Oh , good , I ’m glad you liked it !
BE : Well , obviously , you guys have been back together for awhile now , but was there a specific impetus that led it to happen in the first place ?
TC : Um , I think it was when The Police went on tour .
They had no problems , and they hate each other .
( Laughs )
We figured that if they can bury the hatchet … and not in each other …then Cheech and I could .
And , y’know , I ’d always wanted to reunite with Cheech .
That ’d always been my plan eventually .
That ’s why I always stayed doing Cheech & Chong material .
BE : So when the time came to do this tour , how did you decide what characters to do ?
On the impetus for the Cheech & Chong reunion : " I think it was when The Police went on tour .
They had no problems , and they hate each other .
We figured that if they can bury the hatchet … and not in each other …then Cheech and I could . "
TC : I ’m kind of the writer guy , so I write the shows , and …well , y’know , Cheech ’ll be , like , “ Whatever .
Whatever works . ” ( Laughs )
He ’s easy .
The great thing about us is that I ’ve got a good sense for how to start stuff and Cheech has a really good way of finishing and putting the polish on it , so we make a good team that way .
And now we ’ve got my wife and Cheech ’s son involved , so we really do have a nice little acting troupe going .
I just love it .
BE : As far as the old material goes , did you just kind of go through a gradual process of finding out what still worked and what did n’t ?
TC : Not really .
We knew that anything we ’d do would work .
It was just , “ What do we want to do ? ”
We had to make some choices , you know .
It was like a casting call .
“ Hey , do you think you can still get on your knees and do the dogs ? ” “ Yeah ! ” “ Okay , then let ’s do the dogs ! ”
And then for the second show , it ’s , like , “ You know what ?
Let ’s not do the dogs anymore . ” ( Laughs ) “ Let ’s do this instead . ”
But it ’s just been … I mean , we ’re icons , man !
When we first come on the stage , there ’s such loud applause that you can almost just go home after that .
It ’s that warming .
So we know that whatever we do is going to be received well , and we take advantage of that and do stuff that we ’ve never done before .
BE : What ’s your favorite of the new material you ’ve brought out ?
TC : Right now , I think it ’s Cheech singing “ Does Your Mama Know About Me ? ”
That might be my favorite moment of the whole show , because there ’s no comedy there .
It ’s just a straight song .
And there ’s no orchestra : it ’s just me and Cheech .
And it ’s a heartfelt song .
And I love the fact that it ’s being sung again and heard again .
That ’s nice .
I love that .
BE : Of the classic material , I think the stuff that resonated the best for me was “ Let ’s Make A Drug Deal , ” which absolutely still holds up …
TC : ( Laughs ) Oh , yeah !
That ’s a good one !
I want to do a DVD where you teach kids algebra by using drugs as a working tool .
BE : … and the Blind Melon Chitlin ’ bit was hilarious .
TC : I love Blind .
Blind is … that ’s us .
( Laughs )
That ’s a very funny bit .
Blind is one of my favorites , too .
BE : Now , I know you guys both did a “ South Park ” episode , but you recorded your parts independently of each other .
TC : Yep .
BE : Was that not long before the reunion talks got started ?
TC : No , I think it was just before that .
( Hesitates )
No , wait , that might ’ve actually kicked it off .
That might ’ve started the whole thing going , yeah .
BE : I just knew that it was n’t too terribly long after that when you guys did the “ Get Out and Vote ” bit for FunnyOrDie.com .
TC : That ’s right .
For Obama ! ( Laughs )
Now that was the first thing we ’d really done together as Cheech and Chong in 25 years or whatever .
BE : Was it hard to find the chemistry again , or was it like riding a bike ?
TC : It was n’t hard on my part , but Cheech …he had to lose 25 years of going the other way .
( Laughs )
But he turned it around .
He had a hard time …man , this is so funny , ‘ cause he spent so much time trying to convince everybody that he was a serious actor , and the next thing you know , he ’s teamed up with me again .
There goes that theory !
BE : It was pretty surreal seeing him standing on the stage in his red cap again .
TC : Oh , God , yeah .
I told him we looked like 5th place finishers in a Cheech & Chong lookalike contest .
( Laughs ) I mean , we were n’t even close .
Not second place .
Fifth !
BE : I wanted to ask you about a couple of the non-Cheech & Chong films that you guys worked on .
What do you remember about working on “ Yellowbeard ” ?
TC : I hung with Peter Boyle .
When Peter Boyle saw us , man , it was like we were long - lost cousins or something .
We shot it in Mexico , and we were always on the boat most of the time .
Boat shoots are tough , with a lot of down time , but …
( Starts to laugh )
What else do I remember ?
That ’s about it .
Oh , and Marty Feldman died .
I gave him some advice and told him to get acupuncture and that he ’d feel better .
He said , “ Oh , thank you very much , I feel much better . ”
And a few hours later he died .
BE : So , uh , have you done acupuncture since then ?
TC : Oh , sure .
I do it all the time .
BE : Fair enough .
What was the experience of “ After Hours ” like ?
TC : “ After Hours ” was great .
It was great working with ( Martin ) Scorsese , and it was so toned down from a Cheech & Chong shoot .
It was so …minimalist .
Like , Scorsese ’s mother cooks the meal for the crew !
One of those things .
A real low , low , low budget , with hardly anyone around when you were shooting , but it was a lot of fun .
It was weird working at night .
I ’m not really a night person , and I ’m not thrilled with night work , but when you ’re doing films , sometimes that what you ’ve got to do .
BE : A question about one of your recordings : I ’ve always wondered how you guys managed to get George Harrison , Billy Preston , and that host of solo Beatles sidemen ( Klaus Voormann and Nicky Hopkins also appear ) to play on “ Basketball Jones . ”
On selecting material for their concerts : " We knew that anything we ’d do would work .
It was just , ' What do we want to do ? '
I mean , we ’re icons , man !
When we first come on the stage , there ’s such loud applause that you can almost just go home after that .
It ’s that warming .
So we know that whatever we do is going to be received well , and we take advantage of that and do stuff that we ’ve never done before . "
TC : Well , we were in the studio at the time George was recording .
George , Joni Mitchell , and everybody were all in A&M Studios .
It was just one of those magical times when the mood just went up .
We did n’t even hear them do it !
I was n’t there when George played .
I saw him set up , but then Cheech and I were working on something else , so Lou Adler did all the music .
When we heard the track , we were , like , “ Whoa ! ”
BE : Do you know if George was a fan ?
TC : Oh , George was a big fan , but he was n’t …he just said , “ I suppose it ’s funny . ”
He was n’t into the humor as much as he was , say , the Chicanos , for sure .
But George was a great friend to us .
I knew him quite well , and I loved George .
He was a real solid guitar player .
BE : Do you have a favorite “ Earache My Eye ” cover ?
TC : I like…uh , what ’s that hard rock band ?
BE : Korn did one .
TC : Korn .
That ’s it .
I think Korn ’s was one of the best .
BE : I was listening to Soundgarden ’s version earlier today .
TC : Oh , yeah ?
How was it ?
BE : It was great .
They did it as a medley with Spinal Tap ’s “ Big Bottom . ” ( Laughs )
TC : Ohhhhhhh .
Okay .
BE : What do you think is the most underrated Cheech & Chong movie ?
TC : Probably “ Things Are Tough All Over . ”
Yeah , it was a little touchy because it came as the oil embargo was happening , and we were making fun of Arabs in it .
We became Arabs , in fact .
But it was fun .
I really enjoyed the movie and so did Cheech , but it , uh , did n’t really kill at the box office .
( Laughs )
BE : How do you rate “ The Corsican Brothers ” ?
TC : Well , personally , I liked it .
I mean , I directed it , but it was my wife ’s first role ever , and I thought she did really good , and I thought Cheech ’s performance was just outstanding .
But it was the first movie where Cheech did n’t want to do any drugs in it .
He ’s , like , “ Let ’s not do the drugs .
Let ’s not be the dopers in this movie . ”
And it was the only movie that really failed at the box office , but Orion went out of business almost simultaneously , so that did n’t exactly help , either .
But , yeah , I enjoy it .
That was our swan song , the last movie that Cheech and I did together , so it had a lot of meaning to me .
BE : There ’s been talk of a new movie .
I know you ’ve got the animated feature coming up , but there are also rumblings of an “ Up in Smoke 2 . ”
Are those just rumblings ?
TC : No , no , that ’s definitely happening .
I ’m into the third rewrite … ( Laughs ) … so I know where it ’s at , and it ’s gonna be really good .
You know , I ’m going back to basics .
I ’m going back to Pedro and Man .
But I ’m also adding a few other characters that ’ve never been on screen before .
I ’m looking at this as being a really important movie .
BE : I liked the fact that you took the time in the concert film to talk about your jail time .
TC : Oh , yeah .
People never forget that .
I bring it up in conversation at various functions when there is n’t even any reason to !
I went to a function about pediatrics , and the next thing you know I ’m talking about jail !
( Laughs )
BE : You kind of touch on it in the film , but what ’s the strangest thing that you personally have ever used to make a bong ?
TC : Let me think …
( Drifts off )
God , there ’ve been a few things .
Probably the Tampax tube , though .
BE : Oh , so that was n’t just a punchline ?
TC : Oh , no .
It did have a real familiar taste !
( Laughs )
BE : You guys turned up on WWE Raw recently .
TC : We ’ll be on “ Dancing with the Stars ” next .
( Laughs )
BE : Are you a wrestling fan ?
TC : I love wrestling .
I mean , they ’re actors , but they ’re stuntmen that really get in there and do some serious fighting .
I love it .
BE : We ’re heading into the sunset here , but …why do you think sketch comedy is n’t as popular as it used to be ?
TC : Because nobody ’s really doing it .
Other than “ Saturday Night Live , ” I ca n’t think of any other sketch people .
I mean , maybe there are .
There ’s , what , “ Whose Line is It , Anyway ? ”
Those guys are so good at what they do .
But there are still guys who are doing bits .
The sketch comedy that I liked growing up … ( Long pause ) C’mon , brain !
Uh…Mel Brooks and Sid Caesar !
I love bits where you laugh ‘ til you hurt yourself .
Carol Burnett sketches , Tim Conway , those kind of crazy sketches .
But you know who I really miss the most on the comedy circuit ?
Steve Martin .
I really miss Steve Martin .
I wish he ’d go back to doing comedy .
I ’m not really a big bluegrass fan .
( Laughs )
BE : Yeah , after I read his autobiography about his stand - up years , I was really jonesing to see him do stand - up again .
TC : Yeah !
I mean , to me , he ’s a genius of comedy .
He still is .
He ’s not a big Cheech & Chong fan or a Tommy Chong fan at all , but I ’m a big fan of his comedy .
He was just brilliant .
I saw him live , and I could n’t believe how brilliant this guy was .
BE : Um … the way you said that , do you know for a fact that he ’s not a Cheech & Chong fan ?
TC : Wellllllll , yeah , you can pick up that vibe , you know .
Like , Richard Pryor was .
When we performed , we got off the stage and he helped us off .
That was the respect he paid .
He paid us huge respect .
And I studied under Richard .
He did n’t know it , but he appeared in … there ’s a club in Hollywood that ’s not there anymore , the Bitter End West , and Richard opened the club .
He did something like four days there in a row , and I was there every night , studying comedy .
I saw how he put a show together , and I ’ve used it ever since .
Yeah , he was a fan .
You can tell people who are our fans and who are n’t our fans .
I really liked Richard .
George Carlin was never a really big fan , but I was always a fan of his .
I loved George Carlin .
BE : Who ’s the most surprising person that ’s turned out to be a fan of yours ?
TC : Well , there are a couple .
There ’s Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands .
BE : ( Laughs ) Really ?
" (' The Corsican Brothers ' ) was the first movie where Cheech did n’t want to do any drugs in it .
He ’s , like , ' Let ’s not do the drugs .
Let ’s not be the dopers in this movie . '
And it was the only movie that really failed at the box office .
But Orion went out of business almost simultaneously , so that did n’t exactly help , either . "
TC : Yeah , she ’s a big fan .
Whenever we did a movie , she used to get a disguise and drive to the nearest town to sneak in and see it , then go back to the palace .
( Laughs )
Who else was a big fan ?
Peter Sellers .
Peter Sellers was one of our biggest fans ever .
We went over to England , and Peter brought us over just so that he could see us and welcome us to the country .
Oh , God , he was such a beautiful guy .
And funny .
We hung together more than a few times .
I ran into Peter a couple of times .
We were good friends .
BE : Well , it ’s been a real pleasure talking to you , Tommy …
TC : Oh , thank you !
BE : … but I have to say that , personally , I ’m feeling the irony that I ’m interviewing you and yet have never actually smoked pot .
TC : ( Bursts out laughing )
Well , that shows you !
You do n’t need it .
It ’s medicine .
You do n’t need medicine unless you ’re sick .
BE : At this point , I ’m really only maintaining my status so that I can use it against my daughter when she grows up .
TC : Oh , I love that !
( Laughs )
And , you know , hopefully you ’ll never have to do that .
BE : Hopefully not .
Though , in truth , if that situation rears its head , it really would n’t bother me that much .
I would n’t be thrilled , but in the end , the decision not to smoke pot was my own .
I ’m not against pot .
I just have n’t smoked it .
TC : Good for you , man .
And I love your open mind .
That ’s great .
BE : Actually , now that we ’re here , we should probably close by discussing the proposal for the legalization of marijuana in California .
I , uh , presume you ’re in favor … ?
TC : Well , totally .
( Laughs )
It ’s a no-lose situation for us potheads , because it ’ll show America how many people want it legal .
Even if it does n’t pass , they ’re still going to have to live with the fact that it is a medical necessity .
And the other thing is that , if it does pass , it ’s going to help save the planet with hemp , because hemp products can replace all plastic products .
Did you realize that ?
BE : I did .
I ’ve read that .
TC : Yeah , I mean , they can make cars out of it .
They can make anything out of hemp … and it ’s biodegradable , so it ’s not going to ruin our ecosystem .
BE : My fingers are crossed for you .
All right , Tommy , it ’s been a pleasure talking to you .
: You , too , my friend .
Take care !

The mother of a boy who had the wrong kidney removed in a Dublin hospital has said that she asked staff to check the correct operation was planned before her son went into theatre .
The boy is likely to require dialysis for the foreseeable future , or a kidney transplant , following the procedure at Our Lady 's Children 's Hospital in Crumlin , Dublin , in March 2008 .
The Medical Council today began a fitness to practise inquiry into allegations of professional misconduct against the two doctors involved .
The boy , identified only as Master Conroy , was under the care of consultant paediatric surgeon Professor Martin Corbally .
He delegated the surgery to be performed on 21 March 2008 to specialist registrar Sri Paran .
The doctors face allegations that the standard of care fell below what was expected .
The inquiry has been told that the boy 's parents were concerned that the wrong kidney had been selected for the surgery .
The boy 's mother said she was upset to hear in January 2008 that Master Conroy , who was six at the time , would need an operation .
The woman said her son had medical problems after birth and had a previous operation .
She said the consultant at the Crumlin hospital , Prof Corbally , said her son would require an operation on his right kidney .
Before the operation in March 2008 , she raised concerns with a junior doctor and a nurse about the side planned for the operation and asked staff to confirm that the correct operation was to take place before her son went to theatre .
The boy 's father told the inquiry that he signed the consent form for the operation .
He said he became frustrated as he could not get a definitive answer as to which side the operation would be performed .
The inquiry was also told that Prof Corbally failed to adequately review radiological imaging in January 2008 and erroneously recorded the left kidney for a nephrectomy .
It is alleged that Mr Paran also failed to adequately review the imaging and did not raise the concerns the parents had with Prof Corbally .
In a statement , Prof Corbally said he incorrectly listed Master Conroy for the removal of the left , rather than the right kidney .
He said he was ultimately responsible for the patient 's safety and again unreservedly apologised for the tragic episode .
The inquiry has adjourned until September .
WASHINGTON — President Obama completed a first meeting of world leaders on combating nuclear terrorism with a list of specific commitments from dozens of nations to eliminate or lock down nuclear materials , in what he called a “ bold and pragmatic ” program to finish the task in the next four years .
But in a news conference after leading the conversation among 47 presidents , prime ministers and senior officials , Mr. Obama acknowledged that tough choices lay ahead on many of the far more politically volatile issues in stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons .
He issued a specific warning to Iran , which was not represented at the conference , saying that after four years of failed efforts on sanctions , the penalties he was trying to win at the United Nations Security Council had to be significant enough to get the attention of the Iranian leadership .
Speaking to reporters , Mr. Obama said he had insisted to President Hu Jintao of China that in dealing with Iran : “ Words have to mean something .
There have to be some consequences . ”
A DANCE school is offering pole - dancing classes for 10 - year - olds .
The six - week course , available for 10 - to 16 - year - olds , costs just £ 30 ( $ 45 ) and was touted as a healthy form of exercise , Britain 's Sunday Mirror reported .
But parents and local politicians disagreed , calling it " disgusting " and the " premature sexualisation of children " .
Chris Hyde , whose 13 - year - old daughter takes other classes at the Fusion Dance School in the coastal resort of Blackpool , in eastern England , said : " It 's disgusting someone has come up with this .
" I think most parents would be pretty upset if they knew that 's what children are doing . "
Local council leader Peter Callow said that the classes were " totally inappropriate " .
But class teacher Carolyn Armstrong said the course did not cover the " sleazy side of pole " .
" People get the wrong end of the stick , " she said .

After spending some time with the Palm Pre in the Smartphone Round Robin , we became quite smitten with the form factor .
The vertical slider is rather unique in the smartphone industry and it's surprising that out of all the Android form factors available , no one has put out a Pre - like device .
Well , no more .
Say hello to the ZTE Smooth which is as close to a rip off design of the Palm Pre as possible , except it does n't manage to capture any of that Pre magic .
The ZTE Smooth is a lower end Android phone -- runs Android 1.6 on a 2.8 - inch QVGA screen and comes with your typical slew of connectivity options , it 's expected to release in August ( assumedly in China ) but will probably never hit stateside .
We still think a Pre-styled device is worth exploring but we 'd rather have HTC or Motorola try to tackle it than ZTE .
Nice try though .

Considering what she told Entertainment Weekly about “ Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen , ” we ’re willing to bet Megan Fox is n’t crying too many tears over losing her spot in Michael Bay 's third installment .
A rep for Paramount confirmed to CNN that Megan Fox wo n’t be back to reprise her " Transformers " role of Mikaela Banes for a third time .
So did she want a third movie ?
“ Sure , ” Fox told EW .
“ I mean , I can't [ expletive ] on this movie because it did give me a career and open all these doors for me . "
But , she went on , " I do n't want to blow smoke up people 's [ expletive ] .
People are well aware that this is not a movie about acting .
And once you realize that , it becomes almost fun because you can be in the moment and go , ' All right , I know that when he calls Action !
I 'm either going to be running or screaming , or both . ' ”
Huh .
Well then – any ideas for who should be cast in her place ?

Crazy Dave 's Death Trap
in which Dave and Emily attempt to build a Seven , with minimal knowledge and experience , but plenty of tea
A Muni bus kept driving this morning even as passengers yelled from the back of the bus that the vehicle had struck a bicyclist on Market Street , witnesses and a Muni spokesman said .
A rider on the 5 - Fulton bus said she heard a thump and then yelling as the bus headed east on Market near Fifth Street at about 8:30 a.m .
" People on the back of the bus said , ' You need to stop the bus !
You need to stop ! ' " said Mary Chanzey .
" ( The driver ) would n't stop , which I think is really crazy . "
Judson True , a spokesman for the Municipal Transportation Agency , said initial reports were that the cyclist fell and " the bus then ran over the front wheel of the bicycle . "
There was no indication that the bus hit the cyclist , he said .
But the driver should have stopped , True said .
" It is clearly the policy that if an operator is informed of a possible collision , that he or she should stop the vehicle and call central control , " True said .
" We received a report from another bus of a bicyclist down . "
The 5 - Fulton driver did pull over briefly past the crash and told passengers that the bicyclist had fallen by herself , Chanzey said .
The bicyclist was conscious and appeared to have a scrape on her head as she was loaded into an ambulance in a neck brace .
Her injuries are not believed to be life - threatening , True said .
The driver 's name has not been released .
Muni officials and police were investigating the incident and interviewing the driver .
TMZ has learned Kal Penn -- aka Kumar from that " White Castle " movie -- was robbed at gunpoint early this morning while walking in a neighborhood in Washington D.C .
Law enforcement sources tell TMZ Penn claims a man carrying a gun approached him around 1:20 AM and took his wallet and other personal property .
We 're told Penn immediately reported the incident to authorities , who have launched an investigation into the matter .
All of us in the liberal arts are in the business of being asked what it is we study , and upon answering , getting a “ pfft .
What are you going to do with that ? ”
For political science , the usual dismissive question is “ Are you going to be a politician ? ”
It seemed to me at first that most people could n’t conceive , for example , of voter behavior in new democracies as a worthy area of investigation , or how one would analyze / model whether checks and balances are properly functioning .
I suspect nowadays there ’s a lack of imagination at play to some degree , but also that there ’s something about political science – esp. political philosophy – that ’s genuinely threatening .
In this democracy , the right to vote / run for office / express oneself , in short the right to rule , presupposes no knowledge or qualification in many cases .
A political scientist , by his very title , is saying that knowing something about politics might be an important thing .
It may be the case knowledge prior to action is more fundamental than any declaration of right .
The Declaration makes it clear in specifics why governing bonds had to be broken .
To merely be articulate about law , justice , or how politics functions is to implicitly claim a right to rule .
Political philosophy is even more threatening perhaps , as political philosophy imagines alternative regimes and how / by whom they would be ruled .
The figure of Socrates seems to have nothing to do with any of this .
He stood around in the agora , barefoot , away from a wife famed for her abusiveness .
He had more than a passing interest in handsome young men and one wonders if the turn to philosophy – properly speaking , Socratic erotics – was necessitated because more direct advances were failing .
Such a man cannot possibly be political ; he seems utterly useless and ineffectual .
In the Lysis , Socrates expresses enormous concern with finding a true friend .
Political claims arise from faction , but what if one cannot join or form any faction ?
This in a sense non-social , powerless life somehow transcended a radical individualism into which it may have collapsed .
The key may be less political and more personal .
Most of us work with a “ truth ” that is really opinions with which we can be comfortable .
But think of someone who could get you to exchange that comfort zone for at least one more true thing , just one .
Such a person would be a teacher and a friend , even though the teaching has no formal content ( it is literally value - less ) , and a friend despite demanding more than giving .
The philosophic life introduces a new hierarchy based on the mere approach to knowledge .
It directly challenges politics in the broadest sense , which consists of propositions such as “ the oldest is best ” or the sovereignty of the popular will .
Some argue that Socrates established political philosophy in order to protect philosophy from politics .
I agree somewhat but this very cursory look at political philosophy and Socrates has me thinking two things .
First that the use of reason is an implicit claim to rule in public life .
Most of us can accept that after some thought .
The radical reorganization of private life it can demand , though , is at once impossible and necessary .
A quick glance at Plato ’s Republic does reveal it to be the city philosophy built .
It is a nonsensical city filled with ironies and requiring severe injustice to come about .
No one who attempted to establish such a republic literally would be a philosopher .
But that city when established may be just simply , and we note justice is the end of all government .
Those who remember the sorry saga of the Iraq war no doubt recall the numerous , shifting explanations of why the US attacked an unprovoked invasion of a country that had no ability to mount an attack on the US .
Once the canard of “ weapons of mass destruction ” was dismissed , one of the next set of bogus explanations was that Osama bin Laden was in cahoots with Sadaam Hussein .
That was implausible on its face ; bin Laden had tried to destabilize Iraq , and various leaks from intelligence sources disputed the Administration lies party line ( see here and here for example ) .
Bush eventually ‘ fessed up that there was no connection between Iraq and al Quaeda .
But there was no risk in denying the myth at that point .
Indeed , it turns out that our brains are wired so badly that mentioning two ideas as being connected , whether to claim they are linked or to deny it , serves to reinforce the belief that they ARE connected .
Call it “ the lady doth protest too much ” effect .
A 2007 Washington Post article explains :
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently issued a flier to combat myths about the flu vaccine .
It recited various commonly held views and labeled them either “ true ” or “ false . ”
Among those identified as false were statements such as “ The side effects are worse than the flu ” and “ Only older people need flu vaccine . ”
When University of Michigan social psychologist Norbert Schwarz had volunteers read the CDC flier , however , he found that within 30 minutes , older people misremembered 28 percent of the false statements as true .
Three days later , they remembered 40 percent of the myths as factual .
Younger people did better at first , but three days later they made as many errors as older people did after 30 minutes .
Most troubling was that people of all ages now felt that the source of their false beliefs was the respected CDC .
The psychological insights yielded by the research , which has been confirmed in a number of peer - reviewed laboratory experiments , have broad implications for public policy .
The conventional response to myths and urban legends is to counter bad information with accurate information .
But the new psychological studies show that denials and clarifications , for all their intuitive appeal , can paradoxically contribute to the resiliency of popular myths .
Even worse , when an erroneous belief is confronted frontally , people still cling to it if it supports an outcome to which they are attached .
For instance , surveys found that Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to believe in a Saddam - Osama connection , even after Bush had repudiated it .
An article in Sociological Inquiry describes how survey participants who had believed in a Saddam - Osama connection responded when presented with information that the relationship did not exist , including the 2005 climbdown by Bush himself :
Notice : only 1/6 changed their minds , with the vast majority merely denying that they had ever held the incorrect belief .
Only 2 % of the total engaged in “ Bayseian updating ” meaning absorbing the new information and rethinking their position .
This is a long winded into , but it serves to establish two points :
1 . Per the CDC example , it is n’t hard to implant beliefs , particularly when they are perceived to come from authoritative sources 2 .
Once someone is attached to a belief ( or to something that the belief bolsters ) it is hard to dislodge
Yves here .
So the latest troubling sighting is efforts to turn “ democracy ” into a suspect word .
While it may seem loopy to raise this as a concern , “ liberal ” was not all that long ago seen in the US as a positive , or at worst , descriptive term .
Now “ liberal ” is so discredited that The Position Formerly Known As Liberal has either crept with its tail between its legs to the center , but still maintains that it is liberal , or is now called “ progressive ” , but that too is rapidly losing positive brand association , since pretty much everyone has figured out that Progressive = The Position Formerly Known As Liberal .
So do n’t kid yourself that even cherished concepts like “ democracy ” are immune to reimaging .
From the Salt Lake Tribune ( hat tip reader bubaroth ) :
Some Utah County parents are calling on the Alpine School District to stop spreading “ false educational ideas . ”
First and foremost , the parents say , the district needs to clamp down on its use of the D - word : “ democracy . ” …
Alpine ’s mission statement is “ Educating all students to ensure the future of our democracy . ”
But this nation is a republic , not a democracy , said Oak Norton , a Highland father of five and the founder of Utah ’s Republic .
The Constitution guarantees every state a “ republican form of government . ”
“ Karl Marx said , ‘ Democracy is the road to socialism , ’ ” Norton said .
A true democracy , he said , relies solely on majority rule and inevitably devolves into anarchy , which then sprouts socialist dictators .
Yves here .
Um , the Weimar Republic descended into fascism , the first French Republic led to the First Empire under Napoleon … but never mind .
See Saddam hearts Osama 2.0 in the little Karl Marx quote ?
Whoever is the evil genius behind the smear campaign on democracy knows the psychological tricks .
And why are some people so tetchy pedantic about the use of the word “ democracy ” ?
Because they see it as linked to The Position Formerly Known As Liberal .
In other words , they ’ll attack the idea of democracy if that ’s what it takes to defeat those ( what , gay lovin ’ ?
abortionists ?
godless ? ) progressives :
Jowers said he received some of the same criticism about the D - word as chairman of the Governor ’s Commission on Strengthening Utah ’s Democracy .
“ There seems to be a segment of the population who is worried not just about being technically precise on these words … but somehow interprets a move to democracy as some type of a progressive movement that needs to be stopped , ” [ Kirk ] Jowers [ director of the University of Utah ’s Hinckley Institute of Politics ] said .
“ For the most part , when people talk about strengthening democracy , they ’re talking about getting more people in the United States involved in our politics and government and more nations in the world being subject to elections instead of dictators . ”
Yves here .
While this so far looks to be an isolated event , struggles over cultural norms are often fought via the public education system , so this bears monitoring .
Religious right fumes after Arnold signs gay rights bill
RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday August 29 , 2006
The religious right is fuming after California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed a law that requires schools that receive state funds to introduce nondiscriminatory practices relating to sexual orientation , RAW STORY has learned .
California Assemblyman Doug LaMalfa said earlier that this month that the bill would result " in tremendous crippling , if not complete destruction , of Christian Universities and colleges all throughout California . "
" He speaks at churches and says he believes in religious freedom and family values , " said Randy Thomasson , president of Campaign for Children and Families in a release , " yet hes stabbing pro-family Californians in the back .
People of faith are suffering under Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Hes not the lesser of two evils , hes doing evil . 
 People of conscience are appalled that Arnold Schwarzenegger has trampled religious freedom to satisfy hyperactive sexual activists ,  Thomasson railed .
" Schwarzenegger is ... [ trampling ] religious freedom at the bidding of liberal activists from San Francisco and West Hollywood . "
Christian colleges last week wrote Schwarzenegger urging him not to sign the law .
Schwarzenegger signed the bill -- which not a single Republican and all but one Democrat in the state legislature supported - - into law today .
Campaign for Children and Families has called the law a " sexual indoctrination bill . "
" The gates of hell are prevailing against the church , " Thomasson told World Net Daily for a story titled , " Gov. Arnold Tosses Out School Moral Codes . "
