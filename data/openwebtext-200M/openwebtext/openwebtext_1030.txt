I ’m happy to announce that Portland , OR will be host to the next OpenSQL Camp , Portland .
We ’ll be holding it November 14 - 15 , 2009 .
Patterned after the first Open SQL camp held in Charlottesville , Virginia , USA , in November 2008 , we ’re inviting any and all database practitioners ( even the non-SQL , non-relational ones ! ) to join us for two days of deep database geeking .
To quote :
Attendees of this conference are mostly open source developers and end users / open source enthusiasts .
The goal of this event is to spread the word about the vibrant communities and large ecosystems around Open Source Databases and to educate the attendees about what alternatives exist to commercial databases .
It is a place where people come to learn , to participate and to contribute .
In other words , it ’s a great conference , and if you attend , it will be better .
And to quote Eric Day :
There are direct flights to Portland from many locations in the US , and the venue is
right off public transportation ( train ) , so it should be convenient for everyone to get to .
We ’ve decided on a place in Downtown Portland ( which we ’ll announce shortly ) , and are actively looking for sponsors to help fuel the camp .
If you ’re a database company , looking to connect with database hackers or just want to support the spread of database - fu , get in touch to sponsor OpenSQL Camp , Portland !

Here 's how it works : people are subjected to a range of stimuli , ranging from a series of flashing lights to a driving simulator to , well , silence , while changes in brain activity are monitored by MRI .
The results get passed through software that assigns specific tones to different regions of the brain , netting something like a song for each scan .

These impulses are n't inherently musical — they 've been deliberative assigned tones that sound nice together , and even so sound rather chaotic — nor would you expect them to be , since this is just a novel way to present MRI .
What 's fascinating is how noticeably different the sounds of active and dormant brains , or troubled and untroubled brains actually are .
And not to diminish the seriousness of schizophrenia in any way , but the scanned map and accompanying sounds for an affected brain , seen at about 40 seconds into the video , are nothing short of awesome .

JERUSALEM – Hundreds of Muslims over the weekend tried to set a local Egyptian Christian 's home on fire after he announced he would turn the structure into a church , an Egyptian security source and local Christians told WND .
At least four Christian Copts and two Muslim policemen were wounded in the clashes that ensued this past Friday after about 500 local Muslims descended upon the small Christian village of Al - Hawasiliya , vowing to burn down the house .
Local Christians told WND the Muslim mob was provoked at local mosque services .
" The imams deliberately worked up the congregants against us , " a local Christian told WND yesterday .
The Muslims accused the Christian home owner of attempting to build a church without the proper local permits .
Islamic Shariah law , not explicitly accepted by the Egyptian government , forbids the construction of any new churches in a Muslim state .
Existing churches are allowed to remain but cannot be expanded and cannot conduct public ceremonies or ring church bells .

Egyptian police eventually stepped in to stop the Muslim crowd , but not before they first set several nearby Christian farms on fire , a security source in Egypt told WND .
This was not the first time Egyptian Christians were targeted on suspicion they might build a church .
In 2007 , WND reported Muslims in Egypt attacked local Christians and set fire to their shops and homes after the Christian community was accused of attempting to build a church .
The Egyptian government heavily restricts the construction or enlargement of churches , requiring permits for any Christian building .
Coptic Christians constitute between 8 and 15 percent of Egypt 's population .
They are regularly targeted by the country 's Muslim majority .
In April , WND quoted local Christian leaders charging an Egypt government policy to slaughter the country 's pigs as a stated precaution against swine flu was also aimed at targeting and weakening Egypt 's long - persecuted Christian community .
Almost the entire pig farming community in Egypt is run by Coptic Christians .
Egypt that month started seizing and slaughtering herds of pigs in a bid to rid the country of its swine , explaining it was a safety precaution against swine flu .
The move was heavily criticized by the United Nations , which put out a statement that the mass cull of up to 400,000 pigs was " a real mistake " since the new flu strain has not been found in pigs .
Christians are effectively restricted from senior Egyptian government , military or educational positions , and any worship services require the permission of the government .
The Coptic Church , a major Christian community in Egypt , reportedly dates back to the origins of Christianity .
Christians were the majority in Egypt until several centuries after the Arab conquest of the 7th century .

I stopped actively editing Wikipedia more or less one year ago .
Naturally , I have n’t stopped editing completely , as I still read Wikipedia nearly every day in the pursuit of my own edification .
But I no longer seek out thankless administrative tasks to perform , nor do I browse articles solely to find a way to contribute some writing .
In that way I ’m much more like the casual reader who occasionally fixes a typo , though the casual reader also does n’t have the ability to delete articles , block users , and protect pages ( ah , the privileges of being an administrator ) .
But I do n’t much use those abilities anymore , so it matters little .
In addition to doing lots of editing and administrative tasks ( page may take awhile to load ) , I also spent a good amount of time hacking on programs for Wikipedia .
Some , such as the userbox generator ( do n’t even ask ) , were purposefully silly .
Others , such as my work on the PyWikipediaBot free software project , were more useful .
In addition to my work on that bot framework , I wrote quite a few bots , which are programs for making automated edits .
By the time I ( mostly ) retired from Wikipedia , I had put many hours into those bots , and I could n’t bear to just shut them down .
So I left them running .
They ’ve been running now for over a year , unattended for the most part , and have been remarkably error - free all things considered .
I have variously forgotten about them for months at a time , and only remembered them when my network connection chugs for an extended period of time ( long “ Categories for deletion ” backlog ) or when my server ’s CPU utilization pegs ( bot process gets stuck in an endless loop ) .
So yes , there is a zombie bot editing Wikipedia , and it even has administrative rights that it uses quite frequently !
All of these bot programs that I wrote run under one Wikipedia user account , Cydebot .
That account was the first account on any Wikipedia project to break one million edits .
The total currently stands somewhere at a million and a quarter ( proof ) , though it has been out - edited by one other bot account by now .
But just think about the enormity of that number .
At one point Cydebot had a single digit percentage of all edits to the English Wikipedia .
You ca n’t say that ’s not impressive , especially considering how ridiculously massive Wikipedia is .
Yet being a bot operator was largely unsung work .
The only time I really got noticed for all the effort I was putting into it ( and never mind the network resources involved , especially when I was running AntiVandalBot , which downloaded and analyzed the text of every single edit to Wikipedia in real time ) was when yet another person thought they were the first to realize that Cydebot was using administrative tools and deemed it necessary to yell at me about it .
Wikipedia has this cargo cult rule that “ admin bots are n’t allowed ” — even though people have been running them for years .
I ’ll grant that it ’s schizophrenic .
So after continuing to run Cydebot for this long , I ’m not going to stop now .
I have n’t put any effort into Cydebot for over a year besides occasionally updating the pyWikipediaBot framework from SVN , killing pegged bot processes , and rarely modifying the batch files for my bots when someone points out that the associated pages on Wikipedia have changed .
I do n’t have the time ( nor the desire ) to put any further serious development work into Cydebot , so at some point things will finally break and Cydebot will no longer be able to do any work .
But it ’s already gone for over a year performing all sorts of thankless tasks on Wikipedia that no human wants to be bothered with ; why not let it continue going and see how much longer my favorite zombie bot can continue at it for ?
If you want to track the continuing edits of a zombie bot on Wikipedia , you can do so here .
So the next time you are idly reading Wikipedia , remember that , not only are there bots behind the scenes that are making millions of automated edits , but some of them are zombies that have been running largely unattended for months , if not years .
Wikipedia is built , in no small part , upon zombie labor .

The Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) announced on July 7 the discovery of a new monkey in a remote region of the Amazon in Brazil .
The monkey is related to saddleback tamarins , which include several species of monkeys known for their distinctively marked backs .
The newly described distinct subspecies was first seen by scientists on a 2007 expedition into the state of Amazonas in northwestern Brazil .
The discovery was published in the June online edition of the International Journal of Primatology .
Authors of the study include Fabio Röhe of the Wildlife Conservation Society , José de Sousa e Silva Jr. of Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi , Ricardo Sampaio of the Instituto Nacional de Parquisas de Amaozônia , and Anthony B. Rylands of Conservation International .
Researchers have dubbed the monkey Mura 's saddleback tamarin ( Saguinus fuscicollis mura ) named after the Mura Indians , the ethnic group of Amerindians of the Purus and Madeira river basins where the monkey occurs .
Historically this tribe was spread through the largest territory of any of the Amazonian Indigenous peoples , extending from the Peruvian frontier today ( Rio Yavari ) east to the Rio Trombetas .
The monkey is mostly gray and dark brown in color , with a distinctly mottled " saddle . "
It weighs 213 grams ( less than ¾ of a pound ) and is 240 millimeters ( 9 inches tall ) with a 320 millimeter ( 12.6 inch ) tail .
" The Wildlife Conservation Society is extremely proud to be part of this exciting discovery in the Amazon , " said Dr. Avecita Chicchon , Director of WCS 's Latin America Programs .
" We hope that the discovery will draw attention to conservation in this very fragile but biodiverse region . "
According to the study 's authors , the monkey is threatened by several planned development projects in the region , particularly a major highway cutting through the Amazon that is currently being paved .
Conservationists fear the highway could fuel wider deforestation in the Amazon over the next two decades .
Other threats to the region include a proposed gas pipeline and two hydroelectric dams currently in the beginning stages of construction .
" This newly described monkey shows that even today there are still major wildlife discoveries to be made , " said the study 's lead author , Fabio Röhe of the Wildlife Conservation Society .
" This discovery should serve as a wake - up call that there is still so much to learn from the world 's wild places , yet humans continue to threaten these areas with destruction . "
The American Conservative Union 's remarkable demand is contained in a private letter to FedEx provided to POLITICO .
Chairman David Keene is pictured here .
Exclusive : Conservative group offers support for $ 2 M
The American Conservative Union asked FedEx for a check for $ 2 million to $ 3 million in return for the group ’s support in a bitter legislative dispute , then the group ’s chairman flipped and sided with UPS after FedEx refused to pay .
For the $ 2 million plus , ACU offered a range of services that included : “ Producing op - eds and articles written by ACU ’s Chairman David Keene and / or other members of the ACU ’s board of directors .
( Note that Mr. Keene writes a weekly column that appears in The Hill . ) ”

The conservative group ’s remarkable demand — black - and - white proof of the longtime Washington practice known as “ pay for play ” — was contained in a private letter to FedEx , which was provided to POLITICO .
The letter exposes the practice by some political interest groups of taking stands not for reasons of pure principle , as their members and supporters might assume , but also in part because a sponsor is paying big money .
In the three - page letter asking for money on June 30 , the conservative group backed FedEx .
After FedEx says it rejected the offer , Keene signed onto a two - page July 15 letter backing UPS .
Keene did not return a message left on his cell phone .
Maury Lane , FedEx ’s director of corporate communications , said : “ Clearly , the ACU shopped their beliefs and UPS bought . ”
ACU 's executive vice president , Dennis Whitfield , said that neither the group nor David Keene , the chairman , took any money from UPS .
Whitfield said the group has never received a response to its original proposal to FedEx .
He said Keene endorsed the second letter as an individual , even though the letter bore the logo of ACU .
" Our position has n't changed , " said Whitfield , who was a deputy secretary of labor in the Reagan administration .
" It wo n't change .
I am fundamentally , philosophically opposed to doing what the Obama administration wants to do [ to FedEx ] , and so is our organization . "
FedEx and UPS , fierce competitors in the package delivery business , are at war over a provision under consideration in Congress that would expand union power at FedEx .
FedEx currently has one U.S. union contract for its entire express business .
Under a change passed by the House and awaiting action in the Senate , FedEx — like UPS — would have to negotiate union contracts for individual locations , which FedEx claims would make it much more difficult to promise worldwide regularity for deliveries .
The American Conservative Union , which calls itself “ the nation 's oldest and largest grass - roots conservative lobbying organization , ” took UPS ’s side on Wednesday as part of a conservative consortium that accused FedEx of “ misleading the public and legislators . ”
ACU 's logo is at the top of the letter , along with those of six other conservative groups .
Just two weeks earlier , ACU had offered its endorsement to FedEx , saying in a letter to the company : “ We stand with FedEx in opposition to this legislation . ”
But there was a catch — an expensive one .
ACU asked FedEx to pay as much as $ 3.4 million for e-mail and other services for “ an aggressive grass - roots campaign to stop the legislation in the Senate . ”
“ For the activist contact portion of the plan , we will contact over 150,000 people per state multiple times at a cost of $ 1.39 per name or $ 2,147,550 to implement the entire program , ” the letter says .
“ If we incorporate the targeted , senator - personalized radio effort into the plan , you can figure an additional $ 125,000 on average , per state ” for an estimated 10 states .
The total would be $ 3,397,550 . ”
The letter shows one reason why activists get so much junk mail , both on paper and electronically :
Some groups that send it charge handsomely for the service .
Under the grass - roots program ACU proposed , “ Each person will be contacted a total of seven times totaling nearly 11 million contacts total in the 10 targeted states . ”
“ Within 72 hours of an agreement on the whole plan , we can have the data sets delivered and the first round of e-mail ready for delivery , ” the offer states .
“ Within seven days , the mail can be in the USPS system and the phone call delivered . ”
Lane , the FedEx official , said the offer was refused .
" The proposal did n’t fit with our strategy of taking a straightforward approach to discussing the issue , ” he said .
After the rebuff , American Conservative Union changed sides .
ACU Chairman David A. Keene was one of eight conservative leaders who signed a letter to FedEx Chairman Frederick W. Smith , a champion of capitalism who in the past has been a favorite of conservatives .
The letter accuses FedEx of “ falsely and disingenuously ” labeling the rules change a “ bailout ” for UPS , since FedEx would become subject to the same arduous union structure .
The letter is also signed by Grover Norquist , president of Americans for Tax Reform , who is also on ACU ’s board .
FedEx is pushing its case with a website called www.BrownBailout.com.
The letter signed by the conservative leaders concludes : “ To paraphrase the words of Ronald Reagan , ‘ Mr. Smith , tear down this website . ’ ”
Among the services ACU had offered to provide for the $ 2 million - plus price tag :
— Acquiring data of known conservatives in the targeted states ( to be determined by FedEx ) , matching that data to an e-mail database and then incorporating those e-mail addresses with the current ACU e-mail database to create one targeted database of all potential activists .
— Sending a piece of targeted direct mail to these potential activists to ensure that they are well - educated prior to their contact with their senators .
— E-mailing the identified voter activists , in five rounds , in order to educate them on the issue(s ) and to urge them to call their senators based on key dates .
The ACU would include the phone number of their personal senators directly in the correspondence .
— Conducting targeted phone call campaign that will contact all voter activists to urge them to make a personal call to their senators .
Each state would have a specialized message just for that state .
— Encouraging activists who live within 30 miles of a senator ’s district office to consider making a personal visit to register their concerns at the office .
ACU has proved that we can turn out well - informed , quality voters who present a good image to represent our concerns .
— As the vote for the legislation nears , distributing ACTION ALERT e-mails , and after the vote has taken place , distributing MegaVote e-mails to ACU ’s members letting them know how their senators vote .
Brüno's weekend box office opening is a perfect example of how a movie can be a " success " and " a disappointment " in Hollywood , said Ben Fritz in the Los Angeles Times .
The " outrageous " comedy starring Sacha Baron Cohen as a flamboyantly gay Austrian fashionista took the No. 1 spot , hauling in $ 30.4 million .
But " after a strong start on Friday , " domestic ticket sales dropped 39 percent on Saturday .
" Such a huge drop is rare and almost always a harbinger of bad buzz and a short box office run for a film . " ( watch the trailer for Bruno )
It 's obvious that " many of Cohen 's fans rushed to see Brüno on its opening day , " said John Young in Entertainment Weekly , " but that considerable Friday - to - Saturday drop " seems to " indicate poor word - of - mouth . "
Brüno did outperform
Cohen 's last " mockumentary , " Borat , which opened to $ 26.5 million .
But " Brüno started its run on more than three times as many screens as Borat — all indicators point to Brüno struggling to match Borat 's cumulative gross of $ 128.5 million . " ( watch the trailer for Borat )
But it 's still too early to tell , said David Germain in the Associated Press .
We 'll " have to wait until next weekend for a sense of how well Brüno can hold up for the long haul . "
The movie did take in an additional " $ 25 million in overseas markets so far . "
And " even if revenues continue to plunge , Brüno is well on its way to turning a profit for Universal , which paid $ 42.5 million for rights to distribute it domestically and in eight other territories . "
Now that a number of recent housing reports are generating some incredibly positive headlines and the global economy appears to be slowly digging its way out of an enormous hole that was created last fall when the world nearly came to an end , the burning question on the minds of millions of people is ...
Has the housing market hit bottom ?
There is no shortage of answers .
Unfortunately , most of them are far too simple and , in most cases , the individual or organization providing the answer has a bias of some sort .
I 'm no exception .
We sold our house about five years ago and have been renting ever since .
We plan to buy again , but not until at least next year and we hope to get a lot more house for our money than we could today .
That 's the soonest that I think the bottom in home prices is likely to occur around here in the price range we 're looking , though a bottom in home sales may already be behind us , and this is what makes the recent discussion of a housing bottom so complicated - " hitting bottom " means different things to different people living in different parts of the country .
The discourse on this subject is full of misinformation and deception from parties with vested interests that will inevitably lead people to make horrendously bad decisions that they 'll regret in another year or two while others may postpone decisions that would be best made today .
With my biases out of the way , a few thoughts on a housing market bottom are offered here .
In this article , regional differences will largely be set aside and the focus will be on three sets of national housing data - new home sales , existing home sales , and existing home prices .
New Home Sales Have Bottomed
First , let 's look at the home building industry , which , up until a couple years ago had accounted for about 10 to 15 percent of all home sales .
Then , the homebuilders ' share gradually sank to about half that amount as waves of foreclosures started hitting the market at much lower prices , cutting into their business dramatically .
Ironically , many of these foreclosure sales were homes that the builders had built and sold a couple years prior .
Disgruntled home buyers who , in 2006 and 2007 , complained about how builders were slashing prices on Phase III after they bought in Phase II ultimately had the last laugh in 2008 and 2009 when they walked away from their almost - brand - new home and the bank sold it at a 40 percent discount to the going prices for Phase III .
Do n't feel too sorry for the homebuilders - they had a few very good years .
Anyway , things have gotten so bad in the new home construction business over the last year or so that they really can't get any worse - not only did new home sales set new all - time lows for a data series that goes back more than 40 years , they simply obliterated every other housing downturn over that period in population - adjusted terms .
The annual rate of 329,000 units seen in January of this year was not only less than the 1981 low in nominal terms , but , after accounting for the increase in population , it was not much more than half that level .
Interestingly , there could n't have been two different eras for the homebuilders as far as the cost of money is concerned - back then they were sending truck loads of sawed up two - by - fours to the Federal Reserve building in Washington D.C. because Paul Volcker was on a mission to squash inflation with interest rates approaching 20 percent , whereas , today , the Fed has interest rates pegged at zero .
And speaking of the central bank , their legions of economists might think that housing has bottomed when looking at new home construction because this has a direct impact on economic growth - residential construction has been a drag on GDP for about four years now and , from a direct macro-economic perspective , the worst is probably behind us .
For the homebuilders , it 's hard to imagine how things could get any worse than they were in January , so , unless this downturn morphs back into the Great Depression II , things have got to get better .
In this case , it 's probably fair to say that the bottom is already behind us .
Existing Home Sales Have Probably Bottomed
If you 're in the business of selling real estate , then you 've got to be thinking that you 've seen the worst of the housing bubble 's mean side and you may be correct in this assessment now that banks are realizing they 're not going to get 2006 prices for all those foreclosed homes that have been sitting on their books for the last year or so .
There 's a booming business in distressed property sales that have buoyed existing home sales for months now ( much to the dismay of the homebuilders ) .
Foreclosures and short sales accounted for some 70 percent of all home sales in Las Vegas last month and that 's a good thing .
The " market " is doing what it is supposed to do - price discovery - and the fact that a lot of prices these days are being discovered through auctions is just part of that process .
And those who dismiss the lower prices fetched on distressed property sales as some sort of a temporary phenomenon should realize that they are doing so at their own peril - there 's a lot more of this inventory in the pipeline as the next wave of bad loans wash up on the shores of mortgage lenders and ultimately appear on Realtor.com or Auction.com where , eventually , they 'll lower their reserve prices and make a few more sales .
Though it 's not as clear - cut as in the case of new home sales , existing home sales probably made a bottom back in January although the same caveats about the Great Depression II apply .
The fact that there have been a few false starts before ( circled in blue above ) should be some cause for concern ( particularly the one in late - 2008 as it relates to the possibilities of another Great Depression ) , but , as long as the central bank keeps pumping money into the system and as long as the government continues to guarantee the vast majority of mortgages via the wards of the state - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - eventually , all the excess housing inventory will be worked down and the bottom in existing home sales is probably behind us .
Before moving on to the next section on a bottom in home prices , it 's important to remember that there 's a big difference between home sales and home prices along with the timing of their respective bottoms .
Generally speaking , real estate agents ( those who survived the last few years ) are now a much happier lot than they were earlier in the year because they 're making more sales .
No sales means no commissions , and whether those commissions are large or something less than large makes little difference .
A real estate agent would be much more willing to help you buy or sell a house at $ 250,000 rather than not make that transaction at all and the fact that the home may have fetched $ 400,000 a couple years ago or that it may only be worth $ 200,000 next year does n't really matter - they 'll help you make the sale at the price you agree to and they 'll try to make you feel good about it because , if they do n't make the sale , they do n't get paid .
A sale is a sale , but a bottom in home sales is quite different than a bottom in home prices .
Home Prices Will Not Bottom for Some Time
The vast majority of people in the world today are neither home builders or real estate sales agents , so , despite everything you hear and read about home sales - up , down , or flat - they really are n't all that relevant to most of us .
If you 're like all the other prospective home buyers or sellers out there today , the only thing that you should be concerned about are home prices - whether they 'll keep going down or if they 've already reached a bottom .
The financial world has been buzzing over the last week as rising new home sales and rising existing home sales were followed up by yesterday 's blockbuster report from the folks who run the Case - Shiller Home Price Index that - GASP !
- home prices ROSE from April to May .
There it is for all to see in the colorful graphic below - the housing boom and bust in all its glory along with those little squiggles upward on the right - hand side , a sort of resurrection of the housing market by the sounds of some of the press coverage .
Yes , unfortunately , Detroit is still off the chart - a much bigger bust than boom ...
More than a few anxious housewives have no doubt been elbowing their hubbies in recent days to cancel that golf game on Saturday and schedule a house - hunting expedition because the news is once again full of reports about rising home prices .
As can be seen clearly in China today , nothing excites people more than when prices rise .
While the first increase in the Case - Shiller Home Price Index in three years is a seminal event to be sure , it 's probably not quite what it 's being played up to be in your local real estate sales office where , remember , folks are more interested in sales than prices .
Combining the excitement people feel when prices rise with the excitement real estate agents feel when sales volume rises is a big part of the reason for the enormous rise and fall depicted above .
Just as there was virtually no experience with home prices that rose as fast as they did from 2002 to 2006 or falling as fast as home prices fell between 2007 and 2009 , there is little background that anyone can draw on to predict what a " bottom " in home prices might look like , but you can just about be guaranteed that the price bottom will lag the sales bottom by at least a year as it did during the peak .
Shown below is evidence of such as the National Association of Realtors ' existing home sales are plotted on the same chart as the Case Shiller 20 - City Home Price Index - a 13 month lag .
Those who think that the relationship between sales and price at the bottom will somehow be different than the relationship between these two at the peak have virtually no data to back that claim .
Unfortunately , as Ben Bernanke famously said a few years ago , home prices have not declined nationally since the Great Depression .
If the bottom in sales occurred in January , why could n't the May Case Shiller price data indicate a bottom in price ?
Well , anything 's possible , but this particular scenario is quite unlikely .
While there is no national data to draw on for housing price bottoms , there is one case study that provides some valuable information and it should help to put yesterday 's Case - Shiller report on rising home prices into a little better perspective - the Los Angeles housing market in the 1990s .
As shown below , housing bottoms can be long , drawn - out affairs with lots of false signals .
In the case of Los Angeles in the 1990s , it was almost two full years from the first positive reading in the price index in June 1994 until the ultimate low in February 1996 .
And lest anyone get too excited about that bottom in 1996 , another one occurred a year later in 1997 .
From what little experience there is with housing price bottoms , the odds do n't favor a lasting reversal in prices in the near - term and when it comes , the rebound wo n't be that impressive .
You 'll know when home prices hit bottom when people stop talking about them .
It is important to note that in some low - priced areas where subprime loans began souring a couple years ago and foreclosure sales have been brisk for some time , the bottom in prices may be near , if not already here .
Also , in parts of the country where there was never much of a boom or bust , higher prices may be seen in the near - term , but , those are about the only exceptions .
For people like you and me ( at least , most of you ) , do n't look for a bottom in prices until at least sometime next year .

William K. Black : Why Is Geithner Continuing Paulson 's Policy of Violating the Law ?
[ Associate Professor , University of Missouri ; Senior regulator during S&L debacle . ]
Whatever happened to the law ( Title 12 , Sec. 1831o ) mandating that banking regulators take " prompt corrective action " to resolve any troubled bank ?
The law mandates that the administration place troubled banks , well before they become insolvent , in receivership , appoint competent managers , and restrain senior executive compensation ( i.e. , no bonuses and no raises may be paid to them ) .
The law does not provide that the taxpayers are to bail out troubled banks .
Treasury Secretary Paulson and other senior Bush financial regulators flouted the law .
( The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) and the Office of Thrift Supervision ( OTS ) are both bureaus within Treasury . )
The Bush administration wanted to cover up the depth of the financial crisis that its policies had caused .
Mr. Geithner , as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York since October 2003 , was one of those senior regulators who failed to take any effective regulatory action to prevent the crisis , but instead covered up its depth .
He was supposed to regulate many of the largest bank holding companies in the United States .
Far too many of these institutions are now deeply insolvent because the banks they own are deeply insolvent .
The law mandated that Geithner and his colleagues place troubled banks in receivership long before they became insolvent .
Why are the banking regulators , particularly Treasury Secretary Geithner , continuing to disobey the law ?
We need a Pecora investigation
We can understand now why the administration and so many committee chairs are virulently opposed to the single most essential step we need to take to diminish future crises -- a modern Pecora investigation .
Pecora was the prosecutor hired by the Senate banking committee to investigate the misconduct that helped cause the Great Depression .
You must vigilantly study past failures to learn causation and to enact remedies .
If we were dealing with a crisis of airplane crashes and someone opposed studying the causes of the failures we would ( correctly ) label him a lunatic .
Congress largely stopped conducting meaningful oversight hearings of financial regulation during the Bush administration .
The results were horrific .
It appears that only intense public pressure will suffice to overcome congressional and administration resistance to a Pecora investigation .
I hope readers will add their voices to this call .
The financial cost of Paulson 's and Geithner 's flouting of the law
Paulson and Geithner 's refusal to comply with the law has already cost the taxpayers scores of billions of dollars in unnecessary costs .
Geithner indicated Friday , February 20 that he would continue to flout the law .
If he is allowed to do so it will add hundreds of billions of dollars to the eventual cost to taxpayers .
The amount of taxpayer money wasted due to Paulson and Geithner 's violations of the prompt corrective action law will exceed the total present value cost of resolving the S&L debacle , $ 150 billion ( $ 1993 ) .
The waste will take the form of the U.S. taxpayers subsidizing the officers , shareholders and subordinated debt holders of failed banks -- who are disproportionately wealthy , frequently profited from the accounting fraud that caused the banks to fail , and are often foreign .
The prompt corrective action law was passed in large part to prevent such a subsidy .
The S&L debacle led to a new financial regulatory system premised on " prompt corrective action " ( PCA ) .
Future posts will explain more fully why this system failed , but it is remarkable that the system , the phrase , and the law have disappeared from the coverage of the banking crises .
PCA 's premise was that regulatory discretion led to cover-ups of failed banks and excessive losses to the taxpayers .
The PCA solution was to require higher capital requirements and to mandate that the regulators take over troubled banks before they deteriorated to the point that the failure would impose a cost on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) .
PCA also recognized that failing bankers had perverse incentives to " live large " and cause larger losses to the FDIC and taxpayers .
PCA 's answer was to mandate that the regulators stop these abuses by , for example , strictly limiting executive compensation and forbidding payments on subordinated debt .
PCA 's purpose is " to resolve ... problems ... at the least possible long - term cost to the [ FDIC ] . "
That means the least possible cost to taxpayers .
Secretary Geithner 's priority is protecting private shareholders :
We have a financial system that is run by private shareholders , managed by private institutions , and we'd like to do our best to preserve that system ....
We have a law that says when banks are at or near insolvency private shareholders should be eliminated unless we can arrange a transaction that has no cost to the FDIC .
Receiverships produce " private institutions . "
The FDIC manages the failed institution only long enough to get it in shape to be sold at the least cost to the taxpayers .
Receiverships end unnecessary bailouts of private shareholders , reducing the cost to the FDIC , as the law requires .
Receiverships place banks back in the hands of new shareholders .
Geithner has so twisted the framing of this issue that he is warning that a cheaper , more effective means of resolving failed banks used under President Reagan is some alien form of socialism that President Obama must slay before it destroys capitalism .
Geithner is channeling
Rove when he conflates receiverships with " nationalization . "
Secretaries Paulson and Geithner subverted the PCA law by allowing failed banks to engage in massive accounting fraud ( which also means they are engaged in securities fraud ) .
Treasury is telling the world that resolving the failed banks will require roughly $ 2 trillion dollars .
That has to mean that the failed banks are insolvent by roughly $ 2 trillion .
The failed banks , however , are reporting that they are not simply solvent , but " well capitalized . "
The regulators flout PCA by permitting this massive accounting and securities fraud .
( Note that by countenancing this fraud they make it extremely difficult to ever prosecute these elite white - collar frauds . )

The crisis in Moldova , dubbed the " Twitter Revolution " , was last night threatening to turn into another showdown between Russia and the West .
Just weeks after Barack Obama 's government spoke of " pressing the reset button " with Russia , the conflict risks derailing the fragile diplomatic truce .
Russia gave its backing yesterday to Moldova 's President , Vladimir Voronin , when he accused EU and Nato member Romania of backing a coup attempt , and expelled the Romanian ambassador .
Mr Voronin promised " harsh punishment " would be meted out to the organisers of protests which rocked the capital Chisinau on Tuesday after the ruling Communists claimed victory in weekend parliamentary elections .
Moscow , deeply suspicious of anti-government protests in what it considers its sphere of interest , condemned the protests in the strongest terms .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A foreign ministry statement supported Mr Voronin 's actions and said " any attempts to play on the emotions of the young people who make up the majority of the crowds , especially from outside the country , is not just reckless and reprehensible , but also short - sighted . "
The Russian Foreign Minister , Sergei Lavrov , called the protests " outrageous " and the Duma called on the EU to condemn the protests .
Mr Voronin said : " When the flag of Romania was raised on state buildings , the attempts of the opposition to carry out a coup became clear .
We will not allow this . "
Romania and Moldova share deep historical ties but Romanian authorities vehemently denied the accusations and analysts in Chisinau accused elements in the Moldovan government of provoking the clashes to create a rift with the EU and push the country towards Russia .
Russia 's main bargaining chip with Moldova , and a point of particular concern for the EU , is the " frozen conflict " in Transdniestria .
The sliver of land is officially part of Moldova but is run by a separatist regime with close links to Moscow .
The situation is similar to that in South Ossetia , where Russia and Georgia came to blows last summer .
Russia is the leading player in ongoing negotiations and has a military presence and a large armaments depot in the region .
Riot police retook control of the Moldovan parliament and presidential buildings yesterday as both sides took stock after Tuesday 's violence .
Protesters stormed and ransacked the buildings , demanding repeat elections .
About 200 people were detained while opposition parties demanded access to television and new elections .
The protest organisers insisted that most of the protesters had been students with no party political links and no intention of violent action , determined simply to hold the government to account and force freer elections .
" The protests were initially very peaceful , but then a small group , which seemed to be very well organised , started these violent riots , " said Igor Munteanu , the executive director of the Viitorul think - tank in Chisinau .

" My suspicion is that this was provoked and directed from within .
Elements of the Communist leadership do not want closer relations with the EU as it will mean loosening their grip on power .
They know that if they provoke a crisis with Romania and the EU and improve relations with Moscow , they will be able to continue running the country as they please . "
Mr Munteanu said the protests should not be seen in the same light as the Georgian and Ukranian revolutions : " This was not organised by the opposition parties ; it was a protest self - organised by young people who are unhappy with the Communist government , " he said .
Young Moldovans discussed their next moves online as the role social networking sites played in organising the protests became clear .
Not too long ago , revolutions were named after colours or flowers – Orange for Ukraine , Rose for Georgia , Tulip for Kyrgyzstan .
But in a sign that technology is now fuelling opposition to post - Soviet regimes as much as romantic ideals , the protests in Moldova have been dubbed the " Twitter Revolution " .
In the list of most popular Twitter searches yesterday , along with contestants from Pop Idol and other television - related inanity , was " #pman " the abbreviation for Piata Marii Adunari Nationale , the Romanian name for the main square in Chisinau and the epicentre of the protests .
Every minute new posts were made in English and Romanian , with acquaintances and sympathisers keeping each other up to date on the situation in different parts of the country .
" North of Moldova TV IS OFF !!!
but we have THE ALMIGHTY INTERNET !
Let us use it to communicate peacefully for freedom !! " wrote one Twitter user yesterday afternoon , mirroring the many reports that television networks had been shut down in an attempt to stop the violence .
Others complained that their employers were not letting them join the protests ; some simply posted rousing messages calling for freedom and a change of government .
Many of the " tweets " on Twitter , and blog posts on other internet sites , expressed dismay at the violent turn of events and suspicion that the authorities had provoked the violent clashes .
Natalia Morar , a prominent Moldovan journalist and a leader of one of the youth groups behind the protests , posted a statement on her blog denouncing the violence .
She said the protests , organised under the slogan " I am not a Communist ! " , were organised online : " Six of us distributed information on the internet , Facebook , blogs , by SMS and email .
" All the organisation was through the internet , and 15,000 people came on to the street . "
The EU called on all parties to refrain from any action that could escalate the situation and said it would send a special envoy to Chisinau .
But any talk of a direct EU role in negotiations between the government and opposition is likely to infuriate Moscow further .
Opposition leaders yesterday postponed further protests in light of the violence , but several hundred people gathered outside government buildings demanding the release of the arrested protesters .
Borderline case :
The changing shape of Moldova
* So where is Moldova ?
This landlocked country lies on the fringes of eastern Europe , sandwiched between Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north , south and east .
It is the poorest country in Europe , with residents surviving on an average monthly wage of $ 250 .
* Has it always been independent ?
No , it used to be part of the USSR .
Moldova declared its independence on 27 August 1991 , at the same time as most Soviet republics , following a failed hardline coup against Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev .
The territory has changed hands many times .
Back in the Middle Ages it was part of the Principality of Moldavia .
In 1812 it was annexed by the Russian Empire and became known as Bessarabia .
It was unified with Romania in the early 20th century but then taken back into the Soviet Union at the end of the Second World War .
* What is the ethnic make - up ?
About two - thirds of Moldova 's 4.5 million people are of Romanian descent .
The languages are virtually identical and there are strong cultural ties with the EU and Nato member .
However , the sliver of land to the east of the Dniester River – known as Transdniestria – is home to many Russian and Ukrainian speakers .
* What sparked this week 's unrest ?
Moldovans went to the polls on Sunday to vote for a new parliament .
The ruling Communists won with close to 50 per cent of the vote , but protesters allege that there was wide - scale rigging .
President Vladimir Voronin – who was elected in 2001 – says he won fair and square and is blaming Romania for stoking the violent demonstrations .
* Are there any other ramifications ?
The latest violence could complicate efforts to resolve an 18 - year separatist rebellion in Transdniestria .
The region unilaterally declared independence from Moldova in 1990 .
Up to 700 people were killed in fighting that raged until a July 1992 ceasefire .
Transdniestria has run its own affairs , with Moscow 's support , ever since .
In a 2006 referendum , unrecognised by Moldova , the region reasserted its demand for independence and also backed a plan to join Russia .
Tweets of protest
How the Moldovan protesters discussed the unfolding situation on Twitter .
The tag #pman is the acronym for Piata Marii Adunari Nationale , name of the central square in Chisinau , the capital of Moldova
7 April
" Moldovan president blames opposition for anti-communist protests .
He does n't know youth used social media to gather for protests # pman "
" Public TV not covering the protest .
Internet down in Moldova "
" A friend of mine just told me that some girls from #pman revolution gave flowers to policemen and they accepted with a smile .
Flower - power "
8 April
#pman : on the public TV company just national music and good morning shows , nothing about what 's going on in the country ... "
" #pman : Chisinau is surrounded , Moldova 's borders are closed , internet is partially blocked but this will not stop us "
" #pman Moldovan students in Romania are afraid to come back home .
Rumours say they would n't be allowed to enter Romania again "
So now we know what happens when too many people who have too few assets buy too much house with the help of too many risky mortgage products and too little oversight .
And while there 's plenty of blame to go around -- unethical mortgage brokers , greedy bankers and irresponsible homeowners -- one culprit continues to get off scot - free : HGTV .
That 's right .
The cable network HGTV is the real villain of the economic meltdown .
As the viewership reached a critical mass over the past decade -- HGTV is now broadcast into 91 million homes -- homeowners began experiencing deep angst .
Suddenly no one but the most slovenly and unambitious were satisfied with their houses .
It did n't matter if you lived in an apartment or a gated community , one episode of " House Hunters " or " What 's My House Worth ? " and you were convinced you needed more .
More square feet .
More granite .
More stainless steel appliances .
More landscaping .
More media rooms .
More style .
You deserved it .
If you had any doubts about your ability to afford such luxuries , all you had to do was look at the 20 - something couple in the latest episode choosing between three houses .
Should they go for the fixer - upper , priced at $ 425,000 ?
Or the one with the pool for $ 550,000 ?
What about the one with room to grow for $ 675,000 ?
" How much money can these people possibly make ? "
I shout at my wife before wrestling the remote from her house - hungry little hand and switching it to the nearest sports program .
" The guy can barely string together two sentences ! "
And yet on episode after episode for this entire irrational decade , HGTV pumped up the housing bubble by parading the most mediocre , unworthy - looking homeowners into our living rooms to watch while they put their tacky , run -of - the - mill tract homes on the market for twice what they paid and then went out and bought houses with price tags too obscene to repeat .
You could n't watch these shows without concluding that you must be an idiot and a loser if you lived in a house you could actually afford .

Collactive , a Delaware - registered company with operations mainly in Israel , is backed by Sequoia Capital ’s Israeli office ( Update : funding amount is $ 2 million ) .
The service is free for individuals , but will charge businesses , politicians and some nonprofits for usage .
Apparently , it has already been used successfully by the Genocide Intervention Network , a Washington , D.C. nonprofit , to boost visibility about the conflict in Darfur , Sudan .
Notably , it is run by Eran Reshef and Amir Hirsh , the co-founders of Blue Security , a company that developed an innovative anti-spam technique :
It would deluge spammers by sending them massive amounts of spam back .
While momentarily successful , a Russian based spammer counter - attacked , and brought Blue Security to its knees about a year ago .
Ironically , the co-founders have joined the other side , using what they ’ve learned to essentially spam news sites under the pretense that is for good causes .
Blue Security had been backed by Sequoia ’s rival , Benchmark .

Irene , I would love to get a copy of your book .
Are you willing to exchange one Digital Dickweed coffee mug for a few hundred copies ?
I am sure you have them lying around , and it sounds about equitable .
Also , good thing of Irene to admit that any variant of forntrunning is illegal .
We are with you !
[ WARNING : Some content may disturb ]
We have previously posted a list of the top 10 most disgusting foods and this is our long awaited sequel .
We certainly can’t deny that in the West we eat some pretty awful stuff ( such as sea urchin and tripe ) , and this list includes a couple of our own “ delights ” .
For that reason it is probably more balanced than the previous list which focused less on western foods .
The thing that most frightens me is that this list is how easy it was to find another ten utterly revolting things that people eat .
10 Escamoles
Escamoles are the larvae of ants of the genus Liometopum , harvested from the roots of the agave ( tequila ) or maguey ( mezcal ) plant in Mexico .
In some forms of Mexican cuisine , escamoles are considered a delicacy and are sometimes referred to as “ insect caviar ” .
They have a cottage cheese like consistency and taste buttery , yet slightly nutty .
To procure the escamoles , men must dig as far as 2 feet down to reach a nest of larvae .
One larvae collector said : “ Some of the hunters have a man with a broom who sweeps the ants off their bodies while they ’re digging .
I have heard that others spread their bodies with pork fat so the ants ca n’t bite . ”
It should be noted that the ant ’s bite is extremely painful – so gathering the eggs is something of an “ extreme ” job .
9 Lutefisk
Lutefisk is a traditional dish of the Nordic countries made from stockfish ( air - dried whitefish ) or dried / salted whitefish ( klippfisk ) and soda lye ( lut ) .
Its name literally means “ lye fish ” , because it is made using caustic lye soda derived from potash minerals .
Because of the lye content , overcooking can cause the fish to turn to soap .
When cooking and eating lutefisk , it is important to clean the lutefisk and its residue off pans , plates , and utensils immediately .
Lutefisk left overnight becomes nearly impossible to remove ( imagine what this is doing to your insides ) .
Lutefisk is usually served with a variety of side dishes , including , but not limited to , bacon , green peas , green pea stew , potatoes , lefse , gravy , mashed rutabaga , white sauce , melted or clarified butter , syrup , geitost ( goat cheese ) , or “ old ” cheese ( gammelost ) .
The scandanavians are so good at making nasty smelling or tasting food that they get two items on this list :
8 Surströmming
Surströmming is fermented tinned fish which is so foul that it is mostly eaten outdoors due to the stench .
It is sold in cans , which often bulge during shipping and storage , due to the continued fermentation .
Species of Haloanaerobium bacteria are responsible for the in - can ripening .
These bacteria produce carbon dioxide and a number of compounds that account for the unique odor : pungent ( propionic acid ) , rotten - egg ( hydrogen sulfide ) , rancid - butter ( butyric acid ) , and vinegary ( acetic acid ) .
Usually an open sandwich is made with surströmming and a number of other ingredients .
Boiled potatoes ( often mandelpotatis or almond potatoes ) are common , as are diced onion .
Other common ingredients are gräddfil ( fat fermented milk / sour cream ) or crème fraîche , chives and sometimes tomato .
Many people do not care for surströmming ( surprise surprise ) , and it is generally considered to be an acquired taste .
7 Kumis
This is actually a drink , but it is sufficiently disgusting ( and nutritional enough ) to be included here .
Kumis is a dairy product made from the fermented milk of a female horse .
Because mare ’s milk contains more sugars than the fermented cow ’s or goat ’s milk , kumis has a higher , though still mild , alcohol content .
Kumis is made by fermenting mare ’s milk over the course of hours or days , often while stirring or churning .
( The physical agitation has similarities to making butter ) .
During the fermentation , Lactobacilli bacteria acidify the milk , and yeasts turn it into a carbonated and mildly alcoholic drink – basically fizzy mouldy horse milk .
One other property of this revolting drink is that it has a laxative effect .
In other words , it makes you poo .
6 Century Egg
How I missed this on the first list I do not know , but here it is ( at last ) to haunt your dreams .
Century egg is a Chinese cuisine ingredient made by preserving duck , chicken or quail eggs in a mixture of clay , ash , salt , lime , and rice straw for several weeks to several months , depending on the method of processing .
After the process is completed , the yolk becomes a dark green , cream - like substance with a strong odor of sulphur and ammonia ( AKA farts or rotten egg ) , while the white becomes a dark brown , transparent jelly with little flavor or taste .
Century eggs can be eaten without further preparation , on their own as a side dish or chopped and used as an ingredient .
But whichever way you look at it – you are still eating rotten egg .
5 Human Placenta
I was in two minds about adding this item , but it is definitely eaten by enough people that it has its own name : placentophagy so here it is .
Those who advocate placentophagy in humans , mostly in modern America and Europe , Mexico , Hawaii , China , and the Pacific Islands , believe that eating the placenta prevents postpartum depression and other pregnancy complications .
A variety of recipes are known to exist for preparing placenta for eating in spite of the extended taboo against eating human body parts .
Because a placenta is a temporary organ , it is considered by some to be excluded from the classification needed for cannibalism .
Here is just one recipe I found on the Internet for placenta – it is a placenta cocktail : 1/4 cup raw placenta , 8 oz V - 8 juice , 2 ice cubes , 1/2 cup carrot .
Blend at high speed for 10 seconds and drink .
Or not .
4 Raw Blood Soup
Raw blood soup ( ti?t canh in Vietnamese ) is a dish made with raw blood of ducks or geese ( sometimes pigs ) , with peanuts and herbs on top .
This is the typical protein - rich breakfast of the country people in Northern Vietnam , but is very dangerous because of the H5N1 bird flu virus .
This is made by taking fresh blood and sticking it in the fridge to gently congeal .
Raw blood soup is a Vietnamese dish which is usually consumed while drinking alcohol and it is one that makes very little effort appeal to the taste buds of the non-Vietnamese diner .
Usually you will find a few chopped peanuts scattered on top of your blood but that ’s as far as it goes for fanciness .
Blood soup has the oddest texture and tastes strangely metallic .

3 Corn Smut
What a name !
And if that is n’t bad enough , wait until you hear what this stuff is : corn smut is a disease of maize which can infect any part of the plant it usually enters the ovaries and replaces the normal kernels of the cobs with large distorted tumors analogous to mushrooms .
In the United States it is ( rightly ) considered a pest .
In Mexico … it is a delicacy .
In Mexico corn smut is called huitlacoche , a Nahuatl word reportedly meaning raven ’s poo .
It is considered a delicacy , even being preserved and sold for a higher price than corn .
For culinary use , the galls are harvested while still immature — fully mature galls are dry and almost entirely spore - filled .
The immature galls , gathered two to three weeks after an ear of corn is infected , still retain moisture and , when cooked , have a flavor described as mushroom - like , sweet , savory , woody , and earthy .
This “ delicacy ” has had difficulty entering American and European diets – for obvious reasons !
2 Scorpion Soup
Scorpion soup – as its name implies , is a soup made from scorpions .
Preparing and eating scorpion soup can be a dangerous task as Wing Li from China recently discovered when he was stung by three as he tried to throw them in the pot .
He was making the soup to help ease his rheumatism .
Scorpions are eaten in the south of China .
They are reared in ‘ ranches ’ , mostly in people ’s homes , then sold in the markets .
Scorpions have a woody taste and should be eaten whole , except for the tip of the tail – though some recipes suggest that the venom in the tail is rendered harmless by cooking .
Either way – I think I will stick to chicken soup thanks .
1 Casu Marzu
This cheese is so disgusting it is illegal – but that does n’t stop the blackmarket from selling tons of the stuff to locals .
Casu Marzu is a traditional Sardinian sheep milk cheese , notable for being riddled with live insect larvae .
Derived from Pecorino , Casu marzu goes beyond typical fermentation to a stage most would consider decomposition , brought about by the digestive action of the larvae of the cheese fly Piophila casei .
These larvae are deliberately introduced to the cheese , promoting an advanced level of fermentation and breaking down of the cheese ’s fats .
The texture of the cheese becomes very soft , with some liquid seeping out .
Casu marzu is considered toxic when the maggots in the cheese have died .
Because of this , only cheese in which the maggots are still alive is eaten .
Because the larvae in the cheese can launch themselves for distances up to 15 centimeters ( 6 in ) when disturbed , diners hold their hands above the sandwich to prevent the maggots from leaping into their eyes .
If a diner is not careful to chew the maggots until they are dead , dire consequences can arise : the larvae ( which are resistant to stomach acids ) have powerful mouthhooks which can lacerate stomach linings or intestinal walls as the maggots attempt to bore through internal organs .
+ Human Fetus
This is listed as a bonus because it is disputed and even if true , is not common or accepted anywhere in the world .
We have all heard the xenophobic tales of Chinese people eating fetuses .
This is almost certainly untrue .
However , a series of photos were released onto the internet which showed a Chinese man eating a human fetus .
It turned out that he was an artist and the photographic series was one of his works of art – entitled “ Eating People ” ( another recent work was a can of human brains ) .
When questioned , the artist ( Zhu Yu ) claimed that the fetuses were real human fetuses stolen from a medical school .
Snopes believes the fetus is a doll ’s head attached to a duck ’s body .
Whether they are real or not , the photograph above is somewhat disturbing !

But I think you also have to be impressed by the credulity of the people who invested and the desperation and almost the laziness — the lack of due diligence of the people who pumped their money in .
I mean , when it comes right down to it , people really do n’t know much about this world , and they ’re looking for some kind of Virgil to give them a tour through it .
And they do n’t really do much investigating , and they just — they defer far more to someone like [ Madoff ] than they would in circumstances where the stakes are much lower

With the release of the Potential Gas Committee 's 2008 year end assessment last week , there was a fresh wave of enthusiasm for replacing oil or coal with natural gas .
The PGC , led by Dr. John B. Curtis of the Colorado School of Mines , found a lot of new resources in their reevaluation of potential shale plays .
The Potential Gas Committee ( PGC ) today released the results of its latest biennial assessment of the nation ’s natural gas resources , which indicates that the United States possesses a total resource base of 1,836 trillion cubic feet ( Tcf ) .
This is the highest resource evaluation in the Committee ’s 44 - year history .
Most of the increase from the previous assessment arose from reevaluation of shale - gas plays in the Appalachian basin and in the Mid-Continent , Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain areas ...
The Potential Gas Committee reports its gas resource assessments biennially in three categories of decreasing certainty — Probable , Possible and Speculative .
For each category , a minimum , most likely and maximum volume is assessed for each of 89 geological provinces in the Lower 48 States and Alaska .
The mean values shown in Table 1 below were calculated by statistical aggregation of the minimum , most likely and maximum traditional values for each resource category ...
[ My note : see the link above to view Table 1 .
Figure 1 shows the major U.S. shale basins . ]
Figure 1 — The major shale plays in the United States , from a report by Navigant Consulting , Inc. for the Clean Skies Foundation sponsored by Chesapeake Energy Corp. ( CHK ) .
Some of the biggies in or starting development include the Antrim ( # 1 ) , Barnett ( # 3 ) , the Haynesville ( #10 ) , the Marcellus ( #13 ) and the Bakken ( # 2 ) .
If you add up the mean values for Traditional Gas Resources , which includes shale gas , and Coal Bed Methane , you get the 1,836 Tcf of potential resources .
If you throw in the EIA 's proved reserves , the total resources are 2,074 Tcf in the Lower 48 and Alaska .
Curtis explained that his tally represents the ‘ technically recoverable ’ gas resource potential of the United States .
At current consumption rates , the new total represents about 100 years of supply .
If speculative resources ( 500 Tcf ) are excluded , we would still have about 75 years of supply .
Suffice it to say that there is little reason to doubt that the potential natural gas resource base in the United States is very large .
The hidden problem with such estimates relates to whether the gas is economic to produce , an issue which is outside the PGC 's purview .
Let us assume for now that all the gas ( 2,074 Tcf ) that might be there is actually there .
Let 's further assume that it is indeed technically recoverable and economic to produce at a " reasonable " price , which I will leave undefined .
What would we do with the gas ?
We have two energy problems in the medium to long term , climate change and peak oil .
( In the very long term , all bets are off . )
Consequently , shale gas has been proposed as a temporary ( a few decades ) solution to both .
We can —
If we are at the beginning of a long term shale gas boom , it is clear we can put the gas to good use .
But that 's a big IF .
Before we make a policy commitment to a natural gas future , we must be certain the gas will be there .
Let 's return to the real world , a messy place where some potential gas resources may not exist , or may not be economic to produce .
Things get complicated here , but do n't they always ?
Shale Gas Economics
At first glance , increased shale gas production ( Figure 2 ) looks like a textbook case of resource economics .
A " new " technology ( horizontal drilling & hydraulic fracturing ) combined with rising price ( Figure 1 ) boosts recoverable reserves over time .
Figure 1 — The history of natural gas wellhead prices since the 1970s , from the EIA .
Volatile prices have increased since about 2002 , but have fallen lately during the downturn .
Figure 2 — Increased shale gas production with a risked estimate out to 2018 , from a Tristone Capital study ( October , 2008 ) described in the Oil & Gas Journal 's Study analyzes nine US , Canada shale gas plays .
These are risked production additions — " the study expects companies ultimately to recover from these resources 261 Tcf of gas , based on various risk factors applied and a long - term average gas price of $ 8.50 / MMbtu .
Without the risk factors , Tristone Capital says these shales have a 743 - Tcf recovery potential . "
The Horn River and Montney shales are in Canada , so they do n't appear in Figure 1 .
Tristone Capital 's future production estimate depends on a long - term average price of $ 8.50 / Mcf ( per thousand cubic feet abbreviated as Mcf , equivalent to million British Thermal Units , abbreviated as MMbtu ) .
The required price is well over the 15 - year average of ~$ 5.50 / Mcf .
What average natural gas wellhead price allows the shale boom to continue ?
Shale gas economics is a contentious issue .
One camp believes that shale gas is economic at — and will keep future prices in — the $ 5 - 6 / Mcf range .
I 'll call these analysts the optimists .
The other camp believes the marginal cost of shale gas production is $ 7 - 8 / Mcf , and perhaps much higher depending on the shale play .
These are the pessimists .
Let 's break down the arguments .
Barclays Capital stock analyst Tom Driscoll is an optimist .
On May 27 , 2009 , Platts quoted Driscoll as saying —
" Conventional gas is being displaced by unconventional gas , " Driscoll said and it may take " 20 years for natural gas prices to recover . "
" The emergence of low - cost unconventional , and especially shale gas , resources may lead to lower than expected natural gas prices for the next five to 10 years , " Driscoll said .
" Shale -- along with other low - cost unconventional gas -- could provide 75 % to 90 % of new gas supply over the next several years and set the marginal cost of new supply . "
Despite the nearly 50 % cut in rig counts since their peak in the fall of 2008 , Driscoll estimates that fourth - quarter 2009 gas production numbers will show no decline from fourth - quarter 2008 numbers ...
He said he estimated the market will average 4 Bcf /d worth of oversupply this year and 3 Bcf /d worth of excess gas in 2010 .
Driscoll said the more productive horizontal rigs are profitable at prices " materially below " $ 6 / Mcf , which just keeps gas flooding into the market even as cash prices plummet .
[ My note : Driscoll and others also project that shale gas may provide up to 40 % of U.S. supply by 2013 . ]
This is a very bullish forecast .
Despite reduced rig counts , and despite the likelihood that we will have low or average gas prices over the next few years due to the recession and oversupply , the market share of shale gas grows and grows .
This forecast looks like a high - wire act that defies not only gravity , but also the laws of supply & demand .
One wonders what the minimum price is that makes shale gas unprofitable .
$ 4.50 / Mcf ? $ 3.50 / Mcf ?
Another optimist , Ziff Energy , tells us how much gas is produced from shale now .
Ziff Energy Group forecasts unconventional gas production will supply 53 % of US gas needs by 2020 , up from 30 % in 2000 .
Ziff Energy 's Shale Gas Outlook to 2020 says shale gas production in 2008 was more than 5 Bcfd ( 8 % of North American gas production ) , with 70 % coming from the Barnett shale in the Fort Worth basin of Texas .
In the future , the report sees increased gas coming from the Barnett , Fayetteville , and Woodford shales as well as many other plays such as the Haynesville , Marcellus , Horn River , Utica , and Gothic .
The report expects in 2020 that North America will produce 87 Bcfd compared with 70 Bcfd in 2000 .
[ My note : " Bcf " stands for billion cubic feet and " Bdfd " is the daily rate .
U.S. dry gas production was 20.56 Tcf in 2008 .
The production rate was 56.33 Bcfd .
The U.S. consumes more gas than it produces , getting the rest from Canadian and liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) imports .
Conventional gas production peaked in the 1970's in the United States .
New supply from unconventional tight gas ( and some coal - bed methane ) , along with imports , filled the supply / demand gap .
As Figure 2 shows , shale gas is a johnny - come - lately on the gas scene . ]
The biggest booster is the man who is selling shale gas — Chesapeake CEO Aubrey McClendon .
At Chesapeake Energy 's recent shareholder 's meeting , Chairman and CEO Aubrey McClendon suggested that the increased use of natural gas would be a way to help the U.S. stop indirectly funding nations that are " declared enemies " and would benefit the environment as well .
McClendon said the lack of availability of natural - gas - powered cars in the U.S. is " the most frustrating part of my existence today " and pointed out that General Motors manufactures 12 car models throughout the world that come off of the assembly line ready to run on natural gas , yet there are no such models in the U.S .
McClendon knows how to sing the right notes , but I thought his " most frustrating part of my existence " statement is a bit overdone .
What do the pessimists — they would prefer to be called realists — say about all this ?
And how would optimists respond ?
Art Berman , a Houston geologist and columnist at World Oil Magazine , does not believe most shale gas wells are economic unless operator costs go down , gas prices rise sharply , and high average prices are sustained .
Talking about the Haynesville in A Long Recovery for Natural Gas Prices , Berman says —
Drilling and completion costs [ in the Haynesville ] vary from $ 7.5 to $ 10.5 million per well .
The marginal cost for operators to find and develop natural gas reserves is $ 7 to 8 / Mcf , and current netback prices in the play are less than $ 3 / Mcf .
The threshold netback gas price for a better - than - average 5.5 Bcf well to break even is $ 7 / Mcf at NPV10 ( Bodell and Pittinger , in press ) .
For companies that have favorable hedge positions , realized gas prices for 2009 will be as high as $ 6.50 / Mcf and $ 6.00 / Mcf for 2010 .
This means that the play is marginally commercial today for operators with favorable hedge positions , but not commercial based on cost and price fundamentals .
Berman 's argument is based on current ( and likely future ) gas prices , a minimum ultimately recoverable per well , and " all - in " costs of about $ 7.50 / Mcf , not on the impressive initial well flow rates often reported in Rigzone .
At current prices , the netback of $ 3.25 / Mcf barely covers operating costs , so no Haynesville well is economic and rates and reserves simply do not matter .
Berman 's analysis of the Barnett is just as bad —
Shale gas is not commercial at any " reasonable " price because the costs are too high — I once calculated that at ~ $ 12 / Mcf only slightly more than 50 % of Barnett Shale wells would break even or more money .
I am now working on a re-evaluation of the Barnett Shale 11,500 wells later .
The average per-well EUR is about 0.6 Bcf — pathetic !
The cost is staggering — more than $ 30 billion and most of it hopelessly non-commercial ...
[ My note : quoted from an e-mail from Berman .
0.6 Bcf includes vertical wells , about 1/3 of the total drilling in the Barnett play .
The average estimated ultimately recoverable ( EUR , reserves ) for horizontal wells is ~ 0.75 Bcf . ]
But what about our classic case of resource economics ?
Prices rose ( Figure 1 ) and shale gas production increased ( Figure 2 ) .
That would seem to belie Berman 's pessimism — the proof is in the pudding .
What 's the problem ?
The wrench in the works is that operators appear to have lost money producing shale gas .
McClendon recently stated that " we believe that Chesapeake 's strong financial condition and extensive hedges provide us with ... [ the ] flexibility to make prudent natural gas revenue maximization choices . "
No doubt Chesapeake will try to maximize their revenue , but do they have a strong financial condition ?
Berman says No —
I have worked through the 10 - Ks of most of the major shale players ( Chesapeake , Petrohawk , Range Resources , etc. ) — they ’re all taking a bath financially but put on a brave face , and have huge debt .
As long as their stock price is good , the executives get rich so why do they care ?
The analyst community is so naive about true costs that they believe the propaganda .
[ My note : Chesapeake has 14.4 billion in senior debt and their stock price is faring badly .
" CEO Aubrey McClendon has come under some well - deserved fire for his high compensation in the face of poor results and a declining stock price .
He was paid a one - time $ 75 million bonus at the end of 2008 — suspicious timing given that the stock had lost most of its value in recent months and Mr. McClendon had lost his entire stake in the company to margin calls . " ]
Most shale operators work on borrowed capital — who is going to lend that kind of money [ ~ $ 150 billion for the ~ 30,000 wells required to quadruple shale gas production ] to companies like HK [ Petrohawk ] and CHK [ Chesapeake ] that are already in debt up to their eyeballs ?
[ My note : The 10 k is a document filed with the SEC that contains ... the same financial statements the annual report does in a more detailed form . ]
I entirely agree with Berman 's take on things here .
There 's no dearth of clueless analysts — I 've read or listened to more than a few .
Berman 's deeper point about propaganda is also right on the mark .
In the Age of Hype , the Ponzi Scheme and the Swindle , why would n't some natural gas companies want to get in on the deal ?
Other analysts like Ben Dell , a senior energy analyst at Bernstein Research in New York , are suspicious about corporate reporting of returns on shale wells .
In a March 27 research note , [ Dell ] notes “ a growing discrepancy between the internal rates of return ( IRR ) presented in corporate presentations and company reported ROACE ( return on average capital employed ) ...
For example , in many plays companies claim to generate IRR ’s above 100 % at $ 7.50 / mcf gas or claim that their production is economical even at $ 2 - 3 / mcf gas prices , but at the same time report 6 - 7 % ROACE at a corporate level over the last 3 years , when the average gas price was $ 7.50 / mcf . ”
Titled “ Why the Haynesville Wo n’t Work …at $ 4 , $ 5 , or $ 6 / mcf gas ” , Dell posits that companies are overstating production , understating costs , or there is a terminology gap at work .
For example , a producer could say the IP rate of a well ( Initial Production ) is 8 mmcf /d ( million cubic feet per day ) .
But was that a 30 day average , as is normal , or was it a 12 hour average just after coming online .
These HD wells can decline in production so rapidly sometimes that for stock promotion purposes , companies issue figures that may have been correct for a short time , but have no context and are not really “ best practices ” type numbers .
Dell also questions if the all in costs of a well are being amortized properly into the economics that appear in a company ’s press release .
If the cash operating cost of a well is $ 3 / mcf , which is the number that appears in a release that does not include the $ 4 - 7 million it cost to buy the land and drill the hole - costs that Dell suggests basically doubles the breakeven level of the well to $ 6 / mcf .
And to get an acceptable return - even to generate enough cash to drill the next well - would be $ 8 / mcf .
Dell 's analysis and Berman 's are the same in all the essentials .
Let 's sum up the situation so far —
Shale gas operators are up to their eyeballs in debt .
They would need to borrow vast sums of money — Berman suggests it would take ~ 30,000 wells and ~ $ 150 billion — to get shale gas up to 40 % of total U.S. dry gas production by 2013 .
Shale gas operators can't possibly make money at current natural gas prices , or medium - term future prices if these are close to the 15 - year average ( ~$ 5.50 / Mcf ) .
The situation is actually worse than our summary indicates .
Shale gas wells have very steep decline rates .
Consider the Griffith # 1 well in the Haynesville as reported at Rigzone .
The Griffith # 1 well located in Desoto Parish , Louisiana was completed and brought online in January 2009 .
The exact reading for total gas produced from the Haynesville shale [ Griffith # 1 ] and shipped to market through March 10 , 2009 is reported at 568,856 Mcf or .568 Bcf ...
The Haynesville Shale play is a new play less than one year old and there is limited data to work with to determine the decline rate for Haynesville Shale wells .
[ Mainland Resources , Inc. ] believes that the recoverable reserves for the Griffith well may ultimately be from 7.5 Bcf to 15.81 Bcf .
The 15.81 Bcf rate was determined by a reserve report for the Griffith # 1 done by T.W. McQuire & Associates , Inc. , prepared pursuant to U.S. Securities legislation .
The ultimate recovery was determined by using a type curve that uses 80 % decline for the first year , followed by 30 % decline for the second year , 15 % decline for the third year , and then a 10 % decline over the remaining expected life of the well .
This decline was derived from the Deutsche Bank report issued in 7/08 based on a study of various shale plays .
[ My note : The quoted .568 Bcf is over the first 40 days of operation .
Using a type curve to figure declines in the Haynesville may be misleading .
Berman 's observed decline rates for the Barnett Shale are as follows :
Year 1 : 65 % ;
Year 2 : 53 % ;
Year 3 : 23 % ;
Year 4 : 21 % ;
Year 5 : 20 % ;
Year 6 : 17 % ;
Year 7 : 21 %
Berman notes that " there is no empirical justification to lower terminal decline rates to 10 % / year , and there is no factual evidence for the declines used in Years 2 & 3 by Deutsche Bank .
This is what happens when bankers try to do petroleum engineering and geology .
They have used a model to get these declines but have not bothered to calibrate it against the only shale play in the world with enough production history to it compare to . " ]
The Griffith # 1 well may or may not turn out to be a winner , but the reserves ( 7.5 - 15.8 Bcf ) seem inordinately large for a shale gas well .
Steep declines several years into production , even when there is a high initial flow rate , largely determine what the well reserves will be , which Berman calculated as only 0.6 Bcf on average for the 11,500 wells drilled in the Barnett Shale .
And we only hear about the successful wells , the creme de la creme .
It would be unusual to find a story at Rigzone that reads like this —
Desoto Parish , Louisiana -- March 13 , 2010
Mainland Resources , Inc. announced today that their Bogus # 2 well in the Haynesville showed weak flows in the first few weeks after production began ... Spokesman John Q. Smith said " we probably wo n't get 0.3 Bcf out of the damn thing ...
We 'll never get our money back . "
He called the results " very disappointing . " ...
Smith concluded that " drilling this well was a complete waste of time and money . "
When we consider disappointing wells and high decline rates in successful wells , it is clear that getting shale gas up to 40 % of U.S. production by 2013 is not only very expensive — $ 7.5 - 10.5 million for drilling & completion according to Berman — but also requires poking a lot of very expensive holes in the ground .
One problem with analysts like Tom Driscoll , who is a stock analyst working for Barclays , which is a bank , is that they remember how to add but they 've " forgotten " how to subtract .
This applies straightforwardly to the shale gas play .
The usual human bias , as evidenced in Rigzone stories , is to play up the successes and ignore the failures , as Nassim Taleb pointed out in his book Fooled By Randomness .
We see the single entrepreneur who succeeded on TV , but we never hear about the 10,000 who failed .
This introduces a significant skew into the data being examined .
I do not mean to make a sweeping generalization .
Paul Horsnell , who is an oil market analyst at Barclays , knows what he 's talking about .
The optimists ' response to all this bad news is summed up by Keith Shaefer 's Natural Gas : Costs go down as learning curve goes up .
To give the opposition equal time , I will quote it at length .
Operating costs are still coming down in North American natural gas and oil plays .
This is n’t showing up as reduced all - in costs on the financial statements of these energy producers just yet , but it will .
Costs are lowering for two reasons .
One is demand destruction , which has cut in half the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas in North America .
This has meant that rig rates have also dropped — energy executives are saying they see 20 % - 35 % cost reductions year over year .
Lower drilling costs have an obvious impact on profitability .
The second is that companies in both the US and Canada are figuring out how to properly frac these new unconventional gas plays — both tight gas and shale gas ...
Calgary based securities firm Tristone Capital says wells in the Montney gas play on the BC - Alberta border are now 8 - 10 mmcf /d [ million cubic feet ] , about twice what they were when the play first started .
... the energy producers are learning how to frac these plays much better , using special mixes of chemicals and water to get the most oil or gas out of these new , very tight reservoirs .
It can sometimes take some expensive trial and error on how to get that frac formula right .
Tristone estimates the average break even level of these new shale plays is now hovering around $ 5 / mcf , with the best plays already at $ 4 , and as the learning curve goes up , the cost curve will continue to go down , taking the break even price for natural gas production down with it .
What will likely mask these costs on the financial statements of these companies is the huge land acquisition costs these companies had to pay for these unconventional plays .
As an example , British Columbia in Canada has sold their land rights at an average $ 680 / hectare ( 1 hectare = 2.5 acres ) compared to $ 3511 per hectare over the same time frame in 2008 -- and B.C. has the new Horn River Basin in the north and part of the Montney gas play along the Alberta border .
Both 2007 and 2008 saw huge land cost increases across North America as companies rushed in to buy up acreage ...
Until some of these high land costs are amortized out , do n’t expect to see the “ accounting ” cost of finding a barrel of oil [ gas ] -- usually shown as DD&A - Depletion , Depreciation and Amortization — on the balance sheet , to go down much , even though “ real ” costs are dropping a lot .
So when people ask “ Where is all the cheap gas ? ” , it ’s here , and it ’s getting cheaper by the month , but it might not show up in the companies ’ financial statements for awhile .
It appears Tritone has changed its tune , revising its $ / Mcf from $ 8.50 ( Figure 2 ) to $ 5 .
This story says that 1 ) previous " all - in " costs of $ 7.50 or more were due to expensive land acquisition ; 2 ) oilfield expenses are declining as rig rates go down ; and 3 ) operators are ascending the learning curve for shale drilling , which lowers costs and boosts reserves & flows .
These factors imply that fewer wells will produce more gas due to " more productive horizontal rigs , " as Driscoll maintains .
Berman 's response ?
If shale operators cannot substantially reduce their costs , I doubt that most of them can survive a year or so more of low prices ( Barclay 's " low camp " $ 5 - 6 / Mcf ) because their marginal cost of production is $ 7 - 8 / Mcf , much less find $ 150 billion or so for more unprofitable drilling .
I believe that the cost of services will escalate at a higher rate than cost , and will never drop to meet low price ( except for possibly too brief a period for most operators to take advantage of ) .
Actually the frac costs keep increasing because operators are now commonly using 10 - 12 - stage fracs that cost millions .
Rates are higher but at what cost and for how long ?
The key here is that the extra cost may only accomplish a rate acceleration and not an increase in reserves .
In the Barnett Shale , the average horizontally drilled and fractured wells only have ~ 25 % more reserves than vertical wells but 3 x the cost !
This talk about lowering operating cost and increasing reserves is more propaganda , and most cost benefit is more than negatively compensated by more interest expense on debt .
Let 's sum up .
A Shale Gas Boom ?
Will we have a shale gas boom ?
I 've described the contentious argument among those who follow the natural gas industry .
Generally , my sympathy lies with skeptics like Art Berman .
As someone who has written extensively about peak oil , I 've encountered the human proclivity to hype a situation far beyond any semblance to reality time and time again — the Jack # 2 discovery in the Gulf of Mexico comes to mind .
Nevertheless , I 'm going to say the jury is still out on this one .
That 's not a cop-out , because the verdict will be in very soon , certainly within the next few years .
Art Berman is making specific predictions , just as Driscoll , Shaefer , and Ziff Energy do .
Berman surmises that natural gas prices may stay below or in their average range ( ~$ 5.50 ) for a few years based on a host of new factors that include greater availability of tight gas from the Rockies and increased LNG imports .
If Berman is right , we will not see large increases in shale gas production through 2011 , or some companies will go belly up , or both .
Promoters like T. Boone Pickens and Aubrey McClendon have offered us a Golden Vision of a future powered by natural gas .
Their forecasts assume a shale boom that will last for decades .
But we should n't count our chickens before they 're hatched .
It costs us very little to take a wait & see attitude on the shale gas boom — we'll know soon enough if it 's for real .

I could frequently distinguish the word YAHOO , which was repeated by each of them several times : and although it was impossible for me to conjecture what it meant , yet while the two horses were busy in conversation , I endeavoured to practise this word upon my tongue ; and as soon as they were silent , I boldly pronounced YAHOO in a loud voice , imitating at the same time , as near as I could , the neighing of a horse ; at which they were both visibly surprised ; and the gray repeated the same word twice , as if he meant to teach me the right accent ; wherein I spoke after him as well as I could , and found myself perceivably to improve every time , though very far from any degree of perfection .
Healthy cheerfulness and good spirits forming a part of the banquet , I could soak my crusts in the fountain with Le Sage 's strolling player , and revel in their glad enjoyment : but sitting down with so many fellow - animals to ward off thirst and hunger as a business ; to empty , each creature , his Yahoo 's trough as quickly as he can , and then slink sullenly away ; to have these social sacraments stripped of everything but the mere greedy satisfaction of the natural cravings ; goes so against the grain with me , that I seriously believe the recollection of these funeral feasts will be a waking nightmare to me all my life .

Real Close to the Machine : Floating Point in D
Introduction
by Don Clugston
Computers were originally conceived as devices for performing mathematics .
The earliest computers spent most of their time solving equations .
Although the engineering and scientific community now forms only a miniscule part of the computing world , there is a fantastic legacy from those former times : almost all computers now feature superb hardware for performing mathematical calculations accurately and extremely quickly .
Sadly , most programming languages make it difficult for programmers to take full advantage of this hardware .
An even bigger problem is the lack of documentation ; even for many mathematical programmers , aspects of floating - point arithmetic remain shrouded in mystery .
As a systems programming language , the D programming language attempts to remove all barriers between the programmer and the compiler , and between the programmer and the machine .
This philosophy is particularly evident in support for floating - point arithmetic .
A personal anecdote may illustrate the importance of having an accurate understanding of the hardware .
My first floating - point nightmare occurred in a C++ program which hung once in every hundred runs or so .
I eventually traced the problem to a while loop which occasionally failed to terminate .
The essence of the code is shown in Listing 1 .
double q [ 8 ] ; ... int x = 0 ; while ( x < 8 ) { if ( q [ x ] >= 0 ) return true ; if ( q[ x ] < 0 ) ++x ; } return false ;
Initially , I was completely baffled as to how this harmless - looking loop could fail .
But eventually , I discovered that q had not been initialized properly ; q [ 7 ] contained random garbage .
Occasionally , that garbage had every bit set , which mean that q [ 7 ] was a Not - a - Number ( NaN ) , a special code which indicates that the value of the variable is nonsense .
NaNs were not mentioned in the compiler 's documentation - the only information I could find about them was in Intel 's assembly instruction set documentation !
Any comparison involving a NaN is false , so q [ 7 ] was neither >= 0 , nor < 0 , killing my program .
Until that unwelcome discovery , I 'd been unaware that NaNs even existed .
I had lived in a fool 's paradise , mistakenly believing that every floating point number was either positive , negative , or zero .
My experience would have been quite different in D . The " strange " features of floating point have a higher visibility in the language , improving the education of numerical programmers .
Uninitialized floating point numbers are initialized to NaN by the compiler , so the problematic loop would fail every time , not intermittently .
Numerical programmers in D will generally execute their programs with the ' invalid ' floating point exception enabled .
Under those circumstances , as soon as the program accessed the uninitialized variable , a hardware exception would occur , summoning the debugger .
Easy access to the " strange " features of floating point results in better educated programmers , reduced confusion , faster debugging , better testing , and hopefully , more reliable and correct numerical programs .
This article will provide a brief overview of the support for floating point in the D programming language .
Demystifying Floating - Point
D guarantees that all built - in floating - point types conform to IEEE 754 arithmetic , making behaviour entirely predictable ( note that this is not the same as producing identical results on all platforms ) .
IEEE 754-2008 is the latest revision of the IEEE 754 Standard for Floating - Point Arithmetic .
D is progressing towards full compliance with 754-2008 .
The IEEE standard floating point types currently supported by D are float and double .
Additionally , D supports the real type , which is either ' IEEE 80 - bit extended ' if supported by the CPU ; otherwise , it is the same as double .
In the future , the new types from 754-2008 will be added : quadruple , decimal64 , and decimal128 .
The characteristics of these types are easily accessible in the language via properties .
For example , float.max is the maximum value which can be stored in a float ; float .
mant_dig is the number of digits ( bits ) stored in the mantissa .
To make sense of mathematics in D , it 's necessary to have a basic understanding of IEEE floating - point arithmetic .
Fundamentally , it is a mapping of the infinitely many real numbers onto a small number of bytes .
Only 4000 million distinct numbers are representable as an IEEE 32 - bit float .
Even with such a pathetically small representation space , IEEE floating point arithmetic does a remarkably good job of maintaining the illusion that mathematical real numbers are being used ; but it 's important to understand when the illusion breaks down .
Most problems arise from the distribution of these representable numbers .
The IEEE number line is quite different to the mathematical number line .
+ +-----------+------------+ .. + ..
+----------+----------+ + # - infinity - float .max - 1 - float .min_normal 0 float .min_normal 1 float .max infinity NaN
Notice that half of the IEEE number line lies between - 1 and +1 .
There are 1000 million representable floats between 0 and 0.5 , but only 8 million between 0.5 and 1 .
This has important implications for accuracy : the effective precision is incredibly high near zero .
Several examples will be presented where numbers in the range - 1 to +1 are treated seperately to take advantage of this .
Notice also the special numbers : ±∞ ; the so - called " subnormals " between ±float .
min_normal and 0 , which are represented at reduced precision ; the fact that there are TWO zeros , +0 and - 0 , and finally " NaN " ( " Not - a - Number " ) , the nonsense value , which caused so much grief in Listing 1 .
Why does NaN exist ?
It serves a valuable role : it eradicates undefined behaviour from floating - point arithmetic .
This makes floating - point completely predictable .
Unlike the int type , where 3/0 invokes a hardware division by zero trap handler , possibly ending your program , the floating - point division 3.0/0.0 results in ∞.
Numeric overflow ( eg , real .
max * 2 ) also creates ∞.
Depending on the application , ∞ may be a perfectly valid result ; more typically , it indicates an error .
Nonsensical operations , such as 0.0 / 0.0 , result in NaN ; but your program does not lose control .
At first glance , infinity and NaN may appear unnecessary -- why not just make it an error , just as in the integer case ?
After all , it is easy to avoid division by zero , simply by checking for a zero denominator before every division .
The real difficulty comes from overflow : it is extremely difficult to determine in advance whether an overflow will occur in a multiplication .
Subnormals are necessary to prevent certain anomalies , and preserve important relationships such as : " x - y == 0 if and only if x == y " .
Since ∞ can be produced by overflow , both +∞ and -∞ are required .
Both +0 and - 0 are required in order to preserve identities such as : if x>0 , then 1 / ( 1/x ) >
0 . In almost all other cases , however , there is no difference between +0 and - 0 .
It 's worth noting that these ‘ special values ’ are usually not very efficient .
On x86 machines , for example , a multiplication involving a NaN , an infinity , or a subnormal can be twenty to fifty times slower than an operation on normal numbers .
If your numerical code is unexpectedly slow , it 's possible that you are inadvertently creating many of these special values .
Enabling floating - point exception trapping , described later , is a quick way to confirm this .
One of the biggest factor obscuring what the machine is doing is in the conversion between binary and decimal .
You can eliminate this by using the " %a " format when displaying results .
This is an invaluable debugging tool , and an enormously helpful aid when developing floating - point algorithms .
The 0x1.23Ap+6 hexadecimal floating - point format can also be used in source code for ensuring that your input data is exactly what you intended .
The Quantized Nature of Floating - Point
The fact that the possible values are limited gives access to some operations which are not possible on mathematical real numbers .
Given a number x , next Up ( x ) gives the next representable number which is greater than x. nextDown ( x ) gives the next representable number which is less than x .
Numerical analysts often describe errors in terms of " units in the last place " ( ulp ) , a surprisingly subtle term which is often used rather carelessly .
[ footnote :
The most formal definition is found in [ J. - M. Muller , " On the definition of ulp ( x ) " , INRIA Technical Report 5504 ( 2005 ) . ] :
If x is a real number that lies between two finite consecutive floating - point numbers a and b of type F , without being equal to one of them , then ulp ( x ) =abs ( b - a ) ; otherwise ulp ( x ) = x*F.epsilon .
Moreover , ulp ( NaN ) is NaN , and ulp ( ±F.infinity ) = ± F.max*F.epsilon . ]
I prefer a far simpler definition :
The difference in ulps between two numbers x and y is is the number of times which you need to call nextUp ( ) or nextDown ( ) to move from x to y .
[ Footnote :
This will not be an integer if either x or y is a real number , rather than a floating point number . ]
The D library function feqrel( x , y ) gives the number of bits which are equal between x and y ; it is an easy way to check for loss - of - precision problems .
The quantized nature of floating point has some interesting consequences .
ANY mathematical range [ a , b ) , ( a , b ] , or ( a , b ) can be converted into a range or the form [ a , b ] .
( The converse does not apply : there is no ( a , b ) equivalent to [ - ∞ , ∞ ] ) .
A naive binary chop does n't work correctly .
The fact that there are hundreds or thousands of times as many representable numbers between 0 and 1 , as there are between 1 and 2 , is problematic for divide - and - conquer algorithms .
A naive binary chop would divide the interval [ 0 .. 2 ] into [ 0 .. 1 ] and [ 1 .. 2 ] .
Unfortunately , this is not a true binary chop , because the interval [ 0 .. 1 ] contains more than 99 % of the representable numbers from the original interval !
Condition number
Using nextUp , it 's easy to approximately calculate the condition number .
real x = 0x1.1p13L ; real u = next Up( x ) ; int bitslost = feqrel( x , u ) - feqrel ( exp ( x ) , exp ( u ) ) ;
This shows that at these huge values of x , a one - bit error in x destroys 12 bits of accuracy in exp ( x ) !
The error has increased by roughly 6000 units in the last place .
The condition number is thus 6000 at this value of x .
The semantics of float , double , and real
For the x86 machines which dominate the market , floating point has traditionally been performed on a descendent of the 8087 math coprocessor .
These " x87 " floating point units were the first to implement IEEE754 arithmetic .
The SSE2 instruction set is an alternative for x86 - 64 processors , but x87 remains the only portable option for floating point 32 - bit x86 machines ( no 32 - bit AMD processors support SSE2 ) .
The x87 is unusual compared to most other floating - point units .
It _only_ supports 80 - bit operands , henceforth termed " real80 " .
All double and float operands are first converted to 80 - bit , all arithmetic operations are performed at 80 - bit precision , and the results are reduced to 64 - bit or 32 - bit precision if required .
This means that the results can be significantly more accurate than on a machine which supports at most 64 bit operations .
However , it also poses challenges for writing portable code .
( Footnote :
The x87 allows you to reduce the mantissa length to be the same as ' double or float , but it retains the real80 exponent , which means different results are obtained with subnormal numbers .
To precisely emulate double arithmetic slows down floating point code by an order of magnitude ) .
Apart from the x87 family , the Motorola 68 K ( but not Cold Fire ) and Itanium processors are the only ones which support 80 - bit floating point .
A similar issue relates to the FMA ( fused multiply and accumulate ) instruction , which is available on an increasing number of processors , including PowerPC , Itanium , Sparc , and Cell .
On such processors , when evaluating expressions such as x*y + z , the x*y is performed at twice the normal precison .
Some calculations which would otherwise cause a total loss of precision , are instead calculated exactly .
The challenge for a high - level systems programming language is to create an abstraction which provides predictable behaviour on all platforms , but which nonetheless makes good use of the available hardware .
D's approach to this situation arises from the following observations :
It is extremely costly performance - wise to ensure identical behaviour on all processors .
In particular , it is crippling for the x87 .
Very many programs will only run on a particular processor .
It would be unfortunate to deny the use of more accurate hardware , for the sake of portability which would never be required .
The requirements for portability and for high precision are never required simultaneously .
If double precision is inadequate , increasing the precision on only some processors does n't help .
The language should not be tied to particular features of specific processors .
A key design goal is : it should be possible to write code such that , regardless of the processor which is used , the accuracy is never worse than would be obtained on a system which only supports the double type .
( Footnote : real is close to ‘ indigenous ’ in the Borneo proposal for the Java programming language [ Ref Borneo ] ) .
Consider evaluating x*y + z*w , where x , y , z and w are double .
double r1 = x * y + z * w ; double a = x * y ; double r2 = a + z * w ; real b = x * y ; double r3 = b + z * w ;
Note that during optimisation , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) may be transformed into ( 1 ) , but this is implementation - dependent .
Case ( 2 ) is particularly problematic , because it introduces an additional rounding .
On a " simple " CPU , r1==r2==r3 .
We will call this value r0 .
On PowerPC , r2==r3 , but r1 may be more accurate than the others , since it enables use of FMA .
On x86 , r1==r3 , which may be more accurate than r0 , though not as much as for the PowerPC case .
r2 , however , may be LESS accurate than r0 .
By using real for intermediate values , we are guaranteed that our results are never worse than for a simple CPU which only supports double .
Properties of the Built - in Types
The fundamental floating - point properties are epsilon , min_normal and max .
The six integral properties are simply the log2 or log10 of these three .
float double real80 quadruple decimal64 decimal 128 epsilon

When writing code which should adapt to different CPUs at compile time , use static if with the mant_dig property .
For example , static if ( real.mant_dig==64 ) is true if 80 - bit reals are available .
For binary types , the dig property gives only the minimum number of valid decimal digits .
To ensure that that every representable number has a unique decimal representation , two additional digits are required .
Similarly , for decimal numbers , mant_dig is a lower bound on the number of valid binary digits .
Useful relations for a floating point type F , where x and y are of type F
The smallest representable number is F.min_normal * F.epsilon
Any integer between 0 and ( 1/F.epsilon ) can be stored in F without loss of precision .
1/F.epsilon is always a exact power of the base .
can be stored in F without loss of precision .
is always a exact power of the base .
If a number x is subnormal , x*( 1/F.epsilon ) is normal , and exponent ( x ) = exponent ( x*( 1/F.epsilon ) ) - ( mant_dig -1 ) .
is subnormal , is normal , and .
x>0 if and only if 1/( 1/x ) >
0 ; x < 0 if and only if 1 /( 1/x ) < 0 .
if and only if ; if and only if .
If x - y==0 , then x==y && is Finite ( x ) && is Finite(y ) .
Note that if x==y==infinity , then isNaN ( x -y ) .
, then .
Note that if , then .
F.max * F.min_normal = 4.0 for binary types , 10.0 for decimal types .
Addition and subtraction
Some loss of precision occurs with x±y if exponent ( x ) !
=exponent(y ) .
The number of digits of precision which are lost is abs ( exponent ( x ) - exponent (y ) ) .
x±y has total loss of precision , if and only if ( 1 ) abs ( x * F.epsilon ) > abs(y ) , in which case x+y == x , x-y == x or ( 2 ) abs (y * F.epsilon ) > abs( x ) , in which case x+y == y , x-y == -y
, in which case x+y == x , x-y == x or ( 2 ) , in which case x+y == y , x-y == -y Addition is commutative : a + b == b + a .
. Subtraction is not quite commutative : a - b == - ( b - a ) , but produce +0 and - 0 if a==b .
, but produce +0 and - 0 if a==b .
Addition is not associative at all .
Multiplication and division
Multiplication and division are always at risk of overflow or underflow .
For any abs( x ) >
F.epsilon , there is at least one finite y such that x/y will overflow to ∞.
For any abs( x ) < F.epsilon , there is at least one finite y such that x/y will underflow to zero .
For any abs( x ) > 1 , there is at least one finite y such that x*y will overflow to ∞.
For any abs ( x ) < 1 , there is at least one finite y such that x*y will underflow to zero .
at risk of overflow or underflow .
For any , there is at least one finite such that will overflow to ∞ .
For any , there is at least one finite such that will underflow to zero .
For any , there is at least one finite such that will overflow to ∞ .
For any , there is at least one finite such that will underflow to zero .
x*x will overflow if abs ( x ) > sqrt ( F.max ) , and underflow to zero if abs ( x ) < sqrt(F.min_normal*F.epsilon )
will overflow if , and underflow to zero if Multiplication is commutative .
a * b == b * a
. Multiplication is not associative in general : a *( b* c ) != ( a *b ) * c , because ( 1 ) there is a risk of overflow or underflow and ( 2 ) b*c may be an exact calculation , so that a *( b * c ) contains only one round - off error , whereas ( a*b ) * c contains two .
The roundoff errors may therefore accumulate at the rate of just under 1 ulp per multiplication .
, because ( 1 ) there is a risk of overflow or underflow and ( 2 ) may be an exact calculation , so that contains only one round - off error , whereas contains two .
The roundoff errors may therefore accumulate at the rate of just under 1 ulp per multiplication .
However , a limited form of associativity is possible if the type used for intermediate results is larger than any of the operands ( which happens on x87 and Itanium machines ) .
If R is the intermediate type , and F is the type being multiplied , up to min( R.max_exp/F.max_exp , R.epsilon/F.epsilon ) values of type F can be multiplied together in any order without influencing the result .
For example , if R is double , multiplication of 8 floats f1*f2*f3*f4*f5*f6*f7*f8 is completely associative .
On x87 , 130 floats can be safely multiplied together in any order , and 16 doubles can similarly be multiplied together safely .
Strict distributivity does not hold even under these circumstances , as it may destroy the sign of - 0 .

On x87 , 130 floats can be safely multiplied together in any order , and 16 doubles can similarly be multiplied together safely .
Strict distributivity does not hold even under these circumstances , as it may destroy the sign of - 0 .
The distributive law almost never holds .
For example , 4 *x + 6 *x != 10*x if x==nextDown ( 1.5 ) . a*x + b*x == ( a+b ) * x for all x only if the operations a*x , b*x , and ( a+b ) are all exact operations , which is true only if a and b are exact powers of 2 .
Even then , if a== - b and x== - 0 , then a*x+b*x==0.0 , ( a+b ) *x== -0.0 .
if . for all only if the operations , and are all exact operations , which is true only if and are exact powers of 2 .
Even then , if and , then .
Performing a division by multiplication by the reciprocal returns a result which ( in round - to - nearest mode ) is at most 1.5 ulps from the correctly rounded result .
For almost any denominator , the rounding is incorrect ( >0.5ulps ) for 27 % of numerators .

Powers and logarithms
F.mant_dig = - log2 ( F.epsilon ) for binary types ;
for binary types ; F.dig = - log10 ( F.epsilon ) for decimal types .
for decimal types .
F.max = exp2 ( F.max_exp *(1-F.epsilon ) ) for binary types ;
for binary types ; F.max = exp10 ( F.max_10_exp *( 1-F.epsilon ) ) for decimal types .
for decimal types .
For any positive finite x , F.min_exp - F.mant_dig <= log2( x ) < F.max_exp for binary types , F.min_10_exp - F.dig <= log10 ( x ) < F.max_10 _exp for decimal types
, for binary types , for decimal types exp2( x ) == 0 if x < F.min_exp - F.mant_dig , exp2(x ) == infinity if x >= F.max_exp
NaN payloads
According to the IEEE 754 standard , a ‘ payload ’ can be stored in the mantissa of a NaN .
This payload can contain information about how or why it was generated .
Historically , almost no programming languages have ever made use of this potentially powerful feature .
In D , this payload consists of a positive integer .
real NaN( ulong payload ) -- create a NaN with a " payload " , where the payload is a ulong .
-- create a NaN with a " payload " , where the payload is a . ulong getNaNPayload ( real x ) -- returns the integer payload .
Note that if narrowing conversions have occured , the high - order bits may have changed .
Never store a pointer as an integer payload inside a NaN .
The garbage collector will not be able to find it !
NCEG comparison operations
As well as the usual < , > , <= , and >= comparison operators , D also supports the " NCEG " operators .
Most of them are the direct negation of the ordinary operators .
Additionally , <> , <>= , !<> , and !<>= are provided .
These 8 new operators are different from the normal operators only when a NaN is involved , so for the most part they are quite obscure .
They are useful mainly in eliminating the possibility of NaN before beginning a calculation .
The most useful relationships are probably :
x <>= y is the same as ! isNaN( x ) && ! isNaN(y ) , ( except that signalling NaNs may be triggered by <>= ) .
is the same as , ( except that signalling NaNs may be triggered by <>= ) .
x !<>= y is the same as isNaN ( x ) || isNaN(y ) .
y
!isNaN(x ) and isNaN( x )
x==x
!isNaN(x )
x!=x
isNaN(x )
abs(x ) !< x.infinity
isNaN(x ) || isInfinity ( x )
The IEEE Rounding Modes
Ifis any compile - time constant ( eg 0 ) , these reduce to .
Note thatis the same as , andis the same asis the same as The above relationships are useful primarily because they can be used in compile time functions .
Very few uses are known for the remaining NCEG operators .
The rounding mode is controlled within a scope .
Rounding mode will be restored to its previous state at the end of that scope .
Four rounding modes can be set .
The default mode , Round to nearest , is the most statistically accurate , but the least intuitive .
In the event of tie , the result is rounded to an even number .
Rounding mode rndint ( 4.5 ) rndint ( 5.5 ) rndint ( - 4.5 ) Notes Round to nearest 4 6 - 4 Ties round to an even number Round down 4 5 - 5 Round up 5 6 - 4 Round to zero 4 5 - 4
There are very few reasons for changing the rounding mode .
The round - up and round - down modes were created specifically to allow fast implementations of interval arithmetic ; they are crucial to certain libraries , but rarely used elsewhere .
The round - to - zero mode is used for casting floating - point numbers to integers .
Since mode switching is slow , especially on Intel machines , it may be useful to switch to round - to - zero mode , in order to exactly duplicate the behaviour of cast ( int ) in an inner loop .
The only other commonly cited reason for changing the rounding mode is as a simple check for numerical stability : if the calculation produces wildly different results when the rounding mode is changed , it 's a clear sign that it is suffering from round - off errors .
The IEEE Exception Status Flags
All IEEE - compiliant processors include special status bits that indicate when " weird " things have happened that programs might want to know about .
For example , ieeeFlags.divideByZero tells if any infinities have been created by dividing by zero .
They are ' sticky ' bits : once they have been set , they remain set until explicitly cleared .
By only checking this once at the end of a calculation , it may be possible to avoid comparing thousands of comparisions that are almost never going to fail .
Here 's a list of the weird things that can be detected :
invalid
This is set if any NaN 's have been generated .
This can happen with ∞ - ∞ , ∞ * 0 , 0 * ∞ , 0/0 , ∞/∞ , ∞ %∞ , or x%0 , for any number x .
Several other operations , such as sqrt ( - 1 ) , can also generate a NaN .
The invalid condition is also set when a ' signalling NaN ' is accessed , indicating use of an uninitialized variable .
This almost always indicates a programming error .
overflow
Set if ∞ was generated by adding or multiplying two numbers that were so large that the sum was greater than real.max .
This almost always indicates that the result is incorrect ; and corrective action needs to be taken .
divisionByZero
Set if ±∞ was generated by dividing by zero .
This usually indicates a programming error , but not always ; some types of calculations return correct results even when division by zero occurs .
( For example , 1 / ( 1+ 1/ x ) == 0 if x == 0 ) .
Note that division by a tiny , almost - zero number also produces an infinite result , but sets the overflow flag rather than the divisionByZero flag .
underflow
This happens if two numbers are subtracted or divided and are so tiny that the result lost precision because it was subnormal .
Extreme underflow produces a zero result .
Underflow almost never creates problems , and can usually be ignored .
inexact
This indicates that rounding has occurred .
Almost all floating point operations set this flag !
It was apparently included in the hardware to support some arcane tricks used in the pioneering days of numerical analysis .
It can always be ignored .
Floating - point traps can be enabled for any of the categories listed above .
When enabled , a hardware exception will be generated .
This can be an invaluable debugging aid .
A more advanced usage , not yet supported on any platform ( ! ) is to provide a nested function to be used as a hardware exception handler .
This is most useful for the overflow and underflow exceptions .
Floating point and ‘ pure nothrow ’
Every floating point operation , even the most trivial , is affected by the floating - point rounding state , and writes to the sticky flags .
The status flags and control state are thus ' hidden variables ' , potentially affecting every pure function ; and if the floating point traps are enabled , any floating point operation can generate a hardware exception .
D provides a facility for the floating - point control mode and exception flags to be usable in limited circumstances even when pure and nothrow functions are called .
[ TODO : I 've made two proposals , but I have n't persauded Walter yet ! ] .
Conclusion
Although D is a general - purpose programming language and supports many high - level concepts , it gives direct and convenient access to almost all features of modern floating - point hardware .
This makes it an excellent language for development of robust , high - performance numerical code .
It is also a language which encourages a deep understanding of the machine , making it fertile ground for innovation and for developing new algorithms .

Achievement Beyond IQ : A Genetic Story Achievement Beyond IQ : A Genetic Story
It 's nice to see a bad idea demolished .
And that 's what Greven , et al. do in "
School achievement is predicted by self - perceived abilities ( SPAs ) -- but for genetic rather than environmental reasons .
So asking kids " Are you good at math and English ? " is indeed a good way to find out who is good at math and English ; and basic twin -study methods show that the answers to those questions are in fact genetically - driven , with heritability of 51 % and family environment explaining 2 % .
Another family environment channel shot down .
The authors drive that fact home :
Despite the fact that not a single twin or adoption study has investigated the genetic and environmental etiologies of SPAs , researchers have cited environmental factors as a leading causal explanation for constructs related to SPAs , such as self - efficacy ... and self - concept .....
Moreover , one of the most established theories of SPAs assumes that the development of individual differences in SPAs is shaped primarily by parents ' beliefs , expectations , attitudes , and behaviors ...
Of course , the bulk of the academic literature will surely go right on assuming that self - construct is driven by shared environment : " Surely , you do n't mean to imply that an entire field of research was a waste of time , do you ? "
And in the policy and non-profit worlds these results wo n't stop those "
More results :
The genetic component of self - perceived abilities ( SPA ) is a good predictor of achivement , after you control for IQ .
Even after you control for IQ and self - perceived ability , there 's still a big genetic residual -- about as big as IQ 's genetic channel :
So there are big genetic drivers of school achievement that do n't fit into the two simple boxes of IQ and SPA .
Sounds like an opportunity for some productive data - mining ....

A recent attack on a monastery practising a non-traditional brand of Buddhism is just one of a number of incidents that has raised concerns about curbs on religious freedom in Vietnam .
The BBC's Krassimira Twigg looks at the events at Bat Nha monastery .
The Bat Nha monastery is at the centre of a complex dispute
On 29 June , a group of vigilantes tried to evict the monks and nuns living at the Bat Nha monastery in Vietnam 's central highlands .
The attack left monks without food for two weeks and there is still no electricity or water at the monastery .
Although nobody was seriously hurt , buildings were ransacked , personal belongings were taken and monks were threatened .
Phap Hoi is one of 379 people living at the Bat Nha monastery .
In a telephone interview with the BBC , he said that although the attackers had stepped back , the monks and nuns were still living with the consequences of what happened .
" Life remains difficult .
The biggest problem is water .
We have no electricity and without electricity , we can't pump out water from the well , " he said .
" The kitchen and the dining hall are blocked , so we can't use them ...
We did n't have any food supplies for the first week .
Now people from the village bring food to us . "
Those familiar with the background of the story say the situation is complicated and ' murky ' .
Eyewitnesses say that in the crowd harassing the monks were other , more traditional , monks who are against the new teachings practised at the monastery .
Uniformed and plain clothes police were present too , but they reportedly did nothing to prevent the attack .
Tackling religion
The monks at Bat Nha monastery follow the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh - an internationally renowned Zen master , peace activist and bestselling author .
He 's been living in exile since 1966 , when he went to the US to call for an end to the war in his homeland .
Thich Nhat Hanh's Zen doctrine is popular among young Vietnamese He established Plum Village in southern France - a meditation centre and home to his Order of Interbeing .
In 2005 , the Vietnamese government invited him to return and lecture in the country .
Thich Duc Nghi , the abbot of Bat Nha monastery , also invited him to help with the development of the monastery .
Thich Nhat Hanh 's followers say they have bought the land and built buildings on it to accommodate the nearly 400 young Vietnamese monks and nuns who are undergoing training there in Plum Village practices .
But the opening up and the new tolerance towards non-traditional religious teachings was short - lived .
The head of the BBC's Vietnamese service , Giang Nguyen , says the government has already taken what it needed from a relationship with Thich Nhat Hanh , and is now turning its back on him .
When a violent conflict like that happens , the authorities have to intervene and they did nothing
Tran Giac Hanh
" At the time , the government wanted to be seen as flexible and able to accommodate different ideologies .
They wanted to be taken off the US religion blacklist , become a member of the WTO and attract more foreign investment .
They 've now achieved that , " he said .
Hanh 's followers feel that his Zen doctrine is seen as a potential threat by the Vietnamese government , as it is popular with young , educated and independent - minded people .
For Sister Chan Kong from Plum Village , it 's clear what the reasons behind the attack are .
" The government fear that we are too dynamic and they can't control us .
Local police in every province have been paying visits to the parents of our young disciples , telling them to get their sons and daughters out of Bat Nha because we are ' political ' . "
' Sensitive situation '
There has been no official statement about what happened at Bat Nha , and the media in Vietnam have not published any reports on the event .
But a clue to how the authorities view the teachings there can be found in a department for religious affairs document from 2008 , which criticises the monks from the Plum Village network for having the " wrong approach to the political issues of the Vietnamese state " .
Our investment in the youth of Vietnam , many of whom come from the poorest of the poor , has now been lost
Trish Thompson , Thich Nhat Hanh disciple A local police officer who wishes to remain anonymous told the BBC that the authorities had nothing to do with the attack and it was up to the monks to decide if they wanted to stay or go .
" This is an internal affair between two Buddhist groups .
We do n't know who the attackers are and where they come from .
There was a big crowd of people .
Some of them were wearing monastic clothes , so we could not conclude that they are criminals , " he said .
" The policemen present at the scene did n't intervene because that is a sensitive situation which needed to be dealt with by the security services and the government religious committee . "
Religious freedom is not the only concern for those involved .
Trish Thompson , a Thich Nhat Hanh disciple living in Vietnam , says the Bat Nha events raise broader issues .
" People from around the world , including me , have contributed nearly $ 1 m to the development of the monastery .
We feel our investment in the current and future youth of Vietnam , many of whom come from the poorest of the poor , has now been lost . "

A new program called Safe Calculator puts a fresh spin on computer safety : it uses encryption to lock down the system and help protect important information from an attack .
Safe Calculator : How it Works
When active , Safe Calculator appears to be just another standard Windows - based calculator .
However , it is designed to take an important piece of documentation , encrypt it and hide it within the application itself , similar to a virtual safe .
( Source : techchuck.com )
In many ways , computer hackers and house burglars operate in a similar fashion : both enter without consent , wait until the owner is not present and then clear out all valuables before anyone becomes the wiser .
If you owned a home , chances are you might keep your valuables locked away in a safe .
No Install Required , Easy to Operate
Many who have used Safe Calculator say that it is very user - friendly and easy to operate .
Best of all , the application does not require any installation .
A user simply enters the pre-installed password , clicks a button on the left of the panel and " safe mode " kicks into gear .
While in safe mode , all of the calculator buttons change to reveal directional ones needed to walk a user through storing their personal data .
Some classic calculator buttons remain on the screen , but with different connotations .
When a user clicks the " + " button while in safe mode , the important file is successfully stored .
Pushing the " = " button next confirms this request .
After that , the user can execute their file , bring it back from hiding or delete it altogether .

( AP ) -- IBM Corp. is bulking up its most profitable division with a $ 1.2 billion acquisition of business software provider SPSS Inc. , a deal that also reflects the power of wealthy technology companies to throw their money around despite the recession .
The all - cash deal announced Tuesday represents a 42 percent premium over Chicago - based SPSS 's closing price of $ 35.09 on Monday .
SPSS 's software helps tell companies " what 's coming around the corner " and is " a really terrific acquisition " for IBM , said Charles King , analyst with the Pund - IT Inc. research firm .
" This is really a Cadillac - style technology ... it 's well established and well regarded , " King said .
SPSS 's technology is used to comb through stockpiles of data to predict things such as how a customer will respond to a particular sales pitch , or where hot spots for crime are and where police should be deployed .
The company claims its customers include agencies in all U.S. state governments , top U.S. universities and consumer goods , pharmaceutical and market - research companies .
" With this acquisition , we are extending our capabilities around a new level of analytics that not only provides clients with greater insight - but true foresight , " Ambuj Goyal , general manager of IBM's Information Management group , said in a statement .
The deal is expected to close later this year , and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval .
SPSS has more than 1,200 employees in 60 countries .
The company had $ 303 million in sales last year and $ 36 million in profit .
The acquisition fits with IBM 's strategy of strengthening its software and services divisions as a critical part of a makeover over the past decade .
IBM has spent more than $ 20 billion since 2003 on more than 80 acquisitions .
Fifty of those acquisitions have been software companies .
One result of the transformation is that IBM , a company known for its mainframes and other computers that have powered back offices for decades , is less reliant now on hardware .
Having sold off its personal computer and printing businesses , IBM makes most of its money off services and software .
In the latest quarter - the three months ended June 30 - IBM 's software division contributed 43 percent of IBM 's overall pretax profit .
Expanding its reliance on software is one reason the Armonk , N.Y. - based company is able to keep improving profits even as sales fall because of the economy .
IBM recently raised its latest 2009 profit forecast to $ 9.70 per share , from $ 9.20 per share .
Separately , IBM also has acquired Ounce Labs Inc. , a privately held software company in Waltham , Mass . , for an undisclosed amount .
IBM said the company makes software that helps businesses reduce the risk and costs associated with security and compliance concerns .
Beefing up the software division was a key reason IBM explored buying Sun Microsystems Inc. , a superstar of the dot - com era that struggled with inconsistent financial results for nearly a decade .
The Java technology that Sun invented is a key ingredient of the Internet , and IBM 's $ 7 billion offer for Sun was fueled in part by a desire to have more control over the software 's development .
The deal collapsed in a dispute over price and other terms .
Oracle Corp. ultimately agreed to buy Sun for $ 7.4 billion in cash in a surprise twist in the takeover saga .
The bidding was one of the first signs that cash - rich tech companies were willing to open their wallets again despite the recession .
Another big tech deal recently was data - storage specialist EMC Corp .'s $ 2.1 billion pickup of a company called Data Domain Inc. , whose technology helps companies cut the amount of information that gets stored multiple times .
EMC had been in a fierce bidding contest with rival NetApp Inc. for control of Data Domain .
SPSS shares on Tuesday jumped $ 14.27 , or 41 percent , to $ 49.36 .
IBM shares fell 73 cents to $ 116.90 .

Pack your cutlass and blunderbuss — it ’s time to go a-pirating !
The Invisible Hook takes readers inside the wily world of late seventeenth - and early eighteenth - century pirates .
With swashbuckling irreverence and devilish wit , Peter Leeson uncovers the hidden economics behind pirates ’ notorious , entertaining , and sometimes downright shocking behavior .
Why did pirates fly flags of Skull & Bones ?
Why did they create a “ pirate code ” ?
Were pirates really ferocious madmen ?
And what made them so successful ?
The Invisible Hook uses economics to examine these and other infamous aspects of piracy .
Leeson argues that the pirate customs we know and love resulted from pirates responding rationally to prevailing economic conditions in the pursuit of profits .
The Invisible Hook looks at legendary pirate captains like Blackbeard , Black Bart Roberts , and Calico Jack Rackam , and shows how pirates ’ search for plunder led them to pioneer remarkable and forward - thinking practices .
Pirates understood the advantages of constitutional democracy — a model they adopted more than fifty years before the United States did so .
Pirates also initiated an early system of workers ’ compensation , regulated drinking and smoking , and in some cases practiced racial tolerance and equality .
Leeson contends that pirates exemplified the virtues of vice — their self - seeking interests generated socially desirable effects and their greedy criminality secured social order .
Pirates proved that anarchy could be organized .
Revealing the democratic and economic forces propelling history ’s most colorful criminals , The Invisible Hook establishes pirates ’ trailblazing relevance to the contemporary world .
Peter T. Leeson is the BB&T Professor for the Study of Capitalism in the Department of Economics at George Mason University .
" A brisk , clever new book , The Invisible Hook , by Peter T. Leeson , an economist who claims to have owned a pirate skull ring as a child and to have had supply - and - demand curves tattooed on his right biceps when he was seventeen , offers a different approach .
Rather than directly challenging pirates ' leftist credentials , Leeson says that their apparent espousal of liberty , equality , and fraternity derived not from idealism but from a desire for profit . "
— Caleb Crain , New Yorker
" [ S ] urprising and engaging . . . . [ Leeson 's ] seminars must be wildly popular . "
— Stephen Sedley , London Review of Books
" Economist Leeson leads readers though a surprisingly entertaining crash course in economics in this study of high seas piracy at the turn of the 18th century .
. . .
Illustrated with salty tales of pirates both famous and infamous , the book rarely bogs down even when explaining intricate economic concepts , making it a great introduction to both pirate history and economic theory . "
— Publishers Weekly
" Mr. Leeson 's book represents a serious attempt to use the tools of economics to make sense of the institutions of piracy .
The book is another example of economic imperialism , the use of economics to make sense of real world phenomena that are outside the standard realm of economic science .
It addresses an important force that did , and does , impact world trade .
But as the skull and crossbones on its spine suggests , the book is also just fun .
. . .
[ T ]he book manages to be entertaining and informative .
It is a fun read and provides parents with something to teach their children while looking for pirate treasure left long ago at the beach . "

The Invisible Hook is quick - paced but thought - provoking .
Based on this work , the reader should look forward to more books by the author . "
— Claude Berube , Washington Times
" Piracy has not been Leeson 's only obsession .
The other has been economics .
When he was 17 years old he had supply and demand curves tattooed on his right bicep . . . now the professor has brought his two enthusiasms together in a wonderful ( and wonderfully titled ) new book .
The Invisible Hook is his study of the hidden economics of piracy . "
— Daniel Finkelstein , Times
" Jauntily characterising the typical pirate ship as akin to ' a Fortune 500 company ' , [ Leeson ] reorients pirates as precursors of Milton Friedman and the Chicago school of economics . "
— Ludovic Hunter - Tilney , Financial Times

" From countless films and books we all know that , historically , pirates were criminally insane , traitorous thieves , torturers and terrorists .

He reduces a veritable mountain of facts and history into an entertainingly educational experience . "
— Lewis Perdue , Barron's
" This engaging account is fun to read and full of humor , qualities not often associated with an explanation of economic theory .
. . .
This reviewer speculates that if more economic texts were written like this one , there would be a glut of economics majors to compensate for the shortage of pirates roaming the Atlantic . "
— Karl Helicher , Foreword Magazine
" Peter T. Leeson digs into the dollars and cents of piracy .
He urges us to see pirates as economic actors , their behavior shaped by incentives , just like the rest of us .
Once you 're in an economic state of mind , you can begin to understand actions such as lighting one 's beard on fire , voting , being decent to black people , and torturing captives ' f or fun ' — all equally nutty behaviors to the average 18th — century observer .
When Leeson is done guiding you through the pirate world , life on a rogue ship starts to look less like a Carnival cruise with cutlasses and cannons and more like an ongoing condo association meeting at sea . " — Katherine Mangu - Ward , Reason

. . .
Bottom line : Peter T. Leeson's
The Invisible Hook is an insightful hoot , and scores a couple of extra points for originality .
Economics - minded readers who enjoy historical adventure or relish over - the - top ' freakonomics ' should get a hearty yo- ho - ho out of this book .
Not to mention a 360 - degree brain twist before diving into that new Michael Crichton novel . "

" Peter Leeson 's The Invisible Hook argues that many of the founding principles of capitalist , liberal democracies are not rooted in the Glorious Revolution or the writing of the Declaration of Independence ; but the incentive structures necessary to keep a group of rowdy ocean - bound outlaws working as a team of ruthless sea bandits .

— Tim Wilson , IPA Reviews
" It 's Freakonomics meets Pirates of the Caribbean .
Jack Hirshleifer meets Jack Sparrow .
Fischer Black meets Blackbeard .
Adam Smith meets Captain Hook . . . .

And by the end of the book , he had me convinced of it . "

Piracy is not just a great topic for Walt Disney movies , but also an important economic phenomenon .
Leeson 's excellent book helps us to understand who pirates were , and why they chose their infamous occupation .
He uses economics to make sense of walking - the - plank and the Jolly Roger .
This is a fun book , but also a volume rich with insights and analysis . "
— Edward Glaeser , Harvard University
" Light of touch and truly eloquent , The Invisible Hook is a terrific read on a fascinating topic .
This is a beautifully written book . "

Back in 2001 , Q - Tip fans were anxiously awaiting the release of Kamaal the Abstract .
Well , 2001 came and went .
The same happened to 2002 and soon , fans became disenchanted with the idea of the disc .
Q - Tip then released a critically acclaimed album with The Renaissance in 2008 [ click to read ] .
Still , fans have been bothered by the unreleased project for some time .
Q - Tip felt the same .
“ I am really disappointed that Kamaal was n’t released , ” Q - Tip told RemixMag.com in May of 2004 [ click here ] .
“ LA Reid did n’t know what to do with it ; then , three years later , they release Outkast .
What Outkast is doing now , those are the kinds of sounds that are on Kamaal the Abstract .
Maybe even a little more out .
Kamaal was just me , guerrilla .
I did a lot of overdubs and sampling .
I hope to release it my own label , Abstract Artworks . ”
Now , fans and Tip can actually expect a release date for Kamaal the Abstract .
The long awaited project will be released September 15 barring any changes , via Battery Records .
The disc is entirely produced by Q , including live instrumentation .
After years , it ’s only right for it to be remixed and remastered but one thing will remain the same .
Instead of getting a new cover , the artwork will be as it was in ’01 .
According to Neil Levine of Battery Records , fans should n’t be afraid to cop an album that was made that long ago .
“ Kamaal the Abstract / Q- Tip is a true visionary and ahead of his time , ” he said via press release .
“ These songs sound more contemporary now than when they were first recorded . ”
The Landmark Legal Foundation filed Monday a House ethics complaint against Rep. John Conyers Jr. , Michigan Democrat , over his role in writing a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency that supported a waste project tied to his wife , a former Detroit City Council member who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery .
The foundation , a conservative public interest law firm in Virginia , called Mr. Conyers ’ actions in his wife ’s political dealings “ very serious allegations . ”
Mr. Conyers is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and a powerful member of the Congressional Black Caucus .
The foundation said Mr. Conyers attempted to influence the EPA on behalf of a family member , whose office reviewed a draft of the EPA letter he sent .
He also violated house rules by failing to report funds in a transaction by his wife , the complaint stated .
Monica Conyers pleaded guilty to a federal count of conspiracy to commit bribery for her role in accepting money in exchange for her vote in a city sludge hauling contract .
She is awaiting sentencing .
In a separate business arrangement , her former aide said he received $ 20,000 after she brokered a deal for consulting with a Detroit businessman whose company sought the injection well contract referenced in Mr. Conyers ’ EPA letter .
The aide , Sam Riddle , said Mrs. Conyers later demanded , and he paid her , a $ 10,000 “ finder ’s fee ” on the deal .
Mr. Conyers has yet to comment on his wife ’s federal bribery conviction , but Landmark says he needs to speak out on what he knew about the EPA letter and money received by his wife .
In late June , when news of the questionable EPA letter broke , Mr. Conyers ’ spokeswoman defended his switch in a statement : “ In the context of the Congressman ’s representational duties to his constituents , including the Detroit pension board , he determined that this was something the EPA should reconsider . ”
“ I do n’t believe John Conyers ’ wife could have done these things and John Conyers written the letter that he wrote without knowing something .
It ’s absolutely crucial that he be questioned under oath under penalty of perjury about what he knew , ” said Mark R. Levin , Landmark Legal Foundation president , about its ethics complaint , filed Monday to the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct .
Mr. Levin said his organization will be filing a similar request within the week for investigation with the public integrity section of the criminal division of the U.S. Justice Department .
“ Mr. Conyers ’ role needs a very thorough review both in terms of ethics in the House and in terms of criminal law , ” Mr. Levin said .
Mr. Conyers ’ spokesman , Jonathan Godfrey , did not respond to a request for comment on the ethics violations charges by Landmark .
Federal prosecutors in Mrs. Conyers case said they knew of nothing to suggest that Mr. Conyers knew anything about her dealings in the waste project .
In its complaint to the House committee , Landmark asserts that Mr. Conyers violated House Rule 25 , which covers the acceptance of gifts by members , officers and employees of the House .
It said the rule applies to family members of lawmakers .
Under the House Ethics Manual , “ No funds or things of value other than one ’s official salary may be accepted for dealing with an administrative agency on behalf of a constituent , ” the complaint said .
The complaint letter also said that he violated House Rule 26 .
The foundation said that federal law requires : “ No gift may be accepted pursuant to gift rules and regulations in return for being influenced in the performance of an official act . ”
The complaint also describes what it says was a flip - flop of Mr. Conyers ’ position with the EPA on the injection well contract .
“ It is important to note that Representative Conyers was originally opposed to the operation of these waste injection wells , ” the ethics complaint charges .
However , after his wife received $ 10,000 , he changed his position and advocated for EPA ’s approval of the well ’s operation , it said .
According to Associated Press reports , Mr. Conyers. 80 , is said to spend much of his time in Washington , while his wife , 44 , works in Detroit .
At the time of her plea deal in a Detroit courthouse , which Mr. Conyers did not attend , Mr. Conyers ’ House Judiciary Committee colleague Rep. Jerrold Nadler , New York Democrat , told the AP that “ it should n’t have any impact at all , ” on Mr. Conyers ’
House work .
Mrs. Conyers was a former aide to her husband .
They married in 1990 .
A former public schools educator , Mrs. Conyers first ran for public office in 2005 , earning her seat on the Detroit City Council by what some political consultants have described as her husband ’s name recognition .
During her tenure , she was outspoken , contentious and frequently sparred with council President Ken Cockrel Jr. , whom she publicly called “ Shrek ” in an exchange that made its way to the online video site YouTube .
A spokesman for Rep. Zoe Lofgren , a California Democrat who chairs the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct , did not respond to a request for comment on the ethics complaint .

[ Faith & Freedom , March 1951 ]
With the advent of war , what means are available to those who wish to resist the progressive socialization of American society ?
After every war , until the last one , the people took their liberty back .
It was understood that they would ; it was understood , in each case , that the government would surrender its extraordinary wartime powers and return to the form that was before .
But during World War II , as we know , the planners at Washington were writing the enlarged design for a controlled world — enlarged , that is , from the New Deal design .
They thought they had learned all they needed to know about controls , and they said , " You see that the economy has to be planned for war — prices , production , distribution and all .
What is good for war is good also for peace .
Unemployment can be planned away .
Prosperity can be planned .
The full life forever , with security and social justice — that can be planned . "
And the people , remembering the unplanned depression , answered saying , " Why not ? "
No Retreat
For the first time in our history , there was no intention on the part of government to return to the form that had been before , and from what followed we know that if a government is bent upon extending its power over the lives of the people , war is a wonderful occasion .
During the war it can invoke the laws of necessity and appeal to the spirit of unity ; and even while pretending to be tolerant of criticism , it can insist that criticism shall be constructive , not destructive , as if there could be any point in criticism that did not aim to destroy something .
Then after the war it says , as it said the last time , that the problems of transition from war to peace are more than the people can solve for themselves ; they need the aid and guidance of government much more than they need their liberty back .
These are not cynical reflections .
They rest upon experience .
One would have to be stupid , indeed , not to realize that with the political climate what it is , and has been for twenty years , you could almost as soon imagine putting the chicken back into the egg as to repack in a tight Constitutional box the powers of government that are released by total war .
A Question That May Fairly Tear You Apart
So it is war again , and the question comes , how now shall we behave ?
We , of course , means those who have been fighting the rise of the Welfare State and , in its name , the progressive socialization of American society .
Shall they go on with it ?
In war as in peace , shall they continue to say what they think of a government that tells the people socialism and liberty may dwell together amicably in the same house ?
It is a question that may fairly tear you apart .
Waiving the point as to whether they could if they would , some who are asking the question are not sure they would if they could .
They know that the conditions of total war are so extreme and the perils so great that unity may be imperative .
They know how easily going on with the fight could be construed as disaffection and how it might in fact implement disunity .
Only in a war that calls for less than the utmost exertions of the whole people may disaffection be tolerated .
In total war there arises almost at once a demand that disaffection shall be suppressed ; and if it is too large to be suppressed , as for example in the case of powerful pressure groups like organized labor , it may have to be bribed , and public opinion will condone the bribing of it .
This , of course , means nothing to those whose convictions might lead them to defy hostile public opinion and who could not at all be bribed .
Nevertheless , under stress of common danger , herd compulsions are very strong .
Divisive ideas may be forgotten .
If the price of survival is solidarity , the feeling for solidarity will be almost irresistible .
To begin with , therefore , the degree of peril , according to each individual 's estimate of it , must affect his decision about how to behave .
He may say , " Of what avail are my private political principles if my country falls ?
Am I justified to insist upon them or to fight for them if thereby I tend to create disunity , which could be fatal ? "
On the other hand lies the certainty that if the fight is broken off , the government , in default of opposition , will occupy new ground from which afterward perhaps it can not be dislodged .
So you have the terms of the dilemma .
An Ideological Truce
The decision would be easy to make if the government would say , " In all the fields of social controversy let there be truce for the duration of the war . "
It will not say that .
On the contrary , it is already evident that totalitarian neo-liberalism is riding the war .
Having promised that the government would practice extreme economy in nondefense spending , a staggering defense budget was brought on with , at the same time , further demands for the Welfare State ; such as , increased unemployment compensation at a time when there are more jobs than men , greater subsidies to agriculture at a time when high farm prices are immunized by law from the effects of inflation , compulsory health insurance , federal aid to education , larger grants - in - aid to the states , and the distraction of a Fair Employment Practices Commission .
A budget , said a responsible Senator , that was " the very height of fiscal irresponsibility . "
The government , you see , cannot ever have thought to ask itself the question we discuss here ; that is , whether for the duration of the war there should be a truce between , on the one hand , those who are resolved to extend much further the political regulation of our lives , and those , on the other hand , who very bitterly resist it .
The answer we seek must be found by each individual in himself alone .
That also is freedom .
A man must be free to surrender his freedom if he will , or to give it in hostage for any other value he may set above it — the survival of his country , for example .
But for any whose minds may be in suspense it would certainly seem that the government 's attitude should resolve the doubt .
Well then if you say , " Yes , the fight must go on , " there is the next question : How ?
Selective Targets
It is probably true that the fight cannot be continued in war as it was conducted in peace , if for no other reason than that the minds you want to reach are not the same .
They will be inflamed by passion and slanted by propaganda , and above all they will be greatly distracted by many new cries of " Attention , people !
Attention ! "
The mind 's capacity to give attention is very definitely limited , and as the demands upon it multiply in wartime it is bound in self - defense to become more selective and a little deaf .
In this competition the normal disadvantage of the evangel for freedom is naturally worsened , since by its very nature it requires people to think attentively .
Extremely few people like to do that .
On first reflection this seems a discouraging fact , and yet it might turn out to be a gift if only it would cure the freedom - spokesmen of their principal weakness , which we may call the shotgun method .
They sit in their towers writing many things in different ways , each on his own impulse , competing with one another for the people 's attention — and they have no line .
By contrast , look at the totalitarian neoliberals who are moving the Welfare State .
They say the same things over and over , all as with one voice , and the cumulative effect of their reiterations is tremendous .
They have a line .
They got the idea from the Communists .
Is there not a lesson there ?
To continue the fight successfully in wartime , it must be focused on relatively few points , such , for example , as to clarify the United Nations Covenant on Human Rights or the Genocide Convention , with intent to show the appalling danger of government by international treaty above the Constitution ; or the fantastic nature of the federal budget ; or the implications of any act of usurpation by the President , leading to government by executive discretion — and to do it in every case on level of ordinary understanding , in every man 's language , even as the Daily Worker would do it .
An Ominous Sound
The scattered current literature of economic education , of free enterprise , of freedom 's heritage , of Constitutional government , and so on , is in the aggregate enormous ; but it is the work of many warriors discharging buckshot at many targets .
If it could be organized and trained on a few selected targets — and targets in the news — its effect could be cannon - like .
This would require collaboration , a liaison , a clearing intelligence somewhere , a board of strategy perhaps — but what of that ?
There now is a science of propaganda .
The other side is using it .
When will the conservatives learn it ?
There will be something still for the individual to do .
He can not refuse to pay taxes , no matter how absurd the budget may be .
He cannot attack the credit of the government — not in the wartime .
He cannot conduct the war , nor can he refuse to risk his life for it if that is required of him .
And though he may take to the soap box and lift his voice in the street , that will be only worse frustration .
But there are a few great voices left , and others not so great that are still telling the truth , and these the individual may amplify prodigiously .
In his speech entitled , " Think It Over , " and again in his startling speech calling for our own defense first , Mr. Hoover got several thousand letters and telegrams .
Suppose he had got ten million , so that it had been in the news that the delivery of them blocked traffic in the neighborhood of Park Avenue and Forty - ninth Street .
After a speech on the catastrophe to which the government 's gaiety with billions is leading the country , Senator Byrd gets a few hundred letters , whereas if one - half of those who believe with him responded , the Senate Office Building would be swamped with them .
Notable speeches by Senators and Representatives fighting against socialism are ill - reported in the news — often , in fact , omitted — yet it would be little enough for one who wished to do his part to find them in the Congressional Record and react in a manner to help boost their muzzle velocity .
The running together of many voices , even yours and mine , makes a very ominous sound .

True Blood 2.2 – All Lifestyles , Sizes , Shapes , and Forms
“ If you ’ve got any silver on you , now would be the time to reveal it . ”
So sayeth Sheriff Eric to Lafayette , and given that he preceded the comment by throwing a redneck ’s severed arm in his general direction , you can imagine that it ’s a suggestion that Lafayette would ’ve been quite willing to take , if only he had any on him .
He does n’t , though , assuring Eric that , even if he did have any , he would n’t be stupid enough to try and use it .
Eric disagrees , but he hustles Lafayette off nonetheless , taking him on a trip to meet Pam .
Lovely girl , that Pam .
First , she gives Eric a serious “ tsk-tsk ” for all the blood he ’s gotten in his hair , then does the same thing to Lafayette for immediately offering to give up the names of every single one of his clients in order to save himself .
His response to her attitude results in the first glimpse of the real Lafayette that we ’ve seen this season , and it was so funny that I ’m going to quote it verbatim for your enjoyment :
“ Oh , do n’t get it twisted , honeycone : I ’m a survivor first , a capitalist second , and a whole bunch of other shit after that , but a hookerdead last .
So if I got even a Jew in an Al - Queda pep rally ’s shot of getting my black ass up out of this motherfucker , I ’m taking it .
Now , what you wanna know ? ”
Awesome .
Give Lafayette credit for being embarrassed to give up Jason Stackhouse ( though he did it , anyway , and it still did n’t do him a lick of good ) , and Eric for having the sense not to go after Jason .
Once Lafayette ’s back in the clink , though , he makes a move that ’s damned near ingenious … although , if I ’m to be honest , I first thought he was starving and resorting to cannibalism .
But , no , he used the materials available to him – ewwwwwww – and made a break for it .
And it looked like he was going to get away with it , too , until Ginger the Trigger - Happy Waitress took him down for the count with one shot .
So do you think Eric ’s going to turn Lafayette ?
Do fish swim… ?
You ’ve got to respect a show where a pair of character post - coitally discuss the merits of break - up sex versus you - thought - I - was - dead sex ( according to Sookie , they ’re both pretty good ) , then drift into a discussion about the surprising lack of differences between being a vampire and being a teenage girl .
Sookie ’s sympathetic about Jessica ’s plight as a newly - turned vamp who ’s just lost forever the chance to grow up , and when she sees the plea from her parents , it only gets worse .
The two of them bond , possibly over their mutual ability to not laugh at Jessica ’s pitch - perfect Bill impression , and the next thing you know , Sookie ’s driving Jessica over to her parents ’ house .
C’mon , is there anyone who did n’t think this was going to end badly ?
Speaking of Bill , he has a free shot at the salesgirl at the mall , who ’s apparently looking to fulfill a lifelong dream to hook up with a vamp , but he takes a pass .
But , hey , look , it ’s the new Eric…and he ’s looking a little gay .
Hey , I ’m not saying it ’s what * I * think , I ’m just saying it ’s what the saleswoman thought .
The two of them have a tense conversation about Eric ’s desire to utilize Sookie in Texas and the interest in hunting up this Godric character .
I ’m intrigued .
Well , it ’s pretty clear that they ’re not hesitating when it comes to painting the religious fanatics as slackjawed yokels .
If Jason and his bus mates had all died in a crash , we would ’ve lost maybe 200 cumulative IQ points .
Tops .
Still , when you look at all of the hot babes in the group , it ’s no wonder why most of them stick around , and now that Jason ’s a football hero , too , it ’s only going to assure him that he ’s made the right decision .
And how about that foot - stomping concert by Amanda Jane ?
“ Jesus Asked Me Out Today ” ?
NICE .
Shame about the way the play went down , but you would n’t ask a Vietnam veteran to play the part of Pyle in “ Full Metal Jacket , ” would you ?
The showdown between Jason and his new buddy , the Luke- inator , is destined for next episode , but that ’s probably good , as I ’m still laughing over Luke describing Jason ’s flag - snapping maneuver as the work of “ a Muslim Buffy with a dick , ” anyway .
Tara ’s understandably concerned about the fact that she does n’t know really anything about Eggs , and when he starts to get skittish about her questions , it only makes it worse .
Finally , he ‘ fesses up that he ’s got no job , was living under an underpass when Maryann saved him , and that he did prison time for , among other things , armed robbery and assault .
She ’s taken aback , but he rightfully shrugs and says , “ You wanted to know . ”
It ’s pretty obvious from Tara ’s discussion with Sookie , however , that Eggs ’ faults are n’t the only things that are making her uncertain about living with Maryann .
So will she take Sookie up on her offer to move in ?
I figured she would , but I knew Maryann would n’t be happy about it .
And speaking of Maryann , she pops by to taunt Sam in his own business , which is a pretty shitty thing to do by most anyone ’s standards .
Nasty work , that woman , and it only gets worse when she meets Sookie and talks a load of shit about how wonderful she is .
Cape Cod accent , my ass .
Was that Latin Sookie was hearing in her head ?
I do n’t know what the deal is with this woman , but with her ability to get the entire bar to dance their asses off and force Sam into shifting his shape , she intrigues me .
And , also , she ’s hot .
Random comments :
• Looks like my instincts about Daphne must ’ve been wrong .
VERY wrong .
• Andy ’s off - the - wagon anecdote about how he was once told that his dancing makes him look “ like an epileptic on meth ” was a highlight of the episode .
• So are we going to get some forward motion on this possible Terry and Arlene romance ?
It ’s certainly looking that way .
And , so , the episode ends with Jessica coming within an inch of killing her asshole father – something which , to be fair , I think we were all practically rooting for her to do – before Bill blows in to possibly but not definitely save the day .
I do n’t blame him for being pissed at Sookie , but I seriously doubt he ’s pissed enough to take down this whole family .
I ’m figuring there ’s gonna be a bit of glamouring going on when we return next week .
As the “ write less , do more ” library , jQuery garners lots of love for its terseness .
The terseness , combined with a rich ecosystem of plug-ins , means I can display my OdeToCode twitter feed on a web page using only 10 lines of code ( complete with animation and custom loading message ) * .
$ ( function () { $ ( " #getTweets " ) . click ( function () { $ ( " #tweets " ) .get Twitter ( { userName : $ ( " #screenname " ) .val ( ) , numTweets : 10 , loaderText : " Fetching tweets ... " , slideIn : true , showHeading : true , headingText : " Latest Tweets " , showProfileLink : true } ) ; return false ; } ) ; } ) ;
When writing with jQuery there is a tendency to use nested functions and collapse as many responsibilities as possible into a single piece of code .
For many web pages this approach is entirely suitable .
We are n’t building a space shuttle - it ’s just a web page .
The code above is responsible for locating the DOM element for events , hooking up a click event , fetching tweets , and locating the DOM element to display the tweets .
Composite UIs
In more complex pages , and particularly in composite pages that are made up from independent pieces , the above approach tends to become brittle , and encapsulation breaks down as independent pieces try to peek into each other ’s private business .
It ’s easy to fall into black hole of JavaScript code that swallows all who come near .
A step away from the black hole would be to extract some of the common , reusable functionality into different pieces .
For example , you can separate the piece that knows about DOM elements …
$ ( function () { $ ( " #getTweets " ) .click ( function ( ) { getTweets ( $ ( " #tweets " ) , $ ( " #screenname " ) .val ( ) ) ; return false ; } ) ; } ) ;
… from the piece that knows about Twitter , and include the pieces independently …
function getTweets ( element , screenname ) { $ ( element ) .get Twitter ( { userName : screenname , numTweets : 10 , loaderText : " Loading tweets ... " , slideIn : true , showHeading : true , headingText : " Latest Tweets " , showProfileLink : true } ) ; }
Now we have a bit of separation .
At this point some of us would be inclined to raise the battle cry of the object oriented programmer , and run off to a workstation to design namespaces , prototypes , constructor functions , properties – blah blah blah **.
But we would n’t be creating a greater separation between the pieces of code .
All we ’d really be doing is creating bigger abstractions that are still tied together as closely as they were when they were simple function objects .
Enter The Aggregator
One of the classes I dig in Prism is the EventAggregator .
Eventing is pretty much a required approach to managing a composite UI if you want to stay sane .
The EventAggregator makes this easy in WPF and SIlverlight , and includes some thread marshalling tricks behind the scenes as a bonus .
Fortunately , you can do something similar in most major JavaScript frameworks , including jQuery .
There are jQuery plugins dedicated to event aggregating , but a simple approach would use bind and trigger with custom events , letting the document serve as the aggregator .
Now we can achieve a greater decoupling between the “ I need tweets ” action …
$ ( function () { $ ( " #getTweets " ) . click ( function () { $ ( document ) .
trigger ( " fetchTweets " , [ $ ( " #tweets " ) , $ ( " #screenname " ) .val ( ) ] ) ; return false ; } ) ; } ) ;
… and the piece ( or pieces ) that will respond to such an action …
$ ( document ) . bind ( " fetchTweets " , function ( e , element , screenname ) { $ ( element ) .get Twitter ( { userName : screenname , numTweets : 10 , loaderText : " Loading tweets ... " , slideIn : true , showHeading : true , headingText : " Latest Tweets " , showProfileLink : true } ) ; } ) ;
It ’s easy to layer in additional behavior to the “ Get Tweets ” button click .
We could call a web service to save the user ’s preferences .
We could cache information .
We could add some debugging info …
$ ( document ) . bind ( " fetchTweets " , function ( e , element , screenname ) { console.log ( screenname ) ; } ) ;
All these things could be done by including separate scripts , and without putting any knowledge of these actions inside the click event handler where the aggregated event begins .
Of course , to complete the circle , the code should raise an event when the tweets are retrieved , and let someone else deal with the results .
* Most excellent Twitter plug - in is available from @code_za ’s blog .
** I ’m not saying that bending prototypes to act like classes is bad , it ’s just not the solution to every problem .
In early May , someone in the B.C. Liberal government ordered the destruction of backup tapes of government e-mails prior to May 2004 .
This decision , made during a provincial election campaign , prevents the disclosure of e-mails from the premier and cabinet ministers in the B.C. Rail corruption trial of former ministerial aides David Basi and Bob Virk , and former communications staffer Aneal Basi .
The information surfaced in a column by the Globe and Mail 's Gary Mason who , unfortunately , relied on unnamed sources .
The revelation prompted NDP attorney general critic Leonard Krog to ask B.C. 's assistant deputy attorney general in charge of criminal justice to appoint a special prosecutor .
“ Documents tabled in the B.C. Supreme Court this week suggest sensitive government e-mails relevant to the B.C. Rail corruption trial were destroyed during the spring election campaign , ” Krog said in a news release today ( July 16 ) .
“ If this information is true , it amounts to not only a violation of government policy , but also a serious breach of trust and potential obstruction of justice .
The premier said the rules were followed .
These reports show the premier is not telling the truth . "
Several years ago , the publisher of the Georgia Straight , Dan McLeod , wrote a front - page editorial comparing Campbell to former U.S. president Richard Nixon .
Nixon resigned in 1974 after his secretary Rosemary Woods erased 18 minutes of taped conversations .
That came after the Watergate break - in triggered a criminal case and various Congressional and Senate actions .
The sale of B.C. Rail assets to CN Rail occurred after the premier promised not to privatize the government - owned railway .
Now , the government has erased any possible e-mail trail that might account for this abrupt policy reversal .
But that might be where the similarity with Nixon ends .
In B.C. , unlike in the United States , there 's no real separation in the legislative and executive branches of government .
The premier calls the shots .
Campbell can also block probes by legislative committees , which decreases the likelihood that his government 's act of erasure will force him out of office .
Lou Dobbs continues to make a fool of himself , of CNN and of Time Warner , which owns this blog and pays my salary .
When Jim DeMint , the oh - so - conservative Senator from South Carolina , says that the Obama birth certificate is n’t an issue , and when electronic copies of the birth certificate have been produced–and certified –by the state of Hawaii , one wonders why Dobbs keeps flogging this …and why CNN allows him to do it .
Certainly , Dobbs has a right to say what he likes .
Plenty of nutballs go on television –as guests–and say all sorts of stupid , meretricious things .
( CNN has its share of odious guests , though–happily , to my eye–fewer than its competitors . )
But when you give someone the authority of an hour - long show on the cable network that stands closer to actually being fair - and - balanced than any other , you have the right to expect some journalistic integrity …or you have the responsibility to call the show what it is , The Lou Dobbs Paranoid Crazy Conspiracy Hour .
According to a translation posted on the Sherdog forums , this Croation news account has Cro Cop denying that he signed with DREAM :
ZAGREB -
The same Saturday night in which Mirko Filipović in only three minutes TKOed Britain Mostapha Al Turk , President of American Organization UFC Dana
White without any argument accused the Croatian master of the ultimat fighting for the fraud and hypocrisy .
Ten days ago Dana White and Cro Cop have a phone made arrangements for the duel on the UFC 99 tournament in Cologne Lanxess Arena , leaving open the possibility that cooperation prolongs for the two further tournaments .
However , the head of the UFC on Saturday felt fooled because he thought that the Croatian gladiator signed a new contract with the Japanese Dream .
...
Before we accuse Crocop for hypocrisy , let us see what lays below Dana White 's empty phrase of honor .
UFC leader is angry because Mirko , just as Fedor Emilianenko , the best MMA fighter in the world , did not agree to perform only twice in the next 12 months .
However , it is not true that Cro Cop signed with Dream .
We have learned that Mirko Crocop still did not sign neither with Dream nor with UFC , and that he is ready to discuss any offer .
Moreover , Mirko expected after the victory in Cologne immediate talks with Dana White about the new contract and is surprised by the accusations of UFC 's president .
" I do n’t know why White listened to the roumors instead of talking to me .
I hoped that we will talk about a continuing of our collaboration , because the only obstacle was the long period between two fights that has been offered to me .
I do n’t want to sit at home so long and waiting that someone calls me for a figh .
However , I am grateful to Dana White for an opportunity to fight in Cologne and despite his harsh words , I do n’t see the reason that we do n’t prolong the contract – explained Mirko after returning from Germany .
White gave Crocop the opportunity to fight in Cologne to use his charisma of the most popular European fighter and suggested two more bouts , under the condition that he does n’t fight for other promotions .
Because Dream offered him also three - fights contract , but in the next 6 months , why should n’t Mirko take some time to consider what is better to him ?
Hard to parse this all out .
I certainly would n't consider it out of the question for Dana White to have flown off the handle without confirming with Cro Cop first .
I certainly would n't consider it out of the question for the Japanese media to have gotten the story wrong -- or more likely for the DREAM promoters to feed them misinformation .
And I would n't put it past Cro Cop and his management to have pulled a fast one on both Dana and DREAM -- they 've got a track record of duping promoters .
No matter what the truth is , Fightlinker points out it seems like the old gang ( no pun intended , he he ) from PRIDE has Dana 's number :
A Los Angeles man who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of uploading pre-release Guns N’ Roses tracks was handed one year probation and two months ' home confinement Tuesday after agreeing to cooperate with the Recording Industry Association of America to produce an anti-piracy message .
Kevin Cogill was arrested last summer at gunpoint and charged with uploading nine tracks of the Chinese Democracy album to his music site — antiquiet.com .
The album , which cost millions and took 17 years to complete , was released in November and reached No. 3 in the charts .
Cogill faced a maximum of a year in prison .
The authorities , however , originally were demanding six months , claiming the amount of infringement equaled $ 371,000 .
The higher the number , the longer the potential prison term .
According to court documents , after Cogill agreed to help produce an anti-piracy public service address with the RIAA , the government withdrew the $ 371,000 figure and agreed not to fine him .
Los Angeles federal authorities in March said the figure was a " reasonable estimate " that gave the defendant the " benefit of the doubt . "
The calculations , the government said , were based on each downloaded Guns N' Roses track being worth 99 cents on iTunes .
As part of the 28 - year - old Cogill ’sguilty plea in December , he informed the authorities that he received the music online and unsolicited — a confession prosecutors said might pave the way for more " targets " to be prosecuted .
Cogill uploaded nine songs from the 14 - track album on June 18 , 2008 .
Court records show he confessed to the FBI .
The case was cracked by an investigator with the RIAA .
In March , the RIAA said it believed the infringement amounted to $ 2.2 million . ( . pdf )
The record labels said it would accept $ 30,000 , instead of $ 2.2 million , if Cogill " was willing to participate in a public service announcement designed to educate the public that music piracy is illegal . "
Prosecutor Kevin Missakian said in a telephone interview that the public address will either be a radio or television message of " Kevin talking about the importance of protecting copyright holders ' rights in their songs and movies . "
Missakian added that the government was " satisfied " with the sentence , but " the government had asked for some jail time in hopes of sending a stronger message . "

( CNN ) --
With their budgets teetering on bankruptcy , states are digging deep to find creative ways to ease their financial woes .
If marijuana were legalized , it could become California 's No. 1 cash crop .
Although fiscal year 2009 was grim for states , observers predict that 2010 will be even worse .
" The numbers that states are looking at in terms of their shortfalls is truly staggering .
And all of this is happening in an environment where raising taxes is still pretty toxic , and it's pretty explosive , " said Sujit CanagaRetna , a senior fiscal analyst for the Council of State Governments .
Instead of raising taxes , states are putting taxes and fees on specific items and services as they try to decrease their budget gaps .
" You see this blizzard of fees popping up all over the country and in very unusual places , " CanagaRetna said .
One of the more controversial ideas is to legalize the sale of marijuana , as proposed in a bill introduced in California 's state legislature by Democratic State Assemblyman Tom Ammiano this year .
The bill proposed taxing pot by $ 50 per ounce .
If legalized , marijuana could become California 's No. 1 cash crop , bringing in an estimated $ 1 billion a year in state taxes .
The bill was shelved this session , but a revised version will probably be reintroduced .
See budget woes , state - by - state »
Last week , Oakland became the first U.S. city to tax proceeds on medical marijuana .
Other California cities have discussed a similar tax .
This year , lawmakers in Georgia turned not to pot but to poles as a possible source of additional revenue .
Republican state Sen. Jack Murphy 's proposed " pole tax " would have charged patrons of strip clubs a $ 5 entrance fee .
The bill was not approved .
Nineteen states have explored gambling - related proposals as ways balance their 2010 budgets , according to the National Council of State Legislatures .
In Alabama , lawmakers considered bringing more bingo games to the state and legalizing slot machines , but the measure was not approved .
Delaware 's Democratic Gov. Jack Markell signed legislation creating a sports lottery that legalizes single - game betting .
Four professional sports leagues and the NCAA have filed a lawsuit over plans for the lottery , fearing that it threatens the integrity of the games .
" Basically , what we are dealing with is a larger issue here , which states have been grappling now for a few years , that is the shift in our economy away from manufacturing economy to a service - based economy , " CanagaRetna said .
He noted that when sales tax does n't apply , states are n't able to capture the economic activity .
Here are a few of the more interesting ways states are trying to conserve -- and create -- some extra funds :
In Wisconsin , Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle 's fiscal year 2010 budget triples the price of an elk hunting license , even though his state has no elk hunting season .
Doyle also proposed a fee on for each animal slaughtered , ranging from a penny per chicken to 14 cents per pig , but that provision was shot down .
In his 2009 budget , New York Gov. David Paterson proposed a " fat tax " that would have tacked an 18 - percent tax on sugary beverages .
That tax -- along with proposed taxes on manicures , health clubs and bowling -- was nixed .
Next door in New Jersey , however , residents are subject to a sales tax on health club memberships .
Some school districts in Utah have opted to shorten their school years by a few days or increase class sizes , with hopes of saving millions .
In Virginia , the state House and Senate voted to increase inmates ' daily rent by 500 percent , from $ 1 to $ 5 . Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine vetoed the bill in May , requesting that the fee be capped at $ 3 .
In Kentucky , new legislation puts a tax on cell phone ring tones .

What are these crazy , beautiful images ?
Well , they are none other than Magnus Larsson ’s Dune Project , which is “ Arenaceous Anti-Desertification Architecture . ”
What does that mean ?
Let me clarify : he ’s proposed a 6,000 km - long artificially solidified sandstone wall to line the Sahara Desert .
The structure would provide refuge housing , as well as prevent desertification ( the spreading of the desert ) .
How does he propose creating this wall ?
By using bacteria , clearly .
Larsson started with the work of the Soil Interactions Lab at UC Davis , which allowed Larsson to discover he could push the bacteria bacillus pasteurii through the sand .
This bacterium then solidifies the sand into sandstone .
Larsson even imagined the way he would do this : Essentially , his idea is to create a 3D printer to push bacteria down into the sand and create the structure for this landscape ( see photo below ) .
Then , all that needs to be done is to push out the loose sand to make the shelter - and hopefully , wind would blow out that sand naturally .
This project could definitely be praised for its lateral , creative thinking …
And the forms are gorgeous .

The Olive Oil Scandal By Raymond Francis Reprinted from Beyond Health Copyright 1998
For more than a decade I have advised people to substitute olive oil for the regular oils available in the supermarket .
Good advice .
But here 's the problem : trying to find real olive oil is like looking for a needle in a haystack .
Olive oil has been part of the human diet for more than 5000 years .
These millennia of human experience plus modem research indicate that olive oil is beneficial to health and that we can safely include it in our diet .
In fact , olive oil has been singled out as contributing to the health of Greek centenarians .
But , to get the same health effects as the Greek centenarians , the oil has to be made the way they made it .
The problem is most of the olive oil on the market does not duplicate what our ancestors were eating , and people are not getting what they think they are buying .
Almost all olive oil is processed in ways that result in the loss of nutrients which are essential to health .
Olive oil is almost unique among oils in that it can be consumed in the crude form without refining .
This has the effect of conserving all its vitamins , essential fatty acids , and other nutrients .
Because it contains all these nutrients , including powerful antioxidants , real extra virgin olive oil is beneficial to health and protects us from damage by free radical oxidation .
Cell membranes contain fatty acids that are highly susceptible to free radical damage .
This damage produces lipid peroxides that can kill the cell .
Real olive oil contains polyphenols , vitamin E , and other natural antioxidants that prevent this damage .
Numerous studies show that olive oil reduces cholesterol , lowers blood pressure , inhibits platelet aggregation , and lowers the incidence of breast cancer .
Because it is so rich in antioxidants , olive oil appears to dramatically reduce the oxidation of LDL cholesterol , thereby preventing heart disease .
These same antioxidants also add to the stability , shelf life , and flavor of the oil .
Historically , high quality olive oil , rich in antioxidants , was easy to obtain , but not any more .
Today , high quality oil is available only in relatively small quantities , usually from family owned farms , where the oils are produced in ways similar to how the Greeks and Romans made theirs .
On these farms , olives are picked by hand so as not to damage the skin or pulp .
They are transported in well aerated containers and milled within 48 hours of harvesting .
Before milling , leaves and twigs are removed , the olives washed and dried , and then stone pressed the same way as it was done in antiquity .
The resulting olive paste was then pressed in a hydraulic press without the use of heat , hot water , or solvents .
The oil is left unfiltered as filtering removes many nutrients .
The first pressing produces the best " extra virgin " oil .
The problem with most of today 's olive oil is that it is rarely produced in the old way , which is more time consuming and expensive .
Due to the increasing demand for olive oil , the trend has been to reduce production costs by moving toward more automation and concentration of production in ever larger installations .
These modem factories extract more oil more cheaply , but their processing methods substantially reduce the nutritional quality of the oil .
To reduce costs , olives are machine harvested along with leaves and twigs .
Olives that have dropped on the ground , which can be said to contain bad oil , are often mixed with the good ones .
They are shipped in all kinds of containers , many of which are poorly ventilated , and heaped in large piles where the olives are stored for too long and often become moldy .
The oil is then extracted in a continuous centrifuge where hot water is used to help separate out the oil .
Antioxidant polyphenols are soluble in water and are washed away in this process , thereby lowering the shelf life and the nutritional quality of the oil .
Italy alone produces 800,000 cubic meters of waste water per year from this process .
Because substantial amounts of antioxidants are washed away , factory produced olive oils have a short shelf life of only months , whereas real olive oil lasts for two to three years .
Factory produced olive oil is filtered and looks clear .
Real olive oil is not filtered and looks cloudy .
Most people think that by purchasing " extra virgin " olive oil they are getting a high quality oil .
Unfortunately , in most cases , this is not true .
It 's more complex than that .
A label reading extra virgin is no guarantee of quality .
For one thing , nowhere does it say that extra virgin olive oil has to be made 100 % from olives .
An major criterion for grading olive oil is its level of acidity .
Extra virgin oil should have a free oleic acid acidity of no more than one percent , whereas ordinary virgin olive oil can have an acidity of up to 3.3 percent .
Lower quality oils can be refined to bring the acidity down so they can be labeled as extra virgin .
But now the oil has been refined , and that 's not what you want .
That 's why being labeled extra virgin is no guarantee of getting high quality oil , which has not been processed in ways that reduce its nutritional value .
To complicate matters even more , the term " extra virgin " has no official meaning in the United States .
The U.S. is not a member of the International Olive Oil Council .
So , olive oil sold here can be labeled extra virgin without meeting the accepted international standards .
Another reason why you can't trust extra virgin olive oil is exemplified by a problem that manifested last year , and may turn out to be the biggest food fraud of the 20th Century .
Despite the fact that details of this scandal have been published in Merum , a Swiss - German magazine , and in Italian journals such as Agra Trade , and the newspaper Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno , this information has been successfully suppressed and is known to only a handful .
Investigators are gathering evidence indicating that the biggest olive oil brands in Italy have for years been systematically diluting their extra virgin olive oil with cheap , highly - refined hazelnut oil imported from Turkey .
International arrest warrants have been issued and so far documents indicate that at least ten thousand tons of hazelnut oil are involved .
As much as 20 % hazelnut oil can be added to olive oil and still be undetectable to the consumer .
In fact olive oil labeled " Italian " often comes from Turkey , Tunisia , Morocco , Spain , and Greece .
Considering what has happened in Europe , where there are strict regulations , imagine what can happen in California where there are no regulations .
Apparently , more oil is " produced " in California than there are olives available .
The truth is , most of the extra virgin olive oil on the market does not supply all the nutritional value and health giving properties that we have a right to expect from olive oil .
This is scary stuff when you consider how extremely important oil is to human health .
Our modem chronic disease problems are the result of radically changing , in a short period of time , the fundamental parameters of human existence , namely : diet , environment , and behavior .
One of the most fundamental changes in our diet has been the kind and the amount of fats and oils that we consume .
For example , the consumption of hydrogenated oils has proved to be a disaster for human health .
Hydrogenated oils have been implicated in both our cancer and heart disease epidemics .
In fact , all modem processed oils are injurious to human health .
To reverse our pandemic of chronic disease , we have to return to eating a more traditional diet , and high quality olive oil can safely be included in that diet .
It 's not so much that olive oil should be added to the diet as much as healthy , real olive oil should be used to replace the unhealthy , processed oils now being consumed .
How does one ensure that they are eating the most healthful oil ?
Find an extra virgin olive oil that is cold pressed , unfiltered , and looks cloudy .
The oil should be packaged in dark glass bottles to protect it from the damaging effects of light .
Real olive oil is still made in small estate bottled settings .
The challenge is to find one that does it !
all right .
After selecting the oil , it has to be stored properly .
When properly stored , real extra virgin olive oil can last two to three years .
Because of processing , most of the extra virgin oil on the market has a shelf life of only a few months .
A good rule of thumb is to purchase oil in small bottles and consume it within a year of purchase ; this will also ensure getting the best flavor .
Store the oil away from both heat and light .
Storing in a dark place is important because exposure to light will start a chain reaction that will destroy the oil a thousand times faster than oxygen .
During storage , olive oil oxidizes and undergoes a slow , continuous , and irreversible deterioration until it becomes inedible .
The bottom line is that modem , factory - produced olive oil has been stripped of its health enhancing nutrients , and the task of selecting a high quality oil has been made very difficult .
That 's why Beyond Health has made the selection process easier for you .
We have searched for a high quality , estate bottled oil that meets our standards and we have found one .
The brand name is Bariani .
It 's produced by the Bariani family on a small farm in the central valley of California .
Their olives are grown without pesticides .
They are hand picked from the trees , carefully washed and dried , and milled with a stone wheel within 48 hours of harvesting .
It is pressed in a hydraulic press , collected in stainless steel vats , decanted , and bottled .
This first cold pressed oil is the real stuff and retains all the natural flavor and goodness .
Bariani is used by chefs in a number of fine restaurants .
It is available at selected specialty food stores in California , and from Beyond Health .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney is getting a " bum rap " over reports that he ordered the CIA to withhold information about a secret counterterrorism program from Congress , two former U.S. intelligence officials told CNN Monday .
Former Vice President Cheney reportedly told the CIA to withhold information about a counterterrorism program .
According to both officials , any intelligence program of " great sensitivity " is first approved by the White House after a series of meetings .
In any such situation , once the administration decides to pursue a covert program , there is discussion on whether Congress needs to be briefed , the officials said .
President George W. Bush " delegated " then - Vice President Cheney to chair many of the meetings that followed the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , the officials said .
At issue is CIA Director Leon Panetta 's testimony last month to a congressional committee that he was told Cheney ordered the intelligence agency to withhold information about a secret counterterrorism program from Congress .
Sen . Dianne Feinstein , D - California and chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee , told " Fox News Sunday " that Panetta testified " he was told that the vice president had ordered that the program not be briefed to the Congress . "
" I think this is a problem , obviously , " Feinstein said , adding that the law requires full disclosure of such operations to Congress .
The disclosure by Panetta to both the Senate and House intelligence committees about Cheney 's involvement was first reported in The New York Times .
Efforts to contact Cheney for reaction were unsuccessful .
Neither of the former officials who spoke to CNN would discuss the details of the program in question , but both said the CIA was developing a certain post - 9/11 counterterrorism capacity .
As one official put it , " It should come as no surprise that we would go after the bad guys , the terrorists . "
Both sources said the program that Panetta discussed fell under a presidential finding that broadly authorized covert counterterrorism activities .
They said Congress had been briefed on that finding in the fall of 2001 , and there was no requirement to brief lawmakers on a program that had not been implemented .
" When it goes operational , then you brief them , " one of the former officials said .
The sources said the program was canceled several years ago -- but for reasons unknown to them , it was put back on the table though still not implemented .
Panetta terminated the program when he found out about it last month .
Panetta briefed lawmakers on June 24 on an unspecified counterterrorism program , according to a letter from seven House Democrats to Panetta made public last Wednesday .
The June 26 letter characterized Panetta as testifying that the CIA " concealed significant actions from all members of Congress , and misled members for a number of years from 2001 to this week . "
The letter contained no details about what information the CIA officials allegedly concealed or how they purportedly misled members of Congress .

The loving family of Janet Moses killed one of their own when belief in a curse sprang from a drunken prank to steal a garden ornament from a pub , a jury has been told .
The family of Ms Moses did not mean to kill her but eight of her uncles and aunts did just that , Crown prosecutor Grant Burston told the High Court at Wellington yesterday .
They misinterpreted signs of emerging mental illness as demonic possession resulting from a curse , and made up their own exorcism ceremony as they went along , he said .
PHIL REID / The Dominion Post ONE WALKS FREE : Georgina Aroha Rawiri left behind her husband , his sisters and brothers - in - law in the dock at the High Court when she was discharged of manslaughter due to a lack of evidence .
As the trial entered its final stages , Justice Simon France discharged a ninth accused , Georgina Aroha Rawiri , 50 , because of a lack of evidence to support the manslaughter charge against her .
But the manslaughter trial , now in its sixth week , continues for Rawiri 's husband John , five of his sisters and two brothers - in - law .
The Crown says their niece , Wainuiomata mother - of - two Ms Moses , 22 , drowned on October 12 , 2007 , during " treatment " to cleanse her of a demon .
Mr Burston said people held Ms Moses down and stood on her legs as she thrashed around fighting for her life , as water was poured into her mouth and nose .
He accepted that the eight accused genuinely believed demons had possessed her but group hysteria took over and their actions grew more extreme .
A critical issue for the jury to decide is whether Ms Moses consented to what her family was doing or whether they believed she was consenting .
Mr Burston said the family was making Ms Moses ' decisions for her without reference to her .
" In fact she was actually resisting until she was unable to resist any more . "
But Paul Paino , lawyer for John Rawiri , the senior man in the group , said their belief that she was consenting need not be reasonable , rational or sensible .
Rawiri believed members of his family were being taken by demons and he had to protect them .
He did what he honestly believed Ms Moses wanted him to do .
Mike Antunovic , lawyer for the senior woman of the group , Glenys Wright , said she believed at the time that any resistance from Ms Moses was the action of the demons inside her and not a sign that she was not consenting .
Speaking for two people charged with allowing a 14 - year - old in their care to be ill - treated , he said they did , or allowed to be done , what they thought necessary to save her life .
The girl was also believed to be possessed by demons .
Water was forced into her and her eyes were scratched to remove the demons from them .
She spent five days in hospital recovering from her injuries .
The defence lawyers ' final addresses continue today .
BEFORE THE COURT
Eight members of Janet Moses ' extended family are charged with her manslaughter , which the Crown claims was the result of an attempt to remove a curse a makutu or evil spirit .
The accused are :
John Tahana Rawiri , 49 , Aroha Gwendoline Wharepapa , 48 , Hall Jones Wharepapa , 46 , Tanginoa Apanui , 42 , Angela Rangiaroha Orupe , 46 , Gaylene Tangiohorere Kepa , 44 , Alfred Hughes Kepa , 48 , and Glenys Lynette Wright , 52 .
All are siblings of Ms Moses ' mother , or their partners .
Two people , whose names are suppressed , are charged with cruelty to a 14 - year - old girl in their care .
The charges date from October 12 , 2007 , at Wainuiomata , when Ms Moses and others were subjected to a water - based ceremony resulting in Ms Moses drowning , the Crown claims .
( CNN ) -- Author Frank McCourt , whose tragic childhood became creative grist for his first book , the Pulitzer Prize - winning " Angela 's Ashes , " died Sunday , according to the Web site of his publisher , Simon & Shuster .
He was 78 .
Frank McCourt won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award for " Angela 's Ashes . "
McCourt taught creative writing to high school students in New York City for 30 years before achieving literary acclaim with the 1996 biography .
" Angela 's Ashes , " named after his mother , also won the National Book Critics Circle Award .
It was translated and sold throughout the world .
In the book , McCourt described a desperate childhood marked by severe poverty , malnutrition , neglect , infectious disease and loss .
" When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all .
It was , of course , a miserable childhood : the happy childhood is hardly worth your while .
Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood , and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood , " he wrote .
EW : A tribute to Frank McCourt
McCourt wrote the two other memoirs , " Tis " and " Teacher Man , " as sequels to " Angela 's Ashes , " and penned the children 's book " Angela and the Baby Jesus . "
The author was born to Angela and Malachy McCourt on August 19 , 1930 , in Brooklyn , New York , to Irish immigrants .
The family fled to Limerick , Ireland , four years later , during the Great Depression era , only to become mired in even more gut - wrenching poverty .
Three of the couple 's seven children died .
Malachy McCourt , an alcoholic who managed to keep jobs only a few weeks at a time , left the family scrounging to survive .
Yet , he also brought joy to his children , as the younger McCourt wrote in " Angela 's Ashes " :
" Before bed we sit around the fire and if we say , ' Dad , tell us a story , ' he makes up one about someone in the lane and the story will take us all over the world , up in the air , under the sea and back to the lane .
Everyone in the story is a different colour and everything is upside down and backward .

I count myself lucky that I can earn a living programming with Ruby and in particular with the Ruby on Rails framework .
But every tool , even the best , has a few surprises up its sleeve .
Sometimes you get hung up on something quirky , but more often you ’re having a problem with a feature — something that ’s there by design .
This is my story about one such problem I had with a Rails feature , how I diagnosed it , and what it means : metaprogramming is awesome , but it comes at a price , and in imperative languages , the price is side effects .
The Phenomenology of Nonsense
Debugging code is a singular experience .
If you ’re like me , you have to take a breath and remind yourself that the solution to your problem is going to be logical .
Once you find it , it will make sense .
It will almost certainly fit into your understanding of the framework , library , or language you ’re using .
It might expand your understanding a bit , but it wo n’t be alien .
You have to trust that , because when a bug is obscure , and you ca n’t figure out where to look for it , it ’s all to easy to become convinced that someone out there has it in for you .
Possibly the computer .
All too often the symptoms of the bug and the information you can obtain about it are just nonsense .
Something that just ca n’t be happening is absolutely happening .
Here ’s my specific case .
I ’m programming a web app in which online customers can register credit card information for later use in making purchases .
The app ’s data store does n’t keep any sensitive information ; instead , it sends it on to a payment gateway that exposes an API for storing and retrieving these credit cards ’ information .
Our data store just keeps a bare minimum of app - specific information about the cards , e.g. whether the card is the customer ’s primary card or not .
Communication with the gateway is implemented in callbacks on the credit card model ’s lifecycle .
These two methods , save_profile and remove_profile , perform storage and removal operations on the gateway ’s APIs :
before_destroy :remove_profile
before_save :save_profile
Great .
Except as I tried out actual integration tests , I kept getting the most bizarre errors when deleting a credit card .
They were telling me I was n’t passing enough information to the gateway to save the card information .
Save ?
I was trying to delete !
Does Rails fire a before_save callback before a before_destroy callback ?
Nope .
And yet that seemed to be what was happening .
As a way to blow off steam , I fired off a Tweet about my frustrations : why was before_save happening before before_destroy ?
Paul ’s comment shows the value of a consistent view of the world when debugging .
In an imperative programming language , side effects , or changes in the state of data or objects , are lurking behind every line of code .
If you remember this , you can tackle a bug by trying to find a side effect that is causing the nonsense .
And Paul was 100 % right in my case .
I got a handle on what was happening by including this code in my model , inside a rescue clause in the save_profile method I registered as a before_save callback :
rescue Exception => ex
...
logger.error ( " trace : #{ex.backtrace ( ) .join ( "
" ) } " )
end
When you insist that you can handle the truth , backtrace shows you every method that your code has passed through .
It ’s a lot of data to take in , but it ’s a good way to find out what ’s going on out of your sight .
In my case , I found a mention of something called remove_from_list firing just after the code requesting a credit card record be destroyed .
remove_from_list is part of the acts_as_list plugin , and it updates a record to set its position attribute to nil .
Remember I mentioned in passing that I was tracking whether a card was primary or not ?
I was using acts_as_list to do this .
The first card in the list was the primary one .
And all I had to do to get the ordering was to have this line in my credit card model file :
acts_as_list : scope => : customer
So powerful .
In fact , a little too powerful for me , since this one line registers remove_from_list as a before_destroy callback .
It does it magically , through meta-programming .
That callback assignment does n’t appear in your code , although you can imagine it “ happens ” right on the line with the acts_as_list declaration .
So that was my problem .
I had code attempting to update the record before it was destroyed , and thus my before_save callbacks were firing .
The solution was twofold .
First , I moved the line
before_destroy :remove_profile
above
acts_as_list : scope => : patient
in my code , to make sure remove_profile would be called before remove_from_list .
In Ruby , the order of declarations often determines the precedence of similar operations .
In Rails , callbacks occur in the order in which they ’re registered , which in this case is the order of the lines of code in my model file .
Second , I made a little attribute called mode for my credit card class and had remove_profile set the mode to : destroy .
Since remove_profile is the first callback that is called on destroy , the setting of mode happens before any other callbacks fire .
Then I added a check in save_profile to just return true if mode were set to : destroy .
So when remove_from_list triggers save_profile , save_profile does n’t try to communicate with the gateway .
And that solved the problem .
I wanted to post this for two reasons .
First , when I was debugging , I did a bit of googling to see whether anyone had encountered a problem with callbacks happening out of order .
I did n’t find anything .
So a post with specifics might be useful to someone suffering the same affliction .
Second , I thought this was a great exercise in debugging a Ruby on Rails app .
The Exception class ’s backtrace method is a great tool , especially when combined with the built - in logger object .
Also , I was helped out by keeping a development journal , just a text file that I type and copy interesting things into .
When I ’m debugging , trying to give shape in words to the problem I ’m having often helps me find details and patterns that lead to a solution .
I hope my experience might help you out of a similar jam .
Happy debugging .

The laboratory investigations performed prior to treatment did not uncover any concomitant disease .
All laboratory tests for serum autoantibodies were negative , except for elevated titres of thyroid anti-microsomal antibodies in patient 1 .
All three patients had positive IgG , but negative IgM , to Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) and cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) .
Serologic tests for EBV and CMV , and in addition PCR analyses , were repeated during follow - up , without any evidence of active infection .
The serum levels of IgG were slightly reduced from inclusion to the end of follow - up ( 12.1 - 5.8 , 9.5 - 8.5 , 12.5 - 11.6 g/L for patients 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively , normal range 6.0 – 15.3 g/L ) .
Patient 1
The patient with a transient improvement of symptoms during MIME chemotherapy for Hodgkin 's disease had profound fatigue with little rest relief before rituximab infusion .
She was mostly indoors and could only take walks for a few minutes , and had marked , diffuse muscle and skin pain .
Sleep disturbances and cognitive dysfunction were profound .
The first five weeks after rituximab she noted absolutely no change .
From six weeks after treatment she started to experience increasing energy .
The following weeks her condition improved substantially , she was able to take walks for up to two hours duration , and needed shorter periods of rest .
Muscle and skin pain decreased markedly .
Cognitive function improved substantially , and the sleep quality turned normal .
However , from 14 weeks after the single rituximab infusion , her condition started to deteriorate , with gradually increasing fatigue , muscle and skin pain , cognitive dysfunction , and the sleep disturbances reappeared ( Figure 1 ) .
Five months after the first rituximab infusion , she again had stable and disabling CFS symptoms , although she was still better than before the intervention .
She insisted on retreatment and 20 weeks after her first treatment , she was given a new single infusion of rituximab at the same dosage .
After six weeks , she again experienced a gradual recovery from all CFS symptoms ( fatigue , pain , cognitive symptoms , sleep ) with a major effect on quality of life .
After the second infusion , the therapeutic effect was maximal at 12 – 16 weeks ( 32–36 weeks from the first infusion ) , with slow symptom worsening thereafter ( Figure 1 ) .
We then decided to start weekly oral methotrexate ( Mtx ) from 19 weeks after the second rituximab - infusion , at a time point when she did not have detectable CD19 +
B - cells in peripheral blood .
Mtx was started at one dose of 7,5 mg per week , and increasing to 12,5 mg per week during the next two months .
From 10 weeks after onset of weekly Mtx , she has again experienced gradual recovery from CFS symptoms .
She used Mtx for 25 weeks and reported significant improvement .
Symptom recovery was slower with Mtx than rituximab .
However , slow worsening resumed from 26 weeks after start of Mtx ( Figure 1 ) .
She was again treated with a new ( third ) rituximab infusion at the same dosage , with ongoing weekly Mtx ( 35 weeks after start of Mtx treatment ) .
At this time point B - cells in peripheral blood were increasing ( Figure 1 ) .
In line with her experiences from the previous interventions , she had a major improvement of all CFS related symptoms , again starting from 6 weeks after the rituximab treatment ( Figure 1 ) .
Patient 2
A 34 - year - old male encountered CFS in 2000 after infectious mononucleosis .
At the same time , diabetes type I was diagnosed .
In 2005 he was treated for a testicular seminoma Stage IIA with orchidectomy and postoperative radiation therapy and has since been recurrence free .
Since 2000 he was completely unable to work .
Most days he was only able to perform minor in - house tasks .
He had severe general myalgic pain , headaches , chronic diarrhoea , increased sweating and dizziness .
Cognitive function was markedly reduced and worsening over the years .
He was unable to read more than a page or two of writing and suffered from hypersensitivity to noise .
Two weeks after single rituximab infusion ( 500 mg / m2 ) the diarrhoea vanished , while all the other symptoms remained unchanged .
Before treatment he was mostly confined to rest indoors , with very brief walks , usually to and from the garden mailbox once daily .
However , approaching six weeks after treatment he started to feel energy .
During the next two weeks his activity level and muscle usage increased to the greatest level since the CFS debut .
He could take one - hour walks and started to do carpentry on his house .
Myalgic pain was markedly reduced .
Cognitive functions improved remarkably , and he could now read a whole book without interruption .
The hypersensitivity to noise decreased .
He and his wife confirmed that family life had improved considerably .
The clinical benefit was most pronounced until 12 weeks after the rituximab infusion , thereafter all CFS symptoms started to gradually incline .
At 18 weeks after the intervention , he described symptoms as almost equal to baseline ( Figure 1 ) .
He was then retreated with two infusions of rituximab 1000 mg , given two weeks apart .
As following the first treatment , he started to recover first from diarrhoea ( after 3 weeks ) .
Then , after six weeks , he reported less cognitive symptoms and days later the fatigue started to improve .
The double rituximab infusion gave a clear CFS symptom improvement most prominent 16 weeks after the infusion .
Thereafter , he has experienced a very slow increase in symptoms .
However , six months after the infusion , he still had some clinical response .
Fifty weeks after the first rituximab infusion ( 30 weeks after the second ) he started treatment with weekly oral Mtx .
At the time points of the second rituximab treatment ( week 19 ) and of Mtx initiation ( week 50 ) he did not have detectable CD19 +
B - lymphocytes in peripheral blood .
After 12 weeks on weekly oral Mtx ( 62 weeks after first intervention ) he still did not experience symptom amelioration , and was then given a new double rituximab infusion ( each of 1000 mg ) two weeks apart , with ongoing Mtx treatment .
At this time the B - cell number increased ( Figure 1 ) .
In accordance with the previous courses , he after eight weeks ( week 70 ) again had a marked improvement of fatigue , cognitive function , muscle pain , dizziness , noise intolerance , sweating and diarrhoea ( Figure 1 ) .
Patient 3
The 23 - year - old school pupil attained CFS following infectious mononucleosis in 2001 .
School activities had slowed to the extent that she was in her sixth year of a three - year program .
Marked reduction in physical activity and only moderate relief from rest , diffuse muscle pain and diarrhoea were present .
Cognitive dysfunction was moderate .
She felt frustrated as a consequence of the disease and its negative impact on her studies and social life .
Between five and six weeks after treatment she felt more energized , especially in short - lasting bursts .
Myalgic pain was slightly improved , resulting in reduction in paracetamol usage .
The diarrhoea terminated .
She had less fatigue after special occasions with exertion , but did not experience significantly increased energy in daily life and did not manage to increase efforts at school .
From 13 weeks after infusion she had stable CFS symptoms , only slightly better than at baseline ( Figure 1 ) .
Then , from 26 weeks after the infusion , she experienced a dramatic recovery of all CFS symptoms over the next few weeks .
Fatigue improved to the extent that she could participate fully in school education , she resumed social life , started more extensive physical exertion including jogging and needed no rest during daytime .
All muscle pain vanished , she had better appetite , stools normalized , and she also had regular menstrual cycles for the first time in 7 years .
Concentration ability and memory improved substantially .
There were no other interventions that could explain her symptom recovery .
This major CFS improvement lasted from 6 months until 10 1/2 months after rituximab infusion .
She then experienced gradual symptom worsening over the next 4 weeks , with increasing muscle pain , relapse of fatigue , cognitive dysfunction and loose stools .
She was then ( 48 weeks after the first rituximab ) treated with two infusions of rituximab ( 500 mg / m2 ) given two weeks apart ( Figure 1 ) .
At this time point B - lymphocytes in peripheral blood had recovered .
From 5 weeks after the second rituximab treatment , she again experienced short bursts of being energized , and from 10 weeks she had slight improvement of muscle pain and cognitive function .
Almost identical to the symptom course after her first intervention , from approximately 5 months after the second ( double ) rituximab treatment she experienced a dramatic response on all CFS symptoms , to the same extent as described above ( Figure 1 ) .
Toxicity
No acute toxicity was seen .
Patients 1 had two , and patient 2 one uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection , all appearing approximately two months after one of the rituximab treatments .
Patient 1 had an episode of localized herpes zoster 21 weeks after the first rituximab infusion .
No other toxicity was noticed during follow - up .

PJ saidWhat I see from these exhibits is that SCO 's business slowed noticeably after 1994 .
At that time , I worked for Multi Billion Computer Manufacturer and we had a lot of SCO stuff in the pricebook .
What stopped us from actually selling any was trying to understand the mess of bits ( sorry vital parts ) we had to put on the order only for SCO to throw it back at us saying it was incomplete AND not help us sort out the missing bits .
It was a real sales nightmare and we soon gave up trying to sell this thing called Unix on X86 computers .
We started giving customers this little upstart system called Linux which I personally been using since Slackware 1.1 was released on Floppy .

The list that is in the article mentions ONLY those who licensed SVR5 .
There were other ways to get UNIX .
For example DEC sold a BSD based version of Unix called Ultrix .
Other Companies did the same .
Did Darl get challenged about his factually
incorrect statement ?
I guess not .
IMHO , the same applied to a lot of things that
SCO have siad over the years .

Employees identified on Exhibit G hereto effective immediately prior to the
Closing .
Effective as of the Closing , Purchaser shall offer employment to each
of the Employees identified on Exhibit G. Employees who accept Purchasers
offer
of employment and become employees of Purchaser as of the Closing shall be
referred to as the  Transferred Employees  effective on their initial dates of

All Transferred Employees shall be subject to all
applicable policies and practices of Purchaser .
Sellers shall remain liable for
all employee wages , salaries and benefits respecting each Employee arising out
of periods prior to the closing date , including , without limitation , all

So , does this mean large redundancy / termination payments to all staff ,
effectively using up what little funds are still held ?

If you look at these licenses they are all for reference source code , not
runnable binary code .
If you look at the APA as amended you will see that SCO
was allowed to supply source code this way without reference or payment to
Novell .
I do n't see anything odd here .

Of course 1995 was the year that Windows took off .
I would have reserved most of
my budget for Win95 too .
And it worked pretty well with Novell networks .
The
computing landscape was changing then , and once you had lots of graphical
desktop applications , there was n't so much need to write software for Unix .
And
in any case the Unix companies could n't decide on a single consistent platform
either in terms of an API or a user interface .
It 's no wonder that SCO's
business nosedived too .

What I see from these exhibits is that SCO 's business slowed noticeably after 1994 .
Trying to remember what was happening back then , I think there were several trends , not just one , that were impacting SCO 's business .
Windows NT had been launched : the first version of Windows that could plausibly compete with Unix .
People who wanted to migrate from Windows 3.11 to a full 32 - bit OS could stay with Microsoft .
Sun Microsystems was doing very well , and people who wanted Unix were buying Suns .
They were still a lot more expensive than PC boxes , but the price differential was dropping .
Competitors in the Unix - on - a- PC market had appeared , for example Microport , that licensed AT&T System V , built it for Intel 80286 and 80386 , and resold it .
What they were selling was unquestionably System V Unix , and it was cheaper than SCO Unix .
SCO was losing momentum - SCO Unix was seen as innovative in the 1980s when it was launched , and it had a clear marketing message , but it did n't come up with anything really new in the early 1990s and no longer had an " innovative " image .
So I do n't think it was any one factor - and it certainly had nothing to do with IBM .
Doing business in a competitive free market is tough for a small / medium company : if you do n't keep innovating technically and marketing aggressively , somebody will eat your lunch .
I think that 's what happened to SCO .

" There are some new customers after that , but it 's nothing like the 80s and
90s up until 1995 . "
That would be around the time that OS / 2 and NT were available and Netware was
going strong .
I suspect this simply reflects that there were alternatives to
Unix for many applications .

Why would that go to unXis ?
Three reasons : Unixware is a derivative work of UNIX SysV under copyright law .
UniXis needs the implied copyright license from the APA in order to sell Unixware .
The intent is that in 10 years time , if this saga is still going , all SCO 's rights get given to UniXis .
I.e. UniXis are buying the right to the continuing tax on Linux users that SCO is trying to impose .
See the proposed Unixis APA .
It 's an asset and SCO are trying to give all their assets away so IBM / Novell / Red Hat can't get them .

FWIW , that Tandem Computers license was a follow - on to several prior source
licenses , rather than something new .
It was acquired for the purpose of
providing an MP ( multi - processor ) version of the OS for Tandem 's Integrity

If any technology related to UNIX is transferred does n't Novell have to approve
of it ?
The way I see it , the APA only gave SCOg the right to collect licensing
fees for Novell , and even selling their own technology that contains the UNIX
source code would be illegal if not for Novell permitting it under the
pre-conditions spelled out in the APA .
How can SCOg even think to transfer any
technology / source code for which they do not even hold the copyrights for ?
Having the right to modify and sell their own version of UNIX does not give them
the right to sell it lock stock and barrel to a third party .
By the APA , SCOg is
not even allowed to enter into new licensing agreements much less sell
everything .

SCO 's business slowed noticeably after 1994
I joined a company in 1994 that sold a product that ran on various versions of
Unix , HP , General Dynamics , IBM , Data General , Dec and SCO Unix .
The general opinion at the time was that the SCO Unix was a problem to work
with .
A few years later when NT became a viable alternative , a number of customers
switched from SCO Unix to Windows NT .
( Please do n't ask me to justify , I am
just relating the experience . )
In this case , it was n't Linux that was stealing SCO 's customers , but Microsoft
Windows . [ Reply to This | # ]

From a certain science - fiction writer who was working there at the time :
http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2009/06/how_i_got_h ere_in_the_end_part_3.html
Some key bits there are the fact that in 1995 the CEO retired and was replaced by the CFO -- and , as Charlie says , " Do I need to explain why putting an accountant in charge of a technology - driven company is not necessarily a wise , visionary , and forward - looking move ? "

I was working in the system sales industry at that time .
It was hard to get
updated software for SCO unix at that time .
Even if you could get a vendor
commitment , it was impossible to get a timeframe for it .
System support was eclectic , it was hard to find admins for SCO boxes .
Other
unix variants paid better to support staff .
It was difficult to sell SCO unix .
There were odd approval mechanics within
SCO , that were , at best , inconsistent .
Windows NT was finally stable about that time .
Micro$oft was commanding all the
ISV attention , and dollars , for development .
Adding it all up , there were too many minuses , and no real pluses , to buying
SCO .
The only compelling factor would be if you already had an existing
application running on SCO .
There were some sweet languages on the SCO boxes ,
that had proprietary extensions or implementations .
Transferring an application
OFF of a SCO box to another platform was a painful experience .
( We did it .
We
had little choice , there were no forthcoming updates , and we needed some
updates . )

That makes sense .
It was around the time Microsoft started pushing Windows NT
strongly on workstations as an alternative to Unix - based ones .
So much that the product name was " Windows NT Workstation " .
Windows NT would run on 32 - bits Intel ( IA - 32 ) , MIPS R3000 / R4000 and Alpha , with
PowerPC , Itanium and AMD64 supported in later releases .
Silicon Graphics was forced to start selling Windows too .
The file sharing capabilities that came built - in in Windows NT were
revolutionary in that you could only get similar ease of use , power and
flexibility from competing products that charged a premium for it , like Novell .
With Windows NT , it came right out of the box .
IBM was perceived as the big blue evil at the time , and Microsoft was the lean ,
mean and younger contender .
Microsoft closed the deal when they added the innovative and slicker Windows 95
user interface , in the resulting product that became known as Windows NT 4.0
( immediate predecessor of Windows 2000 ( 5.0 ) and Windows XP ( 5.1 ) .
X - Window workstations from Sun and others costed dearly , Windows NT worked okay
on cheap PCs .
Windows NT originally bundled a POSIX compatibility layer , mandated by US
Government to be considered for any software contracts , and there used to be
products from Microsoft and third parties to build bridges between the Unix and
Windows world .
( most notably X - window , Httpd , NFS server software ) .
At that point it 's interesting to note that Novell would charge as much as $ 1000
for an FTP client .
It 's almost a greek tragedy tale that the mature Microsoft have aged to become
the monster they defied to death .

May be I have my tin foil too tight .
But I have a question to ask .
We know that according to the sales agreement SCOG keeps the litigations and the
assets go to unXis .
But how about future litigation ?
If all the contracts go to unXis , they can be used to sue .
The litigation may
still be used for FUD and harassment .
What stops unXis from interpreting any
ruling and settlement imposed on SCOG narrowly so new litigation on
" different " issues is still allowed ?
It is not like they are building
a viable business with a sound product line .
If no sanctions fall on SCOG and
their executives , a path to riches for more shady characters is open .
What if
someone decides it does not matter if unXis goes bankrupt if its CEO keeps his
bonuses ?
As long as the PIPE ( as in fairy ) does n't dry out litigation may
continue .
Remember when Goldfarb wanted SCOG to sell its UNIX business and focus all the
cash on the litigation ?
Had this advice been heeded none of the bankruptcy dance
we have seen would have been possible .
But Darl decided to keep the Unix
business and here we are .
Is this coincidence ?
Or is it foresight ?
Considering
how baseless this whole litigation has been , one may think that an exit strategy
may have been planned as soon as it was clear that IBM would n't buy SCOG to make
them go away .
I think these possibilities may explain why IBM decided to issue a subpoena .
They want to know what kind of hydra they are dealing with .
The problem with
hydras is there is no use to chop only one head off .
You need to cut all of
them .

SCO 's business slowed noticeably after 1994 .
I do n't know why , but for sure it was n't Linux So you say .
I was in that business back then .
We were one of the important SCO resellers , and I had the ( oldSCO ) ``ACE '' certification .
I did a fair amount of software development at the time .
Linux was admittedly not so far along as it is now ; the SMP support was speculative , and device support was limited .
On the other hand , software development worked better under Linux even then .
Linux was faster for the same hardware , and it provided a more standards - compliant API for network stuff .
I had a lot of #ifdefs for SCO to work around various bugs and infelicities .
Through the later 1990s , I displaced SCO with Linux systems .
Yes , you would find those systems primitive today , but keep in mind that I could , even then , do things like run legacy MS - DOS apps under Linux ( displaced a bunch of dual - boot SCO boxes ) , run name servers , mail servers , DHCP servers , and pretty much any other network server you liked .
During that time , SCO worked to make life difficult .
The license / activation dance was a nuisance when it worked , and it always took way too long .
That made new systems more challenging .
Linux worked to make life easier .
No activation hassles .
License ?
GPL .
Compiler ?
GCC , not SCO 's crufty old MS compiler .
Debugger ?
GDB , not the old unix debugger .
That 's not to say that SCO did not have its good points .
Like Linux , it was reliable .
Neither system was prone to crash .
There were some apps that ran on SCO and were not offered directly for Linux .
Still , my experience was that I could often install Linux instead of SCO , giving the customer a better system for a lower price .
The sales critters hated that because their commission for a Linux license was a percentage of $ 0 .
They should have been grateful , because they were ( a ) selling commissionable hardware ( b ) taking care of the customer so that he would be there next time ( c ) selling labor , which was really the value - add in the company .
Sales types do not think long term , however , so there was no gratitude .
I cannot have been the only one during the 1990s who was replacing SCO sales with Linux sales .
I was one computer guy in a country full of them .
By the end of the 1990s , Linux was ubiquitous in server farms .
It was not rare in other production environments , either .
A computer guy who needed a server could get a Linux system in under the radar : grab an old box from spares , load up Slackware , and did not have to ask the bean counters for a budget .
It follows that at least part of the decline in SCO sales was directly attributable to Linux .
Better product , better price .

1. Aside from the business contracts in the first half of Part 1 , all of these
are source code contracts .
Even though the vast majority are
" dormant " ( such as the DaimlerChryler one ) , they have probably never
been formally terminated , which is why they are all listed .
Actually , t is
quite remarkable how many organizations obtain licenses of one sort or another .
Tiny colleges obtained source code licenses .
2 . In Part 7 , there actually is a contract with Microsoft that is listed as
" terminated " .
Curiously , the contract with Silicon Graphics ( Part 3 )
is not listed as terminated .
Did n't SCO send them a 60 - day notice ?
Perhaps SCO
never followed through .
3. Part 3 , p. 41 - Was Tandem 's license to Unix System V 4.2 MP ( Dec. 9 , 1998 ) a
new SVRX license ?
Or was it an upgrade under an existing license ?
This
transaction is listed in Column 5 , " Product Supplement " .
Let us
suppose that Darl is correct .
In this case the SVRX license , as defined in the
APA , is Tandem 's original Agreement SOFT - 00712 , dated April 17 , 1986 .
However ,
elsewhere SCO has argued that it is the Product Supplement ( or later the Product
Schedule ) that is the actual license , in which case Darl is wrong ( and SCO is in
violation of the APA by issuing new SVRX licenses without Novell 's approval ) .
4 . The 2003 Sun licensing agreement ( of which part is on appeal in Denver ) is an
amendment to the original SOFT - 000296 , Part 3 .
5. Educational licenses to Universities basically ended in 1991 - 1992 .
This was
when AT&T spun off USL .
6 . Part 2 , page 11 , it appears that HP , like IBM , never obtained a license for
System V R4 . Instead , it stopped at R3.2 .
( Or am I missing something ? )
7 . It would seem that the UNIX landscape really changed starting in 1993 when
Novell acquired USL .
Before that , AT&T and USL were in the source code
licensing business , with companies such as IBM , HP , Sequent , Santa Cruz , etc ,
making money selling binary licenses .
Novell , however , was in the binary
licensing business itself and thus a direct competitor to any company who would
purchase a source code license .
This factor , perhaps among others , would
explain the decline in source code licenses around 1995 .
It is not a direct
reflection of the state of SCO 's business itself ( which had one of its best
years ever in FY99 ) but is a strong reflection of the state of the " UNIX
ecosystem " in which SCO operated .

This is the original license agreement between Santa Cruz and AT&T .
You
might think that it is no longer relevant , but in fact it is referenced in the
Novell / Santa Cruz APA
Amendment 1 , which is still operative :
---------
1.2(e ) Revenues to be Retained by Buyer .
...
4. royalties attributable to the distribution by Buyer and its distributors of
binary copes of SVRX products , to the extent such copies are made by or for
Buyer pursuant to Buyer 's own licenses from Seller acquired before the Closing
Date through Software Agreement No. SOFT - 000302 and Sublicensing Agreement No .
SUB -000302A .
---------
Surely the new buyer would surely want to have a copy of SOFT - 000302 , at least
to document which binary royalties it is not obligated to pay to Novell .
For
old time 's sake .

My , admittedly limited , direct experience and observation is that ISO 9000 is
badly applied 95 % + of the time and the consultants and auditors are if anything
worse than the implementer .
If you get it right and apply it right a fair amount
is commonsense any good company is applying anyway but ISO 9000 gives you a
framework and excuse to document it properly then manage the procedures etc
soundly .
On the other hand if you get it wrong every criticism voiced in the posts above
is absolutely true and more .
It is critical you get leadership from the top and
that leadership cuts through the BS that all to readily creeps into any set of
rules , regulations etc .
If you do n't get that as I 've seen myself it does n't
matter how well the people down the chain try to make it work .
In one company the person who wrote the standards originally did a decent job
and he trained the internal auditors , including me , pretty well but the two
managers above treated it as just another bit of paperwork they had to deal with
so audit issues were never dealt with , the documents were never updated fully ,
when the writer retired no one took over managing it and the auditing died .
I
pointed out time and again we had no email policy or IT security policy in place
which was crazy , ISO 9000 or not , but nothing happened .
The company got taken
over by an even worse ISO9000 follower and died when the parent went bankrupt .
To no ones surprise .
I used to deliver , assess and audit vocational training and that suffers exactly
the same problems .
You end up down at the lowest common denominator the awarding
body will tolerate which completely negates the value of the qualifications
because they end up a tick box exercise with a load of paperwork and not a
genuine training .
When I first went in years ago it was worthwhile .
I 've no
interest in going back because of the way it works now and I gather from
business contacts they are increasingly disinterested in the qualifications
involved because they know they have little value .
That 's a very sad outcome for
everyone .

I do n't think that it is that strange that there were few licensees for this ,
which is the Multi Processor version .
At that time there were limited venues to run such software .
Tandem would have been one of the few hardware manufacturers that needed this .
It was not like today where most machines have multiple cores .

A federal jury on Thursday found Jammie Thomas - Rasset liable in the nation ’s only Recording Industry Association of America file - sharing case to go to trial , dinging her $ 1.92 million for infringing 24 songs .
Thomas - Rasset ( then just Jammie Thomas ) went to trial two years ago , and was ordered to pay $ 222,000 by a different jury for the same songs .
The judge in the first case declared a mistrial .
Thomas - Rasset opted for a new trial instead of settling like the 30,000 - plus others the RIAA has sued or threatened to sue for copyright infringement .
Thomas - Rasset , fined $ 80,000 a track , told our sister publication , Ars Technica , she would n’t pay .
Clearly , the Minneapolis jury did n’t buy her latest version of events .
This time , she testified that her children might have used her computer to file share on Kazaa .
The previous trial , she testified a file - sharing hack or crack hijacked her WiFi connection , even though she did n’t have a WiFi router .
Under the Copyright Act , juries can award damages of up to $ 150,000 per pilfered track .
About $ 3,500 was the average payment in the thousands of RIAA cases that settled out of court .
In December , the record labels announced they were winding down their 5 - year - old litigation campaign and instead began lobbying ISPs to disconnect music file sharers .
But the RIAA , the labels ’ litigation arm , said it was continuing with the hundreds of cases already in the legal pipeline .
Here ’s Thomas - Rasset ’s $ 1.92 million playlist .

The NHL's board of governors unanimously rejected Jim Balsillie 's application to become owner of the Phoenix Coyotes on Wednesday , while unanimously approving a bid by Jerry Reinsdorf .
A proposal by a third group was deemed " incomplete . "
But Ice Edge Holdings was encouraged to continue with the application process .
The board of governors 's executive committee convened Wednesday 's meeting in Chicago to evaluate each group 's bid for the Coyotes , who were taken into Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 5 by current owner Jerry Moyes .
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the process was necessary to comply with the league 's constitution and bylaws and an order by U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Redfield T. Baum .
" We will so advise the bankruptcy court and we will move this process forward , " Bettman said .
Reinsdorf , who owns the NBA 's Chicago Bulls and baseball 's Chicago White Sox , has offered $ 148 million US for the Coyotes and wants to keep the team in Phoenix .
Balsillie — the co-CEO of BlackBerry maker Research in Motion — has offered $ 212.5 million , but the bid is conditional on the Waterloo , Ont. , billionaire 's being allowed to move the team to Hamilton .
The NHL has submitted to the bankruptcy court that only a professional sports league can determine the location of its franchises and that owners must be approved by the league 's board of governors .
Bettman , though , said that issue was n't the focus of Wednesday 's hearing .
" This had nothing whatsoever to do with the relocation issue , " Bettman said .
" All that was considered was the suitability of the applicants of the owners . "
" The criteria set forth in the [ NHL ] constitution and bylaws relates to financial wherewithal , character , integrity and the view whether or not the other owners would deem you a good partner . "
Decision coming Aug. 5 ?
A spokesman for Balsillie said Wednesday 's decision would n't stop his pursuit of the Coyotes , whose future could be determined next week in an Arizona courtroom .
" We do not think that Jim Balsillie 's qualification to be an NHL owner is an issue in this case given his 2006 approval as an NHL owner , " Balsillie 's spokesman Bill Walker said in a statement .
Balsillie was approved as an owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2006 , but he backed out of the deal when the league tried to put restrictions on his ownership , including a provision that would have blocked him from moving the team .
Ice Edge Holdings wants to keep the Coyotes in Arizona while playing " a limited number of home games a year in a chosen Canadian sister city . "
The group includes Coyotes minority owner John Breslow among its investors .
One of the key figures is Anthony LeBlanc , a former Research in Motion executive .
An auction for bidders seeking to keep the team in Arizona is scheduled for Aug. 5 , provided the judge finds the bids satisfactorily meet the demands of the team 's creditors .
If not , it is conceivable that bids seeking to relocate the franchise would be allowed .

When it was announced that Fuel , Asobo Studios ’ apocalyptic open - world racer , boasted a daunting 5,560 square miles of terrain ( 14,400 km² ) , I immediately made a mental note to go mental , and drive around the entire world .
Last week , having received some PC preview code from publisher Codemasters , I did precisely that .
It ’s essential that I point out , before we go anywhere , that Fuel has plenty of normal racing game trappings , including a gradual exploration system in which you unlock cars , perform races to unlock regions , and a whole load of other car - collecting , livery - tweaking elements .
Were I bothering to play the game properly I ’d be doing that and travelling about via helicopter to race across the sprawling post - apocalyptic pseudo - America .
I was n’t doing that , of course , because I am a very deliberate kind of crazyman .
I was , instead , going to see what it would take to drive around the world in a single sitting .
It would have to be a single sitting because , without unlocking the game , I could not easily return to where I had driven to , or save my location .
I was going to drive without the safety - net of a saved game , or even a checkpoint .
Could it be done before my girlfriend got home from work ?
Would I still have time to do the washing up ?
Would so many hours non -stop off - roading mean that my brain ended up as a kind of rotisserie chicken , cooked and slowing turning inside my skull ?
What could I possibly learn from this strange road trip ?
These were all questions that would be answered in the next eight hours .
Some people might class what follows as containing spoilers , but they ’re mild ones , if they are spoilers at all .
8:40AM
Girlfriend packed into crumbling Ford Fiesta and sent off to work .
Cats fed .
It is time to begin .
The game begins in a basin by a lake , at the first of many racing camps .
Like everywhere else in the game , there are plenty of opportunities for postcard snaps of wide - open wilderness in this starter area .
I will be taking on my challenge with the default vehicle .
It ’s a buggy with a ludicrously large silencer on the back .
This will be ideal for rough terrain and does around 70 mph on level ground .
Pretty much perfect .
It ’ll be going flat out from here on out , and cover over three hundred miles .
Fortunately for my project , Fuel allows you to set a remote waypoint via the map , and then provides a “ chevrons in the sky ” GPS visual to point you in the right direction .
I did n’t always have this switched on , because it was moderately annoying .
In rough terrain , however , it was essential , because it picked out the roads that would get me safely through mountains , or tricky woodland .
Going offroad in these areas rapidly slowed me down , although it was often necessary to travel in what was generally a straight line cross-country .
8:47AM
Ooh , ramps .
This Is Ramp Country , or the architecture of dubious racing physics .
I occasionally stopped on my journey to jump over a farmhouse , or derelict factory .
There are hundreds of them across the landscape , each with its own convenient ramp .
This achieves little for a tourist like me , but they could be built into the races which you can construct yourself in the game interface .
When I am not jumping – which is most of the time – I am hammering through the countryside as fast as my buggy will carry me .
Occasionally there ’s the respite of open desert or rolling grass hills , but anything wooded requires continuous hard work and concentration .
9:30AM
There ’s something on the horizon .
Smoke !
This is my first major detour .
I head towards to towering plumes and find a burning tract of forest .
This is a world with little life , but plenty of evocative detail .
Fuel , it turns out , is littered with this kind of stuff .
I drive through a series of patchy , smoldering tree - skeletons , but later the burned forests become far more impressive , with blackened branches reaching from horizon to horizon .
Set to a lightening storm and a sunset , it becomes profoundly picturesque .
It ’s lucky that this kind of topography is so beautiful , because there ’s almost nothing else happening in Fuel ’s world , aside from the apparently pointless journeys of a number of black trucks .
Fuel ’s future America is bleak , and near - dead .
Some unruly neuron in my head keeps suggesting that I ’ve seen a human figure , but , of course , I never do .
Like Burnout ’s Paradise City , this is a place populated purely by machines .
10:05AM
I reach the first camp .
The terrain has been pretty rough so far , with some dense woodland and plenty of tricky hills and mountains to navigate .
I find myself chasing after the ambient traffic : those giant , threatening trucks that circle around the lanes and backroads .
Combine their errant movement with the witless distraction with my early road - trip chirpiness and general interesting in wandering about , and this becomes one of the slowest sections of the journey .
I am also delayed by leaving the PC for a few minutes to eat some cereal and to stand in actual daylight for the only time that day .
10:50AM
The temperate hills of varied grassland and forest give way to a scrubby prairie .
These plains , eventually , become dusty , low hills , before smoothing out entirely into salt flats .
I race across these , my eyes on the waypoint .
The doorbell rings .
The postman has brought my copy of Charles Stross ’ Halting State , and a book about mud : Dirt : The Ecstatic Skin Of The Earth .
Somehow both books are deeply relevant to the task at hand .
One book about acts of crime and weirdness in online games , the other an investigation the terrain beneath our feet , which coincidentally shares its name with another Codemasters racing game .
I muse on this bit of synchronicity as my buggy kicks up virtual grime into the camera .
11:07AM
The second camp that I will visit on my tour is an aeroplane graveyard .
It ’s quite something , out there in the dead white of the flats , and should have evoked things in my writerly imagination , but by this point my mind is bent on speed .
I soon leave , eager to cover more ground , faster .
Around this time I also realise that the pure act of driving is unlikely to keep me from boredom , so I begin to construct a meticulous soundtrack for my travels .
I begin with selected tracks from Eno ’s Apollo , which Alec introduced me to the other week .
Something about ambient or post - rock tunes seem to be wired through the travelling part of my brain .
I ca n’t help enjoying the road - trip more once it ’s set to gentle electronica and warbling noises .
11:30AM
The next hour makes for good speed .
I can travel pretty much as the crow flies through this terrain , dodging trees and rocks as I hurtle across gently undulating hills .
These hills start out scrubby and dry , slowly becoming more luscious as I head towards the mountain range ahead .
At this point I should probably stress what a colossal sense of scale the game has .
See that mountain thirty miles away ?
You can drive there .
You are driving there , for hours and hours .
And unlike huge games like Morrowind or Oblivion , where the world seems pretty big because you ’re on foot , in Fuel you ’re travelling at around 70 mph , all the time .
Those distances begin to seem even more enormous , even though you ca n’t get out of the car .
I begin to doubt I can circumnavigate the terrain in under eight hours .
12:00 PM
I am falling down the side of a continent .
I have climbed up a gigantic elevation into some mountains , and I am now plunging , offroad , between wrecked trees and scraggly bushes , towards the valley floor .
The sliding , crashing , tumbling process seems to go on forever .
12:15 PM
I find a pontoon bridge of some kind to cross the huge lake that lay in my way .
It ’s beautiful here .
I switch over the music over to Susumu Yokota ‘s Grinning Cat .
As the terrain becomes more desert - like , so the gentle electronic lulls me into a kind of bored trance .
The endless road seem increasingly dreamlike .
I occasionally crash headlong into the zombie trucks which are cruising aimlessly about the roads .
Crashes do n’t happen if you ’re paying attention , and when they do it ’s just an instant reset a few yards back , which is fortunate for me .
My smoking , battered ride found itself refreshed perhaps a dozen times across the journey .
( Early on , I had noticed an overheating oil gauge and smoke billowing from the engine block , and had feared some kind of realistic damage system would cripple my progress .
Not so . )
12:42 PM
Perhaps my state of mesmerisation explains how I briefly became lost in the desert mountains .
I ’d been blindly following the GPS at this point , which only seems to compute the next road that takes you in the general direction you want to go .
This means that if the roads do n’t link up – like when there ’s a canyon or river in the way – it can end up taking you in circles .
Annoyed , I start to look at the map more regularly , and stick to main roads for a while .
Tastes like American road movie .
13:00 PM
A field of crashed aeroplanes .
Someone at Asobo Studios has spent some time thinking about what an extreme - weather apocalypse might do to North America , and has then expended plenty of effort bringing that vision to life .
The details are what makes it interesting to explore .
13:15 PM
I reach the Grand Canyon .
One of the greatest geological features in North America should perhaps have moved me , but compared to what I ’d already seen , it seemed rather unimpressive .
At this point I decide to have lunch , alt - tab , do some blogging , write a couple of emails .
I am delayed by around an hour .
When I set off again I move the music over to Eluvium , for a rather more mesmeric , cinematic soundtrack .
14:20 PM
Dustbowl City .
Deep in the rippled sand - dunes of Fuel ’s endless southern deserts if one of its few urban areas : an abandoned city amid , well , a vast dustbowl .
Hello , Dubai 2030 ?
Something like that .
I do n’t stick around .
14:45 PM
Having now long exceeded my tolerance for high speed offroading , I begin to fantasize about what could have been done , or what could still be done , with this magnificent terrain .
Have you ever seen the early Spielberg film Duel ?
Fuel ’s big black trucks immediately brought it to mind .
There needs to be a game mode , perhaps a mod , in which you are just a guy in a domestic automobile , trying to get across country .
And the truck is hunting you .
And it absolutely will not stop .
Paranoia in a vast landscape where there is no - one to help you , and nowhere to hide .
Or perhaps the scale of the terrain and its half - hearted apocalypse could be employed to make a difficult experience even more explicit .
Some kind of game with the conceits of Cormac McCarthy ’s The Road .
Heading south , slowly , looking for food : the real fuel shortage faced by the book ’s doomed characters .
A high score table for how far you make it across the map .
No one makes it all the way .
Or , hooking back into rather more traditional Americana , a ranching cowboy game .
The undeveloped wilderness of Fuel suggests something about old America .
What about a true game of cowboys and indians , where you ’re moving cattle , fighting off bandits , cougars and indians ?
Trying to undertake procedurally generated cowboy quests across five thousand square miles ?
A game on horseback in this vast world would make things seem even bigger .
Then there ’s the logical step up from this simple apocalyptic racing game template : the evolution into a game of ultra-violent Mad Maxian speed tribes .
Oh Gods of game development , it ’s so obvious .
So clear and perfect : Asobo Studios must , must deliver a Fuel 2 in which I ’m racing across the desert with a gang of oil - punks , hunting for the last dregs of resources in this burned land .
A freeform action game with RPG , or even management elements : the intense battle to become the dominant road - warrior brotherhood of a vast , abandoned North America .
Yes , please , that needs to get made .
And the terrain , the world , it ’s already right here , and I ’m driving through it , like a nation - sized showroom of videogame possibilities .
Just imagine making a home of this , furnishing it with tales of hi-jacked land - trains , haywire ambushes by machinegun bikers , and hairsbreadth escapes from roving packs of helicopter gunships .
Mmm .
15:15 PM
Immense , burning forests .
Moving fast through Fuel ’s wooded areas is thrilling , even after several hours .
I ’m travelling through a fire - ravaged tract of the game called The Ashtray , and the ruined forests seem to have reached a topological crescendo .
As occurs irregularly throughout the world , a fighter - plane shoots overhead , reminding me that I should have spent the day playing Arma II .
Thanks , game , that was really unnecessary .
15:26 PM
Onwards , onwards , to the charmingly named Drownington Cove .
Home of the famed Charles Drownington , the inventor of death by inhaling water ?
Drownington
Cove is the second abandoned city on my trip .
It reminds me that this is nothing like the real America , although based on its satellite mugshots , instead it ’s a cut and paste videogame creation .
The bridge is clearly some kind of nod to the Bay Bridge , while the city could be San Francisco ’s downtown , or it could be New York .
Whatever , I ca n’t reach it .
I look at the image of the collapsed skyscrapers in the lake for a bit , and then move on .
On the playlist I put on some lively Orbital remixes , to increase the pace , to stay awake , to stay motivated .
15:50 PM
Headache developing .
No stopping .
Must finish this .
I might be hallucinating .
I ’ve begun to sense the terrain ahead of me before I see it .
Or do I ?
I glide onwards with weird inertia .
16:34 PM
Journey ’s end at Tsunami Reef .
My brain throbs .
Finally I arrive at the northwestern corner of the map , where a vast inland beach plays home to a beached and derelict gas transport ship .
I bounce around in the dunes for a bit , and log out .
My work is done .
344 miles and well under my eight - hour target .
So there we have it .
I might be a madman , and Fuel is probably the most impressive work of open terrain in videogame history .
My tour took all day , and barely a covered a fraction of the full map , missing out entire mountain ranges , and the central core of the world .
A shame , perhaps , that this map does n’t contain more life , or more flexibility for the deliberate explorer .
And the limitations of thing were showing through by the end : those same ruins , those same cow - remains , that same jet - fighter .
But at least it exists : a kind of videogame ode to the American wilderness .
( You can click on this image for a slightly larger map of my journey )
You know , I really was n’t joking about the possibilities for this : someone must go and turn this tech into a gigantic open - world action game .
Racing is all very well , but it suggests , or implies , so much more .
Whoever does more wo n’t even have to rebuild the world , because I ’d really be quite happy with the one that Asobo already put together .
Seriously , fill in some ambient life , populate with AI , lob a load of vehicular death toys in , and let there be rejoicing .
Do it .
Do it .
From the ' friggin Laser beams ' files :
LAS VEGAS .
There are all kinds of ways that attackers can ' sniff ' a users password , but laser beams and power cords ?
No it 's not Science Fiction , it 's Black Hat .
Security researchers Andrea Barisani and Daniele Bianco gave a tremendously entertaining and informative talk here about how good old PS / 2 keyboard leak though power lines and oh yeaah the lasers .
But first the keyboards .
" We
attacked PS2 keyboards and they have multiple cables inside of it , "
Barisani said .
" The wires are close to each other and poorly shielded
so there is a leak of information from the data wire to the ground
wire . "
Barisani noted that the signal from the
ground wire would also permeate to other electrical outlets in close
proximity .
The two researcher showed some demo screens of what the
electrical wires actually showed - at this stage they were able to make
out letters .
They did n't demo any kind of larger tool that could
actually turn all the letters into numbers and words , though they said
it was possible .
" We 're confident that more expensive equipment can lead to more precise
measurements , " Barisani said .
" We 're two idiots and we did this in one week . "
Now
the laser beams is another story .
The general idea is that the laser is
used as an acoustic microphone that could be used to remotely pick up
the sound vibration from a users keyboard .
Somehow you can match that
acoustic vibration to words / numbers , but frankly I did n't understand
how that actually worked .
But it is something remarkable and according to their preliminary research very real too .
So how do you defend against these attacks ?
Tin hats of course
Microsoft was in violation of the GPL ( General Public License ) on the Hyper - V code it released to open source this week .
After Redmond covered itself in glory by opening up the code , it now looks like it may have acted simply to head off any potentially embarrassing legal dispute over violation of the GPL .
The rest was theater .
As revealed by Stephen Hemminger - a principal engineer with open - source network vendor Vyatta - a network driver in Microsoft 's Hyper - V used open - source components licensed under the GPL and statically linked to binary parts .
The GPL does not permit the mixing of closed and open - source elements .
This story emerged after Hemminger congratulated Microsoft on its decision to release the driver to GPL .
Microsoft announced the move as part of a release of 20,000 lines of code to the GPL - an open - source license it has historically hated .
Hemminger said he uncovered the apparent violation and contacted Linux Driver Project lead Greg Kroah - Hartman , a Novell programmer , to resolve the problem quietly with Microsoft .
Hemminger apparently hoped to leverage Novell 's interoperability relationship with Microsoft .
" Since Novell has a ( too ) close association with Microsoft , my expectation was that Greg could prod the right people to get the issue resolved , " Hemminger blogged .
Neither Kroah - Hartman nor Microsoft spoke of a potential problem when announcing the code drop on Monday .
Quite the opposite .
Microsoft presented its embrace of the GPL as something it had done to help customers reduce the cost of deploying and managing their IT infrastructure through server consolidation , by speeding the performance of Linux on Hyper-V .
Kroah - Hartman appeared to verify Microsoft's GPL violation in an email exchange with All - About - Microsoft blogger Mary - Jo Foley , here .
Microsoft stunned the industry with its decision to embrace GPL .
The reaction of Hemminger was typical of many Linux aficionados , who congratulated Microsoft , but others were left puzzled .
Microsoft 's decision to release the code will be welcomed by anyone who simply wants Linux to work better with Windows .
But if Hemminger and Kroah - Hartman are to be believed , then Microsoft will have done itself no favors whatsoever on the trust front .
The company 's done much to mend its relations with the open - source community in recent years .
And where it has erred in the past - as when non -open - source code was posted on its CodePlex site - individual staff rather than corporate conspiracy were blamed .
When Microsoft had to be reminded of a long - overdue commitment to release the ECMA specs for its C# and the CLI under a royalty free license , charitable partners cited the short - term memory of a big company .
But this time it seems Microsoft did n't just omit certain key , unflattering facts - a move we expect from IT vendors when presenting their version of the news .
It went a step further , by positioning the GPLing of the code as something it clearly was not .
Microsoft called it a " break from the ordinary " , a " significant milestone , " and a " prime example " of customer demand being a " powerful catalyst " for change .
In realty , it looks like Microsoft messed up and was doing the right thing - if only to avert an embarrassing legal problem .
We do n't know why Microsoft positioned the news as something it was not .
Maybe it was because of the strategic and political importance of Hyper - V to the company , the unmissable kudos of embracing GPL and helping Linux on Windows , and how such an act could finally silence doubters .
The combining of open - and closed - code in the Hyper - V driver may well have been a case of individuals not really knowing what they were doing , not understanding the license , or hoping to get away with it .
Microsoft would n't be unique in this respect : combining open and closed code happens elsewhere .
But that wo n't matter .
Microsoft has more than anybody else to prove in its relationship open source .
The episode will " prove " to skeptics Microsoft simply cannot be trusted and that it has things to hide .
For others , it demonstrates Microsoft deals with open - source where it helps Microsoft and that acceptance of open - source inside Microsoft is not as widespread as such a milestone announcement would have led us to believe . ®

Our apocalypse fixation ignores the fact that the things we 're afraid of are old - hat .
Extinction level events have happened again and again throughout history and , lo and behold , we 're still here .
And hell , we probably would n't be without number five ...
It 's impossible to turn on the news or go the movies without hearing about some disease or cataclysm that 's about to end the world .
There 's a movie coming ( 2012 ) that as far as we can tell is about every apocalypse happening at once , and in the news the flavor of the week is swine flu -- though so far the fatality rate has fallen rather short of , say , Popsicles .
5 The K - T Extinction
Everyone knows this story :
For millions of years , dinosaurs roamed the earth , snacking on the odd mammal that was unfortunate enough to get in their way .
They were big , hungry and had some terrifying weaponry .
As for mammals , our only saving grace was that we bred like crazy and were too small to easily kill .
We presumably spent our days scurrying in terror and it was pretty clear who'd won the genetic lottery .

Then one sunny day 65 million years ago , a big rock fell out of the sky like a game of cosmic billiards gone drunkenly sour .
This falling space matter is suspected to have made the 110 - mile - wide Chicxulub crater in the Yucatan .
To understand the scale of the collision , know that according to newer versions of the theory , the crater in question was caused by only one of several fragments of a larger asteroid that did to our planet what a falling cinder block does to a Chihuahua .
Also remember that the Yucatan crater is 100 - damn - miles across .
The initial blast (s ) threw up enough ash to blot out the sun , killing all plant life .
With the plants gone , the food chain snapped , leaving all the dinos yab ba - dabba dead .
The mammals ' policy of being small and annoying paid off , and they grew up to be us , you and the Knicks City Dancers .

" Suck it , T - Rex ! "
The K - T rock was six - miles across .
If that sounds big , know that the earth is approximately 7,000 - miles across ( which is quite small by stellar standards ) .
Heck , K - T was n't even the biggest one to hit our planet -- a few billion years ago , one such impact shat out the entire moon .
Documentary .
Do n't worry , though .
The good news is that we have dedicated teams of nerds giving up their social lives to stare at the night sky in order to tag and track most cosmic debris in the solar system longer than a mile .
The bad news is that objects smaller than mile across can still ruin your day , particularly if your name is Ann Hodges .
The Shweeb
Finally :
The Infrastructurist shows us the perfect mashup of a podcar with Velo - City : The Shweeb , a pedal - powered monorail that is “ a direct response to the transportation needs of today and the future . ”
( Pics and video )
And , it exists right now , in an amusement park in New Zealand .
In the current version , you can race them ; because they are enclosed they say that it uses half the energy of a racing bike and about a third of a mountain bike .
It looks like a great deal of fun ;
But the technology could offer a lot more .
They inventors write :
The world ’s populations are increasingly migrating to huge cities , and the densities within our cities are steadily climbing as residential towers become the dominant mode of residence .
Traffic is slowing to walking pace , there is little parking and there is significant and ever - increasing pollution of the air we breathe .
Of note , the average speed of a motor vehicle in central London in 1908 was 8 mph .
In 2008 it was still 8 mph .
Any attempt to resuscitate the automobile by devising a new fuel or engine is doomed .
Our cities simply can’t cope with rising numbers of cars or parking spaces .
In our opinion a fresh approach is required .
Geoffrey Barnett and his team propose hanging fully enclosed recumbent bikes from monorail networks that could get you safely and quickly from one point in the city to another .
Gang them together and they face less air resistance and it is even easier .
To top it all off , “ you ca n’t derail or fall out while on the cellphone or blackberry ! ”
They conclude :
The result is the most efficient vehicle on earth , the most inexpensive infrastructure of any proposed urban transit and one of the highest capacity systems available – potentially delivering thousand ’s of people per hour in a very small airspace .
All this with zero carbon emissions and no parking worries or cost !
And great exercise , too .
What ’s not to love .

New High Resolution Observations of the Betelgeuse Unveil the True Face of a Gigantic Star
When one looks up at the clear night sky in winter , it is easy to spot a bright , orange star on the shoulder of the constellation Orion ( the Hunter ) even in light - flooded large cities .
This is the star Betelgeuse .
It is a gigantic star , which is so huge as to almost reach the orbit of Jupiter , swallowing the inner planets Mercury , Venus , Earth , and Mars , when placed at the centre of our solar system .
It is also glaringly bright , emitting 100,000 times more light than the Sun .
Betelgeuse is a so - called red supergiant and approaching the end of its short life of several million years .
Red supergiants shed a large amount of material made of various molecules and dust , which are recycled for the next generation of stars and planets possibly like the Earth .
Betelgeuse is losing material equivalent to the Earth ’s mass every year .
How do such giant stars lose mass , which would normally be bound to the star by the gravitational pull ?
This is a long - standing mystery .
The best way to tackle this issue is to observe the situation where the material is ejected from a star ’s surface , but this is a very challenging task .
Although Betelgeuse is such a huge star , it looks like a mere reddish dot even with the today ’s largest , 8 - 10 metre telescopes , because the star is 640 light years away .
Using different state - of - the - art techniques on ESO 's Very Large Telescope , two independent teams of astronomers have obtained the sharpest ever views of the supergiant star Betelgeuse .
They show that the star has a vast plume of gas almost as large as our Solar System and a gigantic bubble boiling on its surface .
These discoveries provide important clues to help explain how these mammoths shed material at such a tremendous rate .
By combining two or more telescopes as a so - called interferometer , astronomers can achieve a much higher resolution than provided with individual telescopes .
The Very Large Telescope Interferometer ( VLTI ) on Cerro Paranal in Chile , operated by the European Southern Observatory ( ESO ) , is one of the world ’s largest interferometer .
A team of astronomers in German , French , and Italian institutions observed Betelgeuse with the AMBER instrument operating at near - infrared wavelengths .
The resolving power achieved with AMBER is so great that one can recognize a 1 - Euro coin placed on the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin from Bonn .
" Our AMBER observations mark the sharpest images ever made of Betelgeuse " , says Keiichi Ohnaka at the MPIfR , the first author of the publication presenting the result .
" And for the first time , we have spatially resolved the gas motion in the atmosphere of a star other than the Sun .
Thus , we could observe how the gas is moving in different areas over the star ’s surface . "
The AMBER observations have revealed that the gas in Betelgeuse ’s atmosphere is moving vigorously up and down .
The size of these " bubbles " is also gigantic , as large as the supergiant star itself ( that is , one bubble as large as the orbit of Mars is moving at some 40 000 km / h ) .
While the origin of these bubbles is not yet entirely clear , the AMBER observations have shed new light on the question about how red supergiant stars lose mass : such colossal bubbles can expel the material from the surface of the star into space .
It also means that the material is not spilling out in a quiet , ordered fashion , but is flung out more violently in arcs or clumps .
The death of the gigantic star , which is expected in the next few thousand to hundred thousand years , will be accompanied by cosmic fireworks known as a supernova like the famous SN1987A .
However , as Betelgeuse is much closer to the Earth than SN1987A , the supernova can be clearly seen with the unaided eye , even in daylight .

C anadian judges once deferred to government on questions of national security .
No more .
Federal Court Justice Russel Zinn 's withering critique of Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's government for refusing to let a Canadian citizen back into Canada is just the latest in a series of judicial decisions indicating that , on matters of terrorism , the courts no longer believe everything Ottawa says .
Zinn 's decision orders the government to issue Abousfian Abdelrazik a passport and , within 30 days , ensure his return from Sudan .
That 's where the alleged terror supporter has been stranded for six years – at first in jail , latterly in the Canadian embassy .
The judge describes as " nonsensical " the government 's reasons for refusing to let Abdelrazik return and says there is no compelling evidence of his being a terrorist .
Equally important , the judgment dismisses claims by Jim Judd , head of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service , that CSIS had nothing to do with Abdelrazik 's imprisonment and alleged torture by Sudanese authorities .
The judge ruled that CSIS was clearly " complicit " in Abdelrazik 's jailing if not his torture .
Wham , bam .
Thursday 's judgment comes just a week after Simon Noel , another Federal Court judge in another terrorism case , reamed out CSIS .
In that case , which involves Ottawa 's attempts to deport Algerian refugee and alleged terror supporter Mohamed Harkat , Noel bluntly said that CSIS witnesses may have lied in court .
In April , yet another Federal Court judge , James O'Reilly , concluded that Ottawa was complicit in America 's illegal treatment at Guantanamo Bay of teenaged Canadian terror suspect Omar Khadr .
The judge ordered the government to try to repatriate Khadr .
So far , Harper has ignored the courts .
The Prime Minister announced he would not obey the Khadr ruling even before he appealed it .
His government says it is studying the Abdelrazik decision .
If so , there 's not much Ottawa will like .
Zinn concluded that successive Liberal and Conservative governments have victimized Abdelrazik since July 2004 .
That , says the judge , is when a decision was made in Ottawa to ensure that the Canadian never came home .
Exactly why is unclear .
Zinn concludes that the U.S. probably put Abdelrazik on the UN 's international terror list , using a process the judge called Kafkaesque and blatantly unfair .
For the Federal Court , all of this is deliciously novel .
Traditionally a venue for tax and other dry administrative matters , it has been thrown into the public spotlight by the war on terror .
In the earliest terror hearings , judges tended to accept the word of government and CSIS .
But by 2004 , there were rumblings that the judiciary was unhappy .
This was followed in 2007 by a Supreme Court ruling that forced Ottawa to let so - called special advocates hear some of the secret evidence used to detain non-citizens accused of terrorism .
Now the front - line Federal Court is pushing back hard .
Why ?
University of Ottawa law professor Craig Forcese says it 's not so much that the judges are changing .
It 's that the government is becoming more obdurate .
" The court is ... following the law , " adds Toronto lawyer Paul Copeland , a special advocate in the Harkat case .
" The reason there have been so many orders against the government is because this government , even more than previous ones , does not care about the rule of law . "
Thomas Walkom 's column appears Wednesday and Saturday .
Phorm is a controversial system of internet advertising Shares in the online ad firm Phorm have fallen by more than 40 % after BT said it had no immediate plans to use the service that tracks online behaviour .
Phorm serves up adverts related to a user 's web browsing history , which it monitors by taking a copy of the places they go and search terms they look for .
However , it came in for considerable criticism from privacy groups and prompted an EU investigation .
The firm 's shares were down 43.16 % at 270 p at 13:13 BST .
Phorm builds a profile of users by scanning for keywords on websites visited and then assigns relevant ads .
It has proved controversial because it scans almost all sites a user visits and there is an ongoing political debate about how a user gives consent .
Phorm had conducted trials of its technology with BT , which it marketed as Webwise .
On hold A spokesman for British Telecom , Mike Jarvis , told the BBC that they were not completely closing the door on Phorm 's Webwise service .
" We 're interested in this area [ targeted online advertising ] but for now we have no immediate plans .
" It 's more a case that we have other stuff to work on - Project Canvas , rolling out the fibre network and so forth - so we 've taken a step out of Phorm and will see how it develops .
" [ Our decision has ] nothing to do with cost or privacy , it 's about resources and priority , " he added .
In April , Amazon blocked Phorm from scanning its web pages to produce targeted advertising , as has the UK government , citing privacy concerns .
Phorm declined an interview request , instead issuing a statement saying its activities " remain ongoing " and that it was looking forward " to creating the conditions necessary for UK ISPs to move to deployment " .
" We continue to focus considerable effort on faster moving overseas opportunities , " the statement read .
" In so doing we have already minimised our dependency on the deployment by any single ISP or in any particular market .
" In addition to making excellent progress in South Korea , we are engaged in more than 15 markets worldwide including advanced negotiations with several major ISPs . "

The New Acropolis Museum in Athens is a fact .
For Yatzer , the Greek originated global online destination for those who are passionate about design and architecture ( + more ) , no other happening could possibly hold the title of the major event that marked June of 2009 .
The Museum , designed by the Swiss - born architect Bernard Tschumi in collaboration with Michalis Photiadis & Associate Architects in Athens , opened its doors to the public only a few days ago on June 20th .
Located only 300 meters ( 980 feet ) SouthEast of the Parthenon , with an exhibition space of 14,000 square meters and a cost of € 130 million , the New Acropolis Museum houses some of the most famous works of classical antiquity .
It aims at providing the visitors with a comprehensive picture of the human presence on the Acropolis , from the pre-historic times through late Antiquity , with the advantage of being built on the slope of the Acropolis itself .
The three major materials used for its construction are glass for the facades and some of the floors , concrete for the core and the columns , as well as marble for the galleries .

Transparent glass ramp over archeological excavations in the Lobby of the Acropolis Museum
Inside the Museum , visitors ascend a wide glass - floored gallery , as if they were ascending the slope of the Acropolis .
The glass ramp reveals ancient remains that were excavated during the building ’s construction , thus providing a sense of continuity between the Acropolis and the museum site itself .
Along the ramp , on the left and right hands , archaeological finds from the sanctuaries , as well as from the almost uninterrupted settlements from the end of the Neolithic period ( about 3000 BC ) until late antiquity ( 6th century AD ) are displayed .
At the end of the ramp the visitors come across the large finds of the “ Hekatompedon ” , the first large temple of the Goddess Athena on the Acropolis .
The Slope Gallery
On the second floor archaic and early classical statues are scattered across a big gallery like a crowd in an agora .
The specific display selection caused curatorial dispute , as the visitors might miss many important statues of the time , such as the “ Kritios Boy ” and other landmarks of archaic and classical sculpture .
However , while wandering around one cannot help noticing the interaction between the public and the statues .
The three - dimensional exhibits seen from all sides create a sense of an ongoing dialogue between the people mingling with the statues like in a promenade ; visitors are pausing , admiring , taking photos and walking back and forth while following no specific predetermined museum course .

A bit further down , the five Caryatids , those exquisite sculpted female figures from the Erechtheion ’s temple porch , seem a bit incomplete without the sixth member of their “ family ” .
The empty statue base is a reminder of the sixth Caryatid , displayed at the British Museum in London .

The top floor is the rectangular Parthenon Gallery .
Arranged around an indoor court and with the Museum ’s glass enclosure , the gallery display aims at orienting the Marbles – Ionian frieze and metopes - exactly as they were placed at the Parthenon on the 5th century B.C.
The visitor has the opportunity to view not only the Parthenon marbles in a space that has exactly the same dimensions as the cella of the Parthenon , but also the monument itself through the gallery ’s all around glass enclosure .

Ancient Athens and modern Athens combined , with the Parthenon and the Acropolis as their focal point .
The presence of ambient natural light on the marbles is what makes the display breathtaking .
The New Acropolis Museum is a major event not only for Greece .
Its completion is one more argument on the ongoing issue of the repatriation of the Parthenon Marbles from the British Museum .
Removed by Lord Elgin ’s agents from 1801 to 1812 under a controversial permission from the Ottoman authorities to remove pieces from the Acropolis , the return of the Parthenon marbles has been troubling governments , museums and the public .
The return of the marbles is not a new issue ; one cannot mention politicians with an eye to posterity , starting with Melina Mercouri – the late actress who initiated the campaign for the return of the marbles already in 1981 .
The large worldwide archaeological and public community , who support the return of the marbles to their rightful place , now have another strong practical and sentimental argument : a brand new Museum , constructed with top architectural standards right on the Acropolis slope , thus facilitating the reunification of the marbles .

Moreover , the Museum - with its first construction groundbreaking taking place in September 2003 - has been at the centre of general interest ; neighbours have been complaining , values of surrounding houses have been raised ; pros and cons have been expressed by curators and architects both on the museum design and the connection of the building to the general urban architecture .
It makes sense for objections to arise on such a huge project .
In all attempts and projects , from the smallest structure building to the largest construction , conflicting voices and objections often arise .
For something of the New Acropolis Museum magnitude , those were even more .
The New Acropolis Museum is already extremely popular among visitors from all over the world .
What is now left for you is to experience the Museum for yourselves .
Yatzer strongly invites you to do so .

The Artistic Segment of the Acropolis Museum Opening (+ full list of credits )
“ Reflections ” – Large scale Site - specific Projections
The Museum exhibits – masterpieces of world heritage – and the Museum as an example of high contemporary architecture are the undoubted stars of the Acropolis Museum opening .
The artistic segment of the opening takes place in the Museum ’s surrounding area : large - scale outdoor projections of animated sequences appear on the exterior shells of the Museum and its neighbouring buildings , transforming them into receptive , interactive urban membranes .
Points at which the sculptural world of the 6th – 4th centuries BC and contemporary Athens can meet and mingle .
The projections draw their inspiration from the Museum ’s architectural and conceptual principle of reflection between the Acropolis and the surrounding city .
The projected images seek to multiply these reflections .
Statues , and scenes taken from pottery are set into motion , coming to life in a series of animations played in a loop lasting an hour .
Their aesthetic alludes to the first attempts to record and study motion during the early years of cinema .
This artistic approach connects and parallels the emergence of two extraordinary periods in the history of anthropocentric world art : Classical sculpture and cinema .
By interacting with or magically masking the structural and decorative elements of the buildings , the projections prompt a series of architectural games at the interface between the projected image and the façade “ screens . ”
The projections will play from sunset until late on the Museum ’s first three days open to the public , beginning after visiting hours have ended .

The first genetically modified primates that can pass their modifications to their offpsring have been created by Japanese scientists .
The marmosets , pictured above , express a green fluorescent protein in their skin .
The gene for producing the glow was delivered to the first marmoset embryos via a modified virus .
But now that modification method could become unnecessary .
One male marmoset , number 666 , fathered a child ( pictured at right ) that also contained the transgenes .
" The birth of this transgenic marmoset baby is undoubtedly a milestone , " developmental biologists Gerald Schatten and Shoukhrat Mitalipov at the Pittsburgh Development Center and Oregon Stem Cell Center , respectively wrote in a commentary accompanying the study Thursday in Nature .
" The cumbersome and often frustrating process of making a transgenic animal from scratch need now only occur with founder animals . "
Transgenic animals are a key tool in the biomedical researchers ' toolbox .
They allow scientists to model the function of genes and the efficacy of treatments .
Many transgenic mice lines exist , but often the small rodents are too different from humans to effectively extrapolate their responses to human beings .
Primates , on the other hand , are far closer biologically to humans , but before the new technique , creating primate models had proven difficult and expensive .
Now , biologists may be able to produce whole groups of marmosets that mimic humans with genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis .
" Subsequent generations can be produced by natural propagation , with the eventual establishment of transgene - specific monkey colonies — a potentially invaluable resource for studying incurable human disorders , and one that may also contribute to preserving endangered primate species , " Schatten and Shoukhrat continued .
Instead of using bonobos or chimps , the research team led by Erika Sasaki at the Central Institute for Experimental Animals in Japan picked the common marmoset because its " size , availability , and unique biological characteristics " make it a potentially useful animal , particularly in tough fields like neuroscience and stem cell research .

Oh , and if you have doubts about how well a DIY air conditioning unit could work , he reported back with these results after putting it to the test in a hot truck :
When the unit was started , the air in the cab was 95 degrees , parked in the shade after a morning of sun , and the outside heat index was 108 degrees .
Within five minutes the cab had cooled to 75 degrees , and the air output was 65 degrees .
With two quarts of water that had been refrigerated and 8 pounds of ice cubes , the ice had melted after 40 minutes , leaving 50 degree water , with an output of 65 degree air .
Not only does the unit work , but it works well and efficiently !
Check out the link below for detailed instructions on how to build your very own portable air conditioner and while you 're down there , hit up the comments section and tell us about how you battle the summer heat .

A Moldovan activist faces criminal charges for organizing demonstrations that were enabled by social networking tools like Twitter and Facebook , the Russian press reports .
In an interview with Russian news agency ITAR - TASS , Moldovan Prosecutor General Valeriu Gurbulea said Natalia Morar , one of the organizers of an anti-Communist flash mob , has been officially charged with " calls for organizing and staging mass disturbances . "
( Morar has not been put in jail , however – despite some reports to the contrary . )
Prosecutors , Gurbulea added , were contemplating charges against another 200 people he described as being involved in an attempt to overthrow the government in Moldova 's so - called " Twitter Revolution . "
" We 'll charge them not only with the attempt to stage a government overthrow , and incitement to mass disturbances and participation in them , but also with the theft of tangible assets , " he said .
Earlier this week , activists used text messages and online social networking tools to organize what they described a peaceful protest in Chisinau , the capital of the tiny , landlocked former Soviet republic .
Demonstrators sent a stream of Twitter updates , blog posts , video , and pictures .
Things , however , turned violent , and some protesters stormed and trashed government buildings .
On her LiveJournal blog , Morar distanced herself from the riots .
In an interview with The New York Times , Morar said she expected to face charges ; she added that organizers had received threatening phone calls .
Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin , meanwhile , is accusing neighboring Romania of plotting a coup .
Voronin ordered the expulsion of Romania 's ambassador , and Moldova has moved to expel Romanian journalists as well .
Twitter , YouTube and other social media continue to be an important tool for following this crisis .
Posting from Chisinau , Twitter user 1arsz notes that opposition organizers are sending out the call to gather for a rally tomorrow on the capital 's main square .
Associated Press reporter Corneliu Rusnac notes that social networking tools have been essential for maneuvering around a government information blockade .
" Television stations around the world on Tuesday aired images of the violent protest , with the parliament and Voronin 's offices on fire , " he writes .
" But in Moldova , where press freedoms are weak , state television chose to broadcast a soap opera and another station showed images of dance routines . "
UPDATE : Morar 's LiveJournal page went much of the day without updates ; reports circulated that she had been locked up , following the charges filed against her .
At 7:13 p.m. , she posted this update : " Reports of my detention are not true .
I'm O.K . "

EU Commissioner for Telecoms and Media Viviane Reding has joined the debate over Internet piracy .
Yesterday she stated that both sides of the conflict are right but their inability to see things from the other 's perspective is holding back progress .
In the meantime , she says , piracy is seen by many as increasingly " sexy " .
The debate over online file - sharing , copyright infringement , piracy – call it what you will – is not going away .
Indeed , the debate is more vigorous and heated than ever before .
On the one hand many copyright holders are virtually unmovable , steadfast in their belief that file - sharers are little more than thieves , undermining their livelihoods and stealing bread from their children ’s mouths .
The firm belief that they are dealing with criminals explains the draconian policies of the music and movie industry , they say .
On the other hand are millions upon millions of Internet users , desperate for their media fix in the most convenient forms , with as few restrictions as possible .
Every download is not a lost sale , they say , indeed free downloads may even boost sales and treating file - sharers like criminals achieves nothing , with many declaring they will never stop downloading , never stop sharing .
Many champion disconnections for alleged pirates , while others say that access to the Internet and the information it provides is a fundamental right .
In the end , something will have to give .
In her speech to the Ludwig Erhard Lecture yesterday in Brussels , EU Commissioner for Telecoms and Media Viviane Reding joined the debate , focusing on the need for reconciliation between the almost warring factions .
Explaining that her number one priority is to make access to digital media easier and more attractive , Reding said this would drive the take - up of high speed Internet in Europe .
However , the fact that both sides are reluctant to see the world from the perspective of the other , progress is being held back .
“ While many right holders insist that every unauthorised download from the Internet is a violation of intellectual property rights and therefore illegal or even criminal , others stress that access to the Internet is a crucial fundamental right , ” Reding explained .
“ Let me be clear on this : Both sides are right .
The drama is that after long and often fruitless battles , both camps have now dug themselves in their positions , without any signs of opening from either side . ”
Of course , these entrenched positions do little to further the possibility of some kind of willing reconciliation , with many in the file - sharing community more determined than ever to preserve their activities and nurture their beloved hobby , often in a particularly proud way , a point not lost on Reding .
“ In the meantime , Internet piracy appears to become more and more ‘ sexy ’ , in particular for the digital natives already , the young generation of intense Internet users between 16 and 24 , ” she told the lecture .
Noting that this age group should become the “ foundation of our digital economy , of new innovation and new growth opportunities , ” Reding outlined the difficulties in bringing the sides together .
Quoting Eurostat figures , she claimed that 60 % of 16 - 24 year - olds have downloaded audiovisual content from the Internet in recent months without paying .
“ And 28 % state that they would not be willing to pay , ” she added .
These figures , according to Reding , are indicative of the limitations of the present system ;
“ It is necessary to penalize those who are breaking the law .
But are there really enough attractive and consumer - friendly legal offers on the market ? ” she mused , hitting on one of the biggest complaints from media consumers .
Highlighting the perceived gap between ‘ suits ’ and citizens , Reding questioned if the current legal system for dealing with copyright meets the expectations of the younger , more tech - savvy Internet generation ;
“ Have we considered all alternative options to repression ?
Have we really looked at the issue through the eyes of a 16 year old ?
Or only from the perspective of law professors who grew up in the Gutenberg Age ?
In my view , growing Internet piracy is a vote of no -confidence in existing business models and legal solutions .
It should be a wake - up call for policy - makers . ”
Ask many on the file - sharing side of the debate and they will agree with Reding when she says that something must be done and done quickly too .
If the media companies do n’t make access to online media easier and more attractive “ we could lose a whole generation as supporters of artistic creation and legal use of digital services .
Economically , socially , and culturally , this would be a tragedy , ” she said .
“ Digital Europe can only be built with content creators on board , ” Reding told the lecture , “ and with the generation of digital natives as interested users and innovative consumers . ”
In the end , people will have to talk .
When all is said and done , legal action and disconnections will not solve this mess .
Scaring people into becoming a customer is not a sustainable business model .
In the end – just like flowing water – people will find the easiest route to the destination they require .
It is up to the entertainment companies to ensure that the route Internet users take to media is via their door , and not to that of the nearest torrent site .
When that will be is anyone ’s guess .
My guess is no time soon .
EPA lets state get tougher on new vehicles POLLUTION
EPA Administrator - designate Lisa Jackson testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington , Wednesday , Jan. 14,2009 , before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing on her nomination .

Federal officials on Tuesday cleared California to impose tough greenhouse gas limits on new motor vehicles that more than a dozen other states can follow immediately and that will form the basis of new nationwide rules in 2012 .
In a major reversal of Bush administration policy , the Environmental Protection Agency 's ruling was hailed by California politicians and national environmental groups as a breakthrough in curbing carbon dioxide - a leading contributor to global warming .
Tuesday 's waiver highlights the state 's decades - long tradition of environmental leadership , said Roland Hwang , transportation program director for the Natural Resources Defense Council .
" When you look at California 's leadership across the board on energy and global warming , it provides almost a perfect template for the activity going on in D.C. , " he said .
" What 's happening out here with Tesla ( Motors ' electric car production ) is what should be happening in Detroit . "
California has a history of setting environmental standards more rigorous than the federal government 's since before 1970 , and the Clean Air Act passed that year permits the state to continue to do so , providing it receives a waiver from the EPA .
The state law setting the new carbon dioxide standards , written by then - Assemblywoman Fran Pavley , passed in 2002 , and the state sought an EPA waiver in 2005 .
But the EPA denied the waiver in 2007 , saying it was important to have a national emissions standard and that a recently passed energy bill raising fuel economy standards was a better universal rule .
In January , President Obama 's pick for EPA administrator , Lisa Jackson , promised to review the waiver decision .
In May , Obama announced national emissions and fuel economy standards patterned after California 's pending rule .
On Tuesday , Jackson granted the California waiver .
" This decision puts the law and science first , " Jackson said in a statement .
" After review of the scientific findings , and another comprehensive round of public engagement , I have decided this is the appropriate course under the law . "
Pavley , now a state Senator , issued a statement cheering the decision .
" It was a real David and Goliath fight , " she said .
" This news is extremely gratifying to all the people and organizations who have worked so hard on this issue for the past eight years .
We 're thrilled to death . "
The waiver means that California can impose the emissions standards - the nation 's first aimed at reducing greenhouse gases - beginning with the 2009 model year and increase them annually , with a goal of achieving a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gases in 2016 compared with 2002 levels .
National standards fuzzy
The new national standards , which are still being developed , are due to take effect in 2012 and would include both fuel economy and greenhouse gas pollution standards .
They would require an average fuel economy of 35.5 miles per gallon in 2016 ; current federal standards require 27.5 mpg for cars and 22.3 mpg for SUVs and light trucks .
The draft standards also call for a national carbon dioxide vehicle emissions standard of 250 grams per mile of CO { - 2} in model year 2016 , a figure comparable to California 's standard .
Vehicles covered by the policy - passenger cars , light - duty trucks and medium - duty passenger vehicles - generate about 60 percent of all U.S. transportation - related greenhouse gas emissions , which comprise about a third of all greenhouse gas emissions in the nation , according to the EPA .
Under agreements reached during the waiver battle , California will consider any vehicles that meet that national standard to also meet the California standard until 2016 .
That agreement was important to the auto industry , which had long argued that a national standard was needed to avoid costly confusion .
Automakers dropped pending lawsuits as part of the agreement , and on Tuesday Michael Stanton , president of the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers , cited the agreement in reacting to the EPA decision .
" We are now focused on working with California , EPA and ( the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ) to finalize the operational details of this harmonized program and to continue meeting aggressive goals for cleaner , more fuel - efficient vehicles , " he said .
California 's new rules will be followed by 13 other states - Arizona , Connecticut , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington - and the District of Columbia .
40 % of vehicles affected
That means about 40 percent of the nation 's vehicle fleet will come under the new rules , said Hwang - and the waiver opens the door for California to set still stronger standards after 2016 .
In the nearer term , Hwang and other environmentalists said , the decision will give Californians and states that follow their standards a jump - start on buying the next generation of clean cars - and enjoying lower overall fuel costs as miles per gallon rise .
An analysis by the California Air Resources Board estimated that California 's program will reduce the state 's annual climate change emissions by 30 million metric tons in 2020 and save Californians about $ 30 a month in fuel costs .
A separate analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that a federal standard like the one proposed by Obama in May would reduce U.S. oil dependence by about 1.4 million barrels per day by 2020 - about the same amount the nation now imports from Saudi Arabia .
But William Yeatman , an energy policy analyst for the free market Competitive Enterprise Institute , said those estimates overlook a " legal tripwire " created by the waiver that could eventually see property owners forced to spend thousands in legal bills and infrastructure upgrades to meet emissions standards for buildings .
Hwang disagreed , saying the EPA waiver is specifically tailored to automobiles .

As Lou Dobbs notes here , Obama is in favor of the ratifying CIFTA , the Inter - American Convention Against Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms .
On its face , the treaty sounds reasonable because it would “ prevent , combat , and eradicate the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms , ammunition , explosives , and other related materials ” ( emphasis added ) .
However , upon reading the bill we discover the following :
Stressing the need , in peace processes and post - conflict situations , to achieve effective control of firearms , ammunition , explosives , and other related materials in order to prevent their entry into the illicit market .
Obama has promised Mexican President Felipe Calderon that he would urge the Senate to take up CIFTA .
He is doing this under the cover of the drug cartel violence in Mexico .
Obama and Calderon quoted a statistic echoed by the corporate media that 90 % of the weapons seized in Mexican raids were purchased from U.S. gun shops and a reason why the U.S. needs to ratify this treaty .
In fact , this is a lie — only a mere 17 % of guns found at Mexico crime scenes have been traced to the U.S .
CIFTA would bury the Second Amendment under “ pertinent resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly . ”
It would criminalize ammunition reloading ( defined as explosives manufacture ) and gun assembly ( including firearm kits and presumably breaking down weapons for cleaning or transport ) .
Language contained in the CIFTA treaty insists it respects “ the principles of sovereignty , nonintervention , and the juridical equality of states . ”
Not mentioned is the fact the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties has a superior rank to national laws .
If the CIFTA treaty is ratified without exception , it would kill U.S. sovereignty and lead the way to destroying the Second Amendment .
It should be noted that only the Senate needs to ratify the treaty .
Article II , section 2 , of the Constitution states that the president “ shall have Power , by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate , to make Treaties , provided two - thirds of the Senators present concur . ”
The United States was one of the first signatories to CIFTA in November , 1997 .
The Convention was transmitted to the Senate in June 1998 and to this day awaits the Senate ’s advice and consent .
29 of the 34 OAS member states have ratified CIFTA .
Only the US , Canada , the Dominican Republic , Jamaica and St. Vincent & Grenadines have yet to do so .

Mexican growers having big pot year in state Marijuana crops Decrease in enforcement helps Mexican growers
A members of the CAMPS team ( Campaign Against Marijuana Planting ) unloads the remains of a marijuana garden from the forest above Lake Shasta on Wednesday , July 8 , 2009 .
Illegal pot farming on public lands is a problem throughout California , the growers clear - cut forests and cause environmental problems from garbagee , irrigation pipes , hazardous wastes and pesticides .
Gardens sometimes contain as many as 30,000 plants .
It is a major problem in Shasta and Lake counties , where forest pot farming has become a major scourge that state and federal drug enforcement agents are struggling to control .

Mexican drug traffickers have expanded their marijuana - growing operations in California parks as state and local governments have tightened spending and slashed jobs and services .
Law enforcement officials say the traffickers , taking advantage of the fact that there are fewer sheriff 's deputies and rangers monitoring parks , are cultivating more pot than ever before .
This year 's multibillion - dollar crop is on pace to be the largest in history , said state officials .
" It 's a huge problem , " said Gordon Taylor , the assistant special agent in charge of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration .
" California is ground zero for domestic marijuana cultivation in the country . "
The illicit crops are believed to be hidden on ridges and in gullies in California 's 31 million acres offorest , with most being grown in state and national parks .
So far this year , more than a million plants have been seized by the state 's Campaign Against Marijuana Planting , or CAMP program , according to Michelle Gregory , the spokeswoman for the California Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement , and the pot - growing season is not even half over .
" Our whole state is overrun , " Gregory said .
" It 's an epidemic . "
Much of the cannabis grown in California is being exported around the country , into Mexico and overseas .
One batch recently harvested in Shasta County was tracked by drug enforcement agents to Chicago and South Carolina .
Fewer officers
This year , Shasta County has nearly equaled its record of 394,375 plants seized last year despitehaving only one full - time sheriff 's sergeant and five part - timers available to patrol for marijuana .
Adjacent Trinity County , on the brink of financial collapse , has cut the number of sheriff 's officers from 20 to 13 .
Sometimes no one is available to patrol the 3,200 square miles of mostly forested countryside in Trinity County , where Sheriff Lorrac Craig said drug cartels are running rampant .
The problem was evident earlier this month when 24 agents from a state Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement task force swooped in on a large plantation on a ridge overlooking Hirz Bay on Shasta Lake in the Shasta - Trinity National Forest .
The five plots of marijuana - 15,474 plants in all - were bright green and easily visible from a helicopter .
The caretakers had fled by the time agents arrived , and no arrests were made .
Immigrant labor
Even if the growers had been captured , drug enforcement officers said , it might not have made a difference .
The cartels can afford to sacrifice workers and crops , especially when the penalty usually amounts to nothing more than the deportation of a few low - level laborers - who typically are illegal immigrants .
The growers , who often make less than $ 100 a day , are usually working off debts to " coyotes " who guided them across the border , and they know little or nothing about the overall operation , according to drug enforcement officials .
" We 've had cases where some of the workers are kidnapped and told that if they do n't work , something will happen to their families , " Gregory said .
" A lot of them are n't going to talk because they 've been threatened , and we often have a problem identifying them .
If they are not in the computer system , their fingerprints do n't mean anything . "
Michael Johnson , the statewide commander of the CAMP task force , said often the only way to get to the source of the illegal activity is to allow the crop to be harvested and follow the crop to its delivery point .
" They are making money on this , " said Johnson , gesturing toward the giant mound of high - grade sinsemilla his agents had just pulled off the Shasta - Trinity ridge .
He said the big , purple buds can fetch as much as $ 3,500 a plant .
" The money is being used for other illegal operations , like smuggling guns and methamphetamines , " he said .
Just finding marijuana is often a problem given that helicopters cost a lot of money to fly and are seldom available to sheriff 's officers , who are often responsible for finding and reporting plantations .
The CAMP team seized 92,971 plants in Trinity County last year , a fraction of what they would have gotten if there were enough sheriff 's officers to adequately track down illegal plantations , Craig said .
" We just do n't have the manpower to go out and chase them all down , and they know that , " Craig said .
Similar problems were reported in Lake and Tulare counties , which were the top two pot -growing regions in the state in 2008 .
Shasta County was third .
Trinity was eighth .
Environmental damage
The growers are so brazen that they often return to replant crops in the same plots that were recently raided , authorities said , and they do n't care about the extensive environmental damage they cause by clear - cutting forests , damming up creeks and polluting public land with pesticides and trash .
Legalization is not the solution , Johnson said , given that most of the pot is being grown illegally on public parkland by foreign citizens who can not be taxed .
" I 've been doing this for five years , and there just seems to be more and more of it everywhere , " Johnson said .
" We do n't even bother with medicinal grows .
What we 're concerned about is the destruction of the habitat . "

How To Make Technology Presentations
I 'm a professional software developer and architect for more than two decades .
I have done a lot of talks and presentations during the years .
All the time , there was this tention between business - oriented and engineering - oriented approach to presentations .
The commonly - used presentation techniques are usualy business - oriented .
But that thas not work that well for engineering .
Then there are young engineers that often do not get any format training in presentation techniques at all .
However , they have a lot to say to the community .
It is quite obvious , that they would benefit from a good presentaion guide .
Back in 2002 , I have created a short presentation guide for our local Linux User Group ( SkLUG ) .
The HOWTO was very useful back then .
I was quite surprised to realize , that it is still useful , almost two decades later .
Therefore I have decided to update the guide .
This somehow got out of control and ended up with ( hugely ) expanded version .
The result is " How To Make Technology Presentations " guide .
I hope that this will be useful to a broad technology community .

Kenneth Starr , the lawyer who chased after President Bill Clinton and his wife , said on Thursday that he supports President Barack Obama ’s first Supreme Court nominee , federal appeals court Judge Sonia Sotomayor .
Starr voiced his backing of Sotomayor while delivering the keynote speech at a luncheon held in Los Angeles for Loyola Law School ’s program for journalists who cover legal issues .
He said that he “ thinks very well of her . ”
He noted that he has not written any official endorsement letter for Sotomayor but that no one had asked him to do so — suggesting he would if requested .
Starr said that he has told more than one US senator that he supports her nomination , but he would n’t identify which senators he has spoken to about Sotomayor .
Starr , dean of the Pepperdine University School of Law and a member of the rightwing Federalist Society , is one of the leaders of the conservative legal movement .
A former judge and solicitor general , he served as the independent counsel who probed the Clintons on a number of fronts , most notably Bill Clinton ’s affair with intern Monica Lewinsky .
The long and quite graphic report he produced on the Lewinsky matter led to the Republican ’s divisive and failed impeachment campaign against Clinton .
Since then , Starr has worked on several death penalty cases , trying to overturn death sentences .
He also represented a school board in Alaska sued by a student suspended for unfurling a banner declaring , “ Bong Hits 4 Jesus . ”
He has worked for Blackwater ( now known as Xe ) .
More recently , he represented groups in California defending Proposition 8 , which outlawed gay marriage in that state .
This is n’t the first time Starr has publicly offered support for an Obama nominee under fire from the right .
In April , he wrote a letter to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , urging it to confirm Harold Hongju Koh to be the top legal adviser at the State Department and praising Koh ’s “ irreproachable integrity . ”
Starr has something of a working relationship with Sotomayor .
As he noted during his luncheon talk , she twice came to Pepperdine to participate in a program the school runs for judicial clerks .
“ She was a huge hit with the students , ” Starr said .
Starr has made supportive remarks about Sotomayor earlier .
On May 26 , appearing on Fox News , he noted that she had a “ very fine record . ”
He said :
One of the most characteristics of a Justice is that she be humble , that she be modest in her approach to the Constitution .
He predicted that as a Supreme Court justice Sotomayor would be “ modest , always listening carefully to the lawyers , listening carefully to her colleagues . ”
But he did add that her controversial remark about appeals courts making policy was “ a little troubling . ”
He did not endorse her at that time .
But now he ’s out of the closet as a Sotomayor booster .
How will Rush Limbaugh , Newt Gingrich , and other conservatives who have tried to depict Sotomayor as a race - obsessed liberal activist take this news ?
More important , will Starr ’s endorsement –this is true conservative cover–make it even harder for Senate Republicans to go after her ?

During a visit to Stanford a while back Condi Rice gave us a great peek into the thinking of the Bush admin .
and their ideas about who should be subject to the law .
In this clip of her answering questions posed to her about waterboarding by a Stanford student , she states that " the president instructed us that nothing we would do would be outside of our legal obligations under the conventions against torture , " and then concludes with " and so , if it was authorized by the president , it did not violate our obligations under the conventions against torture . "
This , of course , is essentially a fancy way of saying that if the president says something is legal it is , regardless of what the actual laws ( or Constitution in many cases ) say .
That 's not quite the way it works though .
[ RFC ] non-root X
For Moblin , we 'd like to be able to run X as a non -root user , so with that in mind I spent a few hours looking at what it would take to get X running w/o root perms on the latest bits using the xf86 - video - intel driver ( note Dave did this about a year ago , but I guess the bits did n't make it upstream ) .
Turns out now that all the pieces are in place it was really easy .
X needed root on Linux for a few things : 1 ) I /O probing 2 ) tty / VT probing & ownership 3 ) some DRM ioctls 4 ) some PCI related probing 5 ) input perms
However , with a KMS enabled driver that does n't do I/O access , ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) are n't really necessary anymore .
For ( 3 ) , just a couple of ioctls need to have their " root only " status stripped ( safely I think ) .
And for ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) , distro pam scripts can take care of things ( as long as X is started on a tty that has had its ownership / perms modified appropriately ) .
So this small patch is all that 's necessary on the X side ( the DRM patch is trivial , and half of it has already been posted to dri-devel ) .
It 's a big hackish , so I 'm just requesting comments at this point .
I 'd like to do the - nohwaccess part better , but think doing it well will require a driver ABI change ( maybe just a new flags field that indicates whether the driver needs I / O ports enabled , or we can push the xf86 EnableIO call into drivers as needed ) .
Beyond that , I had to fix a few things in the xf86 - video - intel driver and libpciaccess , but all of those bits are in git master of those repos , so if you want to try things out , it should be pretty easy to pull things together .
Anyone have thoughts on this ?

In the first deep sea drilling expedition designed to gather seismic data , scientists have successfully drilled nearly a mile beneath the ocean floor into one of the world 's most active earthquake zones .
Researchers aboard the drilling vessel Chikyu — meaning " planet Earth " in Japanese — used a special technology called riser drilling to penetrate the upper portion of the Nankai Trough , an earthquake zone located about 36 miles southeast of Japan .
By collecting rock samples and installing long - term monitoring devices , the geologists hope to understand how stress builds up in subduction zones like Nankai , where the Philippine Sea plate is sliding beneath the island of Japan .
Riser drilling involves encasing a deep sea drill in a giant metal tube , called a riser , that extends from the ship down to the drilling site , effectively bolting the ship to the sea floor .
The researchers circulate lightly pressurized mud down through the drilling tube and back up through the riser .
" One of the key benefits is the pressurized mud keeps the wall rock from collapsing on the drilling pipe , which allows you to drill deeper and with better control , " geologist Timothy Byrne of the University of Connecticut wrote in an e-mail .
" For example , nearly perfectly vertical holes or steeply inclined holes can be drilled , " wrote Byrne , who co-led the project .
Using a riser also makes it easier to send core samples and cuttings , or small chips of rock collected during drilling , back up to the surface .
The Nankai Trough last ruptured twice in 1944 and 1946 , generating earthquakes greater than magnitude 8 that shook the region and caused deadly tsunamis .
Since then , the two plates have continued to move , but the boundary between them has been locked , causing pressure to build .
" We know that a locked fault is not a quiet thing , but we do n’t quite understand why , " said geologist Kelin Wang of the Geological Survey of Canada , who was not involved in the research .
" When we understand what is meant by locking , we can understand how energy is building up for the next event . "
The Nankai project is part of an international effort called the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program , designed to investigate a variety of scientific questions through drilling .
The IODP chose to drill for seismic data in Nankai because of the region 's history of recent earthquakes and the accessible location of the rupture zone .
The drilling is not powerful enough to trigger an earthquake .
What is learned in Japan will help scientists understand other earthquake - prone plate boundaries , such as the Cascadia subduction zone , which extends along the Pacific coast from British Columbia to Northern California
" For us in North America , the good news is that the Nankai subduction zone is strikingly similar to ours , " Wang said .
Both zones are hotter and accumulate more sediment than average .
" By studying Nankai , we North Americans can actually benefit pretty directly from the project .
It 's almost as if we are drilling our own subduction zone , because we 'll see a lot of the same things . "
The first drilling and sampling operations in Nankai began on May 12 and are expected to conclude on August 1 .
After the initial drilling stage , scientists lowered various gauges and logging instruments into the hole to measure temperature , stress , water pressure and rock permeability .
Once they gather enough data , the scientists will prepare the hole for future installation of long - term monitoring equipment .

We are shocked , shocked , to read in Gotham Gazette : Unlocking the Apartment ' Warehouse '
[ a homeless advocacy group ] found that 24,000 apartments could come out of the vacant buildings and lots they canvassed .
The report noted that while the count only covered Manhattan , " highly visible clusters of boarded - up buildings in neighborhoods exist throughout the five boroughs . "
Picture the Homeless said that the vacant property could house the entire homeless population of New York City .
The report then goes on to ask why there are so many vacant apartments ?
According to a pro-landlord group :
" the property is tied up in an estate "
" the landlord might think that using the property would not be profitable "
" structural problems with buildings "
" property owners who tired of managing "
Throw in a couple more reasons from the " Housing Not Warehousing Coalition "
" Warehousing today is all about gentrification .
That 's all it's about , " he said .
" If you 're holding on to a building , paying and maintaining the cost of taxes , sitting on an investment you 're not profiting from , it 's for a reason , and it 's because you plan on making more money in the future . "
Making more money in the future : that sounds pretty evil , huh ?.
But wait , government to the rescue :
Councilmember Tony Avella , a Queens Democrat running for mayor , is working on a bill aimed at stopping landlords from keeping vacant property off the market .
How anyone can write an entire article about vacant housing in New York City and not mention rent control , or really any rational explanation for this phenomenon , boggles the mind .
In one of the most crowded and expensive cities in the world why are there empty apartments ?
Are landlords stupid ?
Do they not want to make money ?
That rent controls produce a shortage at the controlled price with reservation demand above the controlled prices is one of the most basic conclusions of economics .
All of the other problems mentioned in the article could be caused by rent control as well .
Property tied up in an estate ?
Most business firms do not shut down when they pass into an estate , they continue to operate .
The executors of the estate could still manage the property for income , like any other business , were there an incentive to do so .
The property is not profitable ?
This might change if it could be rented at a higher price .
Structural problems ?
Capital consumption common in rent - controlled areas because landlords try to cut costs rather than raise prices .
Owners tired of managing ?
Why not hire someone to manage ?
Anecdotally , I know of several instances of off - the - market property in San Francisco where I live and which has rent control .
Owners have told me the reason is that , once you lease a property , you cannot terminate the rental very easily .
This means that you cannot get the property back for your own use if you wish to use it for yourself or family members .
( There are some exceptions to this , it 's complicated ... ) .
I 'm not familiar in detail with the ins and outs of New York rent control .
At one point in time , the rent control was associated with the unit , not the tenant , which provided a incentive for a property owner to with hold units to avoid establishing a controlled rent .
I know that there has been some liberalization over the years , however , Wikipedia links to this New York Times article which states that the state legislature has made the rent control law even more strict .
I got to watch the Parliamentary debate over the first Iraq
War when a friend of mine , a member of the House of Commons , invited me to sit in for the day and then have lunch in the members dining room .
It was an enjoyable and stimulating experience , primarily dominated by Margaret Thatcher .
My friend , though , was a gay Conservative .
Honestly , I can't remember if he was in the closet or out of the closet -- at least politically .
Everyone who knew him certainly knew he was as gay as wrapping paper .
Of course the same could have been said of Mark Foley ( R- FL ) , David Dreier ( R - CA ) and Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) before they were outed .
" Everyone " knows they 're gay -- except the dullards in the Republican base who have n't a clue .
Today GOProud , the Republican Party 's far right - wing version of the mainstream conservative gay Republicans ( the Log Cabin Republicans ) , pointed proudly that the number of openly gay Conservatives in the House of Commons could treble .
Nice that they 're celebrating , but I wonder if they 've ever thought about asking our own conservatives why it 's such a taboo to embrace their sexuality on this side of the pond .
Lindsey Graham and David Dreier still think they 're fooling someone about being straight .
I do n't see GOProud mentioning that South Carolina is on the verge of being the first state in the country with a gay Republican Governor and a gay Republican Lt. Governor , albeit two closeted ones .
Of course not every gay conservative politician is from South Carolina -- even if they do have the most per square mile .
Is GOProud proud of Adam Schock ( R- IL ) ?
Patrick McHenry ( R - NC ) ?
Adrian Smith ( R- NE ) ?
Dana Rohrabacher ( R - CA ) ?
Mitch McConnell ( R - KY ) ?
Or are they spending all their time cheering the Brits -- and violent and vicious Utah homophobe and anti-gay crusader rabbit , Jason Chaffetz ?
GOProud members , if there are any , could do worse than reading Sarah Hepola 's Gay Men Go To Hell , an interview withauthor James Hannaham about " religious repression , life in the closet and sex in the bathroom , " at today 's Salon .
And while they 're over at Salon , an even more direct must - read , Behind Washington 's Closet Door which traces political closet queenery from American Conservative Union chairman Bob Baumann ( R - MD ) -- who was arrested for soliciting sex from a 16 year old boy while serving in Congress -- to more recently outed gay Republicans like Jim Kolbe ( R - AZ ) , Larry Craig ( R - ID ) , Jim McCrery ( R- LA ) and Charlie Crist ( R - FL ) is also available .
Let 's celebrate all the out conservatives in the British Parliament after David Dreier , Charlie Crist , Lindsey Graham and Patrick McHenry say " So what ; there 's nothing wrong with it -- and I 'm terribly sorry for all the pain I caused gay families with my viciously homophobic votes in the past .
I 'll make up for it in the future . "

THE tiny village of Bongha , in south - eastern Korea , is surrounded by rice - paddies and steep woods .
After 2008 , however , its biggest attraction was Roh Moo-hyun , the former president .
It is not every day a son of Bongha peasants ends up in the Blue House in Seoul .
As Mr Roh in retirement rode his bicycle round the streets , crowds of tourists would run after him .
As he stood smoking familiarly at his garden gate , visitors would clamour for a photograph .
People who had never much cared for him as president — too quick to take and cause offence , too keen to raise a convivial glass with North Korea 's weird and inscrutable Kim Jong Il — signed on to the website Roh Sa Mo ( “ We Love Roh ” ) , and joined a nationwide fan club .
Mr Roh was an anti-corruption president .
In South Korea , that is saying something .
The two sons of Kim Dae- jung , the country 's most famous modern leader , were imprisoned for graft .
Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae - woo , both former presidents , went to jail for soliciting hundreds of millions of dollars from the country 's biggest business groups .
Mr Roh , a son of the soil who had taught himself well enough to get through South Korea 's ferocious bar exams , was thought to be different .
When he came into office he was candid , moral and refreshing .
And when he left , going back to unassuming Bongha , he enhanced his reputation as a man of the people who , though he governed in turmoil and controversy , was at least clean .
He campaigned for virtuous causes all his life , beginning in 1981 with his defence of students arrested and tortured by the Chun regime for possessing banned literature .
When he saw “ their horrified eyes and their missing toenails ” , he said later , his comfortable lawyer 's life was over .
In the mid-1980s he abandoned law for politics , fiercely denouncing graft during televised hearings in the National Assembly .
He did not always win popularity , or re-election .
But he caught the attention of Kim Dae-jung , organised Mr Kim 's successful run for president in 1997 and surprised perhaps even himself by squeaking into the presidency five years later .
His term was tumultuous .
Businessmen hated him , remembering his support for striking workers in the “ June Struggle ” against Chun in the late 1980s , and seeing him as a leftist maverick intent on redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor through higher taxes .
Established bureaucrats and politicians despised the youthful , callow fellow - protesters he brought in with him .
Several cherished proposals , including one to institute more checks on the president , went nowhere .
At one point Mr Roh was impeached for a minor breach of election rules .
But he was not convicted .
The Americans were gravely disturbed to see him improving links with Pyongyang , striding keen as mustard down the fluorescent pink carpet towards the potbellied little tyrant in his zipped - up uniform .
Korean troops for Iraq , and a free - trade accord with the United States in 2007 , did little to soothe suspicions that he was anti-American .
When Mr Roh and George Bush met in Washington , their body language loudly betrayed how mutually ill at ease they were .
The shoemaker 's bribes
Yet Mr Roh was also ill at ease with himself .
He had plastic surgery round his eyes , complaining that his eyelashes were poking his eyeballs .
Koreans assumed he wanted to improve his looks .
He never managed diplomatic small - talk , tended to say the wrong thing , and packed his own instant noodles for state trips abroad .
He radiated scorn for those who , unlike himself , had been to university .
“ Stone bean ” , as his family called him , the tough , poor youngest son , had risen past all of them without it .
While they had been at Seoul National University , or Oxford , or Harvard , he had been pouring cement and mending nets .
Yet he admitted early in his term that he felt “ incompetent ” .
The burden of office weighed heavy .
Behind the scenes , too , the pure president was caving in to the allurements of his job .
Bribes were offered by a wealthy sports - shoe manufacturer in Pusan , which Mr Roh had represented .
It was alleged that Mr Roh 's wife , his childhood sweetheart , had taken $ 1 m , and his son - in - law $ 5 m .
After he left office , the police said they wished to question him .
Mr Roh denied that anything untoward had happened .
In April , however , he used his blog to make a statement headed “ I Apologise ” .
Mr Roh said his “ household ” had received the money to help settle a debt .
“ I feel ashamed before my fellow citizens , ” said Mr Roh .
“ I am sorry for having disappointed you . ”
He had not been such a bad president as far as foreign policy or the economy went .
But those efforts suddenly counted for nothing .
On May 23rd he went hiking , as he often did , in the hills above Bongha at dawn .
Earlier in the spring fire had swept through the new green woods , blackening them .
Before he left the house , and before he jumped from a high cliff into a ravine , he had left a note to his family on his computer .
He said he had “ made the life of too many people difficult ” .
But “ Do n't be too sad .
Is n't life and death all part of nature ?
Do n't be sorry .
Do n't blame anybody .
It 's fate .
Please cremate me .
And please leave a small tombstone near home .
I 've long thought about that . ”
SAN ANTONIO , Texas — Through Department of Homeland Security contacts ,
Texas journalist Todd Bensman arranged in November 2008 to interview a former Mexican special forces soldier who went AWOL and joined the Gulf Cartel 's notoriously brutal The Zetas enforcement gang .
The Zetas are responsible for thousands of murders and for operating houses of torture all along the Mexican side of the Texas border .
The cartel foot soldier had left the organization several years prior to the interview , and had become a cooperating witness for the U.S. government in the upcoming trial of extradited Gulf Cartel leader Osiel Cardenas Guillen in Houston .
The former gunman was produced for Bensman to interview on strict condition that his name and other revealing details not be publicly disclosed , for his protection .
Bensman questioned the Zeta about how his gang procured American weapons .
How long were you in the military ?
Seven years .
Then in the cartel , what was your job ?
What did you do ?
Basically , I was a hitman .
Your job was to do what ?
Bodyguard and things like that .
Kill people , kidnap , all kind of stuff like that .
That 's an interesting change from the military .
Yeah .
It 's almost the same , but without permission .
What does it pay ?
How much did you make ?
About $ 500 per week .
You would be an expert from your military training .
Were you ever involved in the procurement of weapons ?
Not directly , but I saw little things of how they introduced the weapons in the country , into Mexico .
How did it work ?
The same person that works for the organization here in the United States , they get the weapons and they carry them to Mexico ...
They never had any problems to cross them into Mexico at the border .
Sometimes they use secret compartments to hide the weapons , but not all the time .
The principal way was crossing the river or by the international bridges .
Who would buy the weapons ?
I 'm not sure about that because I never was there .
But the same people that work for the organization here in the U.S. , I do n't know how to explain in English , they have to be U.S. citizens to buy the weapons .
They get some people to buy the weapons , every kind of them , and then pay them for it ... .
The people who was working here in U.S. selling the drugs , they were the same that get the weapons .
It was people who was working directly for my boss , so he said " do n't bring me money , bring me weapons . "
What kinds of weapons did you have , did you carry ?
When I was in the organization , we asked for them to bring weapons like Heckler and Koch , MP5 , and M - 16 or something like that , AR - 15 , but the most we wanted Heckler and Koch and Colt AR - 15 ' cuz they were the better weapons .
We knew about weapons , so we ask them for the best weapons we could use for that work .
Who would you ask ?
The leader of the escort .
He was a nearby person , close person .
We ask them to bring us Barrett rifles , .50 caliber , ' cuz we have them in the military , so we knew about them .
Grenades and all kinds of stuff .
You knew how to use the weapons ?
Actually , the escort leader , he had been a sniper in the army , in the military , so he knew exactly what he wants .
When you would receive an AR - 15 , would you convert it to automatic ?
Sometimes , yeah .
There was a person in Mexico that could do that change .
Just adding a little piece of metal .
In Spanish is the safety thing .
Do n't know it in English .
So you always had American weapons ?
Yeah , actually , the MP5s we got were made in Germany , but they brought them from the U.S .
Always automatic ?
Yes sir .
What do you do now ?
Manual job .
I 'm a craftsman or something like that .
How long did you work for the organization ?
Three years .
When you received these weapons , did you take away the serial numbers ?
No sir .
It is n't necessary ...
Most of the times , the local authorities , the state police or the municipal police , they protect us all the time , so we do n't need to erase nothing .
We do n't cover the parts or nothing .
Did you keep your weapon , the same one , all the time , or was there a central warehouse , where were these weapons kept ?
When we were in service , because we had days off too , we kept the weapons all the time with us .
But when we were tourists , there were safety houses , each small group have their own safety houses to keep the weapons and vehicles and every kind of stuff .
So before you go to the home , you have to pass through the safety house , leave all your equipment , weapons and everything , and then you go to the home .
It 's interesting to me because there was a ban on these kind of guns , you could n't buy these guns very easily , how did you get these assault weapons ?
I do n't have no idea .
Where did you get the military weapons ?
We received hand grenades all the time .
From the U.S. , we do n't know where they came from .
One time we got some oldie machine guns , this one with three - foot stand , it was brought .
There were two of them .
They were Browning , I guess .
Caliber 7.62 .
And some grenade launchers , Just the grenade launcher , that you can put on the guard - hand to the rifle .
That kind of grenade launcher .
How did you get ammunition ?
When we need some ammo , just cross somebody who can come here to the United States legally .
They would go to the store and buy some ammo .
Whatever the caliber because you do n't need an ID or be a citizen or resident or nothing .
How much ammunition did you see ?
Buckets filled with it .
You could enter into the safety houses and see buckets full of ammunition .
So you could go and see whatever caliber do I need and take your own ammunition , magazines and everything .
There 's no restriction for buying .
There were n't , but I do n't know if there is already .
What did you use these weapons for ?
Oh , ( to ) kill people , or hurt people .
Use them as a tool for kidnap and for escort drugs .
After you hurt or killed somebody , did you keep the weapons or throw them ?
Yes sir .
The same gun to kill persons in different events .
If you are caught with the weapons , they never noted that the weapon was used in so many crimes .
They do n't do the investigation , how do you say the CSI things , tests for the weapons to match the crimes .
They do n't do that in Mexico , so it was no problem to keep the same weapon .
How many people in your group ?
In my escort group , about 40 persons .
Was everybody armed better than the local police or the military ?
Yeah , but a lot of , for the first thing , we got uniforms .
The local police did n't have uniforms .
Many times , they could n't afford them .
We had better vehicles .
Better radio communications , and much better weapons because we had automatic and the same weapons and we had ammo in it .
Sometimes we cuff some cops and take their weapons and they do n't have ammo .
I remember one time we took a pistol from a guy who tried to stop us , so when we take the weapon , I show it to my boss and I told him , he has no ammo and he tried to stop us .
What is he thinking about ?
The most times , we were better armed than the local police .
Not the army , just the local police .
Why is all this happening , all this shooting and killing , decapitations ?
It 's a big war .
Many organizations started war in two or three different fronts at the same time , so they are making alliances with another group who has money to get weapons and to get supplies for keep the war .
I mean there are groups who has the training because all the members are military , but there are groups that have the money because they are working more often with drugs here to the U.S. so they are receiving more money .
These groups are working together to fight their enemies .
Why not just stay in the military ?
I told you , I had a problem in the military , so I left the military .
About a couple of months then I met him and he offered me the work ... .
It was a legal problem .
I was working on a special commission and I had a legal problem over there .
Were there a lot of military people like you who were going to the cartel ?
Yeah .
What were their reasons ?
Many reasons .
Some for the money .
Some for they have nothing to do ... .
As your work , you know a lot of people .
As you go to one part , you say , I know this guy and I know this guy .
And that guy knows another two .
It 's a long chain .
And they only paid you $ 500 a week ?
That 's a lot of money to you ?
It was n't too much for me , but it was enough in that moment .
When I started to work for him .
Then some of us got a raise $ 1,000 per week .
Did you ever get bonuses ?
Sometimes , yeah .
What were your favorite weapons you always got in America ?
M - 16 , AR - 15 and HK .
How were they kept or stored ?
We get them in safety houses .
We have a little storage for the weapons .
They were not a main storage , but each group had their own safehouse .
There were a lot of little storage of weapons around the cities where we were working at .
The same way the ammo .
You could find buckets full of ammo , divided by calibers .
For rifles or for hand weapons .
They never told you to go easy on ammunition ?
No , ' cuz it 's a tool for that work .
You ca n't limit the use of that ' cuz it 's a tool .
It 's a tool for the job .
You were always more powerful ?
The police in most of the cities of Mexico are bad armed , so we had better power of fire than them .

Kevin Guise from the Police Dog and Mounted Section laid flowers at the site Flowers have been laid at a special memorial site at Nottingham Police Headquarters for two German Shepherd police dogs found dead in a hot car .
The animals were found dead in the private vehicle outside the Nottingham headquarters on Tuesday , one of the hottest days of the year .
Police and members of the public have left tributes at the scene .
An RSPCA investigation has begun and an independent vet will carry out a post - mortem examination .
The force has so far declined to release any further information about the dogs or the vehicle they were in , but says lessons will be learnt .
The Met Office said it reached 28.1C ( 82.5 F ) in Nottingham on Tuesday .
Ch Supt Ak Khan said everyone on the force 's Dog Section had been devastated by the incident .
' Absolutely devastated ' " We will certainly take any lessons we can get from this process and make sure we put them in place so this sort of thing never happens again , " he said .
" There is a sense of shock and sadness at the news of the death of two of our police dogs and we understand the upset that this has caused the public and members of our staff .
" The bond and the love between the trainers , handlers and the dogs is absolutely outstanding .
The dog unit and the individual concerned are absolutely devastated by what has happened and we can only imagine what they are going through after losing two of their own . "
Earlier , Assistant Chief Constable , Peter Davies , confirmed the RSPCA was helping the force investigate the death of the dogs .

" This is a tragic incident and we value the important work our police dogs carry out on a daily basis , " he said .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission was also informed by the force about the deaths .
" We have decided it is appropriate for this sad incident to be returned to the police force to carry out its own local investigation , " it said in a statement .
An RSPCA spokesman said the force reported the incident to them on Tuesday and was " co-operating " with the charity in the investigation .
Public appeal " I am sure this is n't the first incident and it wo n't be the last , " he added .
Nottinghamshire Police Authority chairman John Clarke said : " I am deeply disturbed to learn of the deaths of these police dogs , which play such a vital role in the fight against crime .
" We are requiring a guarantee from the force that measures are being put in place immediately to ensure that an incident like this can never happen again . "
In June last year the Nottinghamshire force made a public appeal for German shepherd dogs to be donated to increase the number of working dogs in the force .
Training a police dog to the standard where it can go out with an officer on patrol costs an estimated £ 7,000 and involves a nine - week intensive course .
The maximum sentence for causing unnecessary suffering to an animal is six months in prison and a £ 20,000 fine .

NY Attorney General Andrew Cuomo released his report on bonuses at the TARP Top 9 .
At these firms alone , over 800 people made north of $ 3 million in 2008 .
That ’s a lot of scharole .
See Appendix B for the bonus breakdown at each bank .
The key info is in one particular table , however :
( Click to enlarge in new window )
The columns to the right list the number of employees that received bonuses in excess of $ 3 mil / $ 2 mil / $ 1 mil .
Banks that are still sitting on their TARP money ( Citi , BofA , Wells among them ) have no business paying out big bonuses before paying back the government .
For that matter , neither do the others , who all continue to benefit from FDIC guarantees on debt and Fed lending facilities through which they ’ve traded toxic loans in exchange for perfectly liquid Treasuries .
They can use the Treasuries for repo collateral , get cash and then put that on deposit at the Fed where they now get paid interest on their excess reserves .
It ’s a great scam .
One that feeds lots of cash into the 2009 bonus pool .

A lot of folks tend to honor the Osborne 1 as the world 's first mass - produced portable computer .
The machine was admittedly an early pioneer in totable systems in 1981 , but another , much - earlier computer perhaps really deserves the credit .
Some 20 years before the Osborne 's release , the American government was already rocking a line of cutting - edge portable computers that — had they only been more widely released — would have melted any tech lover 's heart .
And their face .
And probably most everything within a mile radius .
We 're speaking , of course , of the first - ever guidance system baked into the US Minuteman 1 nuclear missile .
Maximum portability : about 9,700 km ( 6,000 mi ) .
Target demographic : Commies .
On October 4 , 1957 , the Soviet Union successfully launched the world 's first artificial satellite into orbit .
Sputnik 's celestial beeps gave voice to America 's worst Cold War fears , but the true cause for concern was the rocket the machine rode in on .
Sputnik 's SS - 6 rocket demonstrated that the Soviets had a launcher capable of hitting a target from thousands of miles away .
A few years earlier , the government had detonated its first H - bomb .
Add two and two together , and you get four horsemen of the apocalypse taking an American vacation .
Arise the threat of a US " missile gap . "
America promptly decided to dial its languishing ballistic missile program to eleven .
They had called first dibs on the annihilation of humanity , after all .
You see , during this leg of the Cold War , the US was running under a doctrine of " massive retaliation " against a potential Soviet strike .
Any attack on US soil meant all the chips were on the table .
But all - out nuclear war , as it happens , has a few major drawbacks — the aforementioned face melting for example , but that 's only a concern for sissies .
The real issue at hand was engineering .
Atomic explosions in the atmosphere can disrupt radio communications .
Missiles at the time were controlled by ground - based computers , so huge amounts of radio interference made America 's ability to direct a second volley of fission sandwiches unreasonably hard .
And on the other side of such an exchange , not being able to control your rockets can make mutual assured destruction up to 50 per cent less mutual .
What 's the fun in that ?
The solution developed was to put a digital guidance computer right dab on the missile .
( Somewhere in the multiverse , Skynet cackles maliciously in anticipation ) .
Easier said than done at the time , as a computer with dimensions less than that of a family sedan was considered slim and chic .
The Iranian authorities hated Persepolis .
While it charmed western film critics , audiences and the Cannes film festival jury , one of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's advisers said the distinctive black and white cartoon " presented an unrealistic picture of the achievements of the glorious Islamic revolution " .
Ahmadinejad and his cronies will probably be even more infuriated by the update to the cartoon : Persepolis 2.0 .
The latest version depicts the excitement surrounding the June 12 election , outrage at the result , street protests , the role of Twitter in the unrest , and the death of Neda Agha Soltan .
The new cartoon was the initiative of two Iranian exiles called Sina and Payman , who have put together a website called Spread Persepolis to promote the project .
It was made with permission of the publishers of Marjane Satrapi 's original cartoon on which the film was based .
Sina said the updated cartoon was intended to show how history was repeating itself in Iran .
" The reaction to Persepolis 2.0 has been great , " he wrote in an email .
" We 've had visitors from 120 countries thus far , and a large volume of emails from people asking how they can help support Iranians .
" This has really infused us with energy , and we 're now working on additional ways to help get the word out . "
He added : " I 've read some comments online from people angry that we ' ruined ' Satrapi 's work or unhappy with the poor quality of the copy .
Their opinions are valid , but our point was just to get people to discuss Iran so that it did n't slip back into collective obscurity .
" Her cartoon are about her life but to my generation of Iranians ( at least in the West ) they have become more than that , they have become iconic .
The fact that images from 30 years ago can tell a story about what is happening now makes them all the more powerful .
" Unlike her original work , Persepolis 2.0 is filled with flaws and inaccuracies , but the bottom line is that it has helped spark hundreds of conversations and that 's more than we could have expected . "
The Sky May Be Falling , But We Can Fix It
June 8th , 2009 by Jeff Kart
When it comes to environmental news , doom and gloom often rules the day .
And it ’s easy to get discouraged .
But scientists from Yale University say most polluted ecosystems can recover in as little as 5 or 10 years .
The study means it ’s not too late to turn things around if societies commit to cleanup , restoration and sustainability , according to Yale ’s analysis of 240 independent studies .
The findings appear in this month ’s issue of the peer - reviewed journal PLoS ONE .
Researchers from the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies found that forests took 42 years on average to recover , ocean bottoms recovered in less than 10 years and ecosystems affected by stresses like invasive species bounced back in as little as five years .
Human - induced disturbances took longer to shake off than natural events .
“ The damages to these ecosystems are pretty serious , ” Oswald Schmitz , a co-author , said in a statement from Yale .
“ But the message is that if societies choose to become sustainable , ecosystems will recover .
It is n’t hopeless . ”
This analysis is pretty timely , with a recent proposal by the Obama administration to spend $ 475 million to help restore the Great Lakes , and the recent appointment of Cameron Davis , leader of an advocacy group called the Alliance for the Great Lakes , as the person to carry out the project .

Advertisement Groups of ethnic
Han Chinese have marched through the city of Urumqi carrying clubs and machetes , as tension grows between ethnic groups and police .
Security forces imposed a curfew and fired tear gas to disperse the crowds , who said they were angry at violence carried out by ethnic Muslim Uighurs .
Earlier , Uighur women had rallied against the arrest of more than 1,400 people over deadly clashes on Sunday .
The two sides blame each other for the outbreak of violence .
AT THE SCENE Quentin Sommerville , Urumqi
There are many armed military police standing around , also a few remnants of those Han Chinese demonstrators , still people wandering around the city carrying poles and batons and some carrying knives .
There 's a great air of trepidation here as to how this night will play out .
I would n't have thought today that I would have seen Uighur men and women acting so defiantly in the face of Han Chinese authority , but they did .
I would n't have thought that thousands of Han Chinese would be able to walk freely through a Chinese city and march and shout slogans .
Xinjiang is one of the most tightly - controlled parts of the country .
Those controls seem to have slipped quite considerably .
Accounts of Xinjiang violence
In pictures : Protests Protest not unusual in China Officials say 156 people - mostly ethnic Han Chinese - died in Sunday 's violence .
Uighur groups say many more have died , claiming 90 % of the dead were Uighurs .
The unrest erupted when Uighur protesters attacked vehicles before turning on local Han Chinese and battling security forces in Urumqi , the capital of Xinjiang province .
Map showing protest area in Urumqi
They had initially been protesting over a brawl between Uighurs and Han Chinese several weeks earlier in a toy factory thousands of miles away in Guangdong province .
On Tuesday about 200 Uighurs - mostly women - faced off against riot police to appeal for more than 1,400 people arrested over Sunday 's violence to be freed .
' Heart - breaking ' violence Later hundreds of Han Chinese marched through the streets of Urumqi smashing shops and stalls belonging to Uighurs .
The BBC's Quentin Sommerville , in Urumqi , says some of the protesters were shouting " down with Uighurs " as they rampaged through the streets armed with homemade weapons .
UIGHURS AND XINJIANG Xinjiang population is 45 % Uighur , 40 % Han Chinese Uighurs are ethnically Turkic Muslims China re-established control in 1949 after crushing short - lived state of East Turkestan Since then , large - scale immigration of Han Chinese Sporadic violence since 1991 Attack on 4 Aug 2008 near Kashgar kills 16 Chinese policemen
Q&A : China and the Uighurs China tells its own story Police attempted to block access to the bazaar and other Uighur districts of the city and fired tear gas as the Han Chinese confronted groups of Uighurs .
One protester , clutching a metal bar , told the AFP news agency : " The Uighurs came to our area to smash things , now we are going to their area to beat them . "
Urumqi's mayor , Jierla Yishamudin , said a " life and death " struggle was being waged to maintain China 's unity .
" It is neither an ethnic issue nor a religious issue , but a battle of life and death to defend the unification of our motherland and to maintain the consolidation of all ethnic groups , a political battle that 's fierce and of blood and fire , " he told a news conference .
One official described Sunday 's unrest as the " deadliest riot since New China was founded in 1949 " .
Xinjiang 's Communist Party chief Wang Lequan announced during a televised address that a curfew would run from 2100 until 0800 .
State - run news agency Xinhua quoted him as saying any ethnic violence was " heart - breaking " and blaming " hostile forces both at home and abroad " for the trouble .
China 's authorities have repeatedly claimed that exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer is stirring up trouble in the region .
But she told the BBC she was not responsible for any of the violence .
" Last time during the Tibet riots , [ the Chinese government ] blamed the Dalai Lama , and now with the Xinjiang riot , they are blaming me , " she said .
" I will never damage the relationship between two communities and will never damage the relationship between people .
For me , all human beings are equal . "

MINNEAPOLIS ( Reuters ) - Democrat Al Franken , a satirist turned politician , was declared the winner of a Senate seat in Minnesota on Tuesday , clearing the way for President Barack Obama ’s party to secure a critical 60 - seat majority in the Senate .
Democrat Al Franken ( R ) is pictured speaking to reporters outside his home in Minneapolis , as former Senator Norm Coleman meets with the media at his home in St. Paul , in a combination image , June 30 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Eric Miller- R/Andy King-L
Ending one of the longest Senate races ever , the Minnesota Supreme Court unanimously rejected each of Republican Norm Coleman ’s five legal arguments that an earlier recount of the November 4 vote had been unfair .
Coleman quickly conceded .
Franken will become the 58th Senate Democrat , the most the party has had since 1981 .
Two independents routinely vote with the Democrats , giving the party the 60 votes needed to clear Republican procedural hurdles known as filibusters .
However , the party has traditionally had trouble ensuring all its members vote the same way .
They will also need to rely on Arlen Specter , a former Republican from Pennsylvania who switched parties in April who has said he will vote his own way and not necessarily along party lines .
“ A lot is being made of me being the 60th member of the Democratic caucus .
That ’s not how I see it , ” Franken said .
“ I ’m going to Washington to be the second senator from Minnesota . ”
The Minnesota court , in its 32 - page ruling , said Coleman had failed to show there was anything wrong with the standards used to reject absentee ballots that he wanted counted .
“ I thought we had a better case , but the court has spoken , ” Coleman said outside his St. Paul , Minnesota , home .
“ I ’ll abide by the results .
There will be no further litigation . ”
Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty said in a statement he would sign the election certificate immediately , allowing Franken , a former writer and actor for the popular Saturday Night Live television show , to join the Senate , likely next week .
After creating such characters as sad - sack self - help guru Stuart Smalley on Saturday Night Live , Franken agitated against conservatives on his nationally syndicated radio show and in a series of books that included “ Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them : A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right . ”
As a campaigner , however , he maintained serious demeanor , and said he will focus on issues such as health care reform , education and energy policy .
“ I really will be catching up , ” he acknowledged .
“ I ’ll hit the ground , if not running , trotting . ”
“ I ’m just glad it ’s over .
Enough taxpayer money has been spent , ” said Joseph Grevious , 30 , a neighbor of Franken ’s who joined the crowd outside the senator - elect ’s condominium .
Both Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid extended a hand to the 58 - year - old Franken , who had never run for public office and grew up in Minnesota .
“ The Senate looks forward to welcoming Senator - elect Franken as soon as possible , ” Reid said .
SEE -SAW RACE
Minnesota ’s vote count was the subject of recounts and legal battles .
Coleman , seeking a second term , held a razor - thin 206 - vote lead in initial results after the November 4 election .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
But the close vote triggered an automatic recount of the 2.4 million ballots cast for the two men , and Franken edged to a 225 - vote lead .
That was challenged by Coleman and a judicial panel agreed to add only a few hundred previously rejected absentee ballots .
That tally expanded Franken ’s lead to 312 .
Pawlenty , considered a possible presidential contender in 2012 , previously announced he would not run for governor again next year , which clears an avenue for Coleman to run for the post .
“ That ’s a decision for another day , ” Coleman said .
The last time either party had a filibuster - proof 60 senators was 1979 when Democrats held 61 and Democratic Jimmy Carter was president .
Democrats also control the House of Representatives , 256 to 178 with one vacancy .
There is no guarantee Senate Democrats would all fall in line to pass Obama ’s top initiatives , and the Democratic president knows it .
“ I am under no illusions that suddenly I ’m going to have a rubber - stamp Senate , ” Obama said in April after Specter switched parties .
The Franken - Coleman duel was the longest contested Senate election since a 1974 New Hampshire race , which was voided 10 months later due to voting irregularities , according to the Senate historian ’s office .
American streetcar manufacturer Oregon Iron Works turned to European company Skoda to get ideas for its new 10 T3 Streetcar Prototype , which will be open to the public this summer .
Photo by United Streetcar .
Yesterday , U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood made his appearance at the formal unveiling of an American - made streetcar — the first to be manufactured in the United States in nearly 60 years .
United Streetcar , a subsidiary of Oregon Iron Works , developed the light rail vehicle at a local factory in compliance with the Federal Transit Administration ’s “ Buy America ” requirement that any vehicle purchased with federal funds has at least a 60 percent domestic content and undergoes final assembly in the United States .
According to Rail magazine , United Streetcar ’s vehicle contains 70 percent domestic content .
( Read more about the history of modern streetcars in America here . )
United Streetcar President Chandra Brown said , “ We see a market for this modern streetcar , as more and more cities look to fight congestion and have rail play a role in local economic development . ”
As Portland attempts to reinvigorate the urban transit industry in Oregon , I ’m reminded of another idea about “ how to fix the world , ” proposed in The Atlantic : “ Train Detroit “ :
The city that was once part of FDR ’s “ Arsenal of Democracy , ” for its part in retooling auto plants to make World War II tanks and bombers , has easily a dozen empty auto plants that could be making train engines and train cars .
Of course , railroads helping to rescue Detroit would be sweet irony .
It was General Motors , after all — in cahoots with a number of other companies — that set out to cripple mass transit in America , including the electric streetcars that once trundled through Detroit and Flint .
Sec. LaHood seems to think it ’d be an easy idea .
“ Take what you ’ve down here in Portland and try to replicate it around America , ” he said , according to The Oregonian .
“ It ’s not that complicated . ”
But are streetcars a waste of money ?
According to KATU.com :
The City of Portland spends $ 3 million a year operating streetcars and is planning to pay about $ 15 million for five more streetcars that will service the new eastside streetcar line .
It ’s a money losing venture but planners say urban development makes up for it a hundred times over .
As far as TheCity Fix is concerned , the more transit options , the better .
In the words of Brookings Institution Senior Fellow Robert Puentes : “ You can waste a lot of money on a stupid transit project if you do n’t think it through , but if it ’s done correctly , it can be transformative .
It ’s mostly about driving development and revitalizing commercial corridors and providing options for travel . ”

Despite her enduring popularity with the GOP base , “ Republicans facing tough elections in 2010 do n’t want Sarah Palin campaigning with them , ” said Molly K. Hooper in The Hill .
To gain seats , the GOP has to win in districts that President Obama took in 2008 .
Well , Obama is a “ frequent target of Palin ’s criticism , ” and her “ help ” in these areas would likely fire up Democrats more than it would GOP voters .
She can help , they say , “ by staying home in Wasilla . ”
“ Typical Republicowards , ” said Dan Riehl in Riehl World View .
Not all Republicans in Congress are “ Scaredy - crats , ” of course — Chuck Grassley and Roy Blunt are “ principled ” enough conservatives to welcome Palin ’s help — but it ’s time to clear the party of the “ weak - kneed , big government Republicrats ” who would shun Palin .
What the Republican Party needs is “ conservative leaders who know how to think , ” said Peggy Noonan in The Wall Street Journal , and that emphatically excludes Palin .
If her GOP apologists keep believing their serial “ Palin myths ” — that the “ elites ” hate her , the “ media did her in , ” her poor treatment is due to her social class , she can learn how to think —
Republicans should n’t be treated as “ a grown - up , responsible party , a party that deserves to lead . ”
Who else do the Republicans have ?
said David Frum in The Week .
Palin should be out of the running , because Americans " adore ” but do n’t vote for “ irresponsible , flashy celebrities . ”
But Republicans “ rarely reach into their second tier for national leadership ” — sorry Bobby Jindal and Tim Pawlenty — and they tend to favor orderly succession .
That pretty much leaves 2008 runner - up Mitt Romney .
Do n’t be so quick to dismiss Palin , said Jay Newton - Small in Time .
While she ’s lost ground with Democrats and independents since her surprise resignation , it ’s “ actually given her a bump amongst GOP voters . ”
And Republican primary voters are the only people she has to please for 2012 .

Soldier testimonies appear to contradict official Israeli statements A group of soldiers who took part in Israel 's assault in Gaza say widespread abuses were committed against civilians under " permissive " rules of engagement .
The troops said they had been urged to fire on any building or person that seemed suspicious and said Palestinians were sometimes used as human shields .
Breaking the Silence , a campaign group made up of Israeli soldiers , gathered anonymous accounts from 26 soldiers .
Israel denies breaking the laws of war and dismissed the report as hearsay .
The report says testimonies show " the massive and unprecedented blow to the infrastructure and civilians " was a result of Israeli military policy , articulated by the rules of engagement , and encouraged by a belief " the reality of war requires them to shoot and not to ask questions " .
One soldier is quoted saying : " The soldiers were made to understand that their lives were the most important , and that there was no way our soldiers would get killed for the sake of leaving civilians the benefit of the doubt . "
From Paul Wood , BBC Middle East correspondent : Until now , Israel always had a ready answer to allegations of war crimes in Gaza .
Claims were , they said , Palestinian propaganda .
Now the accusations of abuse are being made by Israeli soldiers .
The common thread in the testimonies is that orders were given to prevent Israeli casualties whatever the cost in Palestinian lives .
The Israeli military says past allegations of wrong - doing in Gaza were the result of soldiers recycling rumours .
But Breaking the Silence has a long - and to many , credible - record in getting soldiers to talk about experiences which might not reflect well on the army .
Breaking silence on abuses
Another says : " People were not instructed to shoot at everyone they see , but they were told that from a certain distance when they approach a house , no matter who it is - even an old woman - take them down . "
Many of the testimonies are in line with claims made by human rights organisations that Israeli military action in Gaza was indiscriminate and disproportionate .
Amnesty International has accused both Israel and Hamas , the Palestinian militant group in charge in Gaza , of committing war crimes during the 22 - day conflict which ended on 18 January .
Israeli officials insist troops went to great lengths to protect civilians , that Hamas endangered non-combatants by firing from civilian areas and that homes and buildings were destroyed only when there was a specific military need to do so .
' Ill discipline '
Other allegations in the testimonies of the 14 conscripts and 12 reserve soldiers include : • Civilians were used as human shields , entering buildings ahead of soldiers
You can't identify too much at night and anything that moves you engage in order not to take risks .
It was not defined this way officially , but it was obvious
Anonymous Israeli soldier
Israel soldiers on Gaza : Excerpts •
Large swathes of homes and buildings were demolished as a precaution or to secure clear lines of fire for the future .
•
Some of the troops had a generally aggressive , ill - disciplined attitude •
There was incidents of vandalism of property of Palestinians • Soldiers fired at water tanks because they were bored , at a time of severe water shortages for Gazans •
White phosphorus was used in civilian areas in a way some soldiers saw as gratuitous and reckless •
Many of the soldiers said there had been very little direct engagement with Palestinian militants .

The report says Israeli troops and the people who justify their actions are " slid[ing ] together down the moral slippery slope " .
" This is an urgent call to Israeli society and its leaders to sober up and investigate anew the results of our actions , " Breaking the Silence says .
Israel said the purpose of Operation Cast Lead had been to end rocket fire from Gaza aimed at its southern towns .
Palestinian rights groups say about 1,400 Palestinians died during the operation .
Thirteen Israelis died in the conflict , including 10 soldiers serving in Gaza .
According to the UN , the campaign damaged or destroyed more than 50,000 homes , 800 industrial properties , 200 schools , 39 mosques and two churches .
Investigations Reacting to the report , Israeli military spokeswoman Lt Col Avital Leibovich said : Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The IDF [ Israel Defence Forces ] regrets the fact that another human rights organisation has come out with a report based on anonymous and general testimony - without investigating their credibility . "
She dismissed the document as " hearsay and word of mouth " .
" The IDF expects every soldier to turn to the appropriate authorities with any allegation , " Lt Col Leibovich added .
" This is even more important where the harm is to non-combatants .
The IDF has uncompromising ethical values which continue to guide us in every mission . "
There have been several investigations into the conduct of Israel 's operation in Gaza , and both Israel and Hamas , the Palestinian militant group that runs the territory , have faced accusations of war crimes .
An internal investigations by the Israeli military said troops fought lawfully , although errors did take place , such as the deaths of 21 people in a house that had been wrongly targeted .
A fact - finding team commissioned by the Arab League concluded there was enough evidence to prosecute the Israeli military for war crimes and crimes against humanity , and that " the Israeli political leadership was also responsible for such crimes " .
It also said Palestinian militants were guilty of war crimes in their use of indiscriminate rocket attacks on civilians .

After ignoring the most politically influential religious group in Washington for decades , the Washington Post is going big with the revelation that randy Republicans Mark Sanford and John Ensign both sought spiritual solace in the C Street House of the Family , aka the Fellowship .
I happen to have written a book about The Family , so the Post called me : I did n’t get back to them in time , but I did speak to reporters from a few other papers .
Mainly , the whole thing makes me sad — show the media documentation of the Family ’s role as accessories to murderous regimes such as those of Siad Barre in Somalia and Suharto in Indonesia , and you get a big eye roll ; but consensual sex between adults — that ’s news !
Especially if it ’s a chance to give Republicans a couple of black eyes .
I ’m no fan of Republicans , myself , but it sounds to me like Sanford was in love ( and Ensign was already separated from his wife ) .
More than that , we do n’t really know .
Their hypocrisy is ugly , true ; but their heterosexist , anti-poor people , pro-empire politics are a lot uglier .
That , unfortunately , was n’t on the table for discussion .
Maybe it would have had I made the Rachel Maddow Show , as scheduled .
I ’ve spoken to Maddow several times before , and I think she ’s smart — she ’s doing mass media , so there ’s not too much subtlety allowed , but she reveals the complexity of issues better than any other political TV host .
Still , I was conflicted about going on the show to talk about Sanford .
Why pile on when the man is already down ?
Sanford ’s done — the question is do we gloat over his hypocrisy , and in doing so reinforce the very puritanical ideas about sex and love of which he was a champion ?
Or do we welcome Sanford into the human race ?
You know , the one where the heart wants what it wants and that ’s not always a simple thing , even when it ’s a true thing .
I do n’t think I would have been able to do that on the Maddow show , so thank god for Michael Jackson .
I imagine Mark Sanford is saying much the same thing .
Jackson ’s death has bumped his affair and that little to - do in Iran from the top of the news .
I was buying a new pair of shoes when I heard .
I ’m traveling at the moment , and when I got the invite to the Maddow show , I had only flip flops with me .
That seemed too casual for 30 Rock , and besides , I needed a new pair of shoes .
I tried Shoe Mania , in Union Square .
The store was abuzz :
He ’s dead !
Who ?
Michael Jackson !
Michael Jackson is dead .
I was stunned .
In my grief , I bought a pair of shoes Michael might have liked , flashier than any I ’d ever worn .
I walked out onto Broadway wearing my new shoes , thinking about Michael Jackson .
As it happens , I ’ve been listening to the deluxe edition of Off the Wall lately , and marveling at the early versions of songs like “ Do n’t Stop Til You Get Enough ” that Michael recorded with his brothers and sisters in their basement studio .
He was a genius .
I do n’t use the term casually — Michael Jackson was a genius , and his decline and death is an American tragedy .
So why the hell was I going on TV to talk about the lovestruck governor of South Carolina ?
Well , I was n’t .
I was n’t a block away from the store when a call came .
I ’d been bumped .
For a moment , I mourned my lost book sales — the Maddow show would have really helped The Family , which is just out in paperback .
But then I thought , at what cost ?
Exploiting the personal woes of Mark Sanford ?
Meanwhile , my feet hurt .
My new shoes lacked enough padding .
Every step I took banged my soles .
So I turned around and headed back up Broadway .
Cars opened their windows and jacked up their radios , early Jackson , “ Rock With You ” amidst the honk and roar of Broadway at rush hour .
“ Thank you , Michael Jackson , ” I thought , “ for bumping me from Rachel Maddow . ”
Even in death , the King of Pop had saved my soul .
I immediately squandered my spiritual gain .
When the store refused my request to return the shoes , I asked to speak to the manager .
The clerk said no .
No ?
Gimme a break — get the manager .
The manager arrives .
“ No returns on sale items , ” he says .
But this is Shoe Mania — everything is always on sale .
“ No returns , ” he says .
Outside , I hear Michael ’s falsetto , calling to me .
“ Just beat it , Jeff , ” he ’s saying .
Do n’t be an asshole .
But do I listen ?
I do not .
I demand my refund .
I declare the manager a dishonest businessman .
I stomp my flip - flopped foot .
In the end , I got my money back — and a pound of flesh , too .
The manager slid the blame over to the clerk who ’d said I could n’t speak to him .
“ Why would you tell a customer that ? ” he snapped .
She looked close to tears .
Oh , shit , I thought — her job for my shoes .
“ Look , ” I tried to say , “ do n’t blame her , she was fine ” – but the manager waved me off , my receipt for my refunded 30 pieces of silver in hand , and then turned back to the cashier .
The manager happened to be an Israeli , I believe , and I found myself thinking as I left , “ fucking Israelis . ”
I ’m Jewish , so I can get away with that in the privacy of my own head , or in a blog post in which I ’m confessing my tendency to blame the rudeness of some Israelis on Israel .
It ’s not anti-Semitism .
Politics aside — and that ’s a lot to put aside —
I ’ve resented Israel ever since I learned that early Israelis loathed Yiddish so much they ’s smash up Yiddish movie theaters .
Yiddish encapsulates everything I love about Jewishness .
Also , everything anti-Semites hate about Jewishness .
In fact , the reason I really started this shaggy dog of a blog was Cathy Grossman ’s report in USA Today on new Nixon tapes revealing Billy Graham , at it again with the anti-Semitism .
You may remember Billy got busted back in 2002 for tapes of him telling Nixon that while the Jews think he ’s their friend , “ They do n’t know how I really feel about what they ’re doing to this country . ”
The new tapes reveal that he was n’t too fond of their doings in Israel , either .
Was Billy a champion of the Palestinians ?
Not at all .
No , he was touting a conspiracy theory that held that Israel was going to expel Christians .
“ Fucking Israelis , ” he told Nixon , only he was more eloquent — he called them “ the synagogue of Satan . ”
Billy ’s defenders say that Billy was never an anti-Semite , that you have to understand these remarks in context .
I completely agree .
After all , I cited context — the context of me being a Jew — in my defense .
What ’s Billy ’s ?
The “ synagogue of Satan ” is a reference to the Book of Revelation , “ which says in verse 3:9 that there are those who claim to be Jews who are liars , and that they belong to a ‘ synagogue of Satan . ' ”
Oh , well , that ’s cool then .
Just to bring this full circle , that happens to be similar to rhetoric used by the Family , with which Billy first began working in the late 50s ( the Family ’s 600 boxes of archives are stored at the Billy Graham Center ) .
The Family ’s founders and its current leaders decided that God had told them that the Jews had broken their covenant with God and thus no longer enjoyed special status .
Instead , the Family itself represents what they call the “ New Chosen . ”
You know , guys like Mark Sanford and John Ensign .
They ’re the new Jews !
Or so the Family believes .
Which makes them , technically - speaking — I say this with no malice , as a Jew who believes we should all be a lot freer about sex — fucking Jews .
Nothing wrong with that .
Let ’s rise above prudish politics of the Right and the gloating of liberals and the stealth anti-Semitism of America ’s preacher .
John Ensign , Mark Sanford , I salute you — do n’t stop til you get enough .
Just stop trying to stop everybody else from getting some , too .
The Forgotten Question in the Health Care Debate

The Forgotten Question in the Health Care Debate
Michael Collins
Scenario 1 : You 've just been diagnosed with a cancer of the lymphatic system .
You 're told that it requires a procedure within the next two weeks .
Unfortunately , you were laid off from your corporate job 11 months , 30 days ago .
You are on your last day of COBRA .
Your company retirement and savings are all gone .
You ca n't afford the $ 1,200 a month premium needed to continue your coverage .
Without the operation , you will die .
Do you deserve to die ?
Scenario 2 : Your spouse has a long history of illness .
Then you discover she has a virulent infection that , if untreated , threatens to disable her to the point where she 's immobile and requires ' round the clock medical care .
You work for yourself .
While you have catastrophic health insurance , it does n't cover the needed treatment nor does it provide for nursing care .
Does your wife deserve to experience this untreated sickness and suffering until her premature death ?
Do you or your family members deserve to die simply because the rulers of this country can't get their act together to provide universal health care ?
Do your friends and neighbors deserve the same fate ?
What 's the meaning of a nation based on a common bond when other citizens , those we do n't know and will never meet , face the same grim end to their lives ?
Others Determine Our Suffering and Death
We hear talk about health care rationing but one theme is missing from that dialog .
Some of you who are the subjects of rationing will certainly suffer and some will clearly die well before your time as a result of health care denied .
Public health care rationing is a term that needs to be changed .
Rationing is a conscious choice .
Policy makers , legislators , and those who hold this view are saying that it is necessary to deliberately deny citizens health care because there " is n't enough money . "
These people need to be honest and stop hiding behind abstract terms .
It 's not rationing .
It is mandated suffering and death guaranteed by those who support the current system or future systems that deny care for those in need .
Health care rationing is based on the assumption that we do n't have enough dollars to provide for open access to health care by all citizens .
But wait !
Did n't we have enough dollars just recently to give $ 4 trillion to failed Wall Street financial institutions ?
That 's now part of our deficit .
We will have to pay it back .
Yet we 're told that we do n't have enough dollars for a truly comprehensive universal health care system .
We 're also told that the health care system that we do end up with cannot , under any circumstances , add to the national debt .
Let 's see now , we can't afford to ease suffering and save lives across the board and whatever we do short of that can't incur any debt .
But we 've just seen a bipartisan commitment of $ 4 trillion ( plus another $ 8.6 trillion set aside ) to bailout banks and save bank executive jobs but we can't do the same to save your life or that of your friends , family and fellow citizens .
Here 's another example of distorted thinking and priorities .
It is a conscious choice .
The proposed defense budget for 2010 is $ 664 billion dollars .
A large portion will be spent on the Iraq and Afghan wars " defending " us by creating even more enemies than we ever had in that part of the world .
But it 's a matter of priorities .
In order to defend us , the rulers require that we sacrifice our well being and lives at home to pay for that defense .
The Culture of Rationed Death
This is what 's called a crisis in values .
The culture of rationed death prevails over the fundamental decency and humanity of caring for the sick .
Those aligned against universal health care consciously choose to impose their culture of death on the entirety of the population .
Who speaks for those of us who will end up without health care ?
Which major figures on either side of the debate address universal health care as a life or death issue ?
Who among the advocates of rationing are without health insurance ?
Who among them are unable to afford or obtain their own critical care or the same for their loved ones ?
Who among them will step forward and tell those denied medical care :
" You deserve to die . "

Pro-gun rights protesters hold signs in front of the Supreme Court in Washington as they wait for the Court 's decision on the DC handgun ban on June 26 , 2008 .
The Supreme Court , in a 5 - 4 ruling , struck down Washington 's handgun ban , affirming the rights of individuals to own firearms .
However , the decision should leave most gun laws and regulations intact .

WASHINGTON , July 21 ( UPI ) --
A measure that would let gun owners carry weapons across state lines could threaten the filibuster - proof edge Democrats have in the U.S. Senate , observers note .
The Republican - backed language , introduced by Sen. John Thune , R - S.D. , would override stricter laws of many jurisdictions , giving preference to states with looser standards , The Washington Post reported Tuesday .

Thune offered the amendment Monday to the defense authorization bill .
The language would allow people to carry concealed firearms across state lines as long as they " have a valid permit or if , under their state of residence ... are entitled to do so . "
On two gun-rights measures this session , Republicans peeled off votes moderate Democrats elected from states with strong Second Amendment traditions .
In May , 27 Democrats supported eased restrictions on firearms in state parks and in February , 22 Democrats joined Republicans to freeze the District of Columbia 's pursuit for House voting rights by demanding the legislation also relax D.C. gun restrictions .
In a statement , Thune characterized his amendment was a crime - prevention tool , the Post said .
" Since criminals are unable to tell who is and who is not carrying a firearm just by looking at a potential victim , they are less likely to commit crimes when they fear that they may come in direct contact with an individual who is armed , " he said .
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , who pledged to filibuster the amendment , said it scuttled states ' rights .
" Each state has carefully crafted its concealed - carry laws in the way that makes the most sense to protect its citizens , " he said .
" To gut the ability of local police and sheriffs to determine who should be able to carry a concealed weapon makes no sense . "

It may not look like much at first glance , but researchers in Japan have pulled off a Jedi mind trick of sorts for directing electric wheelchairs .
Carmaker Toyota and research lab RIKEN have created a wheelchair that can be controlled by thought , perhaps heralding improved mobility for the severely disabled and elderly .
The device scans brain waves through sensors in a cap .
In 125 thousandths of a second , the brain - controlled wheelchair can turn a thought into a command to turn the chair left or right or to move it forward .
To stop , however , the user must puff out his or her cheek , activating a sensor placed there .
( Also see " Monkeys ' Brains Operate Robotic Arm . " )
Said to be about 95 percent accurate , the wheelchair improves on the speed and precision of previous brain - machine interfaces , according to results released June 29 .
To best pilot the wheelchair , do n't try too hard , suggested RIKEN scientist Andrzej Cichocki , leader of the project .
" It works best if you imagine playing the piano with either hand while turning the wheelchair or , for instance , jogging , to [ make the chair ] move forward , " Cichocki said .
" After two to four weeks of training , the accuracy is nearly perfect and it becomes effortless . "
There are currently no plans to put the brain - controlled wheelchair into production , as tests are still in the preliminary phases , he added .
For example , the machine has only been tried with relatively young , healthy subjects so far .
But that does n't mean the researcher is sitting still .
Cichocki wants to reduce the training time for new users and improve the software so that it will be able to , for instance , sense imagined letters to spell out words as a communication aid .
How about driving a car ?
" No , " he laughed , " but maybe it could change the radio station . "

Albert Belle : ‘ I was just an angry black man . ’
Paul Hoynes of the Cleveland Plain Dealer caught up with former MLB slugger and volatile human being Albert Belle recently to discuss , among other topics , whether or not the outfielder had ever used steroids during his playing career .
And Belle ’s answer was , well , vintage Belle :
“ I never did , ” said Belle .
“ I did n’t need to .
All you have to do is check the trainers ’ weight charts .
Every year I ’d come to camp weighing 225 to 230 and end the season at about 215 to 220 . ”
I ventured to say that his temper tantrums could have been interpreted as ‘ roid rage .
Said Belle , “ No , I was just an angry black man . ”
This might just be the fear of Belle coming to my house to give me the beating of a lifetime talking here , but I actually believe him .
After all , he was a very angry black man , as those poor trick or treaters learned on Halloween night in ’95 .
How would you write an arcade - style 2D game in CoreAnimation ?
I 'll show you how to write a resolution independent , high - speed , model - view - controller designed , Asteroids - style arcade game using CoreAnimation as the screen renderer .
In this third of four parts , I add the logic for the game and game objects and present the finished code for the project .
From renderer to game
In the previous post , I presented a rendering system using CoreAnimation layers ( CALayer ) .
To complete the game , we now need to add the game logic .
For this Asteroids - style game , the game logic will be very simple but will need to include the following components :
User control of the ship
Shooting and shot / asteroid collision detection and destruction .
Player / asteroid collision and a finite number of player " lives "
Level logic , so that a new , harder level is started when the previous one is cleared .
With the game logic added , the code for the project will be complete .
A screenshot of the game with shots and asteroid destruction .
User control
Most games treat keyboard input in a different manner to applications .
Instead of reading keyDown : messages , including the isARepeat messages ( whose delay and frequency are specified in the System Preferences ) , games simply want the state of specific keys at a given time .
e.g. " Is the ' thrust ' key pressed ? "
To provide the game with what it wants , I created a subclass of NSView to use as the contentView of the window .
The sole purpose of this view subclass is to read key event messages passed to the window .
When keyDown : messages are received , boolean values on the GameData object are set .
When the keyUp : message is received , the boolean values are cleared .
In this way , we store the keyboard state so we can read it in an asynchronous manner whenever it is needed .
The implementation of the keyDown : method follows .
- ( void ) keyDown : ( NSEvent * ) event { NSString * characters = [ event characters ] ; if ( [ characters length ] == 1 && ! [ event is ARepeat ] ) { const NSInteger ESCAPE_KEY_CODE = 27 ; unichar character = [ characters characterAtIndex : 0 ] ; if ( character == NSLeftArrowFunctionKey ) { [ [ GameData sharedGameData ] setLeftKeyDown : YES ] ; } else if ( character == NSRightArrowFunctionKey ) { [ [ GameData sharedGameData ] setRightKeyDown : YES ] ; } else if ( character == NSUpArrowFunctionKey ) { [ [ GameData sharedGameData ] setUpKeyDown : YES ] ; } else if ( character == ' ' ) { [ [ GameData sharedGameData ] setShootKeyDown : YES ] ; } else if ( character == ESCAPE_KEY_CODE ) { [ gameController togglePause : self ] ; } } }
Notice that Apple provide constants for higher level keys ( like the arrow keys ) but you are expected to handle ASCII codes ( like the Escape key ) yourself .
You can get these from the ASCII manual page ( man ascii in a terminal window ) .
Be careful to avoid the octal set — I have no idea how it earned first position in this file .
To respond to these new keyboard flags , I will create a subclass of GameObject ( the generic class representing an object in the game ) named PlayerObject to handle the player 's ship .
The real purpose of this subclass will be to add game - logic related behaviors .
The primary location for adding behaviors will be an override of the parent class ' updateWithTimeInterval : that supplements the default behavior with player - specific movement and interaction .
Here is the code to handle the " thrust " key ( the up arrow ) :
if ( [ GameData sharedGameData ]. upKeyDown ) { double scaled Acceleration = timeInterval * PLAYER_ACCELERATION
; double dX = speed * cos ( trajectory ) + scaledAcceleration * cos ( angle + M_PI_2 ) ; double dY = speed * sin ( trajectory ) + scaledAcceleration * sin ( angle + M_PI_2 ) ; speed = sqrt ( dX * dX + dY * dY ) ; trajectory = acos ( dX / speed ) ; if ( dY < 0 ) { trajectory *= - 1 ; } if ( speed > PLAYER_MAX_SPEED ) { speed = PLAYER_MAX_SPEED ; } }
This code is some basic trigonometry to add the ship 's current speed / trajectory vector to the new thrust vector , limiting the ship 's maximum speed .
The actual x and y of the ship is modified by invoking the super implementation ( which applies this speed and trajectory ) .
Model - view - controller design note
This approach to key control is not typical of an application .
In an application , a user - interface controller chooses the target object and sends the keyboard control directly to that object .
In this game , the user - interface sets keyboard state in a game - accessible location and game objects choose whether to incorporate that state into their own .
This behavior is good for a game because it allows the game objects to choose their own interaction logic but games represent a special case in this regard .
Firing shots
The other key aspect of user control in the game is the ability to fire shots .
Once again , I will use a GameObject subclass to handle the shots .
These ShotObject s will be created in the PlayerObject 's updateWithTimeInterval : method , since they will need to incorporate speed and trajectory information from the PlayerObject .
The following code fires a shot when the user presses the ' shoot ' key ( spacebar ) .
ShotObject * newShot = [ [ ShotObject alloc ] initWithX : x + 0.5 * width * cos ( angle + M_PI_2 ) y : y + 0.5 * height * sin ( angle + M_PI_2 ) ] ; [ [ GameData sharedGameData ] addGameObject : newShot forKey : [ [ GameData sharedGameData ] keyForShotAtIndex : nextShotIndex ] ] ; nextShotIndex = ( nextShotIndex + 1 ) % PLAYER_MAX_SHOTS ; [ [ GameData sharedGameData ] setGameDataObject :[ NSNumber numberWithInteger : nextShotIndex ] forKey : GAME_DATA_NEXT_SHOT_INDEX_KEY
] ; double dX = speed * cos ( trajectory ) + PLAYER_SHOT_SPEED
* cos ( angle + M_PI_2 ) ; double dY = speed * sin ( trajectory ) + PLAYER_SHOT_SPEED
* sin ( angle + M_PI_2 ) ; double shotSpeed = sqrt ( dX * dX + dY * dY ) ; double shotTrajectory = acos ( dX / shotSpeed ) ; if ( dY < 0 ) { shotTrajectory *= - 1 ; } newShot .
speed = shotSpeed ; newShot .
trajectory = shotTrajectory ; shotCooldown = PLAYER_SHOT_COOLDOWN
;
The initWithX:y : line creates the ShotObject .
The addGameObject : forKey : part adds it to the game .
GameObject s are all stored by a single key in this game but I use the keyForShotAtIndex : to create this key from a prefix ( " shot " ) and a suffix ( the shot 's index ) so that I can extract information about the object from its key .
This is a lazy approach to organizing game objects and any larger game would want to store its objects in a more metadata rich storage system .
Better organizations might include :
metadata methods on each game object so you can query each object about what it is
additionally storing game objects in dictionaries keyed by type or other essential category information
storing game objects in richly indexed system like an SQLite database ( which is then accessible by any column )
The setGameDataObject : forKey : line sets the number of shots that the player has fired in the GameData 's generic object storage .
This will allow us to limit the number of shots fired by the player to PLAYER_MAX_SHOTS .
The next code is some more trigonometry to apply the ship 's speed and trajectory to the shot .
Then finally the shotCooldown value is set .
This is a simple counter ( decremented on each updateWithTimeInterval : ) which will prevent another shot being fired while it is greater than zero ( allowing us to set the minimum time between shots ) .
Collisions
Last week 's code contained a very simple main update loop that called the updateWithInterval : method on all GameObject s.
This time , we expand the update loop to the following :
- ( void ) updateLevel : ( NSTimer * )
aTimer { if ( lastUpdate ) { frameDuration = [ [ NSDate date ] timeIntervalSinceDate : lastUpdate ] ; [ lastUpdate release ] ; lastUpdate = [ [ NSDate alloc ] init ] ; } else { frameDuration = GAME_UPDATE_DURATION
; } NSArray * allKeys = [ gameObjects allKeys ] ; for ( NSString * gameObjectKey in allKeys ) { [ gameObjects willChangeValueForKey : gameObjectKey ] ; GameObject * gameObject = [ gameObjects objectForKey : gameObjectKey ] ; if ( [ gameObject collide ] ) { [ gameObjects removeObjectForKey : gameObjectKey ] ; } } for ( NSString * gameObjectKey in allKeys ) { GameObject * gameObject = [ gameObjects objectForKey : gameObjectKey ] ; if ( ! gameObject ) { [ gameObjects didChangeValueForKey : gameObjectKey ] ; continue ; } if ( [ gameObject updateWithTimeInterval : frameDuration ] ) { [ gameObjects removeObjectForKey : gameObjectKey ] ; } [ gameObjects didChangeValueForKey : gameObjectKey ] ; } }
We time the duration between updates ourselves , even though we ask the NSTimer to invoke us every 0.03 seconds .
This allows us to keep the animation as smooth as possible even if the timer is delayed or frames start taking longer than 0.03 seconds to complete .
After this , we iterate over all the GameObject s twice : once to process collisions and once to update positions .
The reason for this separation is to ensure that all of the game objects are at the same moment in time when we process them for collisions — if we processed collisions during the update of positions then everything already updated for position would be 1 frame ahead of objects not yet processed when collisions are tested .
I chose to perform collisions before the update so that the collision applies to what the user can currently see ( rather than what they will see after CoreAnimation updates ) .
Performing collisions is very simple — especially in this game since I 'm only performing bounding box collisions .
The collision code in ShotObject which tests for collisions between shots and asteroids follows .
- ( BOOL ) collide { NSString * collision = [ [ [ GameData sharedGameData ] collideObjectsWithKeyPrefix : GAME_ASTEROID_KEY_BASE withObjectForKey : keyInGameData ] any Object ] ; if ( collision ) { [ AsteroidObject spawnNewAsteroidsReplacing : collision ] ; return YES ; } return NO ; }
Once again , I 'm using the prefix metadata in my game object keys to select asteroids for collisions .
The collision code lives on the GameData class .
- ( NSSet * ) collideObjectsWithKeyPrefix : ( NSString * ) prefix withObjectForKey : ( NSString * ) testObjectKey { GameObject * testObject = [ gameObjects objectForKey : testObjectKey ] ; NSMutableSet * result = [ NSMutableSet set ] ; NSRect testRect = NSMakeRect ( testObject . x - 0.5 * testObject .
width , testObject . y - 0.5 * testObject .
height , testObject .
width , testObject .
height ) ; for ( NSString * gameObjectKey in gameObjects ) { if ( [ gameObjectKey isEqualToString : testObjectKey ] || [ gameObjectKey rangeOfString : prefix ]. location != 0 ) { continue ; } GameObject * gameObject = [ gameObjects objectForKey : gameObjectKey ] ; NSRect gameRect = NSMakeRect ( gameObject . x - 0.5 * gameObject .
width , gameObject . y - 0.5 * gameObject .
height , gameObject .
width , gameObject .
height ) ; if ( NSIntersectsRect ( gameRect , testRect ) ) { [ result addObject : gameObjectKey ] ; } } return result ; }
This code creates a bounding rectangle from the GameObject specified by the testObjectKey and collides it with all objects stored by keys starting with prefix that are n't the testObject itself .
This code returns the whole set of colliding objects — overkill since the game only ever uses one at a time — but functional and easily fast enough for our purposes .
Tying it all together
We can control the ship , shoot and hit asteroids .
There 's a bit more that 's in the game that you can see if you want :
The shots animate through 5 frames and expire after a fixed amount of time .
I chose to store the current animation frame in the game data and handle the animation there ( instead of in the view like the asteroid animation was in the last post ) .
I wanted to show that animation state could be part of the game data if it is data - related ( this animation is n't really data - related so I have some regrets ) .
The asteroids start at random locations in a ring around the player for each level and spawn 3 smaller asteroids when shot , each of which travels in a random direction with a random rotation .
Instead of dwelling on that , I 'll jump to the last part of the game logic : the game ( including lives ) and the levels .
I want the following behaviors in the game :
The player begins with 3 lives at level 1 .
Each level starts with a " Prepare for level X... " message for a few seconds before displaying the contents of the level and starting normal play .
Every time the player loses a life ( collides with an asteroid ) the game displays an " X lives remaining ... " message for a few seconds before positioning the player in the middle of the screen and starting normal play again .
When the number of lives hits zero , a " Game Over " message is displayed and the game is stopped .
The data containing the number of lives and the current level are just objects in the gameData dictionary .
Creating a new level creates ( 3 + levelNumber ) asteroids and places the player in the center .
The messages are just a string , set using a specific GAME_DATA_MESSAGE_KEY , also on the gameData dictionary .
These values are displayed by using bindings to connect them to ordinary NSText Field s in the window .
More interesting is that the game needs to change its underlying behavior when the player dies or a new level begins .
The solution I chose is to maintain two different update loops for the two basic behaviors .
The updateLevel : method I 've already shown is the " normal " update method .
A second update method named readyCountdown : will be used to do nothing ( not update the GameObject s ) for a few seconds while a message is displayed , before returning to the regular update method .
Along with newGame , newLevel and endGame methods , the game now has the ability to transition between different gameplay states .
Conclusion
With the window and design from the first part , the rendering and layers from the second part and now the game logic , the game is complete .
Download it , build it , play it and be underwhelmed by its simplicity .
In the final part , I 'll present analysis of CoreAnimation 's utility as a game rendering engine .
I 'll look at some features of CoreAnimation that I did n't use , including features that impacted negatively on performance .
I 'll also look at how CoreAnimation performance changes as the number of render objects is increased .
The wait is over .
Now that some T - Mobile customers are reporting they have received their MyTouch 3G , Google has made the new apps packaged with the phone available on the Android Market .
This includes the highly regarded “ Sherpa ” application and T - Mobile Visual Voicemail – 2 applications that are bound to find room on plenty of home screens .
So head on over to Android Market , MyTouch 3G or not , and download the goods .
Make sure you swing back by and let us now how you like them !

Advertisement Honeybee hordes use two weapons - heat and carbon dioxide - to kill their natural enemies , giant hornets .
Japanese honeybees form " bee balls " - mobbing and smothering the predators .
This has previously been referred to as " heat - balling " , but a study has now shown that carbon dioxide also plays a role in its lethal effectiveness .
In the journal Naturwissenschaften , the scientists describe how hornets are killed within 10 minutes when they are trapped inside a ball of bees .
Japanese giant hornets , which can be up to 5 cm long , are voracious predators that can devastate bees ' nests and consume their larvae .
But , if the bees spot their attacker in time , they mount a powerful defence in the form of a bee ball .
This study found that the heat inside the bee ball alone was not enough to reliably kill the hornets .
Giant hornets were taped to temperature and gas probes " They can survive for 10 minutes at a temperature up to 47C , and the temperature inside the bee balls does not rise higher than 46 C , " said Fumio Sakamoto , a researcher from Kyoto Gakuen University in Japan , and one of the authors of the study .
His team recreated experimental bee balls and took direct measurements from inside them .
They anaesthetised giant hornets and fixed them to the tip either of a thermometer probe , or the inlet of a gas detector .
Once the hornets recovered from their anaesthesia , the probes were touched to the bees ' nest .
" The bee ball formed ( around the hornet ) immediately , " said Dr Sakamoto .
After 10 minutes the bees were packed solidly enough around the probe to be removed from the nest in a distinct ball .
As the temperature inside the ball increased to more than 45C , the carbon dioxide level also rose sharply .
In a parallel experiment , the scientists found that in an atmosphere relatively high in carbon dioxide , the temperature at which hornets could survive for 10 minutes was lowered .
" So we concluded that carbon dioxide produced inside the bee ball by the honeybees is a major factor , together with temperature , involved in the bees ' defence . "
The bee ball formed as a bump on the bottom of the nest Dr Sakamoto is not sure , at this point , whether the bees were effectively " gassing " the hornets , or simply depriving them of oxygen .
" Either way , the carbon dioxide increase and / or the oxygen decrease lowered the temperature that was lethal to the hornets , " he told BBC News .
" We are going to do the additional experiments about this point using mixed air of various oxygen and carbon dioxide ( concentrations ) . "
The mob of bees also appeared to operate in " two phases " .
" The hornet may be killed during the first 0 - 5 minute period , in which the highest level of heat production and carbon dioxide emissions take place , " said Dr Sakamoto .
This might suggest that the bees are aware of what physiological state the hornet is in .
Dr Sakamoto said : " The latter 5 - 10 min period may be free running to ensure their victim 's death . "

Co-proxamol is linked to fatal overdoses
The controversial withdrawal of a common painkiller has dramatically cut suicides , say researchers .
A gradual phase - out of co-proxamol led to 350 fewer suicides and accidental deaths in England and Wales , a study in the British Medical Journal reports .
Regulators removed the drug 's licence in 2007 after fears about the risk of overdose but the move proved unpopular with some patients and doctors .
Arthritis Care says some patients now struggle to control their pain .
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency announced the withdrawal in 2005 .
There is no robust evidence that co-proxamol offers any advantage over paracetamol or ibuprofen at normal doses
MHRA spokesman GPs were encouraged to move patients to other painkillers before the drug 's licence was revoked in 2007 .
After that time doctors could prescribe the drug on a " named patient basis " for those who could not manage their pain with alternatives but as it is unlicensed they did so at their own risk .
Study leader Professor Keith Hawton , director of the Centre for Suicide Research at Oxford University , said before the restrictions co-proxamol was responsible for a fifth of all drug - related suicides .
By the 2007 deadline , prescribing of the drug had fallen by 59 % , his analysis showed .
Over the two - year period , deaths from co-proxamol fell by 62 % .
Specifically there were 295 fewer suicides and 349 fewer deaths from the drug including accidental overdoses .
The research also showed that had been no increase in deaths from other painkillers , despite large increases in their use .
Initiative ' effective ' Professor Hawton said authorities in the US were now considering withdrawing co-proxamol , which is a mixture of paracetamol and an opioid drug .
" This marked reduction in suicides and accidental poisonings involving co-proxamol during this period , with no evidence of an increase in deaths involving other analgesics , suggests the initiative has been effective , " he added .
In 2008 , there were 380,831 prescription items for co-proxamol , showing some GPs are still prescribing the drug .
A spokesman for the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) said prior to its withdrawal co-proxamol was involved in 300- 400 self - poisoning deaths each year , of which around a fifth were accidental .
" Co-proxamol is extremely dangerous in overdose - only a small overdose can be fatal , and death can occur very rapidly - before medical attention can be sought . "
He added : " There is no robust evidence that co-proxamol offers any advantage over paracetamol or ibuprofen at normal doses . "
But Federico Moscogiuri , head of policy and campaigns at Arthritis Care , said many people who used to be prescribed co-proxamol were now struggling to control their pain .
A survey done last year by the charity found most people could no longer get prescriptions of the drug from their GPs and many said they had not found an effective alternative .
" For them , co-proxamol makes the difference between being able to perform simple everyday activities and living in chronic , debilitating pain .
" This is an intolerable situation for a society committed to high quality care for all .
" If the named patient system is to work , GPs should feel supported in prescribing co-proxamol for patients who really need it . "

Cops and their kids get to use confiscated cars in St. Louis for free .
Seems that the city of St. Louis , like many cities , allows the police to confiscate the cars of people suspected ( but not necessarily convicted ) of certain crimes .
They have a contract with a city towing firm , and said firm was allowing police officers and their families to " rent " confiscated cars free of charge , sometimes for months on end .
Officers and their families could also sometimes purchase the confiscated cars at a fraction of the cars ' value .
All of that is pretty outrageous .
But it gets better .
The St. Louis Post - Dispatch stumbled onto the story after investigating the daughter of the city 's police chief .
She had been involved in a number of accidents with different cars .
On several occasions she had wrecked a car , then simply gone down to the towing service to get a 60 - 80 percent discount on a new one .
After one accident , her blood - alcohol concentration tested at .17 .
She was n't arrested or charged .
The department says it has " no idea " why she was let go .
Geoff Morrell , the Pentagon press secretary , said that the mooted expansion for the current strength of 547,000 to 577,000 would be designed " to get them through what is still a stressful period as we draw down in Iraq and continue to plus - up in Afghanistan . "

How To Put Free Software Experience On Your Resumé
This document recommends best practice for putting free software 0 experience on your resumé .
It is primarily aimed at college students or people who have not yet had a first job in software .
If you are a college student , your primary " experience " is education .
So list it first and prominently , and only then list free software experience .
Employers tend to be looking for good educational pedigree first ( sad , maybe , but true ) .
Having said that , it 's good to participate in free software development because ( among many other reasons ) it will lead to further opportunities .
Experience starts to trump college the older you get .
After your first job or two , people care much less about your college grades .
( Hopefully this will give you a sense of perspective about them when exams are looming . )
Unless you are fortunate enough to be applying for a job working on the same free software project you contribute to , the primary value of your free software experience to an employer is :
acquired skills using a set of tools ; experience of real - world development ; real work you can point to , and get references for ; a public record of your ability to work as part of a distributed team .
Skills
The way you present your skills and yourself to recruiters and HR staff is not necessarily the way you 'd present them to your peers .
You may end up saying things that would sound arrogant , weird or overly precise in other contexts .
That 's OK .
In larger organizations , it is likely that the first person to review your resumé will be someone in HR ( Human Resources ) .
HR staff may not be intimately familiar with the skills related to the position you are applying for and may not be able to infer that , for example , having Mercurial experience means that you have experience with revision control systems .
So when you are putting your resumé together , it 's useful to list out relevant skills , even if you do n't think of them as " skills " .
What source control systems have you used ?
What IDEs ?
What languages are you familiar with ?
Give your proficiency with each .
It helps to tailor the list for whatever job you are applying for ; it should be apparent from the job description whether to emphasize that you 're good with git or with mercurial .
Give your skills a heading that makes sense to someone who plugs terms into Wikipedia ( e.g. " Version Control " ) .
Here are some skills you may well have picked up while working on free software which you may not have thought of adding :
Experienced at talking to people from different countries and cultures
Ability to work with and motivate volunteers
Written real - world , long - term - maintainable software as part of a globally distributed team
Experience
There are things you can do even while you are contributing to increase the usefulness of your contribution in helping you get a job .
For example , make sure your contribution is documented somewhere so you can point potential employers , HR people , or technical reviewers to a full description of what you did .
For example , you could say " I QAed 7 packages according to these guidelines " , and then point to the guidelines .
You get bonus points for documenting your own processes and work because it shows you can do documentation .
Statistics on your contributions can help lend additional context and credibility to your credentials .
The more lines of code contributed , packages maintained , and releases touched you can list , the more impressed HR will be .
It may also be appropriate to list some statistics about the project and the impact of your work .
E.g. :
Contributed N hours of testing ...
QAed N packages for release X ...
Project Foo is used by 50,000 software developers and organizations , such as Sun and IBM ( who has used Foo as the base of their Foo + Bar project . )
These are quantifiable things that can give you a significant edge over others who can only list educational credentials .
This is much better than talking about " the cool lab project I did " which no - one can look at .
You should have a " Top Accomplishment " section for each position held , which tells a short story about something great that you did in that position .
E.g. explain that you tracked down and fixed a critical bug which was blocking a release , and give a link to the bug report itself .
Resumes typically assign a job title to each chunk of relevant experience .
Unfortunately , most free software projects do n't give people job titles .
However , a job title is just a two or three word summary of what your role is , which is not something intrinsically bad .
So it may be worth discussing with the project lead what appropriate and accurate title you could use when listing your experience on that project .
Position the title so it 's credible and relevant to the job you are applying for .
Shy away from vague terms like " volunteer " where more specific and credible terms ( like " developer " or " author " ) are available , and get specific where appropriate - i.e. , do n't just say " volunteer " , say " QA volunteer " or better ( if accurate ) " QA core team member " .
A key aspect of the free software world is that people 's contributions are not judged based on whether they are paid for them or not .
However , not everyone reading your resumé will understand that , and may erroneously think less of positions which are voluntary .
This is another reason to avoid words like " volunteer " or even " contributor " in favour of more specific terms .
References
If you 've already done software work well , with peer accolades , that will make companies more comfortable hiring you than an untested person .
Most project leads will be happy to provide a reference or endorsement , assuming your work has been good .
However , full references on resumés are actually clutter .
If you are obtaining endorsements or references , it 's much better to get them put into a business social networking tool like Linked In or Xing .
You can then reuse the references in the future , and potential employers can validate their credibility .
In the resumé itself , you should instead reference the relevant website , and instead use the space to excite the potential employer with descriptions of what you actually did .
The Hiring Process
After HR has seen your resumé , what happens next depends on the firm .
Your CV may be passed to a hiring manager for review .
Hopefully , you are dealing with a hiring manager who has expertise relevant to your position .
If they do not , they will likely do the same thing as the HR person did , and look for keywords .
So the same features of your resumé will appeal to them .
If the hiring manager is technically savvy ( or when it gets to a member of the technical team to review ) , they will dive deeply into your experience .
They will care not just that you have just used version control , but that it was git , Mercurial or Subversion .
They 'll read the entry in the project 's issue tracker when you landed the mission critical patch .
They 'll go to your website and see the CV online and click all the links , and confirm that you are indeed mentioned in the release notes for the last six releases , as you claimed .
If they find you 've written the truth and they like what you 've written , your name may be put forward for interview .
The goal of your resumé is to persuade the company to interview you .
Do n't put anything on it which does n't help achieve that .
Interviews
Your first interview will typically be by phone .
You will be asked about everything you list on the CV , so do n't over - inflate your experience .
Be ready to talk about areas of strength , and why you are passionate about those areas .
Passion is important .
Companies would rather hire someone who loves testing and breaking things rather than someone who seems to be just looking for a salary .
An interview serves two purposes .
Your potential employer has an opportunity to assess you , and you have an opportunity to work out whether this job is right for you .
So come prepared with questions about the work and the environment so you know if and when you accept , you 'll be doing something you are excited about .
Useful questions to ask :
What is your company 's view on employers contributing to FLOSS ?
Is it done on my own time or company time ?
Will continuing to contribute to FLOSS during employment cause a problem ?
It is much , much easier to do this during the interview than on your first day , and it shows someone who understands OSS that you know about and care about making a significant ongoing contribution , and being part of the community .
Asking these questions actually helps sell your skills .
You are a fun and engaging human being to work with because you are excited about what you are doing .
General Advice
People will review your resumé on paper , so make sure your CV is something which is useful without being able to click links .
Put a URL to the hyperlinked version on the resumé .
It 's worth tracking your analytics - these will tell you if your CV is interesting to employers .
If no - one 's looking , either it 's not well - targetted , or there 's a global economic crisis going on .
Also , when job hunting , you may have better luck looking in places that value free software job experience , such as the Free Software Foundation 's job listings page .
Best of luck !

Rhode Island became the third state in the nation Tuesday and the first on the East Coast to permit marijuana sales to chronically ill patients , a decision made over the objections of Gov. Don Carcieri .
State lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to override a veto last week from the Republican governor , who warned the system could put people at risk of federal prosecution , would encourage illegal drug use and send conflicting messages to children about substance abuse .
House lawmakers voted unanimously to override Carcieri ’s veto , while the Senate voted 35 - 3 to make the bill law .
“ This gives a safe haven for those who have to go into the seedy areas to try and get marijuana , ” said Rep. Thomas Slater , D - Providence , who suffers from cancer and plans to smoke the drug for pain relief .
“ I think that this center will definitely help those who most need it . ”
Slater received a standing ovation on the House floor .
Patients can buy marijuana at stores in California , while New Mexico in March granted a license to a medical marijuana grower .
Karen O’Keefe , director of state policies for the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington , said the 13 states that have legalized medical marijuana are making a shift toward state - licensed production and distribution .
Such legislation is being considered in Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , New Hampshire , New Jersey , North Carolina and Pennsylvania , while a ballot initiative is being circulated in Arizona .
In November , Maine voters will decide whether to permit marijuana dispensaries in their state .
“ Combining regulated distribution with provisions for patients to grow a limited quantity for themselves is the best way to ensure safe access for patients , with solid safeguards to prevent abuse , ” O’Keefe said in a written statement .
In 2006 , Rhode Island began allowing chronically ill patients registered with the state Department of Health to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana in usable form and 12 plants .
But the state never created a legal way to buy marijuana , and patients here have reported being robbed or beaten when trying to buy it from street dealers .
Marijuana remains illegal under federal law , but U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said the Obama administration will not target dispensers that follow state law .

Illegal squatters often deforest their land merely to mark it out ( Image : Rex Features )
Update 26 June 2009 : Brazilian President Luiz Inacio “ Lula ” da Silva yesterday signed the controversial land - grab bill and sent it back to Congress , having vetoed the clause which environmental groups most vigorously opposed ( see ‘ Encouraging occupations ’ , below ) .
da Silva decided to reject the part which would have legitimised claims made by people who pay squatters to occupy chunks of the Amazon .
Brazilian president Luiz Inacio “ Lula ” da Silva looks set to ratify a bill that will legalise the criminal occupation of large chunks of the Amazon by companies that have been illegally squatting – and often deforesting – them .
The bill has angered environmental groups and researchers , as well as several senators and Brazil ’s former environment minister .
They say that instead of merely regularising land ownership in the Amazon , as it is supposed to do , bill 458 will : justify illegal land grabbing , which has been rife in the Amazon for decades ; encourage further land grabs ; strip indigenous populations of land that has traditionally been theirs ; and make it easy for companies to ignore environmental laws .

The legislation would be counter to “ every single commitment Brazil has ever made with respect to deforestation control and governance in the Amazon ” , says Antonio Nobre , a forestry researcher with the National Institute for Amazonian Research ( INPA ) .
Bill 458 was ratified by the senate earlier this year and president da Silva must now ratify or veto it .
He has so far supported the bill .
Yesterday , a last - minute campaign was launched calling on people to ring the president ’s office and ask him to reject it .
‘ Wild West ’ expansion
Land ownership in the Amazon has always been a contentious issue .
In theory , just 4 per cent of it is legally owned private land .
In reality , much of the region is very remote and poorly policed .
To complicate matters , in the 1970s , the government encouraged people to settle by promising them that they would be given titles to land parcels at a later date .
As a result , companies and individuals have for decades been moving in and occupying parcels that have not subsequently been officially registered .
According to the Brazilian NGO Imazon , just under one quarter of the Amazon consists of unregistered private properties .
Nobre compares the situation to an American Wild - West style of occupation , only in fast forward .
“ Two hundred years ago in North America , ” he says , “ they did not have chainsaws , bulldozers , GPS , and radar images , as the Brazilian modern agribusiness has . ”
On the surface , bill 458 seeks to regularise the situation and make it easier to enforce environmental protection .
If ratified , settlers that have been occupying small plots with a maximum area of 100 hectares since before December 2004 will be able to apply for legal land titles for free .
Those that have been living on larger plots , up to 1500 hectares , will be able to buy the titles , sometimes at discounted price .
The titles will allow them to use their land to guarantee bank loans and they will be able to legally make a profit by selling their deeds .
‘ Encouraging occupations ’
Initially , it seemed like the bill might help restore areas that have been environmentally damaged , says Brenda Brito , executive director of Imazon .
For example , it includes a proviso stating that if owners deforest their land , the government can take away their title deed .
However , amendments introduced as it passed through congress mean that it could end up legalising criminal claims .
The most contested amendment concerns claims by “ indirect ” occupants .
These are people and companies that do not live in the Amazon , but pay others to sit on parcels of land in their stead , hoping that they might one day be granted ownership .
Often they have illegally deforested the land as an easy way of marking their presence .
Nobel says this amendment means the bill is tantamount to a “ wholesale legalisation of criminal land grabs in the Amazon ” for an area the size of Germany and Italy combined .
He adds that the bill will only sustain land grabbing activities .
“ Anybody who has refrained from ‘ grabbing ’ land in the last 40 years because that was a criminal act , will feel like they are being awarded the fool ’s prize , and you can only imagine what that will mean for the remaining pristine areas , ” he told New Scientist .
“ It is unlikely he [ the president ] will veto any relevant part of it , ” says Sérgio Abranches , political scientist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro .
“ The bill will be enacted at the very best with minor vetoes .
This is a major problem because land - grabbing has declined since 2004 . ”
Health Care : Socialism is a Bipartisan Disease
It was amusing to see the the dumbshow in Washington on July 20 , when Barack Obama , in condemning Republican opposition to his health care reform proposals , vowed to “ fight the politics of the moment . ”
One was perhaps left wondering what made this political moment so different from any others in history .
The lives , liberties , and property of the population at large were , as always , under assault by government .
Obama ’s plan would , among other onerous things , create a governmental health insurance program modelled after Medicaid that would compete against private health firms , raise income tax rates on individuals and families making over $ 350,000 annually , and worst of all , make carrying a health insurance policy mandatory for all but the poorest Americans .
The alternative would be to pay roughly 2.5 % higher income taxes , on average , in the form of fines for non-compliance .
I partially recant my earlier statement .
None of this seems to be very amusing at all .
What was were the responses Republicans had to Obama ’s grandstanding .
GOP chairman Michael Steele flat - out called Obama ’s plan “ socialism . ”
Let us assume for this discussion that “ socialism ” can be defined as state policy deviating from the ideal of a free market .
Then while Steele ’s statement is true , it is also a classic exclusionary case of selective perception .
For I ask :
What does government do that is not socialism ?
How , by its very intrinsic nature can government operate or long survive without steeping itself in socialism ?
Observe that everything government does , it finances via taxation .
That is to say , money taken from the public at large by the threat of physical force – or by actual use of that very force itself .
It does not politely ask .
It does not attempt to bring the best goods and services it can into the marketplace at the lowest possible price so as to accrue to itself hordes of satisfied , paying customers who patronize it at will instead of going to its competitors , or instead of simply buying nothing at all .
No , governments do not conduct themselves on such an advanced , productive , and civil basis .
They instead steal .
They intimidate .
They threaten .
They kidnap and imprison .
They kill .
Whether the topic at hand is health care , military defense ( more often offense against innocents , these days ) , police , postal service , courts , roads and bridges – you name it – government represents a series of socialist monopolies wherein there is no consumer choice .
You and I must accept the “ service ” government gives us , and we must pay for it at the barrel of many guns – or else .
Even if we move to another locale or jurisdiction ( i.e. , a geographical region over which one , or several governments simultaneously , arrogate dominion over the lives , liberty , and property of those who live or work there ) , we ’re still left with no real choices – though the faces and names may have changed , the essence of the con-game has not .
If Republicans really wanted to abandon socialism , they would resign their posts and seek the abolition of all government in favor of laissez - faire free markets and individual choice .
Likewise , if Obama and the Democrats really wanted to increase choice and lower the costs of health care for all Americans , they would not be contemplating creating yet another government - funded Ponzi scheme like Social Security , Medicaid , and Medicare .
Further , they would be working feverishly to repeal forthwith all of the taxes , bureaucracy , red tape , licensing , and other government - imposed measures that hamper everyone involved in health care – from physicians , to hospitals , to insurance firms , to the pharmaceutical industry .
Just as in all other areas of endeavor , when it comes to health care , government does and can “ help ” precisely no one .
Except the politicians and their insider cronies , wallowing in all the special interest soft money , perks , and kickbacks courtesy of the public trough .
Democrat , Republican , or whomever , when it comes to government , socialism is a bipartisan disease .
And like any disease , anytime is time to stomp it out for good .
i Pods smoking and bursting into flames : freak accidents , or more common than we think ?
It 's at least the former , but according to a recent disclosure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) , there may in fact be far more of these incidents than previously thought .
Apple 's legal team appears to have tried to keep the information under wraps , too , though the CPSC itself does n't yet consider the issue to be a serious one .
The CPSC sent KIRO 7 Eyewitness News some 800 pages of documentation over smoking , burning , and exploding iPods this week in response to a Freedom Of Information Act request .
In fact , the request was first submitted this past December — more than seven months ago — but was continually delayed " because Apple ’s lawyers filed exemption after exemption . "
It 's unclear whether the 800 pages are comprehensive or whether there 's more .
Regardless , they apparently reveal enough to anger a number of victims even more , because the incidents continued long after they reported their own issues to Apple .
The documents detail cases of varying severity .
People getting shocked by iPod shuffles .
An iPod catching fire on a ship " with over 2,000 persons onboard . "
An iPod nano bursting into flames in someone 's pocket .
Children and minors getting burned .
The incidents are all over the map and include both new and old iPods over a period of several years .
Though no serious injuries have been reported to the CPSC — at least according to the 800 - page document dump — some users are still very concerned .
" That ’s what I ’ve been afraid of , is that that could have been a dead child because Apple did n’t care to fix it , " Tami Mooney , the mother of a 14 - year - old who got burned by an iPod she got for Christmas in 2007 , told KIRO 7 .
" I ’m horrified to learn it ’s still going on . "
She said that she believes Apple needs to issue a massive recall .
The CPSC , for its part , does say that Apple is obligated to inform it of any defects that could create a substantial hazard .
However , according to the Commission 's own investigation , there is not currently a serious cause for concern .
" [ T ] he number of incidents is extremely small in relation to the number of products produced , making the risk of injury very low , " the CPSC wrote .
We here at Ars can't say we have heard any stories from readers about iPods turning into roman candles , but perhaps we have n't been listening hard enough .
( I did bleed once after running for too long with an iPod shuffle pressed against my skin — maybe I should sue ! )
Do you have any stories to share ?
Market Rebels : How Activists Make or Break Radical Innovations , Hayagreeva Rao , Princeton University Press 2009
For decades , economists have extended their intellectual reach beyond mere money in an attempt to encompass all the social sciences in their analytical framework .
But now the boot is on the other foot and it looks like even core economic observations may be better explained by other social sciences .
Robert Solow apparently said that attempts to explain differences in economic growth across countries typically end in " a blaze of amateur sociology " .
The focus on psychology in explanations of the banking crash shows that growth is not the only area of economics where the discipline runs out of steam before reaching its destination .
The rise of behavioural economics , surely a last - gasp attempt by economists to match their models to the real world without changing departments , suggests that the condition goes deep .
Despite its title , Hayagreeva Rao's Market Rebels ( Open Library link , publisher 's page ) challenges the economic analysis of innovations .
At 180 pages and full of case studies it 's easy to read quickly , but I was so taken by it that I went through it a second time and found much that I had missed .
Rao does not hammer the reader over the head with the implications of his case studies , but for me as a non-sociologist and non-economist the implications are huge and I 'll be thinking about the book for a long time .
The case studies are diverse , but are centered around a single claim : the " joined hands of activists " play an important part in the creation , diffusion , and blocking of innovations .
Collective action matters .
Rao describes how hobbyists were key to the cultural acceptance of the car and the development of the personal computer ; how microbrewers brought diversity back to beer ; how nouvelle cuisine grew from the rebellious student movements of Paris 1968 ; how shareholder activism has pushed large companies to change behaviours ; how community activists attempted to stall the spread of chain stores and then of big - box stores ; how the green movement blocked the development of biotechnology in Europe .
These studies , many based on his own research , help to bring activist groups and their campaigns out from the wings and into the spotlight as we think about innovation and social change , and by doing so Rao is performing a valuable service .
The book is not strong on systematic analysis .
The closest he gets to describing what determines whether movements succeed or fail is that successful movements must create " hot causes " and " cool mobilizations " .
Both concepts are tied in to the concept of " identity " , which for Rao is the underlying motive that causes people to join with or against social movements .
A " hot cause " is the spark that successful activists use to light a fire .
It 's a lightning - rod incident or issue that arouses strong emotions such as pride or anger .
Examples include the frustrated demonization of " big beer " by real ale enthusiasts ; the outrageous bonus paid to Home Depot CEO Robert Nardelli which crystallized the shareholder rights movement .
But " hot causes " by themselves are not enough for a prolonged campaign .
" Cool mobilizations " are actions that keep a movement going forward by " engaging audiences in new behaviors and new experiences that are improvisational and insurgent " .
Examples include setting up a microbrewery or formulating shareholder resolutions .
The concepts are useful , but it's a shame Rao does n't have a stronger turn of phrase .
Naming concepts can be key to owning them , and " hot cause " and " cool mobilization " are too literal and clumsy to take on the weight they need .
But this is a detail ( and I do n't have better ideas ) .
For someone who has spent most of their non-fiction reading time reading economics and economics - inspired books in recent years , Rao's is a welcome and refreshing change .
Economic analysis too - often reduces the political left - right split to the false dichotomy of market vs state , but this reduction maps badly on to the real experience of political activism .
Those who protest Monsanto 's private - sector use of genetic engineering are often the same as those who protest state - driven wars .
Many of those who oppose new Wal - Mart stores also oppose the extension of surveillance powers by the state .
Where do such activists see themselves in a market vs state debate ?
For many , they do n't : market vs state is not what it 's about .
So it 's not surprising that economists have a blind spot when it comes to social movements , and that the discipline systematically minimizes their impact .
By putting social movements at the centre of his stories , Rao shows that they can and do have an influence , and that they deserve a place in any serious look at institutions that shape social change .
Although he says almost nothing about the Internet and digital collaboration , Market Rebels ' focus on innovations makes the book obviously relevant .
Rao's analysis is a welcome alternative to the usual focus of widely - read writers like Yochai Benkler and Clay Shirky .
These writers take the economics point of view and focus on issues such information as a public good , lowering transaction costs for online exchanges , and the vanishingly small marginal cost of reproduction of digital information .
Rao 's unspoken counterargument , which convinces me , is that group formation is not a problem of information , it 's a problem of identity .
If he is right then although we can expect to see many examples of successful groups in the online world , we wo n't see not a huge flowering of groupiness compared to the information - starved analogue world .
What 's more , if Rao is right and initiatives such as Wikipedia , blogging and the Open Source movement really are social movements , then they may have a limited lifespan .
Digital activist identity is a rebellious and anti-establishement stance , but such a stance can only be maintained while the movement is oppositional .
Open Source , with a longer history behind it than Wikipedia or blogging , has changed its identity to being more professionalized , more establishment .
Its participants are less likely to be the radicals of yesteryear .
Once Wikipedia is established as a success for a few years , rebellion becomes irrelevant as a motive and one may wonder whether the activists will find the " cool mobilizations " to maintain involvement and participation .
If there is an economics tie - in with Rao 's analysis , it's with the analysis of identity pioneered by Rachel Kranton and Robert Akerlof ( and which I sketched in the final chapter of No One Makes You Shop at Wal - Mart ) .
Rao does little to pick apart the concept of identity and it looks to me like the K&A analysis would have been helpful to him .
For Kranton and Akerlof , identity is a set of social categories ( car enthusiast , green activist ) , a set of prescriptions that go along with those categories , and a set of costs and benefits associated with following or not following these prescriptions .
We each choose an identity from the range that society provides ( " environmentalist " , " conservative " , etc ) .
Forcing this choice is the object behind Rao's " hot cause " : the lightning - rod issue that polarizes participants into supporters and opponents ( " which side are you on , boys , which side are you on ? " , as the greatest living American sings ) .
Once you have chosen an identity , you must affirm it by following the prescriptions associated with that identity ( shopping at independent stores , eating nouvelle cuisine , etc ) or you pay the price of dissonance if you take actions that go against those prescriptions ( shopping at Wal - Mart , eating classical cuisine ) .
Creating a strong set of such prescriptions is the essence of Rao's " cool mobilizations " , which serve to maintain a sense of solidarity and identity among movement members .
One of the more common criticisms of No One Makes You Shop at Wal - Mart was that , although I argued in favour of collective action as a corrective force to free markets , I had little to say about what forms that action should take .
It 's a fair knock , and I 'm happy that I can now point such readers to Rao 's book .
Not only does he take on several of the issues that I cover ( Wal - Mart and big - box stores , biotechnology , real ale ) but he takes them much further than I could ever had done , and in a wonderfully specific and constructive way that provides concrete guidance to activists .
I take my hat off to him .

Desert sands , and the dunes that they form , are constantly on the move
A plan to build a 6,000 km - long wall across the Sahara Desert to stop the spread of the desert has been outlined .
The barrier - formed by solidifying sand dunes - would stretch from Mauritania in the west of Africa to Djibouti in the east .
The plan was put forward by architect Magnus Larsson at the TED Global conference in Oxford .
A 2007 UN study described desertification as " the greatest environmental challenge of our times " .
" The threat is desertification .
My response is a sandstone wall made from solidified sand , " said Mr Larsson , who describes himself as a dune architect .
The sand would be stabilised by flooding it with bacteria that can set it like concrete in a matter of hours .
North African nations have promoted the idea of planting trees to form a Great Green Belt to prevent the spread of the sand .
A similar proposal - known as the Green Wall of China - has also been proposed to stop the spread of the Gobi Desert .
Ballooning idea
In 2007 , the UN issued a report that said that one third of the Earth 's population - about two billion people - are potential victims of desertification .
The idea is to stop the desert using the desert itself
Magnus Larsson
It is concerned that the slow creep of the sands will displace people and put new strains on natural resources and societies .
Problem areas include the former Soviet republics in central Asia , China and sub-Saharan Africa .
" It affects about 140 countries , " Mr Larsson told BBC News .
Mr Larsson showed pictures of a village called Gidan - Kara in Nigeria which had had to be moved because of the creep of the dunes .
He said it was one of many examples .
The architect 's proposed wall across the desert would be a complement to , rather than a replacement , of the Great Green Belt proposal .
" It would provide physical support for the trees , " he said .
Crucially , he said , it would leave a barrier even if the trees were removed .
" People are so poor in these countries and these regions that they chop them down for firewood . "
The wall would effectively be made by " freezing " the shifting sand dunes , turning them into sandstone .
" The idea is to stop the desert using the desert itself , " he said .
The sand grains would be bound together using a bacterium called Bacillus pasteurii commonly found in wetlands .
Moving dunes displace both people and crops " It is a microorganism which chemically produces calcite - a kind of natural cement . "
Mr Larsson got the idea for using the bacteria from a team at the University of California Davis , which had been investigating its use for solidifying the ground in earthquake prone areas .
Mr Larsson envisages injecting the dunes with the bacteria on a massive scale or using a barrage of giant bacteria - filled balloons .
" We allow the dune to wash over this structure then we would pop the balloon , " he told BBC News .
The scheme would also have advantages for nearby populations , he said .
For example , it could be excavated he said to provide shade , shelter or as a structure to collect water .
However , Mr Larsson admitted that the scheme faced numerous practical problems .
" There are many details left to explore in this story : political , practical , ethical , financial .
My design is fraught with many challenges , " he said .
" However , it 's a beginning , it 's a vision ; if nothing else I would like this scheme to initiate a discussion , " he added .
TED Global is a conference dedicated to " ideas worth spreading " .
It runs from the 21 to 24 July in Oxford , UK .

We ’re off to TEDGlobal for what ’s bound to be the intellectual equivalent of a Roman feast .
Starting tomorrow , you ’ll be able to follow along with exclusive daily updates , highlights and photos here on Brain Pickings .
But , in the meantime , what better way to celebrate the tremendously fascinating week ahead than with a special behind - the - scenes look at all the incredible energy — physical , intellectual , emotional — that goes into the making of a TED talk ?
In a way , this only confirms our belief that TED is very much in the package design business .
TED takes what ’s already out there — most speakers have published extensive books , written dry research papers , even given long talks at other conferences — and packages it brilliantly and beautifully .
Stuffed in a bite - sized 18 - minute box , glossed with shiny production value , and placed in the exuberant context of the ( as some would argue , “ cultish ” ) conference itself , each talk is a premium package that makes the ideas inside all the more appealing .
It makes them feel richer and more valuable and more meaningful , and thus , it makes them matter more .
And when ideas matter to us , we internalize them , we propagate and advocate them , we tell our friends about them , we make them — truly — ideas worth spreading .
So here ’s to intellectual package design — the true currency of ideas .

Most people who like puzzles or study computer science have probably encountered the famous N - Queens problem .
If you have n’t , before reading any further , try this online version of the most popular form , the 8 - Queens problem .
The 8 - Queens problem is to find positions on a chess board for eight queen chess pieces so that none of them “ threaten ” the others .
Since a queen in chess can move horizontally , vertically , and diagonally , this means placing each queen on her own horizontal , vertical , and diagonal lines .
The N - Queens problem is a generalization of the 8 - Queens problem with ( surprise ) N queens instead of 8 , on an N × N board instead of a standard 8 × 8 chess board .
In the spirit of Perl Golf , I wondered what the minimal amount of code would be to solve the N - Queens problem .
As an arbitrary target , I picked 140 characters , also the limit on message length imposed by Twitter .
I picked Haskell , knowing its list functions and generally terse syntax would come in handy .
Naturally , I broke all the conventions that would cost extra characters , like using whitespace and explicit function signatures .
Since Haskell modules have a bit of overhead that would use up my valuable characters , I had to cheat a bit by leaving the module declaration out .
The only way to run the program unmodified is to name it .ghci to trick GHCi into using it as a start script .
The result follows .
I used 140 characters exactly , including the newline character .
import Data .
List let nqueens n=[ zipWith ( \x y->x : show y ) [ 'a '.. ] x|x<-permutations [ 1..n ] , ( length$nub$zipWith ( + ) ( x++x ) $ [ 0,- 1..1 -n ]++[n.. ] ) ==n*2 ]
Pretty , eh ?
Fine , maybe not , but it works :
> nqueens 4 [ [ " a2 " , " b4 " , " c1 " , " d3 " ] , [ " a3 " , " b1 " , " c4 " , " d2 " ] ] > nqueens 5 [ [ " a2 " , " b4 " , " c1 " , " d3 " , " e5 " ] , [ " a3 " , " b1 " , " c4 " , " d2 " , " e5 " ] , [ " a3 " , " b5 " , " c2 " , " d4 " , " e1 " ] , [ " a4 " , " b2 " , " c5 " , " d3 " , " e1 " ] , [ " a2 " , " b5 " , " c3 " , " d1 " , " e4 " ] , [ " a1 " , " b3 " , " c5 " , " d2 " , " e4 " ] , [ " a4 " , " b1 " , " c3 " , " d5 " , " e2 " ] , [ " a5 " , " b3 " , " c1 " , " d4 " , " e2 " ] , [ " a1 " , " b4 " , " c2 " , " d5 " , " e3 " ] , [ " a5 " , " b2 " , " c4 " , " d1 " , " e3 " ] ]
The result is a list of queen positions given as coordinates on a chess board ( generalizing them in the obvious way ) .
As an example , the result [ “ a1 ” , “ b5 ” , “ c8 ” , “ d6 ” , “ e3 ” , “ f7 ” , “ g2 ” , “ h4 ” ] would look like this :
Before I explain how it works , I ’ll put the whitespace back in .
import Data .
List let nqueens n = [ zipWith ( \x y -> x : show y ) ['a '..] x | x <- permutations [ 1..n ] , ( length $ nub $ zipWith (+ ) ( x ++ x ) $ [ 0 , - 1..1 - n ] ++ [ n.. ] ) == n*2 ]
Ignore diagonal movements for now — we could call it the N - Rooks problem .
If we want to place N rooks on a chess board so none of them are threatened , each needs to be in its own column and row .
If you number the rows 1 , 2 , … , N , each solution corresponds to a permutation of these numbers .
The board above , for example , would be [ 1 , 5 , 8 , 6 , 3 , 7 , 2 , 4 ] .
So to solve the N - Rooks problem in Haskell , all we need is permutations [ 1..n ] .
That ’s a good start , but we have to consider the diagonal lines as well .
The simplest way to do this is to assign the columns numbers from 1 to N .
Then add those to the number of the row the queen in that column is in ( remember , since we are using permutations , there is exactly one queen in each column ) .
For example , if we add [ 1 , 5 , 8 , 6 , 3 , 7 , 2 , 4 ] and [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] , we get [ 2 , 7 , 11 , 10 , 8 , 13 , 9 , 12 ] .
The resulting numbers are all different , so the queens are all on different diagonal lines — at least for downward diagonals .
For upward diagonals , we could do the same thing but use [ N..1 ] instead of [ 1..N ] .
Since every character counts here , it ’s better if we can do both diagonal directions at once .
This complicates things a bit because without caution , the numbers for upward diagonal lines will overlap with those for downward diagonal lines .
Fortunately , we can just add a constant factor of at least 2N to either set of lines .
This is essentially what the code above does , although the arithmetic is a bit more cryptic to keep the character count down .
The resulting list will have 2N elements — N for the upward diagonal lines and N more for the downward ones .
Now we can use nub to rid the list of duplicates .
If the list had no duplicates — that is , each queen is on her own diagonal lines — the length of that list will still equal 2N after duplicates are removed .
That makes it a valid solution , so it is included in the result .
I should note that this algorithm is n’t ( nearly ) as efficient as a standard backtracking approach as described on Wikipedia ’s eight queens puzzle solutions article .
But good luck getting one of those solutions into a tweet .

As the week of Christmas approaches , the streets get adorned with lights and snow to fill the people with joy .
Everyone waits for the week to arrive to dive into the ultimate fun of the year .
While some people prefer to take a bite of cakes and meat , many others go for the Christmas special movies and TV shows .
But not many holiday - themed games come into the market every year to engage the kids and adults alike .
Here is a list of holiday - themed games that you can try out as you munch on the cakes .
Few of these games are recent entries , while some others are the old favorites .
Super Mario Odyssey ’s Snow Kingdom
Mario has been surrounded by different worlds , one that of sunny beaches and another one of spectacular snowy pathways .
There are hot deserts in here too , but what better than the Snow Kingdom to explore during Christmas .
The Santa hats and sleigh bells in the background make for the perfect virtual Christmas adventure .
Overwatch : Winter Wonderland
The festive character skins and the landscapes of snow are sure to entrance you in the world of Overwatch .
What kicked off on December 11 ended on January 2 , and the Winter Wonderland is about to take over the entire universe of Overwatch with the Yeti Hunter and Mei ’s Offensive Snowball .
Destiny 2 : The Dawning
This multiplayer shooter game celebrates Christmas with the blasts and shots in “ The Dawning . ”
The Tower gets all snowy in the new installment with the sleighs and Christmas setups .
The event runs up to January 1 with the ingredients for a perfect crunchy cookie in Eva ’s oven to sweeten the Christmas mission .
Dead Rising 4
How about some zombies in Santa hats and candy sticks to smash their heads ?
There is no better way to celebrate this season with the go - kart running over these man-eaters and weapons shooting right into their chest .
Malls and stores in the streets are full of zombies , that need to killed right away for your ultimate Christmas treat .
Dead Rising previously belonged to Xbox exclusively but has now been launched in PS4 as well .
Hitman 2 - Holiday Hoarders
Assasins all around the world has been hitting the hotels to slit throats and shoot right on the head of the villains .
Harry and Marv roam the cities of Paris only to be prey to the assassin ’s Christmas robe clutch .
Hitman is now on your PS4 , Xbox , and PC .
The Escapists : Santa ’s Sweatshop and Santa ’s Shakedown
What looks like the lego version of Escape Plan , is not as cute and silly as it may seem .
The Escapists is all about escaping prison and surviving the run through the snowy outsides of the prison enclosure .
You get to play as an elf in Santa ’s Sweatshop , which is a free add - on to the Escapists .
This add - on has more of the Christmas flair to it than the prison escape .
During the 20th century , the world ’s population nearly quadrupled , from 1.6 billion people in 1900 to 6 billion by century ’s end .
In that same period , the world ’s gross domestic product ballooned from $ 1.98 trillion to over $ 28 trillion ( both in 1990 dollars ) , according to author John R. McNeill .
Throughout this period of unprecedented economic expansion and population growth , humanity also transformed the earth .
“ This is the first time in human history that we have altered ecosystems with such intensity , on such scale , and with such speed , ” writes Mr. McNeill in his book “ Something New Under the Sun . ”
Vertebrate numbers are down by one - third since the 1970s , according to the WWF .
And between 20 and 30 percent of plants and animals are in danger of extinction with the temperature increases that are likely this century , says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
The plight of other living things aside , scientists worry that humanity ’s demands on – and disruption of – natural systems threaten their very ability to support people .
Scientists increasingly stress the need for active conservation – not just putting bits of nature off limits , but restoring degraded ecosystems .
The question is : Can ecosystems recover after such major disturbances ?
A new analysis in the June issue of the journal PLoS ONE finds that , if societies commit to cleanup and restoration , ecosystems can recover faster than previously thought .
Surveying 240 studies , scientists at the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies found that the speed of recovery depended upon the type of ecosystem and the growth rate of the organisms within it .
Forests recovered within 42 years , but ocean floors in less than a decade .
Polluted ecosystems – those plagued by oil spills , mining , trawling , or invasive species – could recover in just five years .
Only 15 percent were deemed beyond recovery .
The findings seem to contradict the popular notion that ecosystems take centuries or even millenniums to recover – boosting the rationale for proactive conservation .

Iran ’s president , under attack by reformists after his disputed election victory last month , on Tuesday openly defied his most powerful backer , refusing an order by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to dump a newly chosen vice president who is despised by hard - liners for insisting last year that Iranians had no quarrel with the Israeli people .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad finds himself under increasing pressure from Iranian hard - liners who appear eager to reap political rewards after leading a weeks - long crackdown on supporters of opposition figure Mir-Hossein Mousavi , who say vote fraud was responsible for Ahmadinejad ’s victory .
The leader of a hard - line scholars group linked to the Basiji militia said his organization would propose its own “ desired Cabinet lineup ” to the president .
“ Our organization intends to become the government ’s think tank , ” said Lotfali Bakh - tiari , leader of the group , in an interview published by Khabar newspaper .
“ We want to introduce our elite into the government to serve the country .
No obstacle is on our way , even the current climate of mistrust . ”

Ahmadinejad surprised many observers by defending the vice president , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , an in - law , in the face of a torrent of criticism from his hard - line allies .
News agencies confirmed Tuesday that Khamenei sent a letter to Ahmadinejad on Monday asking for the removal of Mashaei .
“ The president should announce the dismissal , or acceptance of the resignation of Rahim Mashaei right away , ” said Mohammad Hasan Abu- torabi , the deputy speaker of parliament , according to the semiofficial Iranian Students News Agency .
But Ahmadinejad insisted on state television that Mashaei “ will continue his job , ” adding , “ he is very loyal to the Islamic Revolution and a servant of people . ”

In the capital , hordes of Bakhtiari ’s plainclothes Basiji counterparts , wielding truncheons , appeared to lead the way Tuesday in menacing small groups of anti-government protesters seeking to mark a nationalist Iranian anniversary .
The protesters were part of a burgeoning political movement built on Mousavi ’s election campaign .
According to witnesses at the aborted rally , which drew hundreds , at least one woman lay unconscious on the ground after she was clubbed , as hundreds of militiamen and uniformed officers maintained control over the huge Seventh of Tir Square .
A hard - line military leader of the Revolutionary Guard on Tuesday threatened to broadcast confessions extracted from hundreds of prisoners detained at protest rallies as a way to “ restore confidence ” in the political system , an apparent answer to calls Monday by leading reformists for a national referendum on the results of the disputed June 12 election .

“ One solution to restore the lost confidence is to lay bare the dangerous scenarios designed by anti-regime think tanks led by reformist groups , ” Gen. Yadollah Javani told the official Islamic Republic News Agency .
“ It is necessary to broadcast the confessions of the detainees for the people so that they would understand who had designed the ‘ win by any means ’ strategy . ”
Leading Shiite clerics have issued religious decrees saying such confessions have no validity .
Among those arrested and held as political prisoners without access to counsel is the brother of Mousavi ’s wife , Zahra Rahnavard , the family confirmed Tuesday after a right - wing newspaper run by the Revolutionary Guard reported that he was in jail on charges of leading the unrest .
Opposition figures show no sign of relenting .
Mousavi ’s top lieutenant said in a report published early this morning on the website of Khabar that the former prime minister would announce the creation of a new political front by the end of the week .
Ali -Reza Beheshti told Khabar Online that the new political front would include both reformist and conservative political groups .

A day after Khamenei pointedly warned Iran ’s political elites to toe his line or risk “ flunking ” a test that they could never retake , Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani published a 40 - year - old excerpt from his memoirs in which he said “ the most important test is how to communicate with people . ”
In another act of criticism , Hassan Khomeini , a mid-ranking moderate cleric and the grandson of the Islamic Republic ’s revolutionary founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , reportedly left the country to avoid being present at official functions , including Ahmadinejad ’s upcoming inauguration .
The new vice president , Mashaei , who served as head of a state tourism organization during Ahmadinejad ’s first term , struggled to defend himself in a lengthy interview published on several websites Tuesday .
“ What I said has nothing to do with the Zionist regime , ” he said .
“ My remarks were a kind of psychological war against the usurper regime . ”
But hard - liners also dislike Mashaei because he was spotted on a trip to Turkey watching women dance , an act considered sinful by some Islamic hard - liners .

Moderates in parliament oppose the appointment because Ahmadinejad did not consult with lawmakers before making the announcement .

Special correspondent Ramin Mostaghim in Tehran contributed to this report .
The government could be building a giant map of social networks using Facebook and Twitter , scraping MySpace pages , or mining the metadata associated with cellular phone calls in order to look for communication patterns .
On the other hand , all of that computer power that the NSA is aggregating at the datacenters that are coming online could just be for the limited purpose of snooping voice calls and e-mail coming into and out of the US , but such narrow use is unlikely . �
What the NSA is doing with its massive and growing capabilities is still a secret , but it 's probably an extension of DoD efforts at mapping social networks that extend back to the early part of the decade .
A new EFF lawsuit filed this week could finally shed at least a little more light on the nature of these classified activities , so that we can know for sure whether some descendent of John Poindexter 's Total Information Awareness program lives on at the NSA .
Earlier this month , the EFF filed a Freedom of Information
Act request that sought to obtain the mandatory oversight records that agencies in - the - loop on these secret activities would have had to file — records that , at the very least , would indicate whether the filing agency thought these activities were legal .
The government has refused to produce the relevant records , so yesterday the EFF announced that it 's suing the government to get the administration to comply with the FOIA .
" By executive order , federal intelligence agencies must submit concerns about potentially illegal activity to the Intelligence Oversight Board and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , " EFF Open Government Legal Fellow Nate Cardozo said in a statement .
" Intelligence agencies are given a wide berth for national security reasons , but at a minimum they 're required to act within the limits of the law .
These records hold important details about how well the Executive Branch 's internal checks operate . "
In refusing to produce the records , the Obama administration is claiming a FOIA exemption for national security reasons .
But , if the acts covered in the requested documents are illegal , then this rationale wo n't work .
" You can't claim a national security exemption for illegal acts , " EFF Open Government Legal Fellow Nate Cardozo told Ars .
So the EFF wants to get a judge to at least look over the documents in order to determine if they describe illegal acts because , if they do , then they 'll have to be handed over to the EFF .
Since Congress does n't know and does n't apparently care if the NSA is doing that would 've been illegal before they amended FISA last year to authorize it , the Intelligence Oversight Board is our only hope of finding out what 's going on .
" If Congress has been kept in the dark , " Cardozo told Ars , " then the IOB is really it .
So the lawsuit is intended to figure out if the executive branch 's oversight machinery is functioning smoothly . "
The NSA was doing social networking before MySpace
As mentioned above , NSA is probably crawling the sudden explosion of social networking tools , making links between individuals and using data - mining technologies to construct elaborate maps of who associate with whom .
This may seem like a wild allegation , but we know that the Department of Defense ( of which the NSA is a part ) was exploring exactly this sort of social network mapping under the Total Information Awareness ( TIA ) program that was uncovered not long after 9/11 .
The DoD wanted to use communications metadata — essentially , the records that the phone company keeps of who talked to whom and when — to try to build maps of social networks well before users began building them themselves using tools like Facebook and Twitter .
The idea is that if you can link everyone in a giant social network , then you can identify pockets of suspected terrorists by first catching just one small fish and then surveilling his entire network until you 've identified a terrorist cell .
As we pointed out in our�initial coverage of the 2005 wiretapping story when the NYT broke it , TIA was uncovered in 2002 and shut down by Congress in early 2003 .
That was not long after the president had signed an executive order authorizing new surveillance powers for the NSA under the heading of the Presidential Surveillance Program .
The TIA itself was just a rebranding of an earlier program , and similar data mining efforts have been popping up around the executive branch ( DoD , DHS , TSA ) under different codenames for the past decade .
Of course , it 's not certain that one of these data mining efforts is , in fact , going on under the heading of the now - legal PSP .
It 's possible that the DoD could have just given up on its data mining ambitions .
I suppose one could imagine that , in the wake of 9/11 , at the height of the war on terror with the invasion of Iraq looming , the NSA looked at the datamining capabilities that other agencies like DHS and TIA were developing and said , " no thanks ... we 'll just stick to monitoring communications where at least one endpoint is outside the US . "
But given everything that has been uncovered in bits and pieces over the years ( see Further Reading , below ) , it seems warranted to speculate that the mysterious Other Intelligence Activities referenced in the recent OIG report ( see our coverage here and here ) include some type of datamining program that takes in data from the Internet and from voice networks in order to build maps and models of social networks .
And , given that there is a ton of social network data now freely available on the Web for anyone who wants to scrape and compile it , I have a hard time believing that the NSA would ignore all of that .

G8 Summit Fails On Climate Change
Opinion by Gilbert Mercier , NEWS JUNKIE POST
On July 8 , eleven Greenpeace activists climbed Mount Rushmore and hung a banner challenging President Obama to show real leadership on global warming and climate change .
The banner , measuring 65 feet high by 35 feet wide features an unfinished portrait of Obama .
Greenpeace USA Deputy Campaigns Director , Carroll Muffett stated :
“ This monument celebrates leaders who rose to the great challenges of our past .
Global warming is the greatest crisis humankind has ever faced and it is a defining test of leadership for this generation .
It is an open question whether President Obama will pass that test . ”
Judging by the lack of clear commitment by the G 8 and the developing economies such as India & China to cap carbon emissions and curtail global warming , it does n’t seem that neither President Obama nor the other leaders at the summit passed the test in question .
The resolution passed by the G8 is vague and just a little more than wishful thinking as opposed to any binding agreement for the G8 and the developing countries .
To make matters even worse , it was announced yesterday that the Senate will delay the vote on the climate change bill for a couple of months , arguing that their schedule is “ too busy ” as it is .
This is , once again , a clear indication that politicians are not fully aware of the urgency of the crisis and how their inaction will have catastrophic consequences for humankind .
This is the official declaration from the G 8 following the summit .
I had a subscription system running under WP - MEMBER for about a year before that software flaked out on me .
Multiple domains caused problems that were irreconcilable .
I had donations for our work in Africa coming in ( not through wp - member ) and a few hundred subscribers to Informer through wp-member .
All said , when I switched to Suma , I had 10,000 $ US in my personal paypal account .
That was my family ’s support money as well as money for our food program in Kenya .
So I shopped around and picked up Suma .
In the process , we had to switch to a business account ( although I do n’t understand why …wp - member was happily doing recurring payments without a business account ) .
That ’s when all hell broke loose .
Paypal required a proof of non-profit status ( we ’re not a non- profit yet , no 501c3 paperwork from IRS ) which we do n’t have ( I selected the wrong box I guess ) a printed bank statement ( harder to get than you might realize , being overseas ) which because a REAL problem because the account was in my name , not the business name and other information .
Because I could n’t provide some of the info ( 501c3 paper ) and the other info ( bank stuff ) took a LONG time , PayPal restricted my account , meaning my subscription payments are bouncing , and I ca n’t transfer money out of my account .
PayPal has frozen my assets .
We have no source of income beyond the car money we just spent in Kampala on Monday .
I may very well have to return to Kampala and get the car payment money back to live off of .
We are stranded financially and physically without a vehicle because of PayPal .
I ’ve called ( Contact PayPal Customer Support toll - free at 1-888-221-1161 ) to lift the restrictions , but they tell me to email service .
Emailing service is ridiculous , and a week goes by between responses .
Last I got from them was that I could n’t talk to them because I emailed from an address that was n’t on the PayPal account .
So I had to create another email account , and try again ( a painful process ) .
Now they are telling me that the bank info I provided is n’t correct because the bank account is n’t in the business name .
Now I have to switch bank accounts in PayPal ( again , overseas , less that dial - up , VERY HARD ) , get another statement to them and hope they accept it .
At that point they will probably deny me again because I have n’t sent them the 501c3 papers .
I asked to switch to a for - profit account ( even though we ’re not ) through the “ PayPal resolution center ” but have received no response .
This would remove the requirement for the 501c3 paperwork , but I have no faith in this process because everything submitted to the resolution center must be in a graphic format ( png , jpg , etc ) and I was forced to take a screen cap of a text document explaining my case .
( I mean seriously ? ? )
Nothing from them on switching to a for - profit account .
I ’d love to go back to having a personal account , but I ca n’t even imagine how I would request that , how long it would take , or if it would even be possible ,
The bottom line is PayPal has frozen my assets ( which are n’t theirs .. how can they do this ? ) including all the support money my family is relying on .
I ’ve spent hours on the phone ( on hold ) to PayPal at approximately 30 cents a minute to try to get this resolved only to be told to use email .
I ’m considering legal action over this .
HFC is at a complete standstill .
We can not order shirts for the conference .
Subscriptions are bouncing .
Informer is down .
Subscribers are ( rightly ) pissed because they do n’t have what they ’ve paid for .
I ca n’t order the items for the DEFCON auction .
There are too many problems to list here .
The biggest is that PayPal has locked down my family ’s survival money .
I have no clue what to do at this point .
Does the EFF have any leverage ?
I ca n’t tell you how tempted I am to just turn to the dark side here and …
RIO DE JANEIRO , Brazil ( CNN ) --
The Brazilian air force said that debris picked up Thursday near where officials believe Air France Flight 447 crashed Monday into the Atlantic Ocean was not from the plane .
Image released by the Brazilian Air Force shows oil slicks in the water near a debris site .
" It has been verified that the material did not belong to the plane , " Brigadier Ramon Borges Cardoso told reporters in Recife about the material recovered Thursday .
" It is a pallet of wood that is utilized for transport .
It is used in planes , but on this flight to Paris , there was no wooden pallet . "
He added that oil slicks seen on the ocean were not from the plane , either , and that the quantity of oil exceeded the amount the plane would have carried .
" No material from the airplane was picked up , " he said .
The announcement left open the question of whether other debris that had not yet been plucked from the ocean might be from the plane .
On Wednesday , searchers recovered two debris fields and had identified the wreckage , including an airplane seat and an orange float as coming from Flight 447 .
Officials now say that none of the debris recovered is from the missing plane .
Helicopters had been lifting pieces from the water and dropping them on three naval vessels .
Brazilian Air Force planes spotted an oil slick and four debris fields Wednesday but rain and rough seas had kept searchers from plucking any of the debris from the water .
Officials said searchers had found objects in a circular 5 - kilometer ( 3 - mile ) area , including one object with a diameter of 7 meters ( 23 feet ) and 10 other objects , some of which were metallic , Brazilian Air Force spokesman Jorge Amaral said .
The debris was found about 650 kilometers ( 400 miles ) northeast of the Fernando de Noronha Islands , an archipelago 355 kilometers off the northeast coast of Brazil .
Eleven aircraft and five ships are engaged in the search , including airplanes from France and the United States .
Earlier Thursday , a public interfaith service was held for the 228 victims at a 200 - year - old Catholic Church in downtown Rio .
Joining family members were members of the Brazilian armed forces , who are leading the recovery effort .
" Whoever has faith , whoever believes in God , believes in the eternity of the soul , " said Mauro Chavez , whose friend lost a daughter on the flight .
" This means everything . "
Investigators have not yet determined what caused the plane to crash .
The flight data recorders have not been recovered , and the plane 's crew did not send any messages indicating problems before the plane disappeared .
A Spanish pilot said he saw an " intense flash " in the area where Flight 447 came down off the coast of Brazil , while a Brazilian minister appeared to rule out a midair explosion .
Meanwhile , a report in France suggested the pilots were perhaps flying at the " wrong speed " for the violent thunderstorm they flew into early on Monday before the Airbus A330 's systems failed .
Le Monde newspaper reported that Airbus was sending a warning to operators of A330 jets with new advice on flying in storms .
As several ships trawled the debris site in the Atlantic , Brazil 's defense minister said a 20 - kilometer ( 12 - mile ) oil slick near where the plane , en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris , went down indicated it probably did not break up until it hit the water .
If true , that would rule out an in - flight explosion as the cause of the crash of Air France Flight 447 , Defense Minister Nelson Jobim told reporters .
However , both pilots of an Air Comet flight from Lima , Peru , to Lisbon , Portugal , sent a written report on the bright flash they said they saw to Air France , Airbus and the Spanish civil aviation authority , the airline told CNN .
" Suddenly , we saw in the distance a strong and intense flash of white light , which followed a descending and vertical trajectory and which broke up in six seconds , " the captain wrote .
Air Comet declined to identify the pilot 's name but said he waited until landing to inform Air Comet management about what he saw .
Air Comet then informed Spanish civil aviation authorities .
The Air Comet co-pilot and a passenger aboard the same flight also saw the light .
But Robert Francis , former vice chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board , said the question of determining where a plane broke up " is a very difficult one to deal with . "
He told CNN's " Anderson Cooper 360 " that " there are lots of things that cause a plane to go out of control . "
He added that extremely strong winds are not unusual near Brazil .
Pilots who fly over that part of the world keep track of radar and " are very , very wary about the weather as they go back and forth down in that area . "
Jobim said currents had strewn the debris widely and that the search area had been expanded to 300 square miles .
Watch report on the struggle to find pieces of the plane »
The Airbus A330 went down about three hours after beginning what was to have been an 11 - hour flight .
No survivors have been found .

The NTSB said Wednesday it has accepted an invitation from the French aviation accident investigation authority , the Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses , to aid in the investigation .
The aircraft 's computer system did send about four minutes of automated messages indicating a loss of cabin pressure and an electrical failure , officials have said .
Some investigators have noted that the plane flew through a severe lightning storm .
Foul play has not been ruled out .
Air France had received a bomb threat May 27 for a flight from Buenos Aires , Argentina , to Paris , sources in the Argentine military and police told CNN on Wednesday .
Watch as experts question whether recovery is possible »
According to the officials , who had been briefed on the incident and declined to be identified because of the ongoing investigation , the Air France office in Buenos Aires received the threat from a man speaking Spanish .
Authorities checked the Boeing 777 and found nothing .
Security was tightened during check - in for Flight 415 , which left on time and without incident , the officials said .
Most of the people on Flight 447 came from Brazil , France and Germany .
The remaining victims were from 29 other countries , including three passengers from the United States .
CNN correspondent John Zarrella in Rio de Janeiro and journalist Brian Byrnes from Buenos Aires contributed to this report .

Letting off some steam ( Image : Doug Allan / Getty )
IT IS one of the biggest mysteries in human evolution .
Why did we humans evolve such big brains , making us the unrivalled rulers of the world ?
Some 2.5 million years ago , our ancestors ’ brains expanded from a mere 600 cubic centimetres to about a litre .
Two new studies suggest it is no fluke that this brain boom coincided with the onset of an ice age .
Cooler heads , it seems , allowed ancient human brains to let off steam and grow .

GAZA ( Reuters ) - Israeli warplanes bombed tunnels beneath the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt Saturday killing two Palestinians , after militants fired several mortars at Israel from the coastal territory , medical workers said .
Medical workers who reached the area hours after the attacks said they had recovered the bodies of two Palestinian men involved in digging the subterranean passages Israel says are used to smuggle weapons into Hamas - ruled Gaza .
The men were the first fatalities in Israeli - Palestinian violence since early March when an Israeli missile killed a Palestinian militant Israel said was preparing to launch a rocket .
An Israeli military spokesman said Saturday ’s strikes targeted three tunnels used to smuggle weapons into the Gaza Strip near the town of Rafah , along the Egyptian border .
Israel had resumed aerial attacks Friday on the tunnels after a nearly two - month hiatus in fighting , after a rocket fired from Gaza struck inside Israel .
Israel said three mortars were fired at Israel from the northern Gaza Strip Saturday , causing no casualties .
The Palestinian Resistance Committees , a militant group in Gaza , claimed it had fired the mortars Saturday .
Militant rocket fire had dropped significantly since Egypt began efforts to consolidate the January 18 truce that ended Israel ’s 22 - day offensive against Gaza ’s Islamic militants .

Israel launched its war on the territory controlled by the Islamist Hamas movement in late December , with the aim of halting cross - border rocket and mortar attacks on the Jewish state by armed militant groups .
A Palestinian human rights organization says 1,417 people were killed , of whom 926 were civilians .
The Israeli military says the death toll was 1,166 of whom 295 were civilians .
2 HURT IN WEST BANK
Violence also was reported Saturday in the occupied West Bank where two Palestinian men were shot and wounded in clashes with Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers , Palestinian medical workers said .
The two sustained moderate injuries in the incident that erupted in a village near the town of Bethlehem where tensions have risen since the slaying last month of a settler boy from a neighboring Jewish enclave .
An Israeli army spokesman said soldiers fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse Palestinian protesters at the site .
Troops also arrested four Jewish settlers suspected of shooting at the Palestinian village , he said .
Israel has arrested a Palestinian suspect in the April 2 killing of the settler , 13 , in Bat Ayin .
Three Bat Ayin settlers were sentenced to prison terms of 12 to 15 years in 2002 for trying to set off a bomb near a Palestinian girls ’ school in Arab East Jerusalem .
Brazillian architect Marcio Kogan has designed House 53 in São Paulo , Brazil .

House 53 by Marcio Kogan
The House 53 volumetry was defined following São Paulo city building laws and the site ’s peculiar shape , which is just over 10 meters in front and approximately 30 meters in length .
According to the legislation one can build in the neighborhood up to a two - floor building , settled upon the site ’s lateral limits .
A third floor is allowed as long as the lateral setbacks are respected .
The house was conceived as a wood and mortar monolithic block with another concrete and glass volume upon it .
Due to the ground ’s small front and volumetry , the box ’s two edges had to make the most of light ’s entrance , which explains the large windows .
It was also desirable that these windows would make it possible to darken the internal environment whenever needed .
The house ’s inferior volume , which comprises the living room on the first floor , and the bedrooms on the second floor , is a glass box with wooden brises that open as folding doors .
The rooms ’ front and back facades were designed to be completely closed or opened .
From the outside , when the brises ( and the front wall , which follows the same language ) are closed , it´s impossible to distinguish the openings , and all wooden surfaces make up a pure single volume , without bumps .
When these brises are opened , the house looks like a large wood folding .

A £ 1bn government scheme to create jobs and work experience for unemployed young people is being launched today , with ministers saying it will ensure the country does not " lose a generation " to joblessness caused by the recession .
The future jobs fund is aimed at creating tens of thousands of jobs in sectors such as social care , education , tourism and sport .
It also aims to create around 10,000 internships and work placement opportunities for 18 to 21 - year - olds who have not been to university , as well as job clubs and a mentoring network .
The fund was announced by Alistair Darling in April 's budget .
Around £ 100 m of the money was later earmarked to help businesses specifically tackling social or environmental issues to create jobs .
Among the measures launching this week is a website promoting 2,000 internships available to graduates , with another 4,000 to be advertised in the coming weeks .
" We are determined not to lose a generation of talent because of the recession , " the work and pensions secretary , Yvette Cooper said .
" Many young people were denied the help they needed in the recessions of the 80s and 90s , ending up out of work for months and years .
Too many never got a start in the jobs market . "
The fund would create 47,000 jobs , Cooper said .
When the scheme was first announced , her department said its eventual aim was to bring 150,000 unemployed young people into work .
Young people 's job prospects have been hit particularly hard by the downturn .
Figures released in June showed there were 900,000 people aged 18 - 24 out of work , a rate of 16.6 % , the highest for 15 years .
This is expected to rise further as thousands of people leave schools , colleges and universities .
The future jobs fund is aimed mainly at those aged 18 - 24 who have been without work for a year or more .
Organisations and companies can bid for funding , set at a maximum of £ 6,500 per person , to help create jobs lasting at least six months which can both be set up quickly and will improve local communities .
The Conservatives have criticised the plans as insufficient given the current scale of youth unemployment .
John Wright , chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses , said the majority of his members would like to take on young trainees but tended to be put off by " the administration involved and the lack of financial support " .
Everyone ( well , mostly everyone ) is worried about the effects of climate change on global weather patterns .
But what if wind power–one of the most prominent clean energy solutions –affects the weather too ?
According to scientists at the University of Maryland , large wind farms could potentially change the weather patterns of areas downwind .
And that could lead to a whole new kind of NIMBYism .
Atmospheric scientist Daniel Kirk - Davidoff and his colleague Daniel Barrie calculated the effect of covering the Midwest with a grid of wind farms containing thousands of wind turbines .
The result ?
Wind speeds lowered 5.5 - 5.7 miles per hour directly downwind .
That ’s not too scary by itself , but the turbines also caused massive disruptions in air currents , leading to changes in the strength , motion and timing of storms over the entire North Atlantic .
This does n’t mean that we should stop building wind farms entirely ; it ’s not likely that the entire Midwest will be blanketed with a grid of wind farms anytime soon , and the same effect could happen when a new city layered with skyscrapers is built ( hint hint , China ) .
But it does mean that studies about wind turbine weather impact should be fleshed out before embarking on major turbine initiatives .
In the end , though , we may resign ourselves to the fact that any changes in storm intensity caused by wind farms is negligible compared to the wacky weather patterns caused by global warming .

Microsoft has released 20,000 lines of device driver code to the Linux community .
The software giant announced its move at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention in San Jose , Calif. , on July 20 .
The code , which includes three Linux device drivers , has been submitted to the Linux kernel community for inclusion in the Linux tree , Microsoft said .
The drivers will be available to the Linux community and customers alike , and will enhance the performance of the Linux operating system when virtualized on Windows Server 2008 Hyper - V or Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper -V , Microsoft officials said .
In a Q&A about the release of the code on Microsoft 's PressPass site , Tom Hanrahan , director of Microsoft 's OSTC ( Open Source Technology Center ) , said , " This is a significant milestone because it 's the first time we 've released code directly to the Linux community .
Additionally significant is that we are releasing the code under the GPLv2 [ General Public License Version 2 ] license , which is the Linux community 's preferred license . "
Hanrahan added , " Our initial goal in developing the code was to enable Linux to run as a virtual machine on top of Hyper - V , Microsoft 's hypervisor and implementation of virtualization . "
Sam Ramji , senior director of Platform Strategy in Microsoft 's Server and Tools organization , said part of Microsoft 's motivation behind this move is to help companies cope with " the current economic climate , " which calls for increased heterogeneity .
Moreover , " there 's mutual benefit for customers , for Microsoft , and for commercial and community distributions of Linux , to enhance the performance of Linux as a guest operating system where Windows Server is the host , " Ramji said .
Ramji also noted that Microsoft is involved in other open - source efforts .
Ramji said :
" Examples can be found in the work we have done with the PHP Community , which has involved contributing to the PHP Engine , optimizing PHP 5.3 to perform strongly on Windows , and working to improve the performance of numerous PHP applications on Windows .
Then there is the ongoing participation in various Apache Software Foundation projects , such as Hadoop , Stonehenge and QPID .
In addition to this , we worked to improve interoperability with Axis2 and provided support to the Firefox community to optimize Firefox for Vista and Windows Media Player . "
In a statement , Novell said : " As a leading Linux solutions provider and an active player in the Linux community , Novell was influential in bringing this about and has worked closely with Microsoft to make this a reality .
Under the direction of Novell Fellow Greg Kroah - Hartman , who leads the Linux Kernel Device Driver project , Novell proactively engaged with Microsoft to provide valuable guidance and feedback to the Open Source Technology Center , which enabled the team to contribute the code in a way that was in line with community processes . "
Meanwhile , in a blog post , Novell CTO Jeff Jaffe said :
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Apple Inc said it was awaiting results from an investigation into the death of a worker in China , after media reports said the man killed himself on learning he was suspected of leaking company secrets .

The case puts the spotlight on Apple , whose public face as maker of the wildly successful iPhone contrasts with its reputation for a highly secretive corporate culture .
“ We are saddened by the tragic loss of a young employee and we are awaiting the results of the investigation into his death , ” Apple said in a statement released in the United States on Tuesday , declining further comment .
“ We require that our suppliers treat all workers with dignity and respect , ” it added .
Apple ’s iPhones are made in south China by its contract manufacturing partner Foxconn International , a unit of Taiwan electronics giant Hon Hai .
Foxconn said in a statement that a worker named Sun Danyong , who had joined the company in 2008 , had committed suicide and expressed its condolences to his family .
“ The company has noticed there has been much detailed discussion on the Internet and welcomes public discussion on how to help Foxconn ’s management where it is lacking , ” Foxconn said in a statement .
“ We will scrutinize those places ... and strengthen our assistance to young employees , ” it added
Foxconn did not go into the details surrounding Sun ’s death .
But according to a report in the influential Nanfang Daily , Sun , a 25 - year - old product manager , became frantic after discovering that one of 16 prototypes of Apple ’s fourth - generation N90 iPhone had gone missing .
The iPhone is Apple ’s hottest - selling device and the latest version is a well - kept secret .
Sun vented his growing frustration in text messages to his girlfriend and a former classmate , and tried to find the missing device , the Nanfang Daily said .
But company officials from Foxconn ’s security division apparently got suspicious and raided his home .
The Yunnan native jumped from his 12th floor apartment the day after , according to the report .
The incident , which triggered an investigation from local police and within Foxconn itself , sparked a Web firestorm in China and has provoked criticism of Apple ’s intensely guarded culture .
The company has previously threatened lawsuits against media and bloggers that try to publish information about its upcoming products , often arguing they obtained the information from employees who violated confidentiality agreements .
The court agreed that firms had systematically lied about health risks
A US appeals court has largely upheld a landmark ruling that cigarette makers lied about the health risks of smoking .
Washington 's Court of Appeals rejected an appeal by tobacco firms against a 2006 decision that banned labels such as " low tar " and " light " .
Companies including Philip Morris USA were found guilty of racketeering and fraud over the issue .
Judges upheld the previous ruling , but excluded one firm and two trade groups from their judgement .
They ruled that the trade bodies - Council for Tobacco Research - USA and Tobacco Institute - had not made or sold products , so could be excluded .
And the firm Liggett was excused because it had co-operated with the authorities and acknowledged health risks .
But the judges rejected an argument from the other tobacco firms that they had never claimed that " light " cigarettes were less harmful .
" Defendants knew of their falsity at the time and made the statements with the intent to deceive , " Friday 's ruling said .
Denials
The 2006 ruling said firms had set up a " gentlemen 's agreement " not to compete over whose cigarettes were the least damaging to health .
Lawyers for the tobacco companies denied that they had conspired to avoid public discussion of health risks .
The original ruling also required firms to issue " corrective statements " about health effects and addiction .
It has not been applied while the case has been under appeal .
Murray Garnick , lawyer for tobacco firm Altria - the parent company of Philip Morris - said the court 's ruling was " not supported by the law or the evidence presented at trial " .
" We believe the exceptional importance of these issues justifies further review , " he said .
Other companies that were contesting the 2006 ruling included British American Tobacco , Lorillard Tobacco , RJ Reynolds Tobacco , and Brown & Williamson Tobacco .
The companies are now likely to take their appeal before the US Supreme Court , although commentators say that their chances of success are slim .
In a decision last December on an unrelated case , the Supreme Court ruled that smokers can sue tobacco firms over the misleading marketing of " light " or " low tar " cigarettes .

Project FreeDos started at 1994 when Microsoft announced that with release of alpha version of Windows 95 will stop to work on DOS operating system .
This announcement becomes a challenge of nostalgic DOS users ( as myself ) to continue development of DOS ( but started from scratch as open source ) known as project FreeDOS .
The founder was Jim Hall , and co-founders were Pat Vilani and Tim Norman .
In that time the project name was PC DOS , but later , the project got new name – FreeDos ( 1996 ) .
A long development cycle has resulted a stable version 1.0 in 2006 which is also current these days .
This week the project celebrates its 15th birthday .
So , Happy Birthday FreeDOS .

MILWAUKEE ( AP )  Josh Willingham ( FSY ) put the ball from his second grand slam , inscribed with all the details , into an acrylic cube .
His bat was staying in circulation for now , even if the Hall of Fame asked for the lumber .
" No , no way , " he said .
" Well , when I break it , I 'll give it to them . "
Willingham hit two grand slams and tied a franchise record with eight RBIs , powering the Washington Nationals to a 14 - 6 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday night .
" That 's the beautiful thing about baseball , " he said .
" You come into the game before the game and you never know what could happen . "
Willingham became the 13th player to hit two grand slams in a game and first since Boston 's Bill Mueller ( FSY ) hit one from each side of the plate on July 29 , 2003 , against Texas .
Willingham 's eight RBIs were the most in Nationals history and tied the franchise mark , accomplished last by Tim Wallach for Montreal against San Diego in 1990 .
" It 's something that when I was coming up to the plate the second time I knew that I had a chance to do it , " Willingham said .
" Obviously I was n't thinking about doing it , I was n't trying to do it .
I was just trying to get a good pitch to hit and hit it hard . "
Willingham hit his 15th homer off Jeff Suppan ( FSY ) ( 5 - 8 ) with two out in the fifth , capping a six - run inning with a 400 - foot drive to left - center that struck the facing of the second deck .
He connected again in the sixth , finishing a seven - run rally with a one - out shot off Mark DiFelice ( FSY ) that hit the fencing above the Brewers ' bullpen and dropped in to make it 13 - 5 .
" Everything 's got to be lined up right for you .
You 've got to be seeing the ball good , hitting the ball good and your teammates have to have been on base for you all night — twice , " Washington interim manager Jim Riggleman said .
Willingham said he realized the significance of his milestone as soon as he knew his second shot was gone .
" I did n't know that 13 was the number , but I knew it was a rare feat and I was thinking about it , " he said .
Willingham , who also doubled in the second , finished 3 for 5 and Ryan Zimmerman ( FSY ) hit a solo homer in the eighth for the Nationals , who have won three straight to raise their major league - worst record to 31 - 68 .
Willingham was due up fourth in the order when Zimmerman hit his homer .
" I told Zimmerman , I was like , ' Well , get on for me so I have a chance to hit with the bases loaded again . '
Then he hits a home run and I said , ' Why 'd you do that ? " '
Willingham joked .
Jason Bergmann ( FSY ) ( 1 - 1 ) pitched 1 ⅓ innings after rookie Craig Stammen ( FSY ) was pulled one out short of qualifying for the win with Washington clinging to a 6 - 5 lead .
With series against the Nationals and San Diego , this was supposed to be the point of the schedule where the Brewers made up some much needed ground .
Milwaukee is actively looking to trade for a starting pitcher before Friday 's deadline , but it may not matter much .
The Brewers have allowed nine homers in the last four games .
Corey Hart ( FSY ) hit his second homer in as many days and Ryan Braun ( FSY ) added a two - run shot but the Brewers ( 49 - 50 ) fell below .500 for the first time since April 27 .
They are 7 - 15 since entering July with a two - game lead in the NL Central .
" The fans are getting a little restless and I do n't blame them , " Brewers manager Ken Macha said .
" We can't continue to have to get four innings from the bullpen every night . "
Willingham 's homers overshadowed a less - than - stellar start by Stammen .
The rookie right - hander trailed 2 - 0 before Willingham put him ahead 6 - 2 after Suppan allowed an RBI single to Nyjer Morgan and walked Adam Dunn ( FSY ) with the bases loaded earlier in the fifth .
Milwaukee cut it to 6 - 5 on Felipe Lopez 's ( FSY ) RBI single and Braun 's 20th homer , chasing Stammen with two outs in the fifth .
Suppan allowed 10 runs and 10 hits in 5⅓ innings .
NOTES : Willingham has four career grand slams .
His first two were in 2007 with the Marlins .
...
The Nationals can match their season - best winning streak with a victory Tuesday .

1 . Set in the desert of Dubai , the Tiger Woods Golf Course uses 4 million gallons of water every day to maintain its lush appearance .
2. Since 1950 , water usage in the United States has risen 127 percent .
3 . Even though each person only requires 48 liters of water on a daily basis , individuals in the United States use an average of 500 liters , those in Canada an average of 300 liters and those in England an average of 200 liters .
4 . Of all the water that enters each household , about 95 % of it ends up down the drain .
5 . With access to just 5 liters of water each day , more than a billion people in water poor regions around the globe survive on the same amount used to flush a toilet or take a 5 - minute shower .
6 . If you shorten your showers by just a single minute , you can save approximately 700 gallons of water in a month .
7 . Letting the tap run when you brush your teeth wastes up to 4 gallons of water every time .
8 . It takes an average of 300 gallons to water your lawn .
During the summer , this can account for almost half of your water usage .
9 . Every time you throw your clothes in the washer , you use about 50 gallons of water .
10 .
Another wasteful desert endeavor , the proposed Waveyards water park in Mesa , Arizona will require up to 100 million gallons of groundwater every year in an area that receives a mere 8 inches of rainfall in that time .
So , what can we do ?

Quarrel on the Titanic
ONE OF THE HAPPIEST moments in my life occurred in a restaurant .
It happened before the second intifada .
I had invited Rachel to celebrate her birthday with dinner at a famous restaurant in Ramallah .
We were sitting in the garden under strings of colorful lights , the air was fragrant with the perfume of flowers and the waiters were hurrying back and forth with laden trays .
We ate Mussakhan , the Palestinian national dish ( chicken with tahini baked on pita bread ) , and I drank arak .
Our waiter , who had overheard us talking , took our order in Hebrew .
We were the only Israelis there .
At the nearby tables , Arab families with the children in their best clothes , as well as a bride and groom with their wedding guests .
Bursts of laughter punctuated the murmur of Arabic conversations , and spirits were high .
I was happy , and a sigh escaped me : “ How wonderful this country could be , if only we had peace ! ” I THINK of that moment every time I hear sad news from Ramallah .
The news is depressing , but the memory helps me to keep alive my hope that things could be different .
The most depressing news concerns the split between the Palestinians themselves .
This split is a disaster for them , and , I believe , also for Israel and the world at large .
That ’s why I dare to comment on a matter that seemingly does not concern us Israelis .
It does .
It is easy to blame Israel .
Easy and also justified .
In their struggle against the national aspirations of the Palestinians , successive Israeli governments have applied the old Roman maxim divide et impera , divide and rule .
Since the Oslo agreement , the central component of this policy has been the physical separation between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
Article IV of the Oslo Agreement of September 1993 says : “ The two sides view the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as a single territorial unit , whose integrity will be preserved ” .
Article X of Annex 1 of the Interim Agreement of September 1995 says : “ There shall be a safe passage connecting the West Bank with the Gaza Strip for movement of persons , vehicles and goods … Israel will ensure safe passage for persons and transportation during daylight hours … in any event not less than 10 hours a day . ”
In practice , the safe passage was never opened .
Among all the blatant violations of the Oslo agreements , this was the most severe .
Its consequences have been disastrous for both sides .
True , there was a lot of talking about the passage .
Ehud Barak once fantasized about constructing a giant bridge between the West Bank and the Strip , after seeing such a 40 km long bridge somewhere abroad .
Others spoke about a tunnel underneath Israeli territory .
Yet others proposed an extraterritorial highway or railway .
None of these ideas was ever implemented .
On the contrary , while before Oslo there had been free movement for all , including the inhabitants of the occupied territories , after Oslo this freedom was abolished .
THE PRETEXT was – as always – security : convoys of murderers and terrorists would pack the safe passage , trucks loaded with Palestinian rockets would drive to and fro .
But the consequences disclose the true aim : what remained of Palestine was cut into two disconnected parts .
One can not rule a territory without physical contact with it .
That was proven in Pakistan , which was founded as a state with two disconnected parts separated by Indian territory .
Soon enough , war between the two broke out and the Eastern part became the independent state of Bangladesh .
According to the latest Palestinian statistics , which seem reliable , there are now 2.42 million Palestinians living in the West Bank and 1.46 million in the Gaza Strip ( in addition to 379 thousand in East Jerusalem ) .
From Yasser Arafat I once heard that more than half of the Palestinian Authority ’s resources were being devoted to the Gaza Strip , in spite of the fact that the Strip amounted to only 6 % ( one sixteenth ) of the Palestinian territories .
Now there exist in practice two Palestinian entities : the West Bank , whose actual capital is now Ramallah , and the Gaza Strip , with its capital Gaza city .
From the political , economic and ideological points of view , the distance between them is growing .
And from the point of view of the Israeli occupation policy , that is a great victory .
THE ISRAELI government conducts different strategies against the two Palestinian entities .
Against Gaza , the policy is simple and brutal : to overthrow the Hamas government by turning the life of those 1,460,000 men and woman , old people and children , into hell .
They are allowed to bring in only the most basic foodstuffs .
There was an international outcry when Senator John Kerry discovered the import of noodles is prohibited , because pasta is apparently a luxury .
“ We shall not give them chocolate when Gilad Shalit is not getting chocolate , ” an army officer declared this week .
It would be interesting to know how much chocolate the 11 thousand Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails are getting .
The war against Gaza ( “ Molten Lead ” ) was intended to wreak death and destruction upon the civilians , so that they would rise up and overthrow their elected government .
The dead are already buried , but the piles of rubble remain .
The Israeli government does not allow building materials to be brought in , and the inhabitants have started to build homes of mud , as their ancestors did centuries ago .
( To make the whole thing even more depressing , it is forbidden to bring in toys , books and musical instruments . )
The Egyptian government cooperates with the Israeli army in enforcing the blockade on the inhabitants of Gaza .
Lately it has intensified its efforts to choke the essential supply line through the Rafah tunnels ( “ smuggling ” in Israeli and Egyptian parlance ) .
The campaign recently started by the Egyptian authorities against Hizbullah agents in Sinai has the aim , among others , of cutting this pipeline .
The Gaza people have not toppled the Hamas government .
On the contrary , their opposition to the Ramallah government seems to be growing , and some say that it is turning into pure hatred .
AGAINST THE Palestinian Authority in the West Bank , the occupation authorities employ a different , but no less destructive , strategy .
They make every effort to present it as a kind of Palestinian Vichy regime , in order to prevent the healing of the Palestinian rift .
The Israeli government declares this openly and loudly .
This week , the Chief of Staff , Gabi Ashkenazi , wondered publicly how the Palestinian Minister of Justice could sue Israel before the International Criminal Court for war crimes committed in Gaza .
How come , Ashkenazi complained , when throughout the Gaza War there was such close cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority ?
In other words , the Chief of Staff of the Israeli army declares publicly before the Palestinian people and the entire world that the Palestinian leadership in Ramallah cooperated with the Israeli government in the war against their Palestinian brothers in Gaza , in which - according to the Ramallah Minister of Justice - systematic war crimes were committed .
A more damaging blow to the standing of Mahmoud Abbas can hardly be imagined .
Other Israeli officers do not spare their praise for the Palestinian security forces , which – they allege - cooperate with the Israeli army in eliminating Hamas sympathizers in the West Bank .
It is hard to imagine that such statements by the occupation officers will do anything to elevate the standing of Abbas in the eyes of the Palestinians , who see with their own eyes how the settlements on their land grow daily .
This week , a friend told me about a conversation he had with a Palestinian official from Ramallah .
If Israel attacks Iran , he said with great enthusiasm , the Hamas regime in Gaza will collapse .
For an outsider looking in , this is incomprehensible .
When the entire Palestinian people is facing a danger to their very existence , when the Israeli government is working tirelessly to make it impossible for a Palestinian state to come into being and there is a real threat that the Palestinian people will be eventually driven out of Palestine altogether , the split resembles a quarrel on the bridge of the Titanic .
THERE IS an old Jewish saying that “ the destruction of the temple ( in the year 70 A.D. ) was caused by mutual hatred . ”
When the Romans were already besieging Jerusalem , the various Zealot factions in the beleaguered city burned each other ’s stocks of food .
Among the Palestinians , such things are happening right now .
Disunity has always been a curse .
In 1948 , when they were fighting for their survival , they were unable to form a unified leadership and a unified military force .
In practice , every village fought alone , without coming to the aid of its neighbors .
Otherwise , perhaps , the Naqba would not have happened , and the untold suffering that continues to this very day would have been prevented .
The main result of the disunity 61 years ago was that the Palestinians were unable to establish the State of Palestine next to the State of Israel , and the territory allotted for it by the UN was divided between Israel , Jordan and Egypt .
Yasser Arafat understood this well .
He made a huge effort to maintain the unity of his people at almost any cost .
As long as he was alive , this unity was maintained .
The secret services that planned his murder obviously wanted to sabotage this unity , much as Yitzhak Rabin ’s murderers wanted to destroy the peace process .
The two murders complemented each other , and not by accident .
Anyone who believes that peace is essential for the two peoples and for the entire world must fervently hope for the establishment of a Palestinian unity government .
I believe that this is still possible .
IT SEEMS that in this matter , too , Barack Obama must play a leading role .
He must put an end to the stupid and disastrous policy of boycotting Hamas and employ his full power to bring about the creation of a Palestinian unity government .
Perhaps it will have to be , in the beginning , a kind of super - government under which both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip keep some kind of autonomy .
Peace among the Palestinians themselves is a necessary precondition for peace between Israel and Palestine .
Only Israeli - Palestinian peace can also bring about reconciliation between the two peoples and perhaps restore the atmosphere of that magic evening in the Ramallah restaurant – so that it will not remain just a sweet memory .
Study gives clues to increasing X - rays ' power
Three - dimensional , real - time X - ray images of patients could be closer to reality because of research recently completed by scientists at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln and a pair of Russian institutes .
In a paper to be published in an upcoming edition of Physical Review Letters , UNL Physics and Astronomy Professor Anthony Starace and his colleagues give scientists important clues into how to unleash coherent , high - powered X - rays .
" This could be a contributor to a number of innovations , " Starace said .
Starace 's work focuses on a process called high - harmonic generation , or HHG .
X - ray radiation can be created by focusing an optical laser into atoms of gaseous elements – usually low - electron types such as hydrogen , helium , or neon .
HHG is the process that creates the energetic X - rays when the laser light interacts with those atoms ' electrons , causing the electrons to vibrate rapidly and emit X - rays .
But the problem with HHG has been around almost as long as the onset of the method in 1988 :
The X - ray light produced by the atoms is very weak .
In an effort to make the X - rays more powerful , scientists have attempted using higher - powered lasers on the electrons , but success has been limited .
" Using longer wavelength lasers is another way to increase the energy output of the atoms , " Starace said .
" The problem is , the intensity of the radiation ( the atoms ) produce drops very quickly . "
Instead of focusing on low - electron atoms like hydrogen and helium , Starace 's group applied HHG theory to heavier ( and more rare ) gaseous atoms having many electrons – elements such as xenon , argon and krypton .
They discovered that the process would unleash high - energy X - rays with relatively high intensity by using longer wavelength lasers ( with wavelengths within certain atom - specific ranges ) that happen to drive collective electron oscillations of the many - electron atoms .
" If you use these rare gases and shine a laser in on them , they 'll emit X - Rays with an intensity that is much , much stronger ( than with the simple atoms ) , " Starace said .
" The atomic structure matters . "
Starace said that unlocking the high - powered X - rays could lead one day , for example , to more powerful and precise X - ray machines .
For instance , he said , heart doctors might conduct an exam by scanning a patient and creating a 3D hologram of his or her heart , beating in real time .
Nanoscientists , who study the control of matter on an atomic or molecular scale , also may benefit from this finding , Starace said .
Someday , the high - intensity X - rays may be used to make 3D images of the microscopic structures with which nanoscientists work .
" With nanotechnology , miniaturization is the order of the day , " he said .
" But nanoscientists obviously could make use of a method to make the structures they 're building and working with more easily visible . "

Cons : Lacks detail of jQuery UI
Reviewed by : Ian Elliot jQuery , despite its name does n't have anything to do with database or queries - unless you are thinking of selecting objects in the Document Object Model of a web page .
jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library that makes working with the DOM much , much easier .
If you want to create dynamic web pages that have extensive work done to them on the client side of the interaction then jQuery is an excellent choice .
It 's also an open source library which makes it free to use and you can always read the code if something does n't work .
However , as is the case with most open source software , the documentation just does n't keep pace with the project .
The good news is that jQuery in Action is actually more reliable than the on- line documentation .
It 's a practical book that explains how jQuery works without digging into the details of its implementation .
It attempts to give you the flavour of the philosophy behind the design and explains how best to use it .
While there are some useful appendices that explain some of the basics and also more exotic aspects of Javascript , you really do need to know the language and understand the way that it interacts with the DOM .
The book starts off gently with basic principles , moves on to consider the key idea of the " wrapped set " and how to pick out particular DOM elements .
It then describes how you can use jQuery to modify the DOM and hence create dynamic or customised web pages .
Next we move on to consider how jQuery makes event handling easy and relatively browser - independent .
Then there is an easy approach to Ajax and on to animation , which while not jQuery 's strong point , is still worth using .
Finally we take a look at adding to jQuery by way of how to write and use plug-ins .
It does touch on jQuery UI , which is a growing but currently very messy area of jQuery , but not at sufficient length to make sense of it .
The omission of a good guide to the UI is perhaps something to be put right in the next edition .
You definitely get the impression that there are two authors at work - one who likes short pithy examples that explain the basic operations and another who likes longer examples that show the technology in context .
For my money the short examples work better but if you prefer studying the longer models they are n't too difficult .
This is n't the best book that could be written on jQuery but it is currently the best there is .
It 's good enough to need to be kept next to your keyboard as you work so that you can look things up , and this is a rare honour .

An Australian stroke victim paralysed for more than 20 years has walked again thanks to anti-wrinkle drug botox , in a case hailed as extraordinary by his medical team .
Russell McPhee , 49 , was confined to a wheelchair after suffering a severe stroke 23 years ago that left him so disabled that doctors initially told him he would never leave hospital .
But after being injected with botox , the anti-ageing treatment popular among Hollywood celebrities , McPhee can walk around his home unaided and travel up to 100 metres ( 330 feet ) using a walking stick .
" I thought I was going to die in a wheelchair , " McPhee told AFP .
The former meatworker admitted he and girlfriend Kerry Crossley were initially sceptical when told about the treatment .
" ( Kerry ) chipped in and said ' what , do n't you think he 's pretty enough ? ' "
McPhee said .
Botox , or botulinum toxin , blocks the nerve signals which tell muscles to contract , flattening wrinkles when used on the face .
But it can also help patients left immobile by brain injuries , multiple sclerosis , spinal problems or strokes .
Valentina Maric , physiotherapist at the St. John of God Hospital in Victoria state , explained that McPhee was unable to walk because the stroke had left his muscles in permanent spasm .
" The muscles were turned on all the time because of the messages coming from his brain , " she said .
The botox stopped the spasms , Maric said , allowing the McPhee to stretch out the affected leg muscles for the first time in decades and strengthen other muscles needed for walking .
She said muscles that had not been used for so long would normally have withered away , but McPhee 's were remarkably intact , leading to rapid progress after he started the treatment 18 months ago .
" You usually see results in someone who has recently had a stroke but we 've never has such a good response from someone so far down the track ( decades after a stroke ) , " Maric said .
" The botox provided the kickstart needed to start the treatment . "
However , doctor Nathan Johns stressed that McPhee 's muscle strength and determination were a key element in his remarkable progress .
" Not every case is so successful , " he said .
" Mr McPhee had unusually good muscle power and great determination , despite the fact that he had been confined to a wheelchair for so long . "
McPhee said he had been forced to push through the pain barrier to become mobile again .
" It 's not just a matter of getting your botox injection then going to bed and being able to walk in the morning , it takes a lot of hard work , " he said .
He says inspiration came from girlfriend Kerry , a childhood sweetheart who rescued him from a spiral of depression and talked him into rehabilitation when they were reunited two - and - a - half years ago .
" I was in a pretty bad way with depression , " said McPhee , who played football , cricket , basketball and tennis -- " any sport you like " -- before his stroke .
" I felt like my life was over . "
With the help of Kerry and the team from St. John of God , McPhee hopes that one day he will no longer need the three - monthly botox shots in his legs and arm .
McPhee said he was working on making his non-spastic muscles strong enough to compensate for the ones that contract , creating a long - term solution to his condition .
" That 's the aim , " said McPhee , adding that he also plans to marry Kerry .

Why do some couples sizzle while others fizzle ?
Social scientists are studying no - sex marriages for clues about what can go wrong in relationships .
Married men and women , on average , have sex with their spouse 58 times a year , a little more than once a week , according to data collected from the General Social Survey , which has tracked the social behaviors of Americans since 1972 .
But there are wide variations in that number .
Married people under 30 have sex about 111 times a year .
And it ’s estimated that about 15 percent of married couples have not had sex with their spouse in the last six months to one year , according to Denise A. Donnelly , associate professor of sociology at Georgia State University , who has studied sexless marriage .
I recently spoke with Professor Donnelly about how much researchers really understand about no -sex marriages .
Here ’s our conversation .
Q .
Is there any indication that the sexless marriage is becoming more common ?
Or are we just hearing about it more ?
A .
I suspect that we just hear more about it .
Back in the days before reliable birth control , having a sexless marriage was one way of limiting family size .
Those were also the days when women were not supposed to enjoy sex and often used it as a bargaining tool in their marriages ( because they were socialized to do so ) .
Plus , unhappy couples ( who are less likely to have sex ) were more likely to stay together because of social expectations , or because they had children they were raising .
Q .
Why does a marriage become sexless ?
Does it start that way ?
Or does sex fade ?
A .
The answer to that one is both .
Some of the people in our sample never had much sex from the beginning , while others identified a particular time or event ( childbirth , affair ) after which sex slowed or stopped .
Some people become accustomed to their spouse , bored even , and sex slows .
For others , it is the demands of raising a family , establishing a career , and mid-adulthood .
And there are people who have very low sex drives , and may even be asexual .
They may have some sex with their partners to begin with , but it becomes unimportant to them ( and usually not so unimportant to their spouses ) .
These folks may also be dealing with guilt , issues with the human body , or feel that sex is “ dirty ” or only for procreation .
A small number of couples showed a mixed pattern , where they would have periods of “ feast ” and of “ famine . ”
Q .
Are couples in sexless marriages less happy than couples having sex ?
A .
Generally , yes .
There is a feedback relationship in most couples between happiness and having sex .
Happy couples have more sex , and the more sex a couple has , the happier they report being .
But keep in mind that sex is only one form of intimacy , and that some couples are fairly happy ( and intimate ) even without sex .
In my 1993 study , I did find that people in sexless marriages were more likely to have considered divorce than those in sexually active marriages .
There is no ideal level of sexual activity — the ideal level is what both partners are happy with — and when one ( or both ) are unhappy , then you can have marital problems .
Q .
Can people in a marriage that has become sexless rekindle their sex lives ?
A .
Some do .
But once a marriage has been sexless for a long time , it ’s very hard .
One or both may be extremely afraid of hurt or rejection , or just entirely apathetic to their partner .
They may not have been communicating about sex for a very long time ( if ever ) and have trouble talking about it .
Couples who talk over their sex lives ( as well as other aspects of their marriages ) tend to have healthier marriages , but it ’s hard to get a couple talking once they ’ve established a pattern of non-communication .
There are mixed opinions about what to do to rekindle marital sex .
For some couples , it may be as simple as a weekend away from the kids , taking a vacation or cruise , or just having some time off , alone .
Others may need help in re-establishing communication and may seek professional assistance .
The sad fact is that there are few counseling professionals that deal with this issue .
Often , marriage counselors focus on other aspects , rather than sex .
While these other aspects may play a big role in sexual inactivity , talking explicitly about sex is essential .
Q .
Are people in sexless marriages more likely to get divorced ?
A .
In my studies , as well as others , people in sexless marriages report that they are more likely to have considered divorce , and that they are less happy in their marriages .
Some of our former respondents have kept in touch with me , and the happiest ones are actually those that have moved on to other partners .
It may be that lack of sex is a signal that all intimacy in a marriage is over , and that both would be happier in other situations .
I know that this may not be a popular idea with the religious and political right , but it may be a better solution than staying in a marriage that is hurtful and unfulfilling .
In sum , these situations are just so complicated .
Each couple has to examine their specific histories , their motivations and goals , and whether it is worth it to them to work on putting sex back in the marriage .
It can be a difficult task and require that people take emotional and physical steps that are n’t comfortable for them .
Q .
What else are you trying to learn about sexless marriages ?
A .
I ’m hoping to begin some longitudinal work which follows couples over time , to try and understand better the processes they experience , how they make decisions , and how these decisions affect their future happiness .
Ultimately , I ’d like to know how those who were able to repair their sexual relationships did so .
Krugman acknowledges in the last paragraph of his column that " we have a long - run budget problem , and we need to start laying the groundwork for a long - run solution .
But when it comes to inflation , the only thing we have to fear is inflation fear itself . "
Krugman is an able economist .
He is also a fiercely partisan liberal .
He is the gingham dog to Milton Friedman 's calico cat .
His column of today is slash and burn economics .
If there is any responsible economist who believes that the nation is on the verge of a hyperinflation , I do not know who it is , and Krugman names no names .
In fact the danger of inflation in the short run is minimal , but the qualification is essential and can nowhere be found in the column .
He explains why it is minimal , but not clearly , and let me try .
Suppose ( the example is ridiculous , but I think illuminating ) that the national income is $ 1,000 and that it is spent entirely on consumption goods , which consist solely of ten 1983 Chevrolet Caprices .
Then the average price of a Caprice will be $ 100 .
The following year , all the Caprices bought the previous year having rusted away , ten more 1983 Caprices are brought to market .
Only this time the government has doubled the supply of money .
Again the entire national income , now $ 2,000 , is spent on the Caprices , so the average price is now $ 200 .
That is inflation -- an increase in price due solely to an increase in the ratio of money in circulation to the goods available for purchase .
But " in circulation " is vital .
For suppose that , in this second year , the people become fearful and decide to stuff half their income under their mattresses .
As a result , only $ 1,000 is spent on Caprices , and so the average price is unchanged , even though the supply of money has doubled .
For it is only money that is put to use to buy things that influences prices .
As Krugman points out less clearly than he might have done , the depression has caused both banks and individuals to hoard cash .
The cash that the Federal Reserve has pumped into the economy by buying bonds has mainly ended up as " excess reserves " of banks , meaning lendable cash ( as opposed to " required reserves , " the cash that the regulatory authorities require the banks to hold on to , either in their vaults or as accounts with a federal reserve bank , rather than lend or otherwise invest ) that the banks are sitting on rather than lending or otherwise investing .
And the personal savings rate has soared because people are worried about the economic situation and so are cutting back on spending and , if they can afford to , saving more of their income instead .
But the curtailment of spending is , we hope , a temporary condition .
As the economy improves , the banks will start to lend , and individuals will spend more .
The excess reserves will become money in circulation ( before the onset of the current depression , total excess bank reserves were only about $ 2 billion ) .
And so there will be a risk of inflation .
The Federal Reserve can , in principle anyway , prevent the risk from materializing , by selling its huge inventory of public and private debt and retiring the cash that it receives in exchange .
But by sucking cash out of the economy it will drive up interest rates , which will impede recovery from the depression , because high interest rates curtail lending and therefore spending .
So it may forbear , and the consequence may be inflation .

Labour has suffered its worst post - war election result after it was beaten into third place by UKIP and saw the BNP gain its first seats at Brussels .
Labour 's share of the vote at the European elections was just 15.3 % - worse than party bosses had feared .
The Tories won with 28.6 % , beating Labour in Wales but failing to increase their total share significantly .
The results have sent shockwaves through UK politics and led to renewed calls for Gordon Brown to quit as PM .
The BNP gained a seat in Yorkshire and Humberside and in the north west of England , where party leader Nick Griffin was elected - the first time the anti-immigration party has won seats at national elections .
' Two - fingered salute '
Their result was condemned across the political spectrum , with both the Tories and Labour calling it a " sad day " for British politics .
Health Secretary Andy Burnham said : " The BNP is like the ultimate protest vote .
It is how to deliver the establishment a two - fingered salute .
I think largely it is a comment on Westminster politics . "
But in his victory speech , Mr Griffin said he was " absolutely delighted , " adding " it will be a huge change in British politics " .
He said " The most demonised and lied about party in British politics has made a massive breakthrough .
The public have had their say in a democratic election and we should respect that . "
With results in Northern Ireland still to come , it is clear that Labour suffered one of its most abject results of all time .
' Dismal ' result
Its deputy leader Harriet Harman conceded there had been a " big fall " in the Labour vote and it appeared Labour had been hit " much harder " by anger about MPs ' expenses .
" It was a dismal result , " she said .
" We have to understand the concerns that people are expressing and address them . "
But she backed Gordon Brown saying he was " resilient " and would sort out the economy and expenses .
" What we wo n't be doing is wringing our hands , being disunited , " she said .
Conservative leader David Cameron said he was " delighted " with the results : " The Conservative party were the clear winners in these elections .
" We topped the poll , we increased our share of the vote , increased our number of MEPs , we won in almost every part of the country and had some staggering results like topping the poll in Wales . "
' Mocked and derided '
He said taken with last week 's local election results it showed " an enormous gap opening up between Labour and Conservative " with the Tories " almost getting twice as many votes as Labour last night " .
Other UK - wide Westminster parties effectively trod water on their 2004 European results , with the Lib Dems coming fourth and the Tories increasing their share by just over 1 % .
This left the smaller parties to benefit - possibly from public anger over the MP expenses scandal .

UKIP , which campaigns for Britain 's withdrawal from the EU , gained 17.4 % of the vote and increased its number of MEPs to 13 - beating Labour into third place .
Leader Nigel Farage said his party 's performance was a " hell of an achievement " which sent a clear signal to Gordon Brown .
" He has been beaten by a party that he mocked and derided as being on the fringes - so if we have beaten him , he has got to go , " Mr Farage said .
In two English regions , the South - East and South - West , the Green Party beat Labour into fifth place .
' Solid result '
Nationally , the Greens increased their share of the vote to 8.7 % but leader Caroline Lucas blamed the electoral system for her party 's failure to gain more than its current two MEPs .
" In the South East we have increased our vote by 50 % and we are disappointed it has not translated into a second seat , " Ms Lucas said .

The Lib Dems saw their share of the vote shrink slightly on 2004 , but leader Nick Clegg told the BBC that taken with last week 's local election results , his party had a strong platform to make gains against Labour at a general election .
" On the European vote we held our own , we actually added an MEP - would I have liked to have done even better , yes of course but I think given the very volatile nature of the elections it was a solid result . "
He said Labour 's 12 - year dominance of British politics was over and the party " finished " .
Turnout down
In Scotland , SNP leader Alex Salmond hailed a " historic " victory after the Nationalists hammered Labour .
Across Scotland the SNP secured 29 % of the vote to Labour 's 21 % , comfortably achieving the target the SNP leader had set his party at the start of the campaign .
Welsh Labour also suffered humiliation in the European elections , with the Conservatives topping the poll .
It is the first time since 1918 Labour has failed to come first in a Welsh election , as its vote dropped by 12 % .
Labour , Conservatives and Plaid Cymru won a seat each , as did UKIP , which will send its first Welsh MEP to Brussels .
The turnout , with Northern Ireland yet to declare , is around a third of the vote , down 4 % from 2004 , but that is largely down to the fact that some areas had all - postal ballots last time .
The results are likely to pile further pressure on Gordon Brown , who faces a crunch meeting of Labour MPs on Monday , which may decide his future .
ROUND -UP OF OPINION ON LABOUR'S FUTURE
After disappointing results for Labour in the European Elections , columnists and commentators speculate on what this will mean for Gordon Brown and the Labour party .
Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan calls for Gordon Brown to call an Election in the Telegraph blog :
If Labour MPs put their terror of the electorate above any considerations of patriotism or democracy , they will do irreparable damage , not just to their party 's long - term prospects , but to representative democracy .
This is your last chance , comrades .
Labour MP Sally Keeble used the Guardian 's Comment is Free column to explain why she is withdrawing support for Gordon Brown :
They look to the government for high quality public services , and a sense of purpose and direction for the country .
The prime minister has to articulate that and , sadly , it has n't happened .
Not that there is an alternative on offer from the other main parties .
The Times leader article urges the Labour Party to act quickly :
It needs to be said with great clarity : these results are terminally disastrous for the Labour Party .
It is still an open question , however , whether the Labour Party wishes to draw any conclusions from this electoral rout about the future of its leader
The next few days could set the course of Labour politics for a generation .
If the party decides to stick by Mr Brown it is likely he will lead them to a large defeat .
The first years of opposition could be wasted in a war to assign blame
But the moment is upon them .
The Cabinet risks being written off as a collection of cynics and cowards .
It is almost too late .
Boris Johnson says in the Telegraph that the reason Labour backbenchers are n't revolting against Gordon Brown shows they are more bothered about their own finances than the country :
Now is the moment for all the guilty men and women who claimed for plasma TVs and bath plugs and Peperamis to show that they are willing to put the interests of the country first , jettison Gordon , and have an election .
To persist with Gordon is an admission that the cause is lost , and that the best bet is for the maximum number of Labour MPs to hang on to their seats and their dosh for as long as possible
The Guardian , which historically supports Labour , continues to ask for a general election to be called :
The public mood is clearly for a general election , not because there is great enthusiasm for the opposition ( the European results and strength of minor parties shows there is not ) but because people think this parliament has no legitimacy .
The Guardian 's Economics Editor Larry Elliott suggests that if Gordon Brown stays on , he 'll be able to cash in on the recovery of the economy :
Labour reached its political nadir this weekend .
If , as now seems probable , the worst of the downturn occurred between the ¬collapse of Lehman Brothers in September and the G20 meeting in London in early April , the government at least has a political narrative for voters in the run-up to the election : thanks to our efforts , things are getting better .
The Sun's Political editor George Pascoe - Watson says there 's only one way for Brown to get his authority :
Tonight party backbenchers and Peers will decide if it is time to kill off the battered Premier .
The PM is preparing to buy them off by promising an Iraq War probe and will shelve plans to sell off the Royal Mail within days ...
The only real way for Mr Brown to reassert his authority is to hold a general election and win it .
The Daily Mail 's Melanie Phillips says that Lord Mandelson is the real person running the Cabinet , but he wo n't be able to save the government :
For all his efforts , Mandelson may not save Brown either .
Lord Falconer added to the pressure yesterday by calling for a debate over the leadership ; tonight , the Parliamentary party might deliver the coup de grace .
But a new leader wo n't save them - and neither will a propped - up Gordon Brown .
It 's the Labour Government that is the problem ; and it's Labour , whether Lord Mandelson and the rest of them realise it or not , whose time is now up .
Peter Riddell in the Times thinks the European election results give Labour MPs a dilemma :
Labour MPs will return to Westminster today in a very gloomy mood .
Their choice is whether to challenge Mr Brown now or to acquiesce , however reluctantly , in the reshuffle and leadership counter - attack .
The odds are that the plotters will get nowhere this week and Mr Brown will survive in the short - term .
But that will not end the complaints or doubts about his leadership .
The European results underline just how unpopular Labour is .
July 21 , 2009  -- Dr. Regina M. Benjamin , Obama 's pick for the next surgeon general , was hailed as a MacArthur Grant genius who had championed the poor at a medical clinic she set up in Katrina - ravaged Alabama .
But the full - figured African - American nominee is also under fire for being overweight in a nation where 34 percent of all Americans aged 20 and over are obese .
Critics and supporters across the blogsphere have commented on photos of Benjamin 's round cheeks , saying she sends the wrong message as the public face of America 's health initiatives .
But others support the 52 - year - old founder and CEO of Bayou La Batre Rural Health Clinic , citing new research that shows you cannot always judge a book by its cover when it comes to obesity .
Even the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance -- whose slogan is " we come in all sizes " -- has jumped to her defense .
" The job of surgeon general is to make health care and policy decisions for the country -- not to look hot in a pair of skinny jeans , " said one blogger on Frisky.com .
" Perhaps her size could actually be an advantage -- she 's in a better position to understand obesity and contemplate out - of - the - box ways to roll back ever - expanding American waistlines . "
40 Pounds Over , Size 18 , Blogs Speculate
Bloggers on Salon.com speculated that Benjamin is 40 pounds overweight , perhaps a size 18 .
The nominee did n't return calls from ABCNews.com , so there is no information about how much she weighs or her eating and exercise habits .
Spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services Jenny Backus issued this statement : " Dr. Benjamin is a highly qualified physician who has dedicated her life to providing care to her patients .
She is a role model for all of us , and will be an outstanding surgeon general . "
Even some of the most reputable names in medicine chimed in .
" I think it is an issue , but then the president is said to still smoke cigarettes , " said Dr. Marcia Angell , former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine who is now a senior lecturer at Harvard University Medical School .
" It tends to undermine her credibility . "
" We do n't know how much she weighs and just looking at her I would not say she is grotesquely obese or even overweight enough to affect her health , " Angell told ABCNews.com .
" But I do think at a time when a lot of public health concern is about the national epidemic of obesity , having a surgeon general who is noticeably overweight raises questions in people 's minds , " she added .
Obesity Epidemic Plagues U.S .
The potential for hypocrisy bothered others .
" When a teenager listens to this person I want them to listen and respond in a positive way , " said Lillie Shockney , administrative director of the Johns Hopkins Avon Foundation Breast Center .
" Not say ho - hum and then drive to a fast food place . "
The controversy swirled on the Internet just as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans its end - of - month " Weight of the Nation " forum to address strategies to deal with the obesity epidemic .
During the past 20 years obesity has dramatically increased in the United States and is considered a major health risk for cardiovascular disease , diabetes and cancer , costing the nation billions of dollars a year in health care costs .
In 2008 , only one state , Colorado , had an obesity rate of less than 20 percent .
In states like Alabama , Mississippi , Oklahoma , South Carolina , Tennessee and West Virginia , the prevalence is greater than 30 percent .
Dr. Sarah Lester , a pediatrician from Andover , N.H. , told ABCNews.com she lost 30 pounds , setting a good example for her patients ' families .
" I do think it makes a big difference , " said the 38 - year - old .
" Many ask me how I did it and when I tell them more exercise and eating less many are disappointed .
However when they hear even for me there is n't a magic bullet , I think it helps . "
Obesity More Prevalent Among Blacks , Latinos
New CDC data show that compared with whites , African Americans have a 51 percent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics have 21 percent higher obesity prevalence .
Some say that as an African American , Benjamin could set a better example .
" It is important to ' walk the walk and not just talk the talk , ' " said James Anderson , a professor of medicine and clinical nutrition at University of Kentucky Medical Center .
" Oprah struggles as a role model and has given up , as I understand it .
Rumor has it that President Obama still smokes .
We need role models who are attempting to be leaders for change in health and lifestyle to be role models . "
But other top health professionals argue that one can be fit and fat .
" I thank God that Dr. Regina Benjamin is a fat woman , " said Joanne Ikeda , a nutrition specialist at the University of California , Berkeley .
" Maybe now we will stop making the assumption that all fat people are unhealthy particularly in light of new data coming from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey . "
Data from that survey show that more than half of so - called overweight people are metabolically healthy , compared to one - quarter or about 16.3 million adults 20 years or older , who are " metabolically abnormal . "
The study emphasizes looking at a person 's metabolic health -- blood pressure , cholesterol , inflammation and sugar level indicators -- as a better diagnostic tool for future health problems .
" I am appalled that this amount of bias and discrimination exist regarding large people , " said Steven Blair , professor of exercise science at Arnold School of Public Health , University of South Carolina .
" The focus should be on Dr. Benjamin 's credentials and accomplishments .
What difference does her size make ? "
Bias Against Obese People
The former CEO of the Cooper Institute agreed that it is impossible to determine from a photo whether someone is eating a healthy diet or exercising regularly , the cornerstones of physical fitness .
" I cannot resist stating that although too many people assign all sorts of bad traits to overweight / obese people , from being lazy , poor workers , I can think of some pretty bad characters who are thin , " he said .
Blair , who told ABCNews.com that he is also overweight , said " even people who are obese are themselves biased . "
That negative stereotype even colors national research , which puts an emphasis on caloric intake rather than energy expenditure , according to Blair .
" Should the face of public health practice a healthy lifestyle ? " he asked .
" Yes , she should not smoke or engage in other unhealthy behaviors and not exercise .
I have been harping on this for the last 10 to 15 years .
Let 's focus on healthful behaviors instead of the way they look . "
But Dr. Otis Brawley , chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society , and an African American , said there may be " some discrimination people do n't realize . "
" Obesity has a huge environmental component and is rooted in how one is fed in childhood and what physical activities you partake in the inner city , " he told ABCNews.com .
Poverty , Obesity Go Hand in Hand
" Poverty is conducive to obesity , " said Brawley .
" I think Dr. Benjamin may understand the root causes and effectively address the problems more than skinny people . "
Dr. Susan Love , president of the eponymous research foundation , said Benjamin was attacked because she was a woman , reminding that the former surgeon general C. Everett Koop was " no string bean . "
" Now I do suspect some of the questioning is a sexist thing in that as a society we still promote the thin , trim female -- a fact that might be a contributor to our problems with eating disorders , " said Connie Diekman , a registered nurse and director of university nutrition at Washington University in St. Louis , Mo .
Patients also came to her defense .
" Doctors are human , too , " said Chris Hill , a 51 - year - old " overweight " pharmacist from El Paso , Texas .
" They get sick , smoke , overeat and die like everyone else .
Everyone does not have to look like a TV anchor in order to do a good job etc .
Being healthy and tiny are not the same things .
Are you saying overweight people can't or should n't be professionals ? "
" My primary care doctor was overweight and was always telling me I needed to lose a few pounds , " said Adeeba Deterville , a 47 - year - old consultant from Oakland , Calif .
" I did feel it was odd for her to be advising me , when she needed to do it herself .
However , I also found some comfort in knowing that she was struggling too and that helped me feel " not preached to .
I knew she could relate . "
Dr. Clyde Yancy , president of the American Heart Association , said he was " incredulous " at the criticism .
" For the surgeon general to fulfill her responsibility goes beyond anything such as a physical metric , " he told ABCNews.com .
" What we need are health care leaders who are qualified , passionate , results - oriented and part of a team for the great good .
She is all that . "

Traffic Generates High Levels of Polluted Air Causing Premature Births
Added by viorel on Jul 03 , 2009 | Visited by 4563 | Voted by 70 persons
Air pollution is not only hazardous for the environment , it also has a negative effect on pregnant women .
It was discovered that pregnant women who live near the roadways are considerably increasing the risk of premature birth .
American scientists carried out a study in Los Angeles , the city famous for its endless traffic jams .
They found the pregnant women living in the roadways of the Los Angeles area double the risk of premature birth .
Previously it was known that smog negatively influences human health , especially the health of those who suffer from asthma , high blood pressure and diseases related to cardiovascular system .
All these people worsen their state when exposed to an increased level of air pollution .
The team of researchers led by Jun Wu of the University of California discovered that air pollution from the car emissions has a negative effect of pregnant women that lived as far as three kilometers from a major roadways .
Some roads in the area are stuffed with vehicles during the day , which creates huge smog in the air .
After analyzing medical records of 81,186 single child births and the levels of air pollution in the region , scientists found that women exposed to increased level of air pollution had 128 percent increase of a severely premature birth .
In addition , exposure to air pollution increases the risk among pregnant women aged between 33 and 42 of developing preeclampsia , a disorder in which hypertension arises during pregnancy and affects both the mother and baby inside the womb .
The condition forces doctors to induce premature birth to be able to save mothers \ ' lives .
This information needs to be spread since a lot of women are unaware of the negative influence of living near car - stuffed streets , when the level of pollution registers a dramatic increase .
It is advised that women close all windows and turn on their air conditioning in order to filter the air .
It is not the only study to analyze the connection between premature birth and air pollution .
A number of researches were conducted over the last few years , in which scientists found more evidence of the way air pollution impacts pregnancy .
Another pregnancy problem besides premature birth is overall low birth weight .
In addition , pregnancy problems could lead to serious health problems of the child later in life .
Michael Brauer of the University of British Columbia backs the study and says that doctors should stars warning women about the potential risks especially if women are to become mother soon .
He considers that the warnings should be issued in the same way as those that caution about smoking , alcohol consumption and drinking energetic drinks that contain high level of caffeine .
\ " There is probably enough information now to make general statements about air pollution .
It depends on what things people can modify in their life , but it might be a good idea to limit your time near traffic or change when you commute so it \'s not during rush hour , \ " concluded Brauer .
Let ’s face it , we all have our morning addictions – some of us have to choke down a Venti black eye with two Splendas just so we do n’t chop our bosses head off with a rusty butter knife when we get to work .
Others need to rub one out in the shower with our girlfriend ’s Vanilla Jasmine body wash to get our day started off right .
And then there are those of us who , before we even drain the main vein , open our eyes , roll over , grab the trusty one - hitter of off the night stand , fire that sucker up and drag in a lungful of the good ole Grape Ape in order to put the right spin on our day .
What many like to call – The Wake n’ Bake .
Now , I ’m more of a " Wake n' BATE " kind of guy myself but I have plenty of friends who need to get high before they climb out of bed .
Some people may consider this a drug problem ; I however , think they are genius .
I mean , come on , can you think of a better time of day to get baked ?
These glorious Wake n’ Bakers have no problem getting stoned at 7:45 a.m. , and in all honesty , I am jealous as hell .
The Wake n’ Baker knows how to handle their weed , something I alas , do not .
If I got high first thing in the morning there is no way in hell I could function for the rest of the day .
People at work would wonder why the fuck I was staring at my flying toaster screen saver for five hours while shoveling massive handfuls of Cheeze - Its into my pie-hole and giggling like a moron at everything my annoying born - again cubicle mate Tammy says ( on second thought , maybe I should give this a try after all ) .
Seriously , think about all the things you like to do first thing in the morning – eat cereal , watch kid ’s shows , and suck down gallons of Sunny Delight .
Now , think of all the things you like to do when you get blazingly high – eat cereal ( either Fruity Pebbles or Coco - Puffs – Trix are for jag - offs ) , watch kids shows ( “ Yo Gabba Gabba ” will blow your fucking mind – and teach you not to say mean things to friends , it ’s not nice ) and suck down gallons of Sunny Delight ( I think they might put crack in Sunny D – it tastes like shit but I can never seem to get enough of it – especially when high ) .
The Wake n’ Bake may not be for everyone , but for those of you who can and do , I say to you …Bravo !
If you like to Wake n’ Meth though , you might have a serious hard core drug problem – but you will save money on toothpaste .

The events preceding Goldman Sachs ' new " blowout profits "
Monday July 13 , 2009 06:14 EDT
Remember all of this -- the $ 700 billion bank bailout , the AIG scandal , dark and scary threats of imminent global meltdown if there was n't full - scale capitulation by the citizenry to the immense transfer of public wealth to the private investment banking sector ?
Such distant , hazy memories : so many exciting celebrity deaths and riveting celebrity resignations ago .
If sequences of events like these do n't cause mass citizen outrage , then it's hard to imagine what will :
The New York Times , September 19 , 2008 :
WASHINGTON --
It was a room full of people who rarely hold their tongues .
But as the Fed chairman , Ben S. Bernanke , laid out the potentially devastating ramifications of the financial crisis before congressional leaders on Thursday night , there was a stunned silence at first .
Mr. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. had made an urgent and unusual evening visit to Capitol Hill , and they were gathered around a conference table in the offices of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
" When you listened to him describe it you gulped , " said Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York .
As Senator Christopher J. Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee , put it Friday morning on the ABC program " Good Morning America , " the congressional leaders were told " that we 're literally maybe days away from a complete meltdown of our financial system , with all the implications here at home and globally . "
-- SNIP-- When Mr. Schumer described the meeting as " somber , " Mr. Dodd cut in .
" Somber does n't begin to justify the words , " he said .
" We have never heard language like this . "
ABC News , September 26 , 2008 :
The embattled Goldman Sachs investment banking firm and its employees have spent more than $ 43 million dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions to cultivate friends and buy influence in Washington , D.C. since 1989 , according to an ABC News analysis of campaign finance records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics .
As a group , Goldman Sachs bankers have been the country 's top political campaign contributors this year and have given $ 29.5 million in contributions since 1989 , according to the Center .
" They are almost in a class by themselves , " said Sheila Krumholz , the executive director for the Center for Responsive Politics .
" Their top executives are in a class that is way above the clout and name - dropping that most other American businesses can achieve , " says Krumholz .
The New York Times , September 27 , 2008 :
Two weeks ago , the nation 's most powerful regulators and bankers huddled in the Lower Manhattan fortress that is the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , desperately trying to stave off disaster .
As the group , led by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , pondered the collapse of one of America 's oldest investment banks , Lehman Brothers , a more dangerous threat emerged : American International Group , the world 's largest insurer , was teetering .
A.I.G. needed billions of dollars to right itself and had suddenly begged for help .
One of the Wall Street chief executives participating in the meeting was Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs , Mr. Paulson 's former firm .
Mr. Blankfein had particular reason for concern .
Although it was not widely known , Goldman , a Wall Street stalwart that had seemed immune to its rivals ' woes , was A.I.G.'s largest trading partner , according to six people close to the insurer who requested anonymity because of confidentiality agreements .
A collapse of the insurer threatened to leave a hole of as much as $ 20 billion in Goldman 's side , several of these people said .
Days later , federal officials , who had let Lehman die and initially balked at tossing a lifeline to A.I.G. , ended up bailing out the insurer for $ 85 billion .
MSNBC , October 3 , 2008 :
President Bush signed into law Friday a historic $ 700 billion bailout of the financial services industry , promising to move swiftly to use his sweeping new authority to unlock frozen credit markets to get the economy moving again .
. . .
But Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Md. , said compromise was needed .
He said that while he strongly opposed the Senate 's decision to pay for many of the tax breaks with debt , he could not forget everyday Americans at home who were struggling .
" For their sake , we must act , " Hoyer said in a floor speech .
Wall St. Journal , October 6 , 2008 :
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is expected to tap Neel Kashkari , a key adviser on whom he has come to rely heavily during the financial crisis , to oversee Treasury 's $ 700 billion program to buy distressed assets from financial institutions , according to people familiar with the matter .
Mr. Kashkari , 35 years old , a Treasury assistant secretary for international affairs and a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker , is expected to be named interim head of Treasury 's new Office of Financial Stability as early as Monday .
The position confers substantial power on Mr. Kashkari . . . .
New York Times , December 13 , 2008 -- " A Champion of Wall Street Reaps Benefits " :
Senator Schumer plays an unrivaled role in Washington as beneficiary , advocate and overseer of an industry that is his hometown 's most important business .
An exceptional fund raiser -- a " jackhammer , " someone who knows him says , for whom " ' no ' is the first step to ' yes , ' " -- Mr. Schumer led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for the last four years , raising a record $ 240 million while increasing donations from Wall Street by 50 percent .
That money helped the Democrats gain power in Congress , elevated Mr. Schumer 's standing in his party and increased the industry 's clout in the capital .
But in building support , he has embraced the industry 's free - market , deregulatory agenda more than almost any other Democrat in Congress , even backing some measures now blamed for contributing to the financial crisis .
. . .
But Mr. Schumer , a member of the Banking and Finance Committees , repeatedly took other steps to protect industry players from government oversight and tougher rules , a review of his record shows .
Over the years , he has also helped save financial institutions billions of dollars in higher taxes or fees .
He succeeded in limiting efforts to regulate credit - rating agencies , for example , sponsored legislation that cut fees paid by Wall Street firms to finance government oversight , pushed to allow banks to have lower capital reserves and called for the revision of regulations to make corporations ' balance sheets more transparent .
USA Today , January 27 , 2009 :
WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner picked a former Goldman Sachs lobbyist as a top aide Tuesday , the same day he announced rules aimed at reducing the role of lobbyists in agency decisions .
Mark Patterson will serve as Geithner 's chief of staff at Treasury , which oversees the government 's $ 700 billion financial bailout program .
Reuters , March 16 , 2009 :
President Barack Obama 's nominee to oversee U.S. futures markets , who has confessed he should have done more to rein in exotic financial instruments that have battered global markets , was approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee on Monday .
The approval of Gary Gensler , a former Goldman Sachs executive , clears the way for a Senate vote putting him in charge of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
He was approved by a roll - call vote .
Robert Reich , March 18 , 2009 :
We 've also learned that much of the 170 billion has been used by AIG to pay off AIG 's putative obligations to other Wall Street banks such as Goldman Sachs .
Goldman has maintained that it got no bailout money from the Treasury .
But in fact it received some $ 13 billion through AIG .
More troubling is that the original plan to bail out AIG was concocted at a meeting held last fall , run by then Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson who , before becoming Teasury Secretary , had been CEO of Goldman Sachs .
Also attending the meeting was Lloyd Blankenfein , the current CEO of Goldman Sachs .
Also at the meeting : Tim Geithner , then head of the New York Fed .
Tom Edsall , The Huffington Post , April 2 , 2009 :
Decisions made during the final months of the Bush administration created an environment in which the most politically connected investment banks , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , not only flourished , but saw their competitors laid waste , with firms like Lehman in bankruptcy , and others , like Merrill Lynch and Bank of America , forced to merge in desperate hope of surviving .
Former federal bank regulator Bill Black , The Bill Moyers Show , April 3 , 2009 :
BLACK : The Bush administration and now the Obama administration kept secret from us what was being done with AIG .
AIG was being used secretly to bail out favored banks like UBS and like Goldman Sachs .
Secretary Paulson 's firm , that he had come from being CEO .
It got the largest amount of money .
$ 12.9 billion .
And they did n't want us to know that .
And it was only Congressional pressure , and not Congressional pressure , by the way , on Geithner , but Congressional pressure on AIG .
Where Congress said , " We will not give you a single penny more unless we know who received the money . "
And , you know , when he was Treasury Secretary , Paulson created a recommendation group to tell Treasury what they ought to do with AIG .
And he put Goldman Sachs on it .
MOYERS : Even though Goldman Sachs had a big vested stake .
BLACK : Massive stake .
And even though he had just been CEO of Goldman Sachs before becoming Treasury Secretary .
Now , in most stages in American history , that would be a scandal of such proportions that he would n't be allowed in civilized society .
MOYERS : Yeah , like a conflict of interest , it seems .
BLACK : Massive conflict of interests .
MOYERS : So , how did he get away with it ?
BLACK : I do n't know whether we 've lost our capability of outrage .
Or whether the cover up has been so successful that people just do n't have the facts to react to it .
The Washington Post , April 4 , 2009 :
Lawrence H. Summers , one of President Obama 's top economic advisers , collected roughly $ 5.2 million in compensation from hedge fund D.E.
Shaw over the past year and was paid more than $ 2.7 million in speaking fees by several troubled Wall Street firms and other organizations .
. . .
Fees ranged from $ 45,000 for a Nov. 12 Merrill Lynch appearance to $ 135,000 for an April 16 visit to Goldman Sachs , according to his disclosure form .
New York Times , April 27 , 2009 :
An examination of Mr. Geithner 's five years as president of the New York Fed , an era of unbridled and ultimately disastrous risk - taking by the financial industry , shows that he forged unusually close relationships with executives of Wall Street 's giant financial institutions .
His actions , as a regulator and later a bailout king , often aligned with the industry 's interests and desires , according to interviews with financiers , regulators and analysts and a review of Federal Reserve records .
Former IMF Chief Economist and current MIT Professor Simon Johnson , The Atlantic , May 2009 :
THE ATLANTIC :
The crash has laid bare many unpleasant truths about the United States .
One of the most alarming , says a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund , is that the finance industry has effectively captured our government -- a state of affairs that more typically describes emerging markets , and is at the center of many emerging - market crises ...
JOHNSON : Squeezing the oligarchs , though , is seldom the strategy of choice among emerging - market governments .
Quite the contrary : at the outset of the crisis , the oligarchs are usually among the first to get extra help from the government , such as preferential access to foreign currency , or maybe a nice tax break , or -- here 's a classic Kremlin bailout technique -- the assumption of private debt obligations by the government .
Under duress , generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms .
Meanwhile , needing to squeeze someone , most emerging - market governments look first to ordinary working folk -- at least until the riots grow too large .
. . .
Matt Taibbi , Rolling Stone , this month :
Any attempt to construct a narrative around all the former Goldmanites in influential positions quickly becomes an absurd and pointless exercise , like trying to make a list of everything .
What you need to know is the big picture :
If America is circling the drain , Goldman Sachs has found a way to be that drain -- an extremely unfortunate loophole in the system of Western democratic capitalism , which never foresaw that in a society governed passively by free markets and free elections , organized greed always defeats disorganized democracy .
Paul Krugman , The New York Times , today :
At this point , however , the acute crisis has given way to a much more insidious threat .
Most economic forecasters now expect gross domestic product to start growing soon , if it has n't already .
But all the signs point to a " jobless recovery " : on average , forecasters surveyed by The Wall Street Journal believe that the unemployment rate will keep rising into next year , and that it will be as high at the end of 2010 as it is now .
Now , it 's bad enough to be jobless for a few weeks ; it 's much worse being unemployed for months or years .
Yet that 's exactly what will happen to millions of Americans if the average forecast is right -- which means that many of the unemployed will lose their savings , their homes and more .
The New York Times , today :
Most of Wall Street , and America , is still waiting for an economic recovery .
Then there is Goldman Sachs .
Up and down Wall Street , analysts and traders are buzzing that Goldman , which only recently paid back its government bailout money , will report blowout profits from trading on Tuesday .
Analysts predict the bank earned a profit of more than $ 2 billion in the March - June period , because of its trading prowess across world markets .
If they are right , the bank 's rivals will once again be left to wonder exactly how Goldman , long the envy of Wall Street , could have rebounded so drastically only months after the nation 's financial industry was shaken to its foundations .
. . .
Startling , too , is how much of its revenue Goldman is expected to share with its employees .
Analysts estimate that the bank will set aside enough money to pay a total of $ 18 billion in compensation and benefits this year to its 28,000 employees , or more than $ 600,000 an employee .
Top producers stand to earn millions .
Greenwald :
Other than those individuals whose life purpose is to serve as reverent apologists and servile defenders for the most powerful financial elites , is there anyone who would be willing to claim with a straight face that the last event is unrelated to all the ones that preceded it ?
Add to that all the Serious consensus - talk about how the country can't afford health care reform and how Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid must be cut because they 're too expensive , and the picture could n't be clearer .
... UPDATE III : It 's worth recalling this bit of central truth , blurted out in April by the number two Democrat in the U.S. Senate , Dick Durbin :
And the banks -- hard to believe in a time when we 're facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created -- are still the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill .
And they frankly own the place .
That was nice and blunt .
That same week , it was announced that the newly - hired top lobbyist for Goldman Sachs , Michael Paese , was -- immediately prior to his hiring -- the top staffer to Rep. Barney Frank on the House Financial Services Committee chaired by Frank .
If one 's goal were to make all of this as blatant as possible , what else could one do besides what 's being done ?
-- Glenn Greenwald
Then again , maybe Goldman 's obscene profits over the past few months had something to do with the reality that 40 % of their net comes from the highly underregulated world of derivatives trading ?
Or , maybe it had something to do with this ?
When too big to fail morphs into too powerful to jail it 's time for Progressives to prevail .
I can never find a good pitchfork when I need one !
To capture the carbon dioxide generated by coal plants , chemical companies like Dow Chemical Co. and energy giants like Alstom SA have been betting big on liquid solvents like amine , a corrosive derivative of ammonia that has a thirst for binding with CO2 .
Problem is , once the two are bound , they never want to part .
In an attempt to circumvent the huge energy demands needed to separate amines from CO2 , which can take up to 25 percent of the energy generated by a coal plant , scientists -- many funded by the Department of Energy -- are developing a new generation of porous solids that can trap CO2 and then , almost as easily , let it go .
Such solids come in various forms : carbon derived from sugars and tattooed with microscopic holes ; molecular sieves that sift and separate chemicals ; and elaborate , Tinkertoy - like molecules that form massive skeletons capable of trapping and holding specific chemicals .
At the forefront of this last field is the laboratory of Omar Yaghi at the University of California , Los Angeles , which over the past decade has helped create a new realm of massive , crystalline molecules called metal organic frameworks , or MOFs .
With an acronym that sounds like the name of a fuzzy rodent , different species of MOFs may become the basis for hydrogen fuel tanks , drug - delivery devices and CO2 scrubbers .
Now , the lab has created a new generation of MOFs that have close to the same storage capacity and preference for CO2 as amines do , while only weakly bonding with the molecule .
The research will be published later this year ; the lab 's previous reports on the subject have appeared in Science and Nature .
To the naked eye , MOFs look " kind of like a rock , " said Bo Wang , a researcher in Yaghi 's lab .
But at the molecular level , these seeming solids look like a massive series of circular cages , almost like a honeycomb or molecular sponge , he said .
Amines , once they have chemically reacted with CO2 , must be cooked at 120 degrees Celsius for one to two hours before they let go of their load .
According to Wang , it takes two minutes at 60 degrees Celsius for 1 gram of the new MOFs to drop their CO2 and be ready for further use .
The MOFs ' secret is that their frameworks -- which are built out of metal ion clusters connected by organic links -- are easily modified .
Yaghi's lab has made thousands of different versions of the molecules , testing to see which had the proper shape to selectively admit CO2 .
" The genius of the materials that Professor Yaghi has developed is their enormous capacity for CO2 , " said Joseph Hupp , a chemist at Northwestern University who has developed MOFs that separate CO2 from methane .
Carbon dioxide has a moment where its electrons are not distributed evenly among the molecule , called its quadropole moment , Hupp said .
This signature is distinctive from many other gases and allows MOFs , through their arrangement of atoms , to be selective .
Hupp is uncertain that MOFs will easily be applied to the steamy industrial environment of the coal plant .
" I think it 's conceivable , but I 'm not so sure , " he said .
Wang thinks he has a molecule that will be ready to scale up to industrial levels in an affordable way .
Already , Yaghi's lab has partnered with the chemical giant BASF SE to mass - produce three simple MOFs , called Basolite , which are used to absorb a wide range of chemicals .
Once you have the recipe down , MOFs are simple to assemble , Wang said .
" It 's easy as shake and bake , " he said .
You have these metals and organic linkers , and you " dump these into the solvent and cook it .
And when it cools down you will see crystals .
...
It 's more like self - assembly . "
It remains to be seen if MOFs will be able to compete commercially with liquid solvents , which offer a less complicated chemistry .
Wang points out that BASF has already lowered the price of its Basolite line to about € 10 per kilogram .
" That 's already competitive , " he said .

Takes one to know one
The Department of Energy is spreading its bets on porous solids and recently announced funding support of $ 2 million for a research project at TDA Research Inc. , a private firm based in Wheat Ridge , Colo. , in the shadow of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory .
TDA has proposed using a proprietary form of activated carbon for capturing CO2 .
Typically , activated carbon , which is hugely porous -- 1 gram contains almost the surface area of a basketball court -- is used to absorb poisons and in groundwater remediation or sewage treatment .
The carbon developed by Steven Dietz , a researcher at TDA , has two different sizes of pores , which he calls mesopores and micropores .
The larger mesopores act as channels to the micropores , greatly increasing the rate at which TDA 's carbon absorbs CO2 , compared to activated carbon .
Most activated carbon is derived from " carbonized " -- or burnt up -- plants like coconut shells , which still limits one to the plant 's structure , Dietz said .
TDA can now develop activated carbon from sugars , which means there is less junk floating around the compound .
It is essentially synthetic .
Dietz at first wanted to use the carbon for ultracapacitors , which quickly soak up electricity .
Then he noticed how basic his mesocarbon was , meaning it could be perfect for soaking up acidic carbon dioxide .
So last fall , he wandered down the hall to Gokhan Alptekin , a TDA engineer , and they did a few lab experiments and said , " Yeah , these look interesting . "
Research into many other solid adsorbents is under way -- some possibly closer to industrial use than MOFs or TDA 's carbon -- and all share the challenge of working in the harsh environment of the coal plant , said Timothy Fout , a project manager at DOE 's National Energy Technology Laboratory .
" The types of experiments and setups that are used in the laboratory to determine reaction rates and particle properties often do not translate directly into large - scale equipment , " he said .
This scale - up is easier with liquids , which explains much of the attraction of amines and Selexol , a solvent that will likely be used to capture CO2 in coal plants designed from the ground up for carbon capture .
DOE estimates that the cost of electricity produced from plants using Selexol will increase by 30 percent .
In the future , the agency hopes technologies like solid adsorbents will replace liquid solvents .
But neither Wang nor Dietz is so bold as to think their solids provide the only way forward .
" But it could be an alternative , " Wang said .

Often creative and truly remarkable design solutions remain unknown because we , designers , simply overlook them .
Being busy with our own projects , we sometimes try to grasp the intuition behind ( probably ) complex and cluttered code of other designers to understand how they manage to implement particular design ideas .
In fact , by just observing the code of other developers we can learn a lot from them ; we can find interesting ideas and improve the quality of our work .
Over the last months we ’ve been paying closer attention to interesting design techniques and coding solutions and tried to understand how each of these solutions work and how they can benefit other designers and developers .
Such designs are often hard to find , so it would be great if you could suggest some solutions that are worth exploring in detail – we ’ll certainly cover them in our next posts !
So let ’s take a closer look at 10 useful CSS & Javascript techniques and coding solutions that can turn out to be useful for your next project .
You should have at least a basic knowledge of CSS and JavaScript before you read the entire article .
1. Inline Content Imagery
When viewing a blog post or an online article , we typically tend to find that most images which are “ dropped ” into the story ’s actual content are often presented in a boring or bland manner .
However , it is actually quite easy to create attractive content imagery that maintains a strong sense of design and branding , yet still manages to flow naturally with the content of your site .
UXBooth provides a clean and elegant example of this technique ( scroll down until you see a silverback ) .
In the screenshot below , notice how the Silverback 's image sits naturally in - line and in flow with the content on the page .
UxBooth 's Inline Content Imagery in Action
How Is It Done ?
At the first glance the silverback looks like a background image that has been positioned in the center of the content column with CSS or JavaScript ( or a combination of the two ) ; however , this is a pure CSS solution .
A div wrapping the image of the silverback ( a simple .png - image ) is floated to the right .
Immediately after that in the HTML comes a paragraph and an ordered list .
The “ silverback ” - div has a left - margin of 47px which keeps the p tag and the ol tag ’s content from overlapping the image , thus providing good visual spacing and overall page flow .
HTML
< h3 > Contest Details </h3 > < div class= " imagery " " > < img src=" imagery.png " width = " 205 " height = " 400 " alt = " Imagery " /> </div > < p >... the introductory paragraph ... </ p> < ol > < li >... various bullet points went here ...</li > </ol >
CSS
.imagery { /*
The image is floated to the right */ width : 205 px ; float : right ; /*
The image is positioned precisely , by pushing it 20 px from the right border */ margin - right : - 20 px ; /*
The image is pushed away from the text ( to the right ) with a left margin of 47px */ margin - left : 47 px ; }
2. Typographic Tricks
CommandShift3 , self proclaimed hot - or - not of websites , uses an interesting typographic trick to display the vote results for each website in which you have submitted a vote .
Obviously , this effect is achieved using only CSS .
Nice typographic effects to show percentages of votes
How Is It Done ?
Each result line contains a “ winning percentage ” - div + screenshot as well as a “ losing percentage ” - div + screenshot ( the image below should make it clear what is meant here ) .
Each of the percentages blocks is given a width that is slightly smaller than the width it needs to display its full text .
Besides , the CSS attribute overflow : hidden is applied to hide the content that is not needed .
This is all the code necessary for the “ winning percentage ” - div .
The “ losing percentage ” - div gets the same bit of code with the addition of a negative margin to make it appear to slide behind the losing site ’s thumbnail .
HTML
< div class = " bar " > < div class = " screen - left loser choice " > < div class= " pct " > < div>46<span >%</span></div> </div > < div > -- the image goes here -- </div> </div > < div class=" screen - right winner " > < div > -- the image goes here -- </div > < div class= " pct " > < div>54<span >%</span></div> </div> </div> < div class= " legend " >
-- You voted for text goes here -- </div > </div >
CSS
. result .pct { float : left ; height :80 px ; margin: 0 ; overflow : hidden ; padding : 0 ; white - space : nowrap ; width :95 px ; } .result . screen - left .pct div { margin : 28px 0 0 10 px ; float : left ; } .result .loser .pct div { color : #84C3 FF ; } .result .pct div span { display : inline ; font - size : 55 px ; } .result . screen - right .pct div { margin : 28px 0 0 - 8 px ; float : left ; } .result - first .pct div { color : #FFFFFF ; }
3. Inline Informational Overlays
This 31three.com version of myfamily.com has an interesting use of icons sprinkled throughout the body text .
If you roll over the calendar icon an informational overlay ( very similar to a tooltip ) is displayed – the latter one shows a graphic of what your potential calendar would look like when you sign up with myfamily .com .
Notice the transparency effect and the arrow on the left side of the appearing block .
How Is It Done ?
When a user mouses over the calendar icon , JavaScript is used to show a hidden div that contains a transparent . png - image .
When your mouse moves away from the calendar icon , the div is hidden again .
This particular example does n’t use a JavaScript framework like jQuery or Prototype , instead it uses two custom functions to hide and show the div accordingly .
Please notice that this code does not adher to good coding practices as it does not separate JavaScript functionality from the styling of the site .
You should never include Javascript events as inline attributes and this example is rather a quick prototype .
It is better to encapsulate the JavaScript code in a single . js - file and embed it on your web page using the < script > - tag .

HTML
< div id =" hover " onmouseover = " showLayer ( ' image ' ) " onmouseout = " hideLayer ( ' image ' ) " > </div > < div id =" image " style= " visibility : hidden ; " > < img src=" img/event_hover.png " alt =" image " height= " " width= " " >
</div >
Javascript
function showLayer( layerName , shadowLayerName ) { if ( document.getElementById ) // Netscape 6 and IE 5 + { var targetElement = document.getElementById(layerName ) ; targetElement.style.visibility = ' visible ' ; } } function hideLayer ( layerName ) { if ( document.getElementById ) { var targetElement = document.getElementById(layerName ) ; targetElement.style.visibility = ' hidden ' ; } }
4. Product Highlighting
Basecamp , a 37signals product , chooses to highlight its most popular product plan in order to draw attention to it and hopefully create more conversions of visitors to customers .
The featured product plan also has the added bonus of Javascript tooltips to offer more detail to the highlighted product features .
Please notice that each link has its own tooltip that appears on the right hand side when a text link is hovered .
Featured Product Plans for Basecamp
How Is It Done ?
The team at 37 signals choose to use Prototype.js and CSS to achieve the tooltip effect , while relying on pure CSS to highlight the featured product plan .
Each of the plans resides in its own div , with a class “ short ” ; the highlighted plan replaces the short class with a class “ tall ” .
The divs to the left and right of the highlighted plan have additional CSS classes added to them to provide shadows on their left and right hand sides to give the appearance that the featured plan is rising off the page .
The Javascript , written using prototype.js , listens for each of the product features to be hovered over .
When a feature is hovered over , the tooltips are all hidden , and then the appropriate tooltip is shown .
Product Plan Tooltips in Action
HTML ( for the highlighted plan )
< div class = " tall " > < h1 >< a href = " https://signup.projectpath.com/signup/Plus ">Plus</a></h1 >
< h2>$49/month</h2 > < h3 > Most popular plan</ h3 > < ul class =" highlight " style = " margin - top : 12 px ; " > < li > < a href= " # " onclick =" return false " class = " hover_target " hover_container=" users_bubble " >< strong>35</strong > projects </a> < span class=" hover_container " id=" users_bubble " > < div class = " bubble hover_target " >< div class = " wrapper " >< div class= " content " >< div class = " inner " > < div class= " arrow " ></div > < h2 > What are active projects ?</h2 > < p >.. Content for the tool tip ...</ p> </div></div></div></div> </ span > </li > ... code repeats for all product bullet points ... </ul > < a href = " https://signup.projectpath.com/signup/Plus " on Click =" return ConversionCount ( ) " >< img src= " https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/btn_signupchart_large.png " width = " 113 " height = " 45 " alt = " Sign Up " /> </div>
CSS
body.signup4 div.tall { background - color : #FFFFFF ; border : 3 px solid # 3671A1 ; float : left ; font - family : helvetica , arial , sans - serif ; height :310 px ; padding : 8 px 10 px 10 px ; text - align : center ; width : 220 px ; } body.signup4 div.tall h1 , body.signup4 div.tall h1 a { color :#000000 ; font - size : 42 px ; line - height : 1em ; margin: 0 ; padding : 0 ; text - decoration : none ; } body.signup4 div.tall h2 { color :#000000 ; font - size : 24 px ; font - weight : normal ; margin:0 0 2 px ; padding : 0 ; } body.signup4 div.tall h3 { border - bottom : 1 px solid # CCCCCC ; color :#4582B5 ; font - size : 16 px ; font - weight : bold ; margin: 0 ; padding:0 0 4 px text - transform : uppercase ; } body.signup4 a.hover_target { border - bottom : 1 px dotted # 888888 ; color :#64503 F ; margin - left :6 px ; text - decoration : none ; } body.signup4 div.tall li strong , body.signup4 div.short li strong { color : #C33700 ; }
Javascript
37 Signals created a custom class HoverObserver ( see the .js - snippet ) that uses the functionality from prototype.js .
Note that there are other ways to achieve this same effect .
5. Sliding Menus
The portfolio section at Clear Focus Designs contains a nice menu on the right hand side of the page that follows you as you scroll down .
This sliding menu with JQuery and CSS is an effective way to display a long list of information and still present a constant navigation choice to website visitors .
This menu detects when the page scrolls and follows it
How Is It Done ?
This page uses a jQuery plugin called scrollFollow which allows a specified div to follow the page as the user scrolls through the page .
In the Clear Focus Designs example , the right hand menu is being told by this plugin to follow the page .
HTML
< ul id =" sites " > < li >< a href= " #copperStone " >CopperStone Partners < br /> < span class= " projectDesc " > Development </ span></a> </li > < li >< a href= " #vmg " > Visionary Marketing Group < br /> < span class= " projectDesc " > Development </ span></a> </li > ... code repeats for all menu items ... </ui>
Javascript
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( ' # ourWork ' ) .scrollFollow ( { speed : 1000 , easing : ' linear ' } ) ; } ) ;
6. Authors “ Flagging ”
Placing avatars next to an individual ’s post in a comment thread is quite a common practice .
UxBooth ( again ) has taken comment flagging a step further by allowing a user ’s thumbnail to float outside of his / her comments in the article .
This allows a user to quickly scan the page and know who posted a response on that page .
UxBooth does approach this method a little differently , as the article is written by several different authors .
Using this ‘ flagging ’ method helps a user identify which author contributed which part of the article .
UxBooth ’s Using comment ‘ Flags ’ to show which author wrote the comment
How Is It Done ?
On UxBooth , each author has his / her own div with a class named after the author .
For example , the author , Andrew , has an author div with a class “ author andrew ” .
The “ author ” class sets up the basic styling that is common among all authors comments .
The div is placed in the document using the relative positioning within the document ’s flow .
Inside of the div there is an image with a class of “ avatar ” .
The “ avatar ” class is positioned absolutely within the relatively positioned parent - element ( using the classic Making the absolute , relative - CSS - technique ) .
The image is given a top value of 0 , with a left value of - 54 px .
Essentially , this technique sucks the image out of the content column and lays it over the container background color / image .
HTML
< div class = " matt review - quote " > < p >... The user 's comment went here ...</ p> < p ><img class= " avatar " src= " https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/matt.gif " alt = " Matthew Kammerer " ></ p> </div>
CSS
div#ux - booth div#content div.matt .
review - quote { border - color : #FF9F26 ; } div#ux - booth div#content div.review - quote { border - left :6 px solid # D8C9A1 ; margin:0 - 21px 0 - 24 px ; padding : 0.5 em 21px 1.5 em 20 px ; position : relative ; } div#ux - booth div#content div.matt .
review - quote img.avatar { border - color : #CC7200 ; } div#ux - booth div#content div.andrew.review-quote img.avatar{ -moz-border-radius-bottomleft:9px ; -moz-border-radius -topleft:9px ; background : #888888 none repeat scroll 0 0 ; border : 4px solid # 4B6500 ; left : - 54 px ; position : absolute ; top:0 ; }
7. Archive Page Layouts
Warpspire uses a different approach when it comes to the layout of their archive page .
Instead of a long list , they ’ve chosen to use a column approach underneath each month in the archive .
How Is It Done ?
Each entry in the archive contains a h3 - and a p - tag inside of a listed item li .
Each even numbered li is floated to the left , each odd numbered li is floated to the right .
And that ’s it – as simple as that .
HTML
< div class=" section - heading - small " > < h2 > February 09</h2 > </div> < ul class=" archives " > < li class= " odd " > < h3 >... title of archived article ...</h3 > < p >... summary and read more link for article ... </ p> </li > < li > < h3 >... title of archived article ...</h3 > < p >... summary and read more link for article ... </ p> </li > </ul >
CSS
ul.archives li.odd { clear : both ; float : left ; padding - right : 20 px ; } ul.archives li { float : right ; font - size : 11 px ; list - style - type : none ; margin:0 0 20 px ; padding : 0 ; width : 270 px ; }
8. Transparent Rounded Rollovers
This is an example of another archive layout , this time from Particletree , which uses transparent pngs as article title rollover backgrounds .
Transparent Rollovers at ParticleTree
How Is It Done ?
Each article title is placed inside of a h3 - element that has an anchor ( a ) inside .
The a tag has a transparent .png - background image that has its background - position shifted on hover as well as a background color .
The .png - image is positioned to the right hand side and sits above the tree image .
The background color fills the space between the two , creating the illusion of 3D - dimension ( the content block appear to be in front of the “ tree ” - image ) .
Each link also uses CSS - based rounded corners ( using - moz - border - radius ) .
HTML
< div class= " red headline " > < h3 > The Importance of Design in Business < cite >< b> By Chris Campbell </b> · Comments ( < strong>15</strong >) · August 14th</ cite > </h3 > </div > ... code repeats ...
CSS
# features .red a :hover { background - position : 498 px - 30 px ; } #features .red a:hover { background - image:url (/images/fadetree.png ) ; background - repeat : no - repeat ; } # features [ id ] h3 a { height : auto ; min-height : 66 px ; } #features h3 a { - moz - border - radius - bottomright :30 px ; - moz- border - radius - topleft:30 px ; font - size : 210 % ; height :66 px ; padding : 11 px 15 px 3 px 105 px ; } .red a :hover , a.red : hover { background : #5E2510 none repeat scroll 0 0 ; color : #FFFFFF ; } .red a , .red cite strong { color : #843418 ; } h3 a { display : block ; text - decoration : none ; }
9. Blending Flash and CSS
HunterBoot.com has wonderfully constructed black and white imagery on their homepage panel .
This imagery is a part of a Flash movie that contains not only the imagery , but also nice hover - effects for the link lists at the bottom of the layout .
See the screenshot below for a better understanding of what is going on structurally .
When you mouse over one of the links in the four columns below the main image panel , you get a nice animated rollover in the background of that column .
How Is It Done ?
At first glance it appears that this is some type of jQuery plugin or something similar .
However this is a pure CSS - based solution that uses Flash - elements for hover - effects .
This technique starts out with some markup .
There is a main div that contains the Flash movie ( inside a containing div ) , then four distinct divs , one for each of the sections .
These four divs have a heading and then an unordered list containing the individual links .
The main containing div is positioned relatively to its parent .
These four URLs are positioned absolutely inside of the relative main container div – this puts the URLs on the top of the Flash movie .
When you move your mouse over the four implied columns , this triggers a rollover animation in the Flash movie , because your mouse is actually over the Flash movie .
Since the links sit above the Flash you can still click on them with no unfcomfortable side effects .
HTML
<!-- the flash container --> < div id =" featurePanelHomeFlashBoxCntr " > ... the flash movie is inserted here via SWFObject ... ... it's important to note that the .swf 's wmode is set to transparent ...
</div > <!-- the product category links -- > < div class=" homeFlashListFun " > < ul > < li >< a href= " / product/ link/goes/here " > Link Text </a></li > ... repeat li's for each link </ ul > </div > < div class=" homeFlashListSport " > < ul > < li >< a href= " / product/ link/goes/here " > Link Text </a></li > ... repeat li's for each link </ ul > </div > < div class=" homeFlashListWork " > < ul > < li >< a href= " / product/ link/goes/here " > Link Text </a></li > ... repeat li's for each link </ ul > </div > < div class=" homeFlashListKids " > < ul > < li >< a href= " / product/ link/goes/here " > Link Text </a></li > ... repeat li's for each link </ ul > </div >
CSS
.featurePanelHomeFlashBox { margin : 0 px ; padding : 0 px ; float : left ; height : 528 px ; width : 720 px ; position : relative ; } # featurePanelHomeFlashBoxCntr { width : 720 px ; height : 528 px ; position : absolute ; top : 0 px ; left : 0 px ; background : # ffffff ; z-index : 300 ; } --- This chunk of CSS is repeated for each of the lists , with the difference being the positioning of the ul --- .homeFlashList
Fun ul { position : absolute ; top : 380 px ; left : 15 px ; z- index : 599 ; width : 100 px ; background : transparent ; list - style : none ; list - style - image : none ; list - style - type : none ; margin : 0 px ; padding : 10 px 0px 0px 0 px ; } .homeFlashList
Fun ul li { margin : 0 px ; padding : 0 px 0px 6px 0 px ; background : transparent ; text - decoration : none ; line - height : 1em ; } .homeFlashListFun ul li a { text - decoration : none ; color : # 999 ; font - size : 0.95em ; letter - spacing : - 0.00 em ; background : transparent ; } .homeFlashListFun ul li a :hover { text - decoration : underline ; color : # bf0000 ; }
Ogilvy chooses to display their popular tags with a graph - like background ( scroll all the way to the bottom to see the “ Top 5 Tags ” ) .
How Is It Done ?
The tag list is a simple unordered list ; each list item has an inline style with a hard coded width given to it ( not really a good coding solution ) .
This seems like it is coming from a server side calculation and being outputted inline on the element .
Oglivy uses PHP , but this could be done in pretty much any server side language , or it could even be done with JavaScript if necessary .
Each of the li’s has its own background color and because they all have different widths this gives the appearance of a graph .
HTML
< ol class=" transGreen " > < li style = " width : 242 px " > < a href= " " style =" display : block ; width :100 % ; color : #fff " class = " tag tag_1 " > work < / a> </ li > < li style = " width : 216px " > < a href= " " style=" display:block ;width:100 % ; color : #fff " class= " tag tag_2 " > philosophy < / a> </ li > < li style = " width : 153 px " > < a href= " " style=" display:block ;width:100 % ; color : #fff " class= " tag tag_3 " > agency < / a> </ li > < li style = " width : 104px " > < a href= " " style=" display:block ;width:100 %;color : #fff " class= " tag tag_4 " > culture </ a> </ li > < li style = " width : 77px " > < a href= " " style=" display:block ;width:100 % ;color : #fff " class= " tag tag_5 " > maslow </a> </li > </ol >
CSS
# top5 li a.tag { padding : 1px 5 px ; margin - bottom : 2 px ; color : # fff ; text - transform : uppercase ; font - weight : normal ; } # top5 li a.tag : hover { background : # 000 ; } .tag_1 { background : # c12 ; } .tag_2 { background : # 990000 ; } .tag_3 { background : # ee6666 ; } .tag_4 { background : # ee2222 ; } .tag_5 { background : # cc6666 ; }

I do n't want to bury the previous post yet , but ...
After waking me up with pain every three hours , both Friday and Saturday night , my arm seems to be backing off , finally .
' Bout damned time
That shit was hurtin ' so bad at 2 am , Saturday morning , it had me in tears .
I was sitting on the lid of the toilet , pressing my arm against the inside of the tub for the coolness , sobbing ... cute picture , huh ?
I got pissed after that and figured , " Fuck you arm .
You wanna hurt , I 'mina give ya a reason to ... "
So , since then , I 've had it in no less then two and sometimes three braces , from above my elbow to my wrist , and I 've been doing some heavy duty cleaning - type shit .
Let 's see ... what have I gotten done so far ?
The roosters and the rabbits are outside , which entailed moving a load and a half of firewood offa their table to make room for the cages , as well as hefting the cages out there .
Mr. Rat is moving , too .
He 's going into the vacated pigeon cage after I clean that .
In his place now sits the new stereo , blasting Fleetwood Mac .
There is also siding all over the yard that I hope to get to today .
If not , I 'm CERTAIN it wo n't go anywhere til I do get to it .
Back to what I 've gotten done ...
About half of the catboxes ... the dishes ... hmmm .
I 'm about to bring the saddles back in here and clean the mudroom .
Then , there are two bikes , one motorized , one not , that need to go in there .
And , if I get time , I 'd like to bake that cake and sometime before I go to work tomorrow I HAVE to do these nails .
Which oughta be real http://www.livesexchat.net fun , seeing as how holding an emery board is just the kinda thing that still hurts .
A full bucket of water ?
Fine .
A little tiny , gotta - squinch - yer - hand - up - to - hold - it emery board ?
OW !!!!
So , anyway ....
I guess I oughta shaddap and keep on keepin ' on .
Back later , if I can .
In the meantime ...
Peace , y'all !
Want to make a Marine 's day ?
I want y'all to be able to write to Norm , but I do n't wanna be responsible for him getting spammed to death , hence the way I wrote that , ya know ?
Do n't worry about the fact that ya do n't know 'im .
Does n't matter .
Just let him know how ya found about him and that 'll be enough .
He 's my brother .
Please send him a note .
In fact , send him as many notes as you want .
I do n't know how often he 'll be able to write back , but , you know how it is over there .
He 's in Iraq .
He 's a machine gun / door guy .
Like , he sits in the door of the vehicle with a machine gun , protecting or covering the guys when they go out to pick up ... non-living other guys .
( I refuse to say dee - ee - ay - dee and the word " Marine " in the same sentence .
Just can't do it . )
But , he 's on that detail .
AND , he wants to be a cop when he gets back .
Geez , Norm .
Have much of a death wish , do ya ?
ANYway ...
drop him a line , if yer of a mind .
He 'd appreciate it and so would my Dad and me .
If ya wanna know who Norm is , go here .
It 's an old site of his that he and his friend McKenna had , before McKenna died .
Yeah .
Young guy and all .
Not sure what happened there .
Only that it had something to do with McKenna and a gun .
Never did find out if it was an accident or not .
I assume it was an accident .
Glenn Davis ...
Glenn Davis , where are you ?
The one I 'm lookin ' for came to Woodstown High School from one of the Cherry Hill high schools , West , I think .
He took Vocational Agriculture with me and played football for the Woodstown High School Wolverines .
He was sweet , adorable and live in Pole Tavern or on www.livejasmin.cc .
His Dad either worked for or owned a carpet cleaning company .
We graduated with the Woodstown High School Class of 1981 .
Last I knew Glenn was headed to San Diego to become a Navy SEAL .
Him being a SEAL is somewhat akin to me being a NUN !
He was so sweet , so gentle , such a darlin ' ol ' Teddybear ...
I can't see him being a rough , tough , able - to - kill - with his - little - finger SEAL , but ... whatta I know ?
My best memory of him is us , sitting on the hood of his car in his driveway , talking .
He was leaned up against his windshield and I was leaned up against him .
God , he was comfortable to be around ( and lean on ) .
Nothing " major " ever happened between us , but I love (d ) him all the same .
He was one of my best friends and I want to find him , badly .
I miss him all to hell and gone , ya know ?
I also remember being out in the woods , getting wood for their fireplace with him and his Dad .
And , his smiling face in Ag class .
And , him coming to my Mom 's in Carney 's Point before going to San Diego .
And , him saying he'd met a girl .
I wonder if they 're still together ?
I hope so .
Glenn is one of those guys that ya just want to see happy , that ya wanna know somebody is lovin ' the hell out of .
He was so amazing , so sweet ...
Glenn ... google yerself , wouldja ?

Okay , God .
You take it from here , okay ?
Help him find me or vice versa .
Now ...
I 'll be posting this from time to time , just so it 'll get crawled and , hopefully , become the top search for his name , so if ya see the name GLENN DAVIS as the title , you 'll know you can skip it , unless , of course , ya wanna read the same thing over and over , or you 're GLENN DAVIS !!!!!
and then , please , fer the love of all that is holy ( and my sanity ) leave a comment .
Or , if you know him , TELL HIM !!!!
Okay ?
Show him this , please .
Glenn Davis , Glenn Davis , Glenn Davis .
Lord , I hope this works .
Well , it 's not like I do n't have shit I need to get done
I guess this is " some day " , huh ?
That fabled day when I do alla the shit that I 've been putting off .
Liiike ... the animal cages ( the rabbit , the duck amd the two roosters ) , an intense cleaning of the rest of the house , maybe some creative cooking , playin ' with the new kittens Lamar gave me last night ... well , okay .
Maybe I have n't been putting off that last one , she only had 'em last night , but ... there 's the rest of the list .
Which includes two " specialty " posts ... the one ( to be repeated til I find him ) about Glenn and the one with my Marine brother 's email address for any of you guys who wanna " adopt " a Marine and write to him .
He 'd love it , I 'm certain .
He loves to read , just like Dad and I do and he's in Iraq and I hate Bush .
I s'pose it'd make more sense to do this post last , so it'd be on top so it'd explain what the two specailty posts are about , buuuut ... y'all 'll figger it out , right ?
( Hell , if the last part of the last sentence did n't getcha , nothing else I write will , right ?
" Y' all 'll " ?
Jeez ... )
I almost feel like this is a school day that I got to have off because of this stupid white shit , except for the fact that I did n't get paid to go to school , thus did n't lose money because of being off .
I keep going , " Yay !... shit ... "
Anyhoo ...
I guess I 'll do my two posts and go clean something .
There 's also a buncha goofy search terms in my Site Meter .
They 're a post in and of themselves , naturally .
Plus , I 'm starving .
I do n't usually get too hungry when I 'm working , til later , but , this being off shit has me all off kilter .
Hell , I do n't even want my daily " grilled cheese and chicken noodle soup " .
I do n't know what it is lately with that , but , man .
I 'm a cheese eatin ' fool these days .
And , I do n't even really like cheese all that much .
Unless I 'm starving , I 'll pick it offa subs and shit .
Do n't like it on a salad , either .
But , grilled cheese after forkin ' horseshit ?
Oh hell yeah .
Dear snow ...
Fuck you , I hate you and now ... ya owe me money .
You wrecked my record , ya stupid buncha white , useless , fluffy shit .
63 days , damn it .
Six - ty three days without a day off and YOU hadda come along and fuck that up for me .
Well ... thanks a load ( of SALT ) and YOU OWE ME TODAYS PAY !!!!
Go to hell .
Go straight to hell , do not pass go , do not collect jackshit .
In fact , go to hell and MELT .
I hate you .
Sincerely ,
me
P.S. My Crown Vic is a complete pussy .
The goddamned Jack Russell , with his little two inch long legs , negotiates better in this shit than Vic does .

How utterly pathetic .
I 'm so embarassed for him ....

Advertisement A backpacker who went missing for 12 days in the Australian bush is recovering in hospital .
Jamie Neale , 19 , of Muswell Hill , north London , survived on nettles in the Blue Mountains , west of Sydney , until he was found by two hikers on Wednesday .
Mr Neale 's mother said she will make sure he wears a " watch with a beacon " on his next trip .
" He 's not leaving the country without one , " she said .
The teenager is being treated for dehydration and exposure .
Mr Neale , who is due to start a government and politics degree at Exeter University in October , was found as the police were contemplating calling off the search and his father was about to fly back to London .
The only teenager in the world who goes on a 10 - mile hike and leaves his mobile phone behind
Richard Cass , father Mrs Neale , 49 , said : " I never gave up hope .
As far as I was concerned he was coming home .
" He 'll have one hell of a story to tell when he starts university , let 's just hope he does n't repeat it at any time . "
' Very , very lucky '
Mr Neale 's father , Richard Cass , who flew to Australia to join the search , was reunited with his son , who he said looked " gaunt and scratched " .
Mr Cass told Australian newspaper , The Age : " The millions that have been spent on this search , the man hours that have gone into it ... all because he goes out on a walk without his mobile phone .
" The only teenager in the world who goes on a 10 - mile hike and leaves his mobile phone behind . ''
Speaking at a press conference he admitted that he had " lost faith " .
The Blue Mountains can be a very disorientating environment " I made a little shrine for him , " he said .
" I defaced your national park with his name and date of birth - he 's going to come back and see his gravestone . "
New South Wales Police said Mr Neale checked into the Katoomba Youth Hostel on 2 July .
He was seen the following morning but failed to return for a pre-booked cave tour , resulting in a search for him .
Personal belongings , including a phone and passport , were found still in his room .
See map of area where Jamie Neale went missing Mr Neale had not intended to go missing , the BBC was told .
It is understood he had gone for a walk but did not know how far he had wandered into the wilderness .
He slept under trees and logs and ate nettles to survive .
The teenager was eventually found near Katoomba , nine miles from where he went missing .
' I am lost ' John Hughes , of New South Wales State Emergency Service , said : " He came out to two people who were camping in the bush and said , ' I am lost ' .
" In winter we have had people lost for three days but never more than a week [ and surviving ] .
Nick Bryant , BBC News , in Katoomba Much of the wilderness in this popular tourist spot is dense , rugged , extremely cold in the winter and notoriously difficult to survive in if you have ventured out unprepared .
These were the challenges facing Jamie Neale .
He survived by eating seeds and vegetation .
His shelter , according to his father , was a log , and his attempts to chase down a wild horse , which he looked on as a source of food , ended in failure .
Speaking to me outside the hospital in Katoomba he spoke of his resilience and said , rather memorably , that his son was the sort of person who could run to the North Pole and back wearing only his underpants .
Lucky escape from wilderness 10 tips to survive the bush " This is extraordinary . "
Mrs Neale said she always " stayed positive " .
" He 's very stubborn , he 's very persistent and very resourceful , so I had no doubt that he would get through , " she told the BBC .
" He just said that he wanted to hear my voice , that he did n't think he'd see me again .
I told him , you do n't get rid of me that easily . "
Mr Neale is described in a stable condition in hospital .
A spokesman for New South Wales police told reporters the search had covered " in excess of 100 square kilometres " .
" He was going for a day trip , but took 12 days to come back - very , very lucky , " he said .
Jamie 's aunt , Caroline Neale , said her family had felt " helpless " during the search .
BBC correspondent Phil Mercer in Sydney described Mr Neale 's ordeal as " a remarkable story of resilience " .
Rescuers were hampered by poor winter weather , including thick fog , rain and freezing temperatures , he said .
And the BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney said police were on the verge of calling off the search just hours before Mr Neale was found .

Blackest Night , the latest DC Comics mega-event , starts today with Blackest Night # 1 .
If you 're looking for some kickass undead superhero action but have n't been diligently memorizing every obscure tidbit of Green Lantern continuity , here 's everything you need to know .
Advertisement
I may just be an eternal optimist ( or , you know , a fool ) , but Blackest Night might just be the comic book event that actually delivers on all the hype .
It 's got what is fundamentally a compelling , straightforward premise ( every dead superhero - scratch that , every dead character rises from the grave ) .
The backdrop is suitably epic ( a war between eight different Lantern Corps ) .
The creative team has an encouraging track record ( main writers Geoff Johns and Peter Tomasi have been doing some of DC 's best stuff in recent years , and the art is being handled by the likes of Ivan Reis and Ed Benes ) .
And , if nothing else , Blackest Night is the conclusion of what has thus far been a very satisfying trilogy , with both Green Lantern : Rebirth and Sinestro Corps War standing as bright spots in DC 's recent history .
All that said , it 's probably not going to be the easiest event to pick up without any background knowledge .
After all , this is the culmination of a story at least five years in the making , and there are at least two dozen plot lines already in motion before the series even begins .
So here 's our Blackest Night primer , which will attempt to cover all the basics as well as highlight a few of the more obscure details that might just prove crucial to the entire epic .
Advertisement
How did we get to this point ?
You could trace the roots of Blackest Night to a whole lot of places .
Obviously , there 's Green Lantern : Rebirth and Sinestro Corps War , Geoff Johns 's two previous epics that both laid important groundwork for what 's going to play out over the next eight months .
There 's also " Tygers " , Alan Moore 's 1986 story from Tales of the Green Lantern Corps Annual # 2 , which prophesied much of what Geoff Johns brought to pass in Sinestro Corps War and has provided ( with some minor revisions ) one of Blackest Night 's major antagonists .
But , for my money , all of this really goes back to the death of Superman .
Advertisement
What are the different Lantern Corps , and what do they want ?
Even if you 've got a good handle on the admittedly complicated backstory to Blackest Night , that still leaves seven new Corps to keep track of .
The colors themselves are actually fairly easy to remember , as they 're the same as the colors of the rainbow .
That 's right - it 's time to bust out the old ROY G BIV mnemonic , because it 's pretty much the entire key to Blackest Night .
Well , that and the black light of the Black Lantern Corps .
That 's probably important as well .
Advertisement
Who 's coming back to life ?
It would probably be easier to list which dead characters are n't coming back as Black Lanterns .
If I had to guess , maybe Jor-El is safe , if only because Krypton 's explosion probably did n't leave a body behind .
Everybody else ?
They 're all fair game .
( And honestly , I 'm not all that sure about Jor -El either . )

What roles are the various human Green Lanterns going to play ?
Since the " mantle " of Green Lantern is actually a position in an intergalactic police force , it makes sense that there are so many active claimants to the title .
With five human Green Lanterns currently operating ( only the four Flashes come close to matching this ) , Blackest Night has the difficult job of giving all of them something to do .
Fortunately , the preceding arcs in Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps ( not to mention some peeks ahead at DC 's solicitations for the next few months ) provide a good sense of what we can expect for each Green Lantern .
Advertisement
With all that in mind , what books do I actually need to read ?
DC Comics has gotten into a good habit in recent years in making its events fairly easy to follow , with one main book and a limited group of supporting titles .
Final Crisis , for instance , was pretty much completely contained to books that actually carried the " Final Crisis " banner , and Blackest Night will be similar .
The Google Update process is the bane for many Internet users as it seemed to become available again even if it has been disabled previously on the computer system .
The process googleupdate .
exe is running all the time on the computer system trying to connect to Google to see if there are any updates for Google software available .
It can even happen that the updating process is still running if no Google software programs are installed on the computer system anymore .
It does feel strange that Google needs a process to update their programs while other companies like Mozilla do not .
Especially if the only software by Google is their web browser Google Chrome .
Google has announced changes yesterday that will please many computer users .
They basically changed Google Update from running in the background permanently to a process that would check for updates periodically which basically eliminates the googleupdate .
exe process in the background as it will terminate after the check for updates .
This means that the process will only run when it is scheduled to check for software updates and terminate afterwards .
Users can check the Task Scheduler in the Windows Control Panel to change the frequency of the update checks .
The easiest way to do so is to tap on the Windows - key on the keyboard , type Tasks and select the schedule tasks option that appears .
This opens the Task Scheduler listing all scheduled tasks on the system .
Locate the Google Update task there and modify its triggers to change when and how frequently it runs on the system .
The default is set to check once every hour which may be too frequently depending on your requirements .
The Google team points out that the process might be running continuously on some computer systems if problems are encountered with the task scheduler and Windows Services .

Upon further review , LeBron James ' decision not to shake hands with the Orlando Magic or speak to the media after Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals is going to cost him .
And more than just on the sports talk shows .
NBA Commissioner David Stern announced before Game 1 of the NBA finals on Thursday that he had decided to fine James $ 25,000 for his actions .
This was after Stern initially said on Monday that James would not be fined .
Stern informed James , who is recovering from surgery to remove a growth from his right jaw , in a phone call on Wednesday .
" [ LeBron ] expressed to me that when he left the building and did not meet the media or did not congratulate the Magic , he was wrong , " Stern said .
" He 'll be talking to you I assume directly as he gets better and stronger , but he asked that I express to the media , the Magic and the fans his apology , and particularly the young fans , because he knows he has a responsibility to all of our fans , and that sportsmanship is appropriate whether you win or whether you lose . "
This is the first time in James ' career he 's faced any sort of discipline of this nature from the league .
It probably did not help James ' case that he was not repentant about the matter when he did discuss it with the media on Sunday .
The NBA has fined players in the past for skipping media sessions , including Michael Jordan .
" The more I thought about it I thought there were two things we had to deal with , which was the media and the failure to congratulate , " Stern said .
" LeBron and I discussed it , and I 'll leave the rest for him to talk about , but I think it was important .
Certainly as it related to the media , we have a rule , you guys know that we 've had some interesting issues over the years with some of our coaches and the like , and it was inappropriate for me to give someone a pass here . "

Remember how Sarah Palin graduated from her fiftieth college with a degree in communications ?
What the hell happened to addle this woman 's mind so much that she can no longer form logical sentences ?
We went to the tapes to investigate .
Here 's the classic clip of Sarah Heath delivering the sports report on the local news back in the late ' 80s .
She reads the Teleprompter with admirable competency , stumbling noticeably only once or twice .
( Also : LOTS OF DOGS !)
Was it when she decided to enter politics , in the '90s , that Sarah lost her words ?
Here she is in 2006 running for governor , skillfully dodging a question on abortion .
She speaks in brief sentences that quickly get to the point , and then she stops talking .
There is one worrying extraneous " also " thrown in there .
A sign of dangling connectors yet to come !
Hey , this old guy selected the feisty young lady to be his Vice President .
What does she have to say for herself , as she 's introduced to the nation ?
She certainly seems to like the attention .
But there she is , just reading a coherent series of statements , from a Teleprompter , without deviating into odd non-sequiturs .
Here , at Palin 's first big McCain rally , she trips over some shitty writing .
Profiles in courage usually come in books , but we are about to elect one ...?
But she skillfully segues to the lady - pandering , ignoring the boos Hillary 's name elicits .
Oh , Palin 's greatest public moment .
Her vile , scummy RNC speech .
It was not quite as " masterfully delivered " as everyone thought at the time , but she got the sneering contempt down pat , and did n't stumble over any of the prepared slurs .
Listen to her feed on the seething hate of the crowd !
It only made her stronger !
Here 's where the wheels came off the wagon .
Katie Couric 's interview with Sarah Palin was so embarrassing that mocking it is impossible .
She can't handle simple questions , she speaks in vague generalities , and for some reason Couric keeps asking her mean questions even when Sarah gets all defensively folksy .
This is when Palin went from a pro who was remarkably polished for a small state politician to a jumbled ball of nerves .
She never recovered , either politically or cognitively .
Expectations were so low for Sarah by the time the VP debate came around that it would 've been considered a success if she did n't suddenly erupt in a stream of racial slurs or something .
But it was just weird .
" Can I call you Joe ? " " Doggone it . "
And the winking !
This is when working from prepared material stopped working for Sarah , because she was rebelling against her handlers , or because she forgot how to read , or something .
Oh , her thing on the SNL .
They did n't ask much of her , and she did n't deliver , having Amy Poehler do the funny rap thing .
And then the election ended , and Palin was free to let her freak flag fly .
When Greta Van Susteren met Sarah Palin it was like a ramble - off .
Greta lobbed softballs and Sarah Palin responded with her new brand of dark , vague paranoia about " bloggers " and " the media , " spreading " gossip " and unnamed " lies . "
And : " You know I consider myself sometimes too a feminist , whatever that means . "
Then she resigned .
For no reason .
She sounded terrified , rushed , nervous , and insane .
This was the worst prepared statement we 've ever heard from a politician , basically ever .
Until the next time she appeared on the TV !
After Sarah Palin resigned , she went fishing , and she got all morbid and depressed .
She is still lying , as that is second - nature to her , and she is still paranoid about unnamed media enemies , but she cannot answer or dodge a very simple question about her own motivations , except to repeat a buzz phrase she likes , and then to mention her kids .
But Sarah Palin maybe saved the best for last .
What was your favorite line from Sarah Palin 's second resignation speech ?
Was it :
" So , how ' bout in honor of the American soldier , ya quit makin ' things up ? "
Or maybe this amazing bit :
" Let me tell you , Alaskans really need to stick together on this with new leadership in this area especially , encouraging new leadership ... got to stiffen your spine to do what 's right for Alaska when the pressure mounts , because you 're going to see anti-hunting , anti-second amendment circuses from Hollywood and here 's how they do it .
They use these delicate , tiny , very talented celebrity starlets , they use Alaska as a fundraising tool for their anti-second amendment causes . "
Actually , this is our favorite line :
" In the winter time it 's the frozen road that is competing with the view of ice fogged frigid beauty , the cold though , does n't it split the Cheechakos from the Sourdoughs ? "
It 's like Peggy Noonan , Jack London , and William Faulkner wandered into the woods with three buttons of peyote and one typewriter , and only this speech emerged .
And she wrote this speech !
In advance , on paper !
What does any of it mean ?
It is amazing .
Twenty years ago she could competently descibe a dog race , three years ago she could articulate a position on the abortion issue , and this weekend she composed a resignation speech by throwing culture war stock phrases into a hat and dumping it upside down on a copy of The Paranoid Style in American Politics .
Vid Famous crazycraft company Aerovironment has won a $ 2.1 m contract to further develop its robotic " Nano Air Vehicle " ( NAV ) , which flies and hovers using flapping wings like a hummingbird .
The company has also released a video of the innovative craft in test flights .
According to Aerovironment , the fluttering NAV achievement is the first ever " controlled hovering flight of an air vehicle system with two flapping wings that carries its own energy source and uses only the flapping wings for propulsion and control " .
The NAV project is one of the swarming brainchildren of DARPA , the Pentagon tech - wizardry bureau .
Many of DARPA 's spawnings do n't make it past Phase 1 ; the new Phase 2 deal with Aerovironment indicates a somewhat greater chance of eventual success .
Such a success , according to DARPA 's Dr Todd Hylton , would see the tiny ornithopter shrink to 10 grams ' weight and a maximum size of 7.5 cm .
The little machine , to meet the US government 's requirements , must also achieve forward - flight speeds of 10 metres per second ( 22 mph ) and be able to resist gentle gusts of wind in the hover .
It must also become quieter .
The hummingbird - or large - insect - sized craft is intended by DARPA for clandestine " urban mission operations " in " indoor and outdoor environments " .
Future versions of the bugthopter are expected to be able to " perch " in suitable locations , relaying sound and video back to their controllers up to a kilometre away .
They might also drop off very small payloads such as listening devices .
“ The NAV program will push the limits of aerodynamic and power conversion efficiency , endurance , and maneuverability for very small , flapping wing air vehicle systems , ” says Hylton .
It 's not immediately clear why an ornithopter like the NAV is better than a tiny helicopter ( for instance the Norwegian PD - 100 Black Hornet ) .
But DARPA believe that " low Reynolds number " * bird - style flying could offer advantages over normal aircraft technologies .
Even if the idea of pocketsize bug - dropping bugthopter drones never takes off with the US military or intelligence communities , DARPA seems to be suggesting , learning more about exactly how the birds and the bees pull off their tricks is well worth doing . ®
Bootnote
* The Reynolds number is the ratio between inertial forces and viscous forces arising where fluids such as air flow over solid surfaces such as aircraft wings .
It is generally high for big , fast things like normal aircraft ; but flying critters such as bats and insects operate in low - Reynolds - number flight regimes .

Decision trees are intelligible , but do they perform well enough that you should use them ?
Have SVMs replaced neural nets , or are neural nets still best for regression , and SVMs best for classification ?
Boosting maximizes margins similar to SVMs , but can boosting compete with SVMs ?
And if it does compete , is it better to boost weak models , as theory might suggest , or to boost stronger models ?
Bagging is simpler than boosting -- how well does bagging stack up against boosting ?
Breiman said Random Forests are better than bagging and as good as boosting .
Was he right ?
And what about old friends like logistic regression , KNN , and naive bayes ?
Should they be relegated to the history books , or do they still fill important niches ?
In this talk we compare the performance of ten supervised learning methods on nine criteria : Accuracy , F- score , Lift , Precision / Recall Break - Even Point , Area under the ROC , Average Precision , Squared Error , Cross - Entropy , and Probability Calibration .
The results show that no one learning method does it all , but some methods can be " repaired " so that they do very well across all performance metrics .
In particular , we show how to obtain the best probabilities from max margin methods such as SVMs and boosting via Platt 's Method and isotonic regression .
We then describe a new ensemble method that combines select models from these ten learning methods to yield much better performance .
Although these ensembles perform extremely well , they are too complex for many applications .
We 'll describe what we 're doing to try to fix that .
Finally , if time permits , we 'll discuss how the nine performance metrics relate to each other , and which of them you probably should ( or should n't ) use .
During this talk I 'll briefly describe the learning methods and performance metrics to help make the lecture accessible to non-specialists in machine learning .
Awhile ago , I embarked on an effort to build yet another build tool , this one in Scala .
I shelved that effort , and I ’ve switched to SBT , instead .
I ’ve had it with Ant , for all the reasons outlined in my previous build tool discussion , and then some .
I looked at Maven and Ivy , but , really , I am so over XML configuration files .
( Again , see previous rant . )
At one suggestion , I began to look at Gradle , a Groovy build tool with Maven , Ivy and Ant integration .
Now this was looking promising : A simple code - oriented configuration ( no XML ! Yay ! ) , with complete access to Ant tasks and full external dependency management .
Before diving feet - first into Gradle , though , I decided to take a closer look at SBT , a tool Daniel Spiewak recommended .
SBT bills itself as “ a simple build tool for Scala projects that aims to do the basics well . ”
SBT uses Scala , much the same way that Gradle uses Groovy ; this is appealing to me , since I ’m doing most of my “ elective programming ” in Scala these days .
After digging a bit , I found that SBT has complete support for external dependency management .
Like Gradle , SBT has support for automatic external dependency management , using Ivy under the covers .
Also like Gradle , SBT integrates well with Maven repositories .
It ’s completey trivial to support an external dependency on a jar file that is n’t in Maven .
If your project is laid out in a Maven directory structure ( something SBT will create for you , if you want ) , SBT can generally figure out where everything is .
If you do n’t need “ extras ” ( such as external dependencies ) , you do n’t have to create a configuration file at all .
If you do n’t like the Maven directory structure , or you want to change pieces of it ( such as where the compiled code ends up ) , SBT lets you configure just those pieces easily .
In all , it ’s an impressive piece of software .
I switched from using Ant to using SBT to build my Grizzled Scala Library , and the resulting configuration file was 15 lines long , including blank lines and comments .
I ’m building a Scala - based replacement for my Python sqlcmd tool ( because I ’ve come to prefer JDBC to Python ’s DB API ) , and I switched that project over , too .
The Ant build file for that project is 250 lines of XML , and it does n’t support external dependencies .
The Maven POM file ( if there were one ) would , of course , be smaller than that .
But the configuration file for SBT is trivial , and far more readable than a pom.xml file :
import sbt . _ class SQLShellProject ( info : ProjectInfo ) extends DefaultProject ( info ) { override def compileOptions = Unchecked :: super.compileOptions.toList // External dependencies val scalaToolsRepo = " Scala - Tools Maven Repository " at " http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases/org/scala-tools/testing/scalatest/0.9.5/ " val scalatest = " org.scala-tools.testing " % " scalatest " % " 0.9.5 " val joptSimple = " net.sf.jopt- simple " % " jopt - simple " % " 3.1 " val jodaTime = " joda - time " % " joda - time " % " 1.6 " // Grizzled comes from local machine for now val grizzled = " grizzled - scala-library " % " grizzled - scala - library " % " 0.1 " from " http://internal-repo/~bmc/code/grizzled-scala-library-0.1.jar "

Recent signs indicate that Apple may be looking to design computer chips for its own devices as early as next year .
With its own chips , the company could potentially create Apple - only features , but -- perhaps more importantly -- it could also keep Apple 's product plans secret from its competitors , according to The Wall Street Journal .
Some features that Apple may be looking to improve with its own chips include energy efficiency , graphics capability for gaming and high definition video , handwriting technology , and display management .
But what 's really could be of concern is the increasingly common information leaks about Apple 's plans based on rumored contracts with outside suppliers and the company 's buying patterns .
So far , those rumors have only helped increase product hype for Apple , but with so many product rumors flying around eventually one may come back to haunt Apple .
There 's also the concern that technology developed for Apple by a third - party could be sold to Apple 's competitors .
That 's not an uncommon event , and already happened with the Merom chip Intel developed for the MacBook Air .
Intel also introduced another reduced - size processor shortly after the MacBook Air debuted in 2008 .
Apple may also be concerned that any customizing it does on existing chip designs from third - party suppliers could be shared with other companies , according to the Journal .
We 've heard rumblings for some time that Apple could be going after its own chip designs .
Last April , Apple bought P.A. Semi a chip designer that makes " energy - efficient processors based on the Power architecture that Apple used in its Macintosh computers for many years before adopting Intel 's x86 chips . "
When Apple acquired P.A. Semi , many analysts discounted the notion that Apple would design its own chips .
The analysts pointed to Apple 's relationship with Intel -- the current supplier of Mac processors -- as being very strong and that Apple was merely buying talent to customize chip design for future Apple products and not to design its own chips .
Since then there have been other signs of Apple 's interest in computer chips : in December 2008 the company picked up a 3.6 percent stake in Imagination Technologies , a graphics chip maker ; and Apple recently hired Bob Drebin as a Senior Director .
Drebin has a long history in the computer chip industry , serving as Engineering Director for the graphics card maker ATI Technologies until that company was bought out by Advanced Micro Devices , when he became the chief technology officer of AMD 's Graphics Products Group .
The Journal says Apple also recently hired Raja Koduri , another former technology officer at AMD .
Apple is also currently on a hiring spree for top chip - making talent .
The company has listed several job openings on its
Web site that have to do with chip design , including a posting for an SOC SW Test Development Engineer , which lists the engineer 's main responsibility as " verifying the functional correctness and optimizing the coverage of Apple developed silicon . "
The Journal reports that Apple has also listed several jobs on the professional social network LinkedIn , and Apple representatives recently took part in a job fair for engineers whose jobs will soon disappear at Spansion Inc.
Spansion , a flash memory chip maker , in February announced plans to lay off more than 3000 employees and then in March Spansion filed for bankruptcy .
While Apple is looking to pull in chip - making talent , the company is n't immune to the current recession .
In March , a rumor came out that layoffs at Cupertino were imminent , then earlier this week it was discovered that Apple had reduced its retail staff by more than ten percent .

A picture may be worth a thousand words , but a user interface needs real words to clearly indicate what the user needs to do .
The words we choose are as important as , if not more important than , the graphics that frame them .
Here are four simple rules you can apply to instantly improve the usability of your touchscreen interfaces .
Rule One :
Use verbs to clearly describe what a button does .
A non-specific label is confusing to the user and could require you to spend more time on training and support .
“ OK ” and “ Cancel , ” or , even worse “ Yes ” and “ No , ” force the user to first fully understand the accompanying message and its context .
Rule Two :
Put the emphasis on the first 12 characters of your messages and labels .
People skim text .
Expect a user to read only the first two or three words of any line .
“ You are about to shut down your system ! ” loses its impact if the user sees only the first 12 characters : “ You are abou ” .
“ Shutting down your system ! ” communicates the same message and truncates better .
Rule Three :
A button ’s label should be placed on the button itself rather than adjacent to it .
Most designers center the text .
But users tend to touch only the bottom half of a button — so consider placing the label above the center .
This will increase its visibility while the user is touching it .
Rule Four :
Eliminate duplication .
If you use the same words over and over again on your button labels , group them together , instead , within a single labeled group — or eliminate the duplicate words altogether .
This will make it much easier for your user to quickly locate and touch the action he wants to take .
You wo n’t be able to follow all of these rules all the time , but by doing so whenever possible , you ’ll be delivering the best possible user experience .
The US " shock jock " banned from entering the UK said today that he would carry on with defamation proceedings against outgoing home secretary Jacqui Smith , saying he had never incited violence among his listeners .
Michael Savage , real name Michael Weiner , was included on a list of undesirables banned by the government from entering the UK last month due to " stirring up hatred and promoting their extreme views " .
Savage said his " honour " was at stake over the " crazy " Home Office decision .
" None of my words have ever led to violence for the simple reason that I do not call for violence , I do not provoke violence , and moreover , I want to say that provoking violence is illegal in the US as well , " he told Victoria Derbyshire on BBC Radio 5 Live today .
" How in the world can she allege that my words have caused violence while I am still on the air all these 15 years ? " he said .
The radio host , who said he was a longstanding Anglophile , announced last month that he was launching legal proceedings against the home secretary , who it emerged today is to stand down in a cabinet reshuffle .
He was angry at his inclusion in the list , which also includes former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard Stephen Donald Black , Hamas MP Unis Al - Astal , Jewish extremist Mike Guzovsky and American anti-gay Baptist pastor Fred Waldron Phelps .
The Home Office described Savage , 67 , as a " controversial daily radio host considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence " .
A Home Office spokeswoman insisted that the decision to ban him was the right one .
" The home secretary has made it clear that if such a case was brought that any legal proceedings would be robustly defended , " she said .
Savage , a married father of two , hosts right - wing radio show The Savage Nation , one of the most popular talkshows in the US .
The London mayor , Boris Johnson , said last month the decision to ban Savage was " utterly demented " .
" Has this stuff warped America , or deformed its political psyche ? " Johnson wrote in his Daily Telegraph column .
" On the contrary , the Americans have just had the good sense to elect a supremely gifted and eloquent black man – when the prospect of a black British prime minister still seems some way off .
What are we , some sort of kindergarten that needs to be protected against these dangerous American radio shows ? "
Savage was described by Salon.com as giving voice " to the right wing 's darkest fantasies " .
He once told Muslims to " take your religion and shove it up your behind " .
He also said , of homosexuality : " The gay and lesbian mafia wants our children .
If it can win their souls and their minds , it knows their bodies will follow .
" Of course , it wants to homosexualise the whole country , not just the children .
This is all part of the war that is going on .
Maybe you do n't want to face up to it , but it 's a very real war .
It 's being inflicted on the American people by the radical gay lobby , which is now everywhere . "

Less stable materials may not sound like a great thing for your car but they may be the solution to producing a clean - running hydrogen fuel cell vehicle .
More on that in just a minute .
First , let 's talk about where things are in clean energy .
If you 've read this site for more than five minutes you know I believe it 's better to spend money researching legitimate clean energy rather than porkbarrelling environmental activism darlings like ethanol , wind energy , solar panels and CFL bulbs .
Hydrogen fuel - cell vehicles can not only be an important part of the solution to America 's energy crisis , they can eliminate it ... but challenges remain .
A hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is like today 's electric cars but instead of the current horrid feel - good technology which trades CO2 for acid rain in the manufacturing and disposal of the batteries , future fuel cells will convert pure hydrogen and oxygen into electricity .
There arefor any fuel system that wants to replace gasoline .
If you 're one of those people who insists people have to change their ways rather than have technology that accomodates them , save your time .
It is n't going to happen .
We 're not a stone - age tribe and even when we were a stone - age tribe no one listened to people who said we had to ration food when game ran short .
Scientists instead invented agriculture and scientists will solve this problem as well .
The ABCs of hydrogen fuel cell requirements are :
In all the whining about Big Auto supposedly killing the perfect electric car in the 1990s , what is left out of documentaries is that they were dangerous and they only went 60 miles - a fine solution for Hollywood celebrities with multiple cars but not most commuters .
Make it 300 miles and it will sell , but that leads to ... To go 300 miles with today 's admittedly less efficient hydrogen methods , you need a tank the size of a double - decker bus or you need to compress it .
Compressed hydrogen can take you to a weird place quickly if something goes wrong .
Few people want to stand around for 30 minutes while their car refuels , although it would be a wonderful thing for truck stops and getting to know your fellow man on road trips .
Still , we 're not in the social engineering business .
There are ways where hydrogen vehicles can work now , namely in government jobs .
Let 's face it , the efficiency and cost loss of hydrogen vehicles are not the worst thing governments will waste money on .
Basel , Switzerland is testing the hydrogen - powered Bucher CityCat H2 , basically just a giant street sweeper , but it 's something they can use to test durability of components and practicality of technology .
in London is a little more suitable for small European parking spaces .
It is n't cheap but economies of scale will conquer that assuming demand and quality ( and keeping the government out of it ) .
Bonus : it was created using open source technology !
So your kids will some day build their own .
2.- yes , they are pursuing sugar - fueled cars .
But it can go even further than that .
A company called Isis Innovations is prototyping biological fuel cells .
Now , biological fuel cells may sound like a step backward - when I was in the army , we told foot soldiers they would be travelling using LPCs , Leather Personnel Carriers ( their boots , if you have n't had your coffee yet ) but acronyms sounded better .
So biological power to you may mean ... No , this hydrogen technology uses enzymes for a catalyst rather than expensive metal like platinum .
Bring on the cyanobacteria !
You may have heard of titanium dioxide because Energy Secretary Steven Chu said a short while ago that people should paint their roofs white .
Yes , it took a Nobel prize and an entire US government to say what everyone already knew .
It still gave activists the vapors and a chance to say that Obama is sooooo much better for science despite any actual work yet .
But he 's right , in the same way your grandparents knew .
Even better , titania nanotubes may some day allow us to convert water into hydrogen using solar energy - a clean energy trifecta ! , though it may sound a little scary at first .
Graphene sheets — layers of carbon just one atom thick — will be stabilized by vertical columns of carbon nanotubes .
Pillared graphene could theoretically store up to 41 grams of hydrogen per liter , which nearly matches the DOE target of 45 grams but it has a way to go .
Finally , let 's get back to the unstable materials I mentioned in the first paragraph to round out our 5 ways to achieve a hydrogen economy .
says it can solve all three of the consumer - comfort requirements above .
Right now its thermodynamic properties require high temperatures to release hydrogen , hardly a practical , cost - effective or safe solution .
But materials are where the research will need to go in order to have hydrogen storage safe enough for your kids yet cost - effective enough people will buy them .
Additional hydrogen fuel cell vehicle updates :* Toyota recently made the 350 - mile drive from Osaka to Tokyo expending only 70 percent of the fuel supply of a current FCV technology .
Masatami Takimoto , vice president with the company said , " " Toyota Motors is planning on releasing a fuel - cell car by 2015 in its attempt to retain its lead in the global race for green cars . " *
Honda 's FCX Clarity was recently chosen as 2009 World Green Car .
They say its fuel efficiency is three times that of a conventional auto and double that of gasoline - powered hybrids .
Volkswagen and GM both have laid claim to hydrogen technology appearing in 2012 but I have n't seen anything more than press releases on those .
Exclusive : Conservative group offers to sell endorsement for $ 2 M
The American Conservative Union asked FedEx for a check for $ 2 million to $ 3 million in return for the group ’s endorsement in a bitter legislative dispute , then flipped and sided with UPS after FedEx refused to pay .
For the $ 2 million + , ACU offered a range of services that included : " Producing op - eds and articles written by ACU ’s Chairman David Keene and / or other members of the ACU ’s board of directors .
( Note that Mr. Keene writes a weekly column that appears in The Hill . ) "
The conservative group ’s remarkable demand — black - and - white proof of the longtime Washington practice known as " pay for play " — was contained in a private letter to FedEx that was provided to POLITICO .
The letter exposes the practice by some political interest groups of taking stands not for reasons of pure principle , as their members and supporters might assume , but also in part because a sponsor is paying big money .
In the three - page letter asking for money on June 30 , the conservative group backed FedEx .
After FedEx says it rejected the offer , Keene signed onto a two - page July 15 letter backing UPS .
Keene did not return a message left on his cell phone .

What and When Is Death ?
Alan Rubenstein
All living things die .
This is not new and it has nothing to do with technology .
What is new in our technological age , however , is an uncertainty about when death has come for some human beings .
These human beings , as an unintended consequence of efforts to prevent death , are left suspended at its threshold .
Observing them in this state of suspension , we , the living , have a very hard time knowing what to think :
Is the living being still among us ?
Is there still a present for this person or has the long reign of the past tense begun :
Is he or was he ?
The phenomenon is popularly known as “ brain death , ” but the name is misleading .
Death accepts no modifiers .
There is only one death .
Has it occurred or not ?
Alive or dead ?
The President ’s Council on Bioethics has taken up this question in a recently published report entitled Controversies in the Determination of Death .
At stake in the report is the moral status of those human beings who are “ suspended at the threshold . ”
These are human beings who have suffered the worst sort of injury to the brain , but who , with technological support , retain ambiguous signs of life .
The brain injury leaves them in a state of incapacitation significantly more profound than that associated with the “ persistent vegetative state ” ( PVS ) , the condition associated with the cases of Karen Ann Quinlan , Nancy Cruzan , and Terri Schiavo .
The name given to their injury is “ brain death , ” or sometimes “ whole brain death . ”
The President ’s Council suggests a more neutral term , which this article will adopt as well : “ total brain failure . ”
Calling the condition by this name does not pre-judge the question of whether the patient so diagnosed is alive or dead .
What can we say definitively about the patient diagnosed with total brain failure ?
He is in an eyes - closed coma twenty - four hours a day .
He shows no sensitivity to pain and , on examination by a neurologist , exhibits no reflex responses that would indicate even the simplest brain function .
He makes no effort whatsoever to breathe on his own .
If the ventilator were removed , his cells and tissues would , in a very short time , shut down .
In stillness , the body as a whole would come to look like a familiar corpse .
But as long as the ventilator remains , that body does not look like a corpse .
It remains warm , like the living , and the organs continue to do the work they have always done , albeit with the assistance of chemical interventions .
Most significant and most challenging , from the point of view of common sense , is the fact that the heart still beats .
The injury to the brain has destroyed the centers in the brainstem that regulate breathing — thus the perpetual need for the ventilator .
But the heart of an animal — even one profoundly injured — has its own “ inherent rhythmicity , ” its own originative source of motion .
This means that heartbeat and circulation have no absolute dependence on the brain in the way that respiration has .
The heart , without any input from the brain , can continue to beat as long as its own tissue is intact .
The characteristic puzzle of the total brain failure condition , then , is this : the body remains warm and pink as blood courses through the vessels ; the vital organs continue performing their work ; but the human being as a whole , permanently unconscious and permanently and profoundly disengaged from his surroundings — eyes closed , making no response to pain , making no effort to breathe — seems something short of alive .
The Heart - Beating Cadaver
In most of the world , the law considers the human being who is carefully diagnosed with total brain failure to be deceased .
This has been the case in some American states since the early 1970s and in all fifty states since the early 1980s ( the result either of legislation or , in some states , court decisions ) .
This move to uniformity was encouraged by a report issued by a forerunner to the President ’s Council on Bioethics , a group known as the President ’s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research ( hereafter : President ’s Commission ) .
This 1981 report presented the medical facts about the condition as they were then known and summarized arguments for and against equating the condition with the death of the human being .
Responding to a patchwork of legal approaches to this question in different parts of the country — the same person pronounced dead in Kansas would be considered alive in neighboring Missouri — the President ’s Commission proposed a uniform statute for all states to adopt :
An individual who has sustained either ( 1 ) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions , or ( 2 ) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain , including the brain stem , is dead .
A determination of death must be made in accordance with accepted medical standards .
This statute puts two standards for determining death — one ancient and one novel — on equal footing :
If a doctor can determine that circulation and breathing are gone and will never return , the patient is dead .
So it has always been .
But then the novelty : if a doctor can determine that the entire brain is non-functional and will never regain its powers , the patient is dead .
The existence of cases where the second standard is met and not the first — the existence of patients who are stabilized on a ventilator with beating hearts but destroyed brains — presented the puzzle .
The statute provided the answer :
These patients are no longer truly patients .
They are heart - beating cadavers .
Cadavers there have always been , but heart - beating ones are products of modern technology — of the ventilator and the modern intensive care unit .
Under this new paradigm of practice , there are two distinct classes of comatose , brain - injured patients : those who have already died and those who might be ethically allowed to die since there is little hope of a meaningful recovery .
The two classes can only be distinguished by employing a barrage of neurological tests .
If these reveal that some vitality remains in the brain — even if it is limited to the more ancient part of the brain known as the brainstem — the patient is considered still alive .
The family and medical staff must decide what course to follow :
Will interventions be continued or will they be suspended ?
Suspending them can mean allowing death to come .
At one time such action was controversial , but today , in this context , it is not .
If there is evidence of the patient ’s prior expressed wishes , these are considered .
The doctors offer guidance .
Family members have their say .
While some choose to let death come , others choose to keep up interventions .
It is in the latter cases that the patient can , over time , emerge from the eyes - closed coma condition into the vegetative state , a condition of compromised consciousness in which the patient goes to sleep and wakes up , responds minimally to pain , and , in most cases , regains the power to breathe on his own .
But if the initial neurological tests conducted during the crisis period reveal total brain failure , if they reveal that the injury has ravaged both the higher centers of the brain and the brainstem , then the law offers no opportunity for a decision about whether death should be allowed to come .
Death has come , says the law , and the ventilator is ventilating a corpse .
The law has been well established for decades .
But still we can ask :
Is the rationale behind it sound ?
Why is the case of total brain failure not seen as a form of human injury — albeit of the most severe kind ?
Why does n’t the question of whether the patient should be allowed to die apply here just as it applies to other circumstances of injury where life - sustaining technologies are employed ?
The current President ’s Council on Bioethics , following the lead of certain strident voices in neurological science and in the wider community of concerned observers , has re-opened the question :
Should we believe in heart - beating cadavers ?
That is , should we believe that a human body with a beating heart can be dead ?
If so , why ?
At this point we must acknowledge the eight - hundred - pound gorilla in the room .
For there is a very practical , perhaps even cynical , reason that can be given for believing in heart - beating cadavers :
Such a belief is exceedingly useful .
Indeed , it serves a noble purpose .
For the heart - beating cadaver is the bedrock upon which organ transplantation medicine has been built .
It fulfills the two requirements , one moral and one technical , that are necessary for the harvesting of organs for transplant into other human beings .
The technical requirement : that the organs remain perfused with oxygenated blood up until the time of their excision , and thus remain protected from oxygen starvation ( or “ anoxia ” ) .
The moral requirement : that the body from which organs are harvested be a corpse — no longer a full human subject .
In 2007 , over twenty - eight thousand organs were taken from roughly eight thousand deceased donors .
Roughly ninety percent of these donors were pronounced dead by the neurological standard and had their organs removed before the ventilator was detached and the heart stopped beating .
Although organ transplantation on this scale might have been unforeseeable for the pioneers of the neurological standard , the connection between the two issues was undoubtedly at the forefront of their attention .
When , in 1968 , a committee at Harvard Medical School announced the medical consensus that total brain failure ( they called the condition “ irreversible coma ” ) should be considered the death of the human being , they mentioned the prevention of controversy in obtaining organs for transplantation as one of the primary reasons for the change .
By contrast , when the President ’s Commission issued its report in 1981 , it insisted that the issue was not whether organ harvesting was legitimate for patients with total brain failure but rather whether those patients were , in fact , dead .
In so doing , the President ’s Commission followed the lead of thinkers like Leon Kass , Alexander Capron , Paul Ramsey , and Hans Jonas who had argued , in the wake of the Harvard report , that the question of whether the new standard for death was legitimate should be considered on its own merits and not in light of the impact the standard would have on organ transplantation or any other secondary consequence .
The 2008 report from the President ’s Council on Bioethics follows the same principle as its forerunner .
As the new report puts the matter in its introduction :
The central question addressed by the Council is , Does a diagnosis of “ whole brain death ” mean that the human being is dead ?
That is to say , the central question is not , Does a diagnosis of “ whole brain death ” mean that the human being is eligible to be a heart - beating organ donor ?
This is surely the most principled first step to take in beginning an inquiry into controversies in the determination of death .
The Council steadfastly refuses to accept that utilitarian concerns should have decisive weight .
Nonetheless , it would be impossible to conduct a credible inquiry into the neurological standard for determining death without locating the question in its pressure - cooker context .
Rejecting the “ whole brain death ” standard would mean one of two things : Either ( 1 ) dealing a severe blow to organ transplantation at a time when talk of “ organ shortages ” is commonplace — that is , when medical humanitarians already bemoan the constraints that come of the limited number of organ sources ; or ( 2 ) sanctioning the idea of “ death by organ harvesting ” — of taking organs from one human being who is on the verge of death but still alive to prolong the life of someone else .
Principled Agnostics and Personhood Theorists
In the immediate aftermath of the Harvard Committee ’s 1968 report , the philosopher Hans Jonas presented a position that might fairly be called principled agnosticism .
Jonas counseled putting the genie back into the lamp : undoing the “ redefinition of death ” that the Harvard group announced and that had so much momentum behind it .
Jonas did not argue that patients with the worst kind of brain injury are indisputably still alive .
He argued , rather , that we cannot know that they are deceased .
In that state of ignorance , the only moral course is to eschew innovative definitions and assume that , in tough cases , life is still present .
He put the point this way in an essay collected in his Philosophical Essays ( 1974 ) :
We do not know with certainty the borderline between life and death , and a definition cannot substitute for knowledge .
Moreover , we have sufficient grounds for suspecting that the artificially supported condition of the comatose patient may still be one of life , however reduced — i.e. , for doubting that , even with the brain function gone , he is completely dead .
In this state of marginal ignorance and doubt the only course to take is to lean over backward toward the side of possible life .
What does “ leaning over backward toward the side of possible life ” mean ?
For Jonas and for most others who agree with his position , it does not mean continuing to administer aggressive interventions to keep the patient with total brain failure from dying ( or , if you will , from dying beyond a reasonable doubt ) .
Again , Jonas stated the distinction with eloquence :
The question [ of interventions to sustain the patient ] cannot be answered by decreeing that death has already occurred and the body is therefore in the domain of things ; rather it is by holding , e.g. , that it is humanly not justified — let alone demanded — to artificially prolong the life of a brainless body ... the physician can , indeed should , turn off the respirator and let the “ definition of death ” take care of itself by what then inevitably happens .
Jonas ’s position can be stated simply :
In the face of total brain failure , remove the ventilator from the body and let it pass through the threshold area of ambiguity to the ground of certain death .
Do not , however , simply regard it as a dead body , because it would be immoral to do so , absent a greater level of certainty .
Jonas ’s counsel would surely be the one we followed today , were it not for our need to extract organs from bodies suspended at the threshold .
But the need is there and so the precision in knowing when death has come — the precision that Jonas claims is impossible — continues to be sought .
A very different sort of criticism comes from what might be called the “ death of the person ” or “ neocortical death ” camp .
Holders of this position consider today ’s neurological standard for death too restrictive .
Certainly , they would argue , a human being with total brain failure should be considered dead in spite of persisting signs of bodily life .
He should be so considered because , though his body remains living , the person has expired .
The individual human being , known to his friends and enemies , with all his tastes and fears and quirks of personality , is gone ; why should we care if there is still a pulse , warm skin , and functioning kidneys ?
Indeed , in cases of vegetative - state patients — at least the most severe cases — why should we consider breathing and sleep - wake cycles and responsiveness to pain as signs that the person is still alive ?
If a brain injury has left a mere body behind , this is no impediment to claiming that the life ’s flame has been extinguished .
If a society were to seriously follow through on the consequences of considering patients in a vegetative state to be dead , then families and hospitals would be compelled , not simply permitted , to remove life - sustaining interventions like the ventilator or feeding tube .
Few who argue for a personhood definition of death draw this conclusion , at least publicly .
But there are many , such as Georgetown University bioethicist Robert Veatch , who claim that patients in a vegetative state should be used as heart - beating organ donors so long as it can be shown that this was their pre-mortem wish or is the wish of their surviving family .
In this view , their loss of “ personhood ” makes them at least “ dead enough ” to be used for this noble purpose .
As things stand today , patients with less severe injuries than total brain failure are never used as heart - beating donors .
There is an alternate route to donation for some of these patients , however .
During the period when the patient is still dependent on the ventilator ( recall that independence from this machine often comes for a vegetative patient after the time of crisis following the injury has passed ) , he can be taken off the machine and allowed to expire .
If this is done in a very particular , deliberate way , then organ harvesting can follow immediately upon the stoppage of heartbeat and circulation .
This is known as “ non-heart - beating donation ” or “ donation after cardiac death . ”
The practice , which is becoming significantly more common in the United States , is controversial in its own right .
But the mere existence of this alternate route to donation is testimony to the fact that patients in a vegetative state — or , more precisely , patients who can reasonably be expected to emerge into a vegetative state — are not considered by the law to be dead .
There are many who would like to see this changed .
Defending the Neurological Standard
From very different angles , these two positions — Jonas ’s call for greater certainty and the “ personhood ” camp ’s call for a looser standard — are both critical of today ’s well - established law and accepted practice .
What is the line of reasoning that defends that practice — the reasoning that says , contra Jonas , that we can know , with the certainty required for moral action , that patients with total brain failure are dead and , contra “ personhood theorists , ” that death is not a matter of losing personality but of losing bodily life ; that death is a biological event , not a psychological or mental one ?
The standard defense of today ’s neurological standard goes like this :
The body with total brain failure is , by virtue of its injury , not a unified , integrated whole .
Parts of the organism still function , but the organism itself , which only exists so long as the parts work together in an integrated way , is no more .
The body that has suffered total brain failure resembles the proverbial corpse whose hair and nails still seem to be growing even as he is lowered into the grave .
The physiological basis for this position is the important contribution to bodily , or “ somatic , ” integration that is carried out under normal circumstances by the brain , especially the brainstem .
Kidney and liver function , blood pressure regulation , temperature control — all of these diverse bodily processes receive input from the brainstem and from hormonal regulatory centers in the brain .
When the brain is destroyed , the processes go on working for a time , but the coordination that made sense of their operation , that brought their work together into the operation of the organism as a whole , is gone .
Neurologist James L. Bernat and his colleagues , in an influential 1981 paper , put the matter this way :
This criterion [ total brain failure ] is perfectly correlated with the permanent cessation of functioning of the organism as a whole because the brain is necessary for the functioning of the organism as a whole .
It integrates , generates , interrelates , and controls complex bodily activities .
A patient on a ventilator with a totally destroyed brain is merely a group of artificially maintained subsystems since the organism as a whole has ceased to function .
An important corollary to this position was the fact that a body with total brain failure could not be stabilized .
Since the physiological structures which are required for integration are gone , and since integration is necessary for a stable condition of health , the body with total brain failure could not last in that state , even if the ventilator continued to put oxygen in the body and the heart continued to move the oxygenated blood out to the tissues .
The phenomenon of “ multiple organ failure ” — the deterioration of all the body ’s organs , usually over a short time — seems to confirm this :
The bodies of patients with total brain failure would “ come apart ” in spite of the ventilator ’s work and the beating of the heart .
Even if the body was only being maintained for the purpose of organ donation , the “ coming apart ” was often inexorable and had to be fought against by the determined and careful institution of drug therapies .
The “ loss of somatic integration ” rationale for the “ whole brain ” neurological standard held sway for over two decades — for all the time that the medical response to “ brain death ” and its consequences for organ transplantation took on the standard form they have today .
In 1981 , at the time of this rationale ’s first articulation , the use of a human being as a source of organs was by no means a routine occurrence .
The development of immunosuppressive therapies and improved surgical techniques during the 1980s , along with crucial financial and logistical support lent to organ transplantation by the federal government , caused the practice to expand greatly and , as a consequence , contributed to the normalization of belief in the heart - beating cadaver .
That normalization might have occurred even without a conceptual justification .
But a conceptual justification there was , and this was it .
The New Challenge to the Neurological Standard
By the year 2000 , anyone taking up a position of skepticism about the neurological standard was seen as voicing an opinion far out of the mainstream .
In that year , Pope John Paul II informed a congress of transplant professionals that “ the criterion adopted in more recent times for ascertaining the fact of death , namely the complete and irreversible cessation of all brain activity , if rigorously applied , does not seem to conflict with the essential elements of a sound anthropology . ”
Moreover , he noted ( though , to be fair , did not fully endorse ) the rationale for this criterion :
“ The complete and irreversible cessation of all brain activity ( in the cerebrum , cerebellum and brain stem ) ... is then considered the sign that the individual organism has lost its integrative capacity . ”
As widely as it has been accepted , the rationale for the neurological standard has nevertheless been challenged in recent years — most prominently by D. Alan Shewmon , a veteran pediatric neurologist at UCLA medical center .
Shewmon , who had taken many different positions on the question of “ brain death ” over the years , had his most profound influence when he became the leading critic of the equation of total brain failure with human death .
Shewmon made his contribution in this area not so much by discovering new facts as by shouting loudly what others acknowledged in hushed tones .
For one thing , Shewmon pointed out , there are many cases of patients who suffer total brain failure but are stabilized following the period of crisis immediately after their injury passes .
In a 1998 paper in the journal Neurology , Shewmon gathered together 175 case reports of patients whose bodies were maintained after the total brain failure diagnosis for much longer than the literature on “ brain death ” suggested was possible .
Many of these reports were drawn from media sources or lacked documentation to confirm the diagnosis , but at least fifty of the cases were well substantiated .
The length of “ survival ” ranged from a month to over a year to — in one remarkable case — over fourteen years .
Still , one might counter , as many critics of Shewmon ’s Neurology article did , that “ chronic brain death , ” as he called it , was too rare an occurrence to be given much credibility .
“ These cases are anecdotes yearning for a denominator , ” one prominent pair of critics put it in a letter of response to the journal .
The trouble with this objection is that it is very rare for hospitals to try to sustain bodies once a diagnosis of total brain failure has been made .
Such bodies are either disconnected from the ventilator very soon after diagnosis or they are kept on the ventilator just long enough for surgeons to extract organs .
In other words , the quick collapse of the body that occurs in nearly all total brain failure cases is not an intrinsic fact about the injury but a result of how we routinely respond to the injury .
Shewmon also gives an account for why there is so much instability in the body after total brain failure .
It is not , as some have assumed , because the brain is the integrator of the body ’s autonomic work .
The brainstem clearly does have an important role to play in bodily integration under normal conditions , but there is no proof that it is essential for that integration to occur .
Integration might well be , as Shewmon puts it , an “ emergent property of the whole organism . ”
When the brainstem is compromised , other parts of the nervous system take on the role of supporting integration .
The instability of the body with total brain failure , in this theory , might be a result of a sort of shock that follows injury — a transient condition , in other words .
When that shock passes — in some cases at least — the body stabilizes .
Some support for Shewmon ’s theory is provided by cases of total brain failure that have occurred in pregnant women .
A 2003 paper in Critical Care Medicine by neurologists David J. Powner and I. M. Bernstein surveyed eleven such cases from the medical literature .
In all of the cases , it was possible to sustain the body of the pregnant woman long enough for the delivery of a viable fetus .
The length of time that support continued after total brain failure ranged from 36 hours to 107 days .
These cases at least suggest that , given the current state of technology , most bodies could be stabilized after brain death if those caring for the patient were motivated to do so , as they are with these pregnant women .
Shewmon may have delivered the fatal blow to the “ loss of integrative unity ” rationale for a “ whole brain ” standard of death in a 2001 paper in the Journal of Medicine and Philosophy .
He argued that there are many functions that go on in the bodies of patients with total brain failure that unquestionably indicate integration in any meaningful sense of that term .
It is not only the rare cases of prolonged “ survival ” that give the lie to claims of lost somatic integration .
Even in the more routine cases where the body would very likely fall off the cliff in a short time no matter what efforts were made , there are processes which call on disparate systems of the body to work together in an end - directed , coordinated way .
Examples include wound healing , blood pressure control , temperature control , maintenance of chemical homeostasis , elimination of cellular wastes , and fighting infections .
To the trained eye , all of these are integrated functions ; and all are well documented in patients diagnosed with total brain failure .
Most commentators have acknowledged , either explicitly or tacitly , that Shewmon ’s critique is absolutely compelling up to this point :
The rationale for declaring a patient with total brain failure to be dead cannot rest on the fact that the brainless body is “ merely a group of artificially maintained subsystems ” and , as a result , is intrinsically and unavoidably unstable .
This long accepted “ fact ” is simply not true .
Death After Shewmon
What are the options for moving forward in the wake of Shewmon ’s work ?
One is to renounce entirely the neurological standard for death .
The failure of the integrative unity rationale and the presence of “ chronic brain death ” show that Jonas was right all along : there is too much uncertainty about the line between life and death for us to accept any innovation .
Only the age - old means of knowing death is valid : it must be shown beyond reasonable doubt that heartbeat and breathing are gone and could never be restored .
If this is the case , we face a stark choice : Either abandon heart - beating organ harvesting , or re-conceive of what we are doing as taking organs from the nearly dead rather than the newly ( but fully ) dead .
Some very prominent bioethicists , including Robert Truog , Franklin Miller , and Stuart Youngner , argue for this latter course : do away with the “ dead donor rule ” and save organ transplantation by learning to live with and manage death by organ - extraction .
Another way forward is to confess that all this time the real reason why the neurological standard seemed palatable was that the patient with total brain failure has lost consciousness and will never regain it .
All the talk about the body no longer being a whole was just a distraction .
The pulsing heartbeat , the warm skin , all the integrated work of the body — these are indicators that the body is alive but not the person .
And it is the life of the person that demands protection , in this case from being made into a source for organs .
This kind of dualism opens the door , of course , to the possibility that there are more “ personless ” bodies — that , for instance , some patients with severe dementia or PVS might meet the description .
In any case , the bodies with total brain failure certainly qualify .
There is still another option — one that , until the release of the report from the President ’s Council on Bioethics , had not been pursued .
This option involves rejecting the “ integrative unity rationale , ” just as Shewmon insists that we must , but maintaining that there are other biologically sound reasons for considering those with total brain failure to be dead .
A clue that this might be a fruitful avenue to pursue comes from this thought :
It is neither “ mental life ” that makes an animal alive nor is it mere “ integrative work . ”
Consider the fact that many animals , even when healthy , exhibit no discernable “ mental life , ” as that term is usually employed , and yet we have no trouble calling them alive .
Any animal without a central nervous system ( including a human embryo ) could serve as an example here .
And consider , at the same time , that complex machines often exhibit “ integrated functioning ” and we have no trouble saying they are not alive .
Something is missing from the “ brain death ” debate — something fundamental about what it means to be a living organism .
The Whole Organism
To develop a sound argument for whether an organism is still alive , we must work harder at understanding what an organism is .[*]
We might reasonably begin where the defenders of the “ whole brain ” standard for death begin — by asserting that an organism is a whole , not a mere collection or aggregation of parts .
Moreover , an organism ’s wholeness is manifest in the way that the parts — cells , tissues , organs — are actively organized .
That is , it is reasonable to mark the working - together of the parts .
An organism is indeed a fantastically complex example of a whole that , by virtue of its organization , is more than the sum of its individual parts .
The etymological connection between the English words “ health ” and “ whole ” is illuminating : both are derived from the Old English word hal .
An organism is a whole because it is the sort of thing that has health ; the sort of being whose parts can manifest this sort of ordered , balanced activity .
But it is not adequate to leave the matter here — to simply state that the organism is a whole because its parts work together in an integrated way .
We must ask what the work of the organism as a whole is — what is it that an organism does that makes it an organism ?
Again the comparison with a machine is instructive .
While it is true that a clock is a whole by virtue of the integrated operation of its parts toward a common end , and that the whole would be lost if the individual parts were merely piled up in a heap , one cannot understand the clock without understanding the work of the clock as a whole , the work of keeping time .
Different sorts of organisms are of course very different from one another .
The cheetah does what the cheetah does , the amoeba does what the amoeba does , the human does what the human does .
Should we really expect to find some common description of the work of an organism qua organism ?
One reason to think we should is the fact that we have no trouble calling all of these creatures alive .
But what does it mean to be alive ?
At one time it would have been an acceptable philosophical answer to say that being alive means having or partaking in a soul .
But this term , “ soul , ” has taken on many connotations that are not particularly useful to scientific , biological accounts of the phenomenon of life .
One such distracting notion of soul is that of an immaterial “ ghost in the machine ” that animates the body but is something other than the body .
This notion of soul is at odds with modern biology , or at least is of no help to biology in its project of understanding organisms .
There is , however , an older notion of soul that is worth revisiting .
Aristotle uses the word entelechia to describe the soul .
This word was a novel coinage in Greek and it is rendered reasonably faithfully in English by a similarly novel ( and clumsy ) coinage proposed by translator Joe Sachs : “ being - at - work - staying - itself . ”
This , according to Aristotle , is the mode of being distinctive to living things ; this is what sets the living apart from the non-living .
What does it mean ?
It means , for one , that a living thing is never simply reducible to its material parts .
The proof positive of this is the fact that a living thing is always exchanging the parts that compose it for new parts .
It is always turning over its chemical constituents by taking in new material from the outside world and expelling waste products back into that world .
The living thing is not the parts , not the material , but rather the form that the ever - shifting material takes as it moves through the living system .
In living things , form is more primary than matter : the matter is incidental ; the chemicals that make up my body at any given moment are just the ones that happen to be there now and will be gone later .
But the form of the body persists .
Notice that this is categorically different from the relationship between the fuel that drives a machine and the machine itself — the fuel does not remake or reconstitute the machine as it is processed .
The engine is not the gasoline in the way that we are what we eat and breathe .
But noticing the constant turnover of material in order to sustain form is just the beginning .
The next important observation is that a living thing is not passive in this process .
It is not reconstituted by forces outside it but rather at work reconstituting itself through interchange with the surrounding world .
The living thing is a being - at - work - staying - itself .
It actively reaches out in a purposeful and discerning way into the world to take what is other and make it “ self . ”
The higher animals exhibit this in both the way we go after food and consume it and in the way that we bring oxygenated air into the body system in order to stay alive .
Less complex animals have other means of appropriating material from the world , but it is just as much the case that these processes involve action and discernment on the part of the organism .
The amoeba exhibits action and discernment in moving toward food in its fluid surroundings so that it can envelop it and bring inside what is needed from the outside .
It should be clear now that in this account , conscious awareness is not a necessary feature of “ action and discernment . ”
The activity of breathing demonstrates very nicely how action on the world can be initiated by an organism either deliberately , as in conscious breathing ( think yoga , or simply “ take a deep breath ” ) or “ unconscious ” breathing ( think breathing while we sleep or , in fact , most of the time that we are awake and not paying attention ) .
Again , the point is not involvement of the mind or the attention but rather end - directed and outward - pointing motion initiated by the organism or , to put it another way , from the organism ’s center .
This might seem like a very rudimentary way of thinking about the work of an organism — but that is just the point .
To get at a characterization of bare life , we must put aside in our thoughts all the noble and elegant work of organisms — the cheetah running , the eagle soaring , the human being staring at the heavens .
These activities display living things in the fullness of their nature , but they are built upon a humbler foundation .
The fundamental work of an organism is to preserve itself by remaking itself .
And this remaking involves engaging in commerce with the world , actively and with discernment .
There is still one element of the fundamental work of an organism left out of the description thus far .
The organism is not only active and discerning in engaging its world in order to stay alive , it is also interested .
Leon Kass describes this feature of organisms well in the first chapter of his 1994 book The Hungry Soul :
What moves an organism to feed is not merely the sensed and registered presence or absence of a certain chemical or edible being in its environment but the inner needy state of the organism , for which such an absence is a lack , an absence to be overcome or remedied .
Bacteria do not measure the concentration of glucose in their environment in the indifferent and detached way of the biochemist who prepared their growth medium ....
The organism would not “ respond ” to perceived food “ stimuli ” were it not an “ interested ” or “ appetitive ” being , were it not already internally ordered toward the necessary activities of self - nourishing .
Kass is focused on the activity of feeding or eating , but the same observation can be extended to breathing , in those creatures who engage in this activity .
When an organism brings in air from the world , it does so in response to a felt need that directs it outward to find what it lacks .
This is no more a conscious effort of the organism than the bacteria ’s effort to obtain glucose .
But conscious awareness is not the key to understanding bare life — the pre-conscious powers of action , discernment , and appetite are .
Brain Failure and the Organism
The discovery of the total brain failure state in the 1950s launched a long conversation about the moral significance of such a condition of maximal dysfunction .
The recent efforts of Alan Shewmon and others in challenging the total brain failure standard for death are an understandable response to the difficulty of articulating why such a loss of function might signal a morally relevant change in the sort of being the family and physicians are confronted with on the hospital bed .
But keeping in mind the preceding discussion of the basic work of the organism , we can look anew at the morality of treating patients with total brain failure as deceased human beings .
We must begin by asking :
What is distinct about the phenomenon that we are presented with in the human being with total brain failure ?
And what is it about the experience of witnessing a body in this state that has led so many people , expert and non-expert alike , to accept the state as a form of human death ?
I would contend that it is precisely the fact that the body is shut off from the world , that the need - driven commerce between organism and world is simply no longer there .
The body with total brain failure is disengaged from the world in a significantly more profound way than is true of any other human injury .
Colloquially speaking , the body is “ closed for business ” ; it is no longer engaging in the most fundamental work of living things , and observers recognize the profundity of this fact even if they do n’t articulate it in just this way .
There are two distinct facets of the body ’s disengagement with the world after total brain failure .
One is the utter lack of consciousness .
Even the very compromised form of consciousness in patients with PVS — called by neurologists , somewhat problematically , “ awakeness without awareness ” — is absent here .
The body with total brain failure never wakes up and it fails the simplest tests of reactivity to stimuli — to pain , to light , to anything from the world outside .
The second facet of the body ’s disengagement is the complete loss of drive to breathe .
This aspect of the phenomenon is often brushed aside rather casually by those who ponder the significance of total brain failure .
Many are content to say either that breathing is not absent in the body connected to the ventilator or that the absence of the power to breathe is of little importance to interpreting the patient ’s condition .
Those who claim that the body with total brain failure still breathes betray a deep misunderstanding of this crucial activity .
It is true that the ventilator successfully bellows air in and out of the lungs .
And it is true , as well , that oxygen from the air enters the bloodstream and is carried out to the body tissues .
But these mechanical aspects of breathing are not the whole of the phenomenon .
Breathing is an activity of the whole organism , an action taken by the organism , toward the world , and spurred by the organism ’s felt need .
The body of an animal needs what the world has to give and works constantly in its own interests to obtain it .
This element of need - driven action on the world must not be forgotten when we evaluate the condition of total brain failure .
The fact that there is no sign of this need , no “ air hunger ” that would disturb the stillness , lends credence to the idea that death has indeed come .
To be clear :
The claim being made here is not that patients who cannot breathe on their own are , by virtue of this fact , deceased .
This would be an absurd claim given the many cases of conscious patients who , due to spinal cord injuries , require a ventilator to remain alive .
The claim is rather that in the presence of an irreversible and complete coma , it is philosophically defensible to give weight to the presence or absence of the drive to breathe .
If the first condition here is not met — if there is even a very rudimentary sign of awareness or reactivity to the outer world — then the question of whether the patient is alive should be settled on that ground alone :
No conscious being , no being capable of either awareness or awakeness , is dead .
But when this more elaborate form of engagement with the world is gone , we must look for signs of the humbler , more ground - level form of engagement that we call breathing .
When such signs are lacking and when there is reliable evidence that neither consciousness nor drive to breathe will ever return , the body can rightly be called a corpse .
At that point , it should be handled with all the dignity that the remains of a human being require .
Maintaining the body ’s persistent functions long enough to take organs to help those in need of them is not inconsistent with this dignity .
This action can be done without compromising our adherence to the dead donor rule and without requiring us to revolutionize the concept of death by considering it anything other than a biological event that happens to all living things .
[ *]
The argument that follows is my own , although a similar case can be found in the recent report of the President ’s Council on Bioethics .
These ideas owe much Leon Kass ’s work on philosophical biology and also to Hans Jonas ’s writings on this subject , which I here employ to overcome his own stated views on the question of “ brain death . ”
The woman standing on the steps of the supreme court in Washington DC is nervous .
A harsh sun is beating down on the white marble , threatening to bleach her out of the picture .
She looks very small beneath the classical columns of America 's legal shrine , with its legend : " Equal justice under the law . "
" I 'm scared , " she says , glancing at two police officers standing nearby .
" You never know if they 'll recognise me .
Maybe they 'd arrest me . "
A few minutes later , as we prepare to leave the supreme court complex , the same woman bends over and spits ostentatiously on to its bottom step .
" There , I 've done it ! " she says .
" I made sure those guards saw me . "
But just a moment ago you were scared they might arrest you , I say .
" I do n't care .
I 'm feeling militant standing in front of this mortuary . "
Such is the volatile , confusing and contradictory world of Norma McCorvey .
She is , or was , the Jane Roe of the US supreme court 's most famous and contentious ruling , Roe v Wade .
In 1973 , as the anonymous pregnant plaintiff , her plight was presented to the court so that American women could win the constitutional right to an abortion .
For the past 36 years , Roe versus Wade has been a fault line across America , pitting its coasts against its heartland , state against state , woman against woman .
And with the killing of the abortion doctor , George Tiller , in Kansas in May , the issue has come hurtling back into the national consciousness , its potential for vicious conflict thrown into stark relief .
For 36 years , Roe v Wade has also been the great divider for McCorvey personally .
Abortion has come to dominate her life , carving it into two blocks that are so wildly at odds with each other that it is hard to imagine them being squeezed into the same human frame .
Here 's what McCorvey wrote in 1994 , when she was proud to be Jane Roe , a supporter of the women 's rights she helped to attain : " All over the country the anti-choice fanatics are still at work , still trying to inflict their own religious views on others , still trying to hide their anti-woman feelings , still trying to keep us from controlling our own bodies and our own lives . "
Yet here is McCorvey today , on the steps of the supreme court where those rights were laid down : " These steps are covered in blood !
' Equal justice under the law ' - what crock !
If there is no right for a child to be born , there is no justice at all . "
In May , McCorvey was arrested along with 26 other anti-abortionists inside the grounds of the Catholic university of Notre Dame in Indiana .
She was protesting against the appearance of Barack Obama , whom she sees as an evil advocate of what she now calls " child killing " .
" It was exhilarating ! " she says .
" When I got arrested , I loved it !
I felt like I was high .
But it was a God high .
I 'd never been arrested before .
But who better to be arrested for than the unborn children ? "
McCorvey was born Norma Nelson on 22 September 1947 in a small town in Louisiana , and raised in Houston , Texas .
Her father , a TV repairman , left the family when she was little .
Her mother , who worked in a supermarket , used to slap her and call her an idiot .
Norma was in trouble with the law from the age of 10 .
Aged 16 , she married a sheet - metal worker called Woody McCorvey , who turned violent after he learned she was pregnant .
She left him after two months .
When baby Melissa was born in 1965 , Norma 's own mother adopted the infant against McCorvey 's wishes .
Separated from her first - born , she entered into a tailspin of drinking and drug - taking in which she remained , she says , for most of the next 30 years .
She bears the scars of those years : her face carries deep worry lines and her voice is grained with years of smoking .
As we talk , she pulls up the sleeves of her white cardigan to reveal neat crosshatching over the inside of her wrists , the record of self harm .
Another girl , who McCorvey calls Paige but who she has not seen since birth , was given away for adoption in 1967 .
Then , two years later , she was pregnant again from a casual fling .
Baby Jane Roe was on the way .
Aged 21 , with her third child pending , McCorvey was working in a circus looking after freak animals - a giant rat , a five - legged steer , a double - headed snake .
" I was a street kid .
I lived with my dad part - time and on the streets part - time .
I sold flowers on the street corner .
These are n't high - paying jobs . "
She could n't envisage going through with another birth .
Even now , a committed anti-abortionist , she communicates with burning conviction how she felt then : " I did n't want to bring a baby into the world that I was living in .
I never knew where I was going to sleep at night .
I never knew if I was going to eat . "
She inquired about abortion , only to learn it was illegal in Texas .
She was steered towards an underground abortion joint and was shocked .
" It was bad .
I remember a table in the middle of the room , nothing else .
There was dried red stuff all over the floor .
It was full of 'roaches .
The epitome of filth . "
Soon after , she was introduced to young lawyers , Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee .
They wanted to challenge the Texan ban on the grounds that it violated a woman 's right to privacy in her reproductive choices .
They were looking for a test case , and McCorvey fitted the bill .
She did not want the baby , had strong economic reasons against having it , and was so poor she could not travel to the few states that in 1969 did allow abortions .
In the end the case was widened into a class action , but McCorvey remained the anonymous lead plaintiff .
Legal battle was joined : Jane Roe v the Dallas district attorney , Henry Wade .
The case duly rose up the legal pyramid until , on 22 January 1973 , the supreme court , ruling by seven justices to two , slapped down the Texan ban and made abortion legal across the US .
Too late for McCorvey , who , in fact , has never had an abortion .
She had her baby in the summer of 1970 , three years before the ruling .
In her 1994 autobiography , I Am Roe , she describes the harrowing moment when a nurse mistakenly handed her the girl for feeding , not knowing she was being put out for adoption .
" There was a flap of cloth over its face .
My entire body , my entire soul cried out to me to turn the flap down , to look at my baby 's face .
But my mind told me that it would be the worst thing I could ever do .
I never touched the flap . "
She has never seen nor heard of the baby since then , though she has given her biological daughter a name : Mariah .
She prays that one day she will come and find her .
McCorvey says the whole legal fight over Roe v Wade " went right over my head " .
Her only reaction to the news that Weddington and Coffee had won was fear .
" I thought , what the hell have I done ?
I had a liquid dinner that night .
I had a lot of liquid dinners after that night .
I went into a very deep depression . "
She remained disengaged for several years .
But from 1980 she began to become more involved in the pro-abortion movement , attending rallies and gradually letting it be known that she was Jane Roe .
She started working in abortion clinics and , when anti-abortionists began picketing the clinics , she turned their own tactics against them .
" I used to follow them around the country .
Do you remember that song I Am the God of Hellfire from the 60s ?
I would drive up to the abortion clinic where they were picketing and I would jam in the cassette and crank it up to full blast .
Just to let them know I was there . "
For her pains , McCorvey became the target of aggression .
She received hate mail calling her a baby killer .
Eggs were thrown at her door .
Dolls ' clothing and parts - arms , legs , torsos - would be scattered over her lawn .
Then one night a truck drove past and a marksman shot out her front window and the windshield of her car .
In I Am Roe , she describes these as the acts of " pro-lifer terrorists " .
Now , however , she blames the harassment on pro-abortionists : " The pro-aborts did n't like me .
I spoke my mind .
I never supported them .
They never got a penny out of me . "
How she made such a gigantic leap of faith from one side of the abortion divide to the other illustrates the extraordinary persistence and persuasiveness of the anti-abortionists .
Operation Rescue , one of the leading US anti-abortion groups devoted to overturning Roe v Wade , turned its considerable firepower onto her .
At the time , she called them a " pack of vultures " .
Now she prefers to see them as " rescuers " .
When her book came out in 1994 they picketed her signings , shouting at her that she was responsible for the deaths of 35 million unborn babies .
Then Operation Rescue took out a lease on the house next door to the abortion clinic where McCorvey worked .
They began talking to her , befriending her , offering her lunch .
" I started watching the rescuers and wondering what makes them tick .
They were down to earth , they were n't telling me I was going to fry in hell , though I 'm sure they were thinking that .
They were very kind to me . "
Slowly , they turned her ideas around .
In August 1995 she allowed herself to be baptised in a backyard swimming pool in Dallas .
Three years later , she attended her first Catholic mass .
She moved from the clinic - or " abortion mill " as it now was to her - to Operation Rescue next door .
One of her new friends summed up the shift : " The poster girl of the anti-abortion movement has walked off the poster . "

He has a loyal following of anti-abortionists , McCorvey among them , who he drills through his daily broadcast which is beamed to nine major cities across America .
In 1991 , Terry organised mass pickets outside George Tiller 's abortion clinic in Kansas ; almost 3,000 of these protesters were arrested .
And when the same clinic was permanently closed last month following Tiller 's murder , Terry rejoiced .
" The mortar of that building is meshed with the blood of the innocent , " he said at the time .
In the wake of Tiller 's death , Terry convened an emergency war council of anti-abortionist leaders , and called for a wave of social unrest on a scale not seen since the civil rights days .
He calls it Insurrecta Nex - Latin for " insurrection against death " .
He tells his listeners : " We are looking for people who will use the weaponry of social revolutions past so that child killing can be brought to an end . "
During the past decade , however , the real battleground over Roe v Wade has been at the level of individual states .
Elizabeth Nash of the pro-choice thinktank the Guttmacher Institute says access to abortion has been progressively whittled down under a constant barrage of legal challenges .
Some 400 or more anti-abortion bills are put before state legislatures every year , of which 30 on average succeed .
The outcome is that women are now required to undergo waiting periods before terminating a pregnancy .
They must be given information about their foetus that is often patently designed to act as a deterrent .
In some states , women are told of a link between abortion and breast cancer , though such a link has never been proved .
Other states emphasise the pain felt by foetuses .
" Nothing is solid , " Nash says .
" Even without Roe being overturned , many women already do n't have a right to abortion as they just can't access it . "
McCorvey sees these mini-victories as moves in the right direction .
With Terry as her guide , she has been moving increasingly on to the national stage .
Terry has grasped the PR worth of having Jane Roe on board , describing her conversion as of " inestimable value " to the cause .
When she was arrested at Notre Dame last month , he was right beside her .
Her court case for trespassing comes up in October , and she says she is relishing the prospect of going to prison .
Where McCorvey holds back from the full fire - and - brimstone rhetoric of Terry is over the death of Tiller .
She says she was shocked when she heard that the doctor had been gunned down inside his church one Sunday .
The news was poignant for her as she used to live in Wichita and regularly prayed the rosary outside Tiller 's clinic .
" Even though he was a monster , it still did n't give the right to take his life . "
Not for a minute , though , is she taking her eye off the main prize .
Her latest obsession is Sonia Sotomayor , Obama 's nomination for the new ninth member of the supreme court .
Though Sotomayor has not been outspoken on the subject of abortion , it is assumed she would maintain the current balance of the court at five justices to four upholding the right to abortion .
McCorvey is methodically gathering testimony from women who say their life was ruined by having had an abortion , to present to the supreme court whenever the time comes .
And later this month she will be back on those court steps , demonstrating against Sotomayor 's nomination .
" That 's when I 'm at my best , " she says with real elation .
" When I 'm all fired up ! "
No doubt there will be more nerves , followed by more spitting ; Norma McCorvey will always be a mass of contradictions .
But grant her this : the woman who was once so proud to be Jane Roe will not stop until she has wiped from the face of America the judgment that bears her name .

We referred to Norma McCorvey taking her first Catholic mass ; we should have said she attended it .
This has been corrected .
Almost half of workers in the UK think having a company mobile phone is a negative experience , according to a survey released today .
Of the 1,072 people surveyed in June by Opinion Matters , on behalf of Cable & Wireless , 47 per cent thought a company mobile infringed on their personal time and 46 per cent thought it took away their freedom from work .
The numbers rose to over 50 per cent when just the over 45s answers were considered .
Phil Grannum , managing director of Enterprise for Cable & Wireless , said : " Acknowledgement of the demographic change is much higher in younger people than older .
They are used to the mobile elements at home so are more ready to embrace them in the workplace . "
The survey also found that younger people are happier to take work home with them .
Of the respondents , 84 per cent of under 35s said they were happy to take a work - related call out of office hours .
However , only 40 per cent of the over 55s would be happy to do the same .
The figure dropped even further for employees in the public sector , with only 35 per cent happy to take a work call .
Torrential downpours , overflowing lakes and rivers , flooded basements -- the rain just wo n't stop .
Have things reached biblical proportions ?
Maybe it's not that bad yet , but just in case , we thought it might help to provide instructions on how to build an ark .
Pictured , Steve Carell takes a break while building an ark of his own in the 2007 film " Evan Almighty . "
But a public health and infectious disease expert from Vanderbilt University , Dr. William Schaffner , said the test results were “ going to change , I think in a substantial way , the image of this outbreak in Mexico . ”
If the outbreak is much smaller than initially thought , Dr. Schaffner said , “ It would , I think , enable the world ’s public health community to take a deep breath and continue to track the outbreak and reduce the tendency , as the W.H.O. has been doing , to notch up on its pandemic scale . ”
If the testing also shows that the disease has caused fewer deaths than the 170 or so suspected , Dr. Schaffner said , it might resolve a question that has been puzzling health experts since the outbreak began : why did the disease appear to be so much more severe in Mexico than in the United States ?
In the United States , cases have been mild and there has been only one death , that of a 23 - month - old child from Mexico .
Meanwhile , the disease continued to spread to other countries and was confirmed in more American states on Friday .
The disease is expected to drop off during the summer , because flu viruses do not thrive in heat and humidity , but it could rebound in the fall and winter .
The World Health Organization said that the flu vaccine given to millions of people for the most recent flu season appeared ineffective against the A( H1N1 ) strain , but that health officials were talking to manufacturers about creating a new swine - flu vaccine , which would take four to six months to produce .
Dr. Marie - Paule Kieny , director of the Initiative for Vaccine Research at the World Health Organization , said that unless the numbers of cases decreased significantly , “ it seems mostly likely that the manufacturers will proceed and we will certainly support them . ”
Officials at the Centers for Disease Control said a decision had not yet been made about whether to manufacture a vaccine , but President Obama said that the government would support it .
New cases were reported in Denmark , France , Russia , Hong Kong and South Korea on Friday , but they were not confirmed by the health organization .
The United States reported 141 confirmed cases in 19 states , up from 109 cases in 11 states on Thursday .
Concerns about the disease are having an increasing impact .
On Friday , a United Airlines flight with 245 passengers heading from Munich to Dulles Airport in Washington landed in Boston instead because a female passenger had flu symptoms and the airline thought she needed prompt attention , a United Airlines spokesman said .
" The British and some others will not like it as it moves policy to the EU , " said an official .
" Some of things we want to do will only be realistic with the Lisbon Treaty in place , so we need that too . "

Many emails littered our inbox last night night asking about the weird bald - looking dude who received an uncomfortable level of face - time during the All - Star game .
Of course , this is a sneaky Fox promotion for a television show .
I guess we 've fallen for it as well since I 'm now writing about it .
But here 's the WIkipedia info on " The Observer " :
The Observer is also seen on occasion in other Fox programs .
For example , on April 7 , 2009 , the Observer was seen on American Idol .
He was on the front row and blatantly shown near the beginning of the episode .
This appearance , along with others at televised sports events , including a close - up appearance at the 2009 Major League Baseball All - Star game , is part of a viral marketing campaign by Fox Television

Anyway , good morning .
It 's Wednesday .
There are bagels and fresh juices available on the table near the kitchen .
A couple of weeks back we showcased a special interest story about Roger Keeney , a man who lost his sight over twenty years ago , one of ten lucky individuals who are getting a chance to live out their dreams via the new 2010 Mustang .
Ford has created a unique marketing vehicle that actually is doing a great deal of good in the process .
After watching the first video and reading the press release on A Blind Man’s P.O.V. you realize how truly special this experience is for Keeney and others involved .
In the followup episode , we finally get a chance to see Keeney tear up some pavement at the Ford Proving Grounds in Phoenix with pro racer Tommy Kendall there to provide instruction .
The first episode was a great introduction but left you wanting to see this man really go crazy out there with the new 2010 Ford Mustang .
The fans have spoken and Ford has answered .

They do n't build 'em like they used to , they build 'em better .
But , it could be argued , they do n't style 'em like they used to .
A handful of purists have taken the best from both worlds , recreating classic automotive shapes using modern technology .
The results – like the Creative Sport Speciale Gullwing - America 300SL Panamerica and Huet Brothers Special – have always fascinated us , and here 's the latest : a recreation of the famous 1957 Aston Martin DBR2 racer , built with the latest methods by Rizk Auto of Phoenix , Arizona .
The RA DBR2 is built around a state - of - the - art carbon - fiber tub and aluminum honeycomb monocoque chassis that weighs a feather - like 100 kgs ( 220 lbs ) , overlaid with carbon - fiber body panels lined with Nomex .
Sound space - age enough for a classic roadster ?
How about some Aerogel , a NASA - developed heat insulator being used in a roadgoing automobile for the first time .
Each example is built to order , and customers can specify their choice of powertrain options between Jaguar - derived inline - six and V12 engines or a Corvette LS3 V8 .
The original Aston DBR2 chalked up a handful of victories in its day – if Rizk Auto had put it together , maybe it would have won even more .

PRESS RELEASE
At the intersection of Art and Science lies a common soul : Creativity .
The creativity of a beautiful form .
The creativity of a well executed function .
The history of the Automobile spans a century of innovation and sensuous design , yet unfortunately rarely both attributes combined .
The RA assimilates the best elements of the most seminally beautiful racers of the golden era with the material and manufacturing processes of current aerospace technology .
Transcending the mundane mechanics of mere transport , the RA is meant to transform every journey into a lifestyle .
A lifestyle that recognizes that speed and sport have form , and that in nature there are no straight lines .
The visceral experience of driving a RA ; the noise , the vibration , the intimacy of the surroundings ; are an affirmation of a life worth living .
RA is a statement of elegant choices , of lack of pretence and of an uninhibited joy for speed .
Art
Drowning in a sea of sharp lines and edgy Bangelized surfaces , the era of sensuous curves seems to have eluded us .
Whether the inspiration is the female form , or the weathering smoothness of rocks immemorial , the human psyche resonates with flowing lines and cohesive shapes .
This yearning for elegance has led us to one of the most inspired designs in the history of the Automobile .
The 1957 Aston Martin DBR2 LeMans
Race car epitomizes the pinnacle of beautiful mechanical design , when cars were still being described as sexy .
The RA relies heavily on the long lost genius of master artisans , and has assuaged the design to accommodate the demands of a 21st century road car while retaining its inherent beauty .
Science
The chassis was the single biggest engineering challenge in the build of RA .
Our criterion was the following : Exceptional stiffness , extremely light weight , excellent cabin space , flexibility in adapting multiple engine options and finally precise dimensional accuracy .
Every vehicle in the same category of RA has always used what is commonly known as the space frame or ladder type chassis .
These are cage like frames built usually out of steel tubing and welded together on a jig .
The main advantages to this type of structure are very low tooling costs and they can be built to good stiffness .
Yet the space frame has two significant flaws .
They are heavy ( if strength and stiffness are achieved ) and extremely inefficient in packaging especially for the occupants of the vehicle .
This immediately eliminated the space frame as an option for RA .
We decided that the chassis will not be compromised .
Thus an all Carbon monocoque chassis was the only solution .
There is only one disadvantage to this design : it is prohibitively expensive .
Yet we were undaunted and the challenge thus became to engineer the tooling and chassis to aircraft quality standards .
We consulted with one of the best men in the industry ; Philip Henderson ; a composites guru whose extensive Formula 1 resume includes the Benetton team during the tenure of Michael Schumacher ( he won 2 world championships with them ) and the distillation of his expertise and experience resulted in the RA chassis .
What we have achieved is a stiffness that is incomparable to any mass produced production vehicle , spectacular cabin space that will accommodate frames from 5 ' 0 " to 6 ' 5 " comfortably and a total weight of only 220 lbs .
No other custom built classically designed vehicle in the world has this level of engineering , strength and technology in one package .
From Formula 1 to NASA 's space exploration vehicles , the most prevalent composite structure in use are the Carbon - Nomex body panels .
These are some of the highest performing materials available to man .
The carbon is used for the skin plys , providing one of the best strength to weight ratios .
Nomex ; used as the core material ; is an aramid that is fire retardant and has exceptional shear properties .
The purpose of using Nomex is to add thickness to the material without adding any substantial weight .
A composite structure 's stiffness is a function of the cube of the thickness of the material .
Thus if we compare 2 composite panels , one with 1t thickness and the second with 2t thickness , the second panel will be approximately 7 - 8 times as stiff as the first .
Typical automobiles are built with a sheet metal thickness of approximately 0.04 " inch ( 19 gauge ) .
On the other hand , every panel on the body of RA has a composite thickness of 0.5 " inch .
Doing a very simplified mathematical comparison , the RA would yield a body stiffness that is more than 1500 times stiffer than common sheet metal bodies .
Furthermore the energy absorption characteristics of Nomex provide superior crash protection compared to traditional stamped bodies .
Finally the thickness also adds to the thermal insulation properties of the panels .
In laymen terms , the body of the car is extremely stiff and cannot be bent or dented by any human force , is a natural insulator of heat , is extremely safe in an accident and the entire body of the car weighs less than 100 lbs .
When NASA embarked on their Mars rover program they needed to invent a new and far more efficient insulation solution that would provide exceptional heat shield properties for the rovers from the harsh environment of Mars .
This product , the first breakthrough technology incorporating Nano - tech science is called Aerogel .
It is the most advanced insulating technology in the world .
The success of Aerogel has been so spectacular , that NASA created a company to commercialize the product .
RA is the first passenger vehicle to use Aerogel as its primary insulating material .
The entire engine bay and underside of the vehicle is covered in this space age hydro - phobic ( water resistant ) compound .
The light weight and extraordinary attributes of Aerogel make the RA the most technically advanced vehicle in the world when it comes to heat insulation .

A win for people who hate the DMCA and censorship .
As we reported on earlier this year , Apple pressured the public wiki site Bluwiki into removing several pages about how to sync iPods and other devices with the iTunes database without actually going through iTunes .
Apple invoked the DMCA and sent several cease and desist letters , after which Bluwiki removed the pages in question .
However , the Electronic Frontier Foundation got involved , and together with law firm Keker & Van Nest they sued Apple .
It worked .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation and the law firm Keker & Van Nest , from San Francisco , filed a lawsuit against Apple , asking the courts to allow Bluwiki to put the pages and discussions around iTunes - less syncing back online .
Apple has now withdrawn their original threats .
In a letter , the Cupertino company states that “ Apple no longer has , nor will it have in the future , any objection to the publications of the iTunesDB Pages . ”
Consequently , the EFF and the law firm have withdrawn their lawsuit .
“ While we are glad that Apple retracted its baseless legal threats , we are disappointed that it only came after 7 months of censorship and a lawsuit , ” EFF Senior Staff Attorney Fred von Lohmann said , “ Because Apple continues to use technical measures to lock iPod Touch and iPhone owners into – and Palm Pre owners out of – using Apple ’s iTunes software , I would n’t be surprised if there are more discussions among frustrated customers about reverse engineering Apple products .
We hope Apple has learned its lesson here and will give those online discussions a wide berth in the future . ”
This is n’t the first time Apple tried to censor websites , and it ’s a good thing the EFF and the law firm were able to pressure Apple into dropping their threats .
It ’s behaviour like this that makes me not like Apple as a company – they are free to be a bunch of control freaks within their own company , but trying to censor websites just because they contain information they do n’t like simply should not be acceptable in an open society .
So it was with God of War III , so it is with Uncharted 2 .
If something is going to be shown behind " closed doors " at GDC , there 's a good chance somebody will film it regardless .

The footage seems to have been shot by some Italian kids .
As you can see , there 's shooting .
There 's rolling .

Just like the first one , only in a new place .
Which really , is all we 're asking for !
Today , Randall Terry held a press conference at the National Press Club “ to discuss how the pro-life movement should deal with Dr. [ George ]
Tiller ’s death ” and defend his statement that Tiller essentially deserved to die because he was a “ mass - murder . ”
Terry said that Dr. Tiller ’s murder “ poses a setback for us on some levels ” and then tried to deflect blame from the anti-abortion movement :
Terry :
The point that must be emphasized over , and over , and over again : pro-life leaders and the pro-life movement are not responsible for George Tiller ’s death .
George Tiller was a mass - murder and , horrifically , he reaped what he sowed .
Q : So who is responsible …
Terry :
The man who shot him is responsible … Q : … because that makes it sound like you were saying that he [ Tiller ] is responsible .
Terry :
The man who shot him is responsible .
Q : What did you mean by “ he reaped what he sowed ” ?
Terry :
He was a mass - murder .
He sowed death .
And then he reaped death in a horrifying way .
The event came to an utterly bizarre ending when Terry said that Tiller ’s murder “ can be a teaching moment for what child - killing is really all about ” … and then seemed to ask those in attendance if they ’d be willing to buy him lunch – he likes Guinness and chicken wings :

The big run-up in gasoline prices at the pump , 45 cents a gallon in the past month , may soon ease , many oil and gas analysts say .
" Most of the increase has been taken , " says Tom Kloza , chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service .
FUEL FORUM : Discuss the prices in your area with other readers
The rapid rise — which has surpassed earlier predictions — has been driven by expectations of a global economic recovery later this year and seasonal increases from Memorial Day to the summer driving season , industry analysts say .
The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $ 2.50 Sunday , auto club AAA says .
That 's up 55 % for the year and higher than the average $ 2.23 a gallon that the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) had projected for the summer .
But it 's far below the $ 4 a gallon of last summer .
Oil prices have likewise jumped .
They hit $ 66.31 a barrel on Friday , up 30 % in May .
They 've similarly been driven higher by expectations of an economic recovery .
Benchmark crude for July delivery rose $ 2.27 Monday to settle at $ 68.58 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest close since early November .
Brokerage CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets said its purchasing managers index rose to 51.2 from April 's 50.1 on a 100 - point scale , indicating that the world 's third - largest economy might be recovering from a slump .
Numbers above 50 show an expansion .
The state - sanctioned China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing reported that its index had eased , but that manufacturing was still expanding somewhat .
When crude prices were heading toward $ 150 per barrel last year , many energy analysts believed the booming economies of China and India would support energy prices globally .
That did not turn out to be the case and there is little tangible evidence to suggest that the rapid rise in energy prices can be sustained for long this summer .
Also affecting prices :
The EIA , which is the Energy Department 's statistical arm , said last week that U.S. crude oil stocks fell 5.4 million barrels in the week ended May 22 .
Refineries increased gasoline production to 85 % of their capacity during the same time , the EIA says , though that 's still down from a more normal rate of 91 % .
The increase in production may signal a bottoming of weak demand for gasoline , says Phil Flynn , energy analyst at Alaron Trading .
Still , he says , gasoline prices are " close to the peak . "
Gas prices could stabilize even if oil rises because refineries could continue to kick up production , he says .
Prices could start to fall this month — though not by as much as they rose in May — if expectations for a rebound in demand for gasoline prove too rosy , says Jim Ritterbusch , president of oil trading advisory firm Ritterbusch and Associates .
Others are n't so sure .
Oil companies will parlay rising crude oil prices into higher pump prices no matter the demand , says Michael Fox , executive director of the Gasoline & Automotive Service Dealers of America , which represents 450 gas retailers in Connecticut .
" There 's nothing going on but pure gouging by oil companies , " Fox says .
" There 's no rational reason for gas prices to go up . "

§ 13 . QUESTIONS WHICH TEND NOT TO EDIFICATION .
SERMON NUMBER 1 .
{ The Lesser Mâlunkyâputta Sutta}
§ 13a .-- Translated from the Majjhima - Nikâya , and constituting Sutta 63 .
Thus have I heard .
On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling at Sâvatthi in Jetavana monastery in Anâthapindika 's Park .
Now it happened to the venerable Mâlunkyâputta , being in seclusion and plunged in meditation , that a consideration presented itself to his mind , as follows : --
" These theories which The Blessed One has left unelucidated , has set aside and rejected , -- that the world is eternal , that the world is not eternal , that the world is finite , that the world is infinite , that the soul and the body are identical , that the soul is one thing and the body another , that the saint exists after death , that the saint does not exist after death , that the saint both exists and does not exist after death , that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death , -- these The Blessed One does not elucidate to me .
And the fact that The Blessed One does not elucidate them to me does not please me nor suit me .
Therefore I will draw near to The Blessed One and inquire of him concerning this matter .
If The Blessed One will elucidate to me , either that the world is eternal , or that the world is not eternal , or that the world is finite , or that the world is infinite , or that the soul and the body are identical , or that the soul is one thing and the body another , or that the saint exists after death , or that the saint does not exist after death , or that the saint both exists and does not exist after death , or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death , in that case will I lead the religious life under The Blessed One .
If The Blessed One will not elucidate to me , either that the world is eternal , or that the world is not eternal , . . . or that the saint neither exists
nor does not exist after death , in that case will I abandon religious training and return to the lower life of a layman . "
Then the venerable Mâlunkyâputta arose at eventide from his seclusion , and drew near to where The Blessed One was ; and having drawn near and greeted The Blessed One , he sat down respectfully at one side .
And seated respectfully at one side , the venerable Mâlunkyâputta spoke to The Blessed One as follows : --
" Reverend Sir , it happened to me , as I was just now in seclusion and plunged in meditation , that a consideration presented itself to my mind , as follows : ' These theories which The Blessed One has left unelucidated , has set aside and rejected , -- that the world is eternal , that the world is not eternal , . . . that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death , -- these The Blessed One does not elucidate to me .
And the fact that The Blessed One does not elucidate them to me does not please me nor suit me .
I will draw near to The Blessed One and inquire of him concerning this matter .
If The Blessed One will elucidate to me , either that the world is eternal , or that the world is not eternal , . . . or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death , in that case will I lead the religious life under The Blessed One .
If The Blessed One will not elucidate to me , either that the world is eternal , or that the world is not eternal , . . . or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death , in that case will I abandon religious training and return to the lower life of a layman . '
" If The Blessed One knows that the world is eternal , let The Blessed One elucidate to me that the world is eternal ; if The Blessed One knows that the world is not eternal , let The Blessed One elucidate to me that the world is not eternal .
If The Blessed One does not know either that the world is eternal or that the world is not eternal , the only upright thing for one who does not know , or who has not that insight , is to say , ' I do not know ; I have not that insight . '
" If The Blessed One knows that the world is finite , . . .'
" If The Blessed One knows that the soul and the body are identical , . . .'
" If The Blessed One knows that the saint exists after death , . . .'
" If The Blessed One knows that the saint both exists and does not exist after death , let The Blessed One elucidate to me that the saint both exists and does not exist after death ; if The Blessed One knows that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death , let The Blessed One elucidate to me that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death .
If The Blessed One does not know either that the saint both exists and does not exist after death , or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death , the only upright thing for one who does not know , or who has not that insight , is to say , ' I do not know ; I have not that insight . ' "
" Pray , Mâlunkyâputta , did I ever say to you , ' Come , Mâlunkyâputta , lead the religious life under me , and I will elucidate to you either that the world is eternal , or that the world is not eternal , . . . or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death ' ? "
" Nay , verily , Reverend Sir . "
" Or did you ever say to me , ' Reverend Sir , I will lead the religious life under The Blessed One , on condition that The Blessed One elucidate to me either that the world is eternal , or that the world is not eternal , . . . or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death ' ? "
" Nay , verily , Reverend Sir . "
" So you acknowledge , Mâlunkyâputta , that I have not said to you , ' Come , Mâlunkyâputta , lead the religious life under me and I will elucidate to you either that the world is eternal , or that the world is not eternal , . . . or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death ; ' and again that you have not said to me , ' Reverend Sir , I will lead the religious life under The Blessed One , on condition that The Blessed One elucidate to me either that the world is eternal , or that the world is not eternal , . . . or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death . '
That being the case , vain man , whom are you so angrily denouncing ?
" Mâlunkyâputta , any one who should say , ' I will not lead the religious life under The Blessed One until The
Blessed
One shall elucidate to me either that the world is eternal , or that the world is not eternal , . . . or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death ; '-- that person would die , Mâlunkyâputta , before The Tathâgata had ever elucidated this to him .
" It is as if , Mâlunkyâputta , a man had been wounded by an arrow thickly smeared with poison , and his friends and companions , his relatives and kinsfolk , were to procure for him a physician or surgeon ; and the sick man were to say , ' I will not have this arrow taken out until I have learnt whether the man who wounded me belonged to the warrior caste , or to the Brahman caste , or to the agricultural caste , or to the menial caste . '
" Or again he were to say , ' I will not have this arrow taken out until I have learnt the name of the man who wounded me , and to what clan he belongs . '
" Or again he were to say , ' I will not have this arrow taken out until I have learnt whether the man who wounded me was tall , or short , or of the middle height . '
" Or again he were to say , ' I will not have this arrow taken out until I have learnt whether the man who wounded me was black , or dusky , or of a yellow skin . '
" Or again he were to say , ' I will not have this arrow taken out until I have learnt whether the man who wounded me was from this or that village , or town , or city . '
" Or again he were to say , ' I will not have this arrow taken out until I have learnt whether the bow which wounded me was a câpa , or a kodannda . '
" Or again he were to say , ' I will not have this arrow taken out until I have learnt whether the bow - string which wounded me was made from swallow - wort , or bamboo , or sinew , or maruva , or from milk - weed . '
" Or again he were to say , ' I will not have this arrow taken out until I have learnt whether the shaft which wounded me was a kaccha or a ropima . '
" Or again he were to say , ' I will not have this arrow taken out until I have learnt whether the shaft which wounded me was feathered from the wings of a vulture ,
or of a heron , or of a falcon , or of a peacock , or of a sithilahanu . '
" Or again he were to say , ' I will not have this arrow taken out until I have learnt whether the shaft which wounded me was wound round with the sinews of an ox , or of a buffalo , or of a ruru deer , or of a monkey . '
" Or again he were to say , ' 1 will not have this arrow taken out until I have learnt whether the arrow which wounded me was an ordinary arrow , or a claw - headed arrow , or a vekanda , or an iron arrow , or a calf - tooth arrow , or a karavîrapatta . '
That Mâlunkyâputta , without ever having learnt this .
" In exactly the same way , Mâlunkyâputta , any one who should say , ' I will not lead the religious life under The Blessed One until The Blessed One shall elucidate to me either that the world is eternal , or that the world is not eternal , . . . or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death ; '-- that person would die , Mâlunkyâputta , before The Tathâgata had ever elucidated this to him .
" The religious life , Mâlunkyâputta , does not depend on the dogma that the world is eternal ; nor does the religious life , Mâlunkyâputta , depend on the dogma that the world is not eternal .
Whether the dogma obtain , Mâlunkyâputta , that the world is eternal , or that the world is not eternal , there still remain birth , old age , death , sorrow , lamentation , misery , grief , and despair , for the extinction of which in the present life I am prescribing .
" The religious life , Mâlunkyâputta , does not depend on the dogma that the world is finite ; . . .
" The religious life , Mâlunkyâputta , does not depend on the dogma that the soul and the body are identical ; . . .
" The religious life , Mâlunkyâputta , does not depend on the dogma that the saint exists after death ; . . .
" The religious life , Mâlunkyâputta , does not depend on the dogma that the saint both exists and does not exist after death ; nor does the religious life , Mâlunkyâputta , depend on the dogma that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death .
Whether the dogma obtain , Mâlunkyâputta , that the
saint both exists and does not exist after death , or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death , there still remain birth , old age , death , sorrow , lamentation , misery , grief , and despair , for the extinction of which in the present life I am prescribing .
" Accordingly , Mâlunkyâputta , bear always in mind what it is that I have not elucidated , and what it is that I have elucidated .
And what , Mâlunkyâputta , have I not elucidated ?
I have not elucidated , Mâlunkyâputta , that the world is eternal ; I have not elucidated that the world is not eternal ; I have not elucidated that the world is finite ; I have not elucidated that the world is infinite ; I have not elucidated that the soul and the body are identical ; I have not elucidated that the soul is one thing and the body another ; I have not elucidated that the saint exists after death ; I have not elucidated that the saint does not exist after death ; I have not elucidated that the saint both exists and does not exist after death ; I have not elucidated that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death .
And why , Mâlunkyâputta , have I not elucidated this ?
Because , Mâlunkyâputta , this profits not , nor has to do with the fundamentals of religion , nor tends to aversion , absence of passion , cessation , quiescence , the supernatural faculties , supreme wisdom , and Nirvana ; therefore have I not elucidated it .
" And what , Mâlunkyâputta , have I elucidated ?
Misery , Mâlunkyâputta , have I elucidated ; the origin of misery have I elucidated ; the cessation of misery have I elucidated ; and the path leading to the cessation of misery have I elucidated .
And why , Mâlunkyâputta , have I elucidated this ?
Because , Mâlunkyâputta , this does profit , has to do with the fundamentals of religion , and tends to aversion , absence of passion , cessation , quiescence , knowledge , supreme wisdom , and Nirvana ; therefore have I elucidated it .
Accordingly , Mâlunkyâputta , bear always in mind what it is that I have not elucidated , and what it is that I have elucidated . "
Thus spake The Blessed One ; and , delighted , the venerable Mâlunkyâputta applauded the speech of The Blessed One .
The Lesser Mâlunkyâputta Sermon .
SERMON NUMBER 2 .
{ The Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta}
§ 13b .-- Translated from the Majjhima - Nikâya , and constituting Sutta 72 .
Thus have I heard .
On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling at Sâvatthi in Jetavana monastery in Anâthapindika 's Park .
Then drew near Vaccha , the wandering ascetic , to where The Blessed One was ; and having drawn near , he greeted The Blessed One ; and having passed the compliments of friendship and civility , he sat down respectfully at one side .
And seated respectfully at one side , Vaccha , the wandering ascetic , spoke to The Blessed One as follows : --
" How is it , Gotama ?
Does Gotama hold that the world is eternal , and that this view alone is true , and every other false ? "
" Nay , Vaccha .
I do not hold that the world is eternal , and that this view alone is true , and every other false . "
" But how is it , Gotama ?
Does Gotama hold that the world is not eternal , and that this view alone is true , and every other false ? "
" Nay , Vaccha .
I do not hold that the world is not eternal , and that this view alone is true , and every other false . "
" How is it , Gotama ?
Does Gotama hold that the world is finite , . . . "
" How is it , Gotama ?
Does Gotama hold that the soul and the body are identical , . . . "
" How is it , Gotama ?
Does Gotama hold that the saint exists after death , . . . "
" How is it , Gotama ?
Does Gotama hold that the saint both exists and does not exist after death , and that this view alone is true , and every other false ? "
" Nay , Vaccha .
I do not hold that the saint both exists and does not exist after death , and that this view alone is true , and every other false . "
" But how is it , Gotama ?
Does Gotama hold that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death , and that this view alone is true , and every other false ? "
" Nay , Vaccha .
I do not hold that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death , and that this view alone is true , and every other false . "
" How is it , Gotama , that when you are asked , ' Does the monk Gotama hold that the world is eternal , and that this view alone is true , and every other false ? ' you reply , ' Nay , Vaccha .
I do not hold that the world is eternal , and that this view alone is true , and every other false ' ?
" But how is it , Gotama , that when you are asked , ' Does the monk Gotama hold that the world is not eternal , and that this view alone is true , and every other false ? ' you reply , ' Nay , Vaccha .
I do not hold that the world is not eternal , and that this view alone is true , and every other false ' ?
" How is it , Gotama , that when you are asked , ' Does Gotama hold that the world is finite , . . . '?
" How is it , Gotama , that when you are asked , ' Does Gotama hold that the soul and the body are identical , . . . '?
" How is it , Gotama , that when you are asked , ' Does Gotama hold that the saint exists after death , . . . '?
" How is it , Gotama , that when you are asked , ' Does the monk Gotama hold that the saint both exists and does not exist after death , and that this view alone is true , and every other false ? ' you reply , ' Nay , Vaccha .
I do not hold that the saint both exists and does not exist after death , and that this view alone is true , and every other false ' ?
" But how is it , Gotama , that when you are asked , ' Does the monk Gotama hold that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death , and that this view alone is true , and every other false ? ' you reply , ' Nay , Vaccha .
I do not hold that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death , and that this view alone is true , and every other false ' ?
What objection does Gotama perceive to these theories that he has not adopted any one of them ? "
" Vaccha , the theory that the world is eternal , is a jungle , a wilderness , a puppet - show , a writhing , and a fetter , and is coupled with misery , ruin , despair , and agony , and does not tend to aversion , absence of passion , cessation , quiescence , knowledge , supreme wisdom , and Nirvana .
. . . . . . . . . .
" Vaccha , the theory that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death , is a jungle , a wilderness , a puppet - show , a writhing , and a fetter , and is coupled with misery , ruin , despair , and agony , and does not tend to aversion , absence of passion , cessation , quiescence , knowledge , supreme wisdom , and Nirvana .
" This is the objection I perceive to these theories , so that I have not adopted any one of them . "
" But has Gotama any theory of his own ? "
" The Tathâgata , O Vaccha , is free from all theories ; but this , Vaccha , does The Tathâgata know , -- the nature of form , and how form arises , and how form perishes ; the nature of sensation , and how sensation arises , and how sensation perishes ; the nature of perception , and how perception arises , and how perception perishes ; the nature of the predispositions , and how the predispositions arise , and how the predispositions perish ; the nature of consciousness , and how consciousness arises , and how consciousness perishes .
Therefore say I that The Tathâgata has attained deliverance and is free from attachment , inasmuch as all imaginings , or agitations , or proud thoughts concerning an Ego or anything pertaining to an Ego , have perished , have faded away , have ceased , have been given up and relinquished . "
" But , Gotama , where is the priest reborn who has attained to this deliverance for his mind ? "
" Vaccha , to say that he is reborn would not fit the case . "
" Then , Gotama , he is not reborn . "
" Vaccha , to say that he is not reborn would not fit the case . "
" Then , Gotama , he is both reborn and is not reborn . "
" Vaccha , to say that he is both reborn and not reborn would not fit the case . "
" Then , Gotama , he is neither reborn nor not reborn . "
" Vaccha , to say that he is neither reborn nor not reborn would not fit the case . "
" When I say to you , ' But , Gotama , where is the priest reborn who has attained to this deliverance for his mind ? ' you reply , ' Vaccha , to say that he is reborn would not fit
the case . '
And when I say to you , ' Then , Gotama , he is not reborn , ' you reply , ' Vaccha , to say that he is not reborn would not fit the case . '
And when I say to you , ' Then , Gotama , he is both reborn and not reborn , ' you reply , ' Vaccha , to say that he is both reborn and not reborn would not fit the case . '
And when I say to you , ' Then , Gotama , he is neither reborn nor not reborn , ' you reply , ' Vaccha , to say that he is neither reborn nor not reborn would not fit the case . '
Gotama , I am at a loss what to think in this matter , and I have become greatly confused , and the faith in Gotama inspired by a former conversation has now disappeared . "
" Enough , O Vaccha !
Be not at a loss what to think in this matter , and be not greatly confused .
Profound , O Vaccha , is this doctrine , recondite , and difficult of comprehension , good , excellent , and not to be reached by mere reasoning , subtile , and intelligible only to the wise ; and it is a hard doctrine for you to learn , who belong to another sect , to another faith , to another persuasion , to another discipline , and sit at the feet of another teacher .
Therefore , Vaccha , I will now question you , and do you make answer as may seem to you good .
What think you , Vaccha ?
Suppose a fire were to burn in front of you , would you be aware that the fire was burning in front of you ? "
" Gotama , if a fire were to burn in front of me , I should be aware that a fire was burning in front of me . "
" But suppose , Vaccha , some one were to ask you , ' On what does this fire that is burning in front of you depend ? ' what would you answer , Vaccha ? "
" Gotama , if some one were to ask me , ' On what does this fire that is burning in front of you depend ? '
I would answer , Gotama , ' It is on fuel of grass and wood that this fire that is burning in front of me depends . ' "
" But , Vaccha , if the fire in front of you were to become extinct , would you be aware that the fire in front of you had become extinct ? "
" Gotama , if the fire in front of me were to become extinct , I should be aware that the fire in front of me had become extinct . "
" But , Vaccha , if some one were to ask you , ' In which direction has that fire gone , -- east , or west , or north , or south ? ' what would you say , O Vaccha ? "
" The question would not fit the case , Gotama .
For the fire which depended on fuel of grass and wood , when that fuel has all gone , and it can get no other , being thus without nutriment , is said to be extinct . "
" In exactly the same way , Vaccha , all form by which one could predicate the existence of the saint , all that form has been abandoned , uprooted , pulled out of the ground like a palmyra - tree , and become non-existent and not liable to spring up again in the future .
The saint , O Vaccha , who has been released from what is styled form , is deep , immeasurable , unfathomable , like the mighty ocean .
To say that he is reborn would not fit the case .
To say that he is not reborn would not fit the case .
To say that he is both reborn and not reborn would not fit the case .
To say that he is neither reborn nor not reborn would not fit the case .
" All sensation . . .
" All perception . . .
" All the predispositions . . .
" All consciousness by which one could predicate the existence of the saint , all that consciousness has been abandoned , uprooted , pulled out of the ground like a palmyra - tree , and become non-existent and not liable to spring up again in the future .
The saint , O Vaccha , who has been released from what is styled consciousness , is deep , immeasurable , unfathomable , like the mighty ocean .
To say that he is reborn would not fit the case .
To say that he is not reborn would not fit the case .
To say that he is both reborn and not reborn would not fit the case .
To say that he is neither reborn nor not reborn would not fit the case . "
When The Blessed One had thus spoken , Vaccha , the wandering ascetic , spoke to him as follows :
" It is as if , O Gotama , there were a mighty sal - tree near to some village or town , and it were to lose its dead branches and twigs , and its loose shreds of bark , and its unsound wood , so that afterwards , free from those branches and twigs , and
the loose shreds of bark , and the unsound wood , it were to stand neat and clean in its strength .
In exactly the same way doth the word of Gotama , free from branches and twigs , and from loose shreds of bark , and from unsound wood , stand neat and clean in its strength .
O wonderful is it , Gotama !
O wonderful is it , Gotama !
It is as if , O Gotama , one were to set up that which was overturned ; or were to disclose that which was hidden ; or were to point out the way to a lost traveller ; or were to carry a lamp into a dark place , that they who had eyes might see forms .
Even so has Gotama expounded the Doctrine in many different ways .
I betake myself to Gotama for refuge , to the Doctrine , and to the Congregation of the priests .
Let Gotama receive me who have betaken myself to him for refuge , and accept me as a disciple from this day forth as long as life shall last . "

King Milinda and Nâgasena Come to an Understanding
IT MAY be time to hide the cookie jar .
Over 26 % of Americans are obese , with a weight to height ratio ( or body mass index ) of over 30 , according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention , a government body .
Over the past ten years , waistlines have expanded in every state .
In 1998 most states had a relatively trim population , with fewer than a fifth of adults obese .
But since then the scales have tipped in the other direction .
Now at least a quarter of adults in 32 states are obese .
Mississippi is the fattest of all , with a third of its residents considered obese .

Fired Fox News freelance gossip columnist Roger Friedman ’s lawyer , Martin Garbus , is making an explosive claim to journalists that Wolverine ‘s Internet leak can be blamed on boss Rupert Murdoch .
I ’m shocked that Garbus , a respected NYC attorney who often defends media , is saying this .
Is he merely repeating the rumor that has been making the rounds since April , or does he have facts to back up his contention ?
Garbus told the New York Daily News ‘ Rush & Molloy column that the piracy occurred because Murdoch asked the studio to make him a DVD copy of the unfinished movie .
“ Apparently , someone made another copy for themselves , ” Garbus said .
( This is different from the rumor as I heard it : that Murdoch was anxious to bring the film on board his yacht and asked 20th Century Fox to make a copy for him .
But then Murdoch had outside people do it , and that ’s how the film leaked onto the web . )
Sources tell me Rupert saw a rough cut on the lot weeks before Wolverine was pirated .
Garbus told Rush & Molloy that he will be filing a “ slam dunk ” wrongful termination lawsuit in Manhattan Federal Court this week over Fox News ’ recent firing of Roger Friedman .
News Corp stated publicly that Friedman ’s promotion of Internet piracy was the cause of his firing .
But Garbus contends that 4 of the gossip writer ’s “ editors and superiors ” reviewed and okayed the column .
As for Friedman , he ’s claiming he was axed because of pressure from Hollywood Scientologists who did n’t like his coverage of their religion .
It will be interesting to see how The Hollywood Reporter reacts to this lawsuit by its newly hired blogger .
A comic meanders its way into the office today even though a little Thai woman crushed Tony ’s bones while Wes had some explaining to do .
All humans are gone , and it is only by chance that he discovers a small community of others like him taking refuge from fearsome machines that roam the earth intent on their extinction .
Despite being the neophyte of the group , 9 convinces the others that hiding will do them no good .
They must take the offensive if they are to survive , and they must discover why the machines want to destroy them in the first place .
As they ’ll soon come to learn , the very future of civilization may depend on them .

“ 9 ″ arrives in the movie theaters September 9th , 2009 .
The forums have very few rules , but chief among them are :
A friendly reminder : Do n't promote your terrible band , hawk your terrible wares , pander for worthless votes or inquiry goons for your surveys unless you have moderator permission first .
We ( the mods ) probably wo n't let you post a thread about it either unless it 's incredibly interesting , funny , engaging or profitable for the Something Awful audience .
These sorts of rules exist to keep the forums from being overrun with the unfunny dregs of humanity and 4 chan .
But soon people began to ignore them .
So , in an effort to revamp and reenergize the system , forums moderator AYBraham introduced the concept of the Moderator Challenge .
Moderator challenges are handed out to Goons who break rules , usually threads with low content ie , " first post , " " hello , I 'm new here , " etc , or pandering goons into checking out their blog or voting for them on some site .
Rule breakers are given the chance of avoiding a ban / probation and redeeming a otherwise shitty thread by completing 1 of 3 ( or all of 3 ) challeges relating in some way to the thread topic , however the third challenge always involves the OP getting naked .
If none of the challenges are met the OP is banned .
If the OP wins they get to change the avatars of 3 posters in the thread to whatever they want .
Fellow Goons are invited to take up the challenges and win the right to ban , probate or let the OP off , but face banning themselves if their efforts are lackluster .
In this week 's Comedy Goldmine , a terrible thread produces the most beautiful Moderator Challenge that the forums have ever seen .
The master becomes the student , flasks are fucked , and fruit baskets are munched in this most terrific of tales .
Enjoy !
FAIR WARNING : EVERYTHING PAST THIS PAGE IS PROBABLY NSFW ( UNLESS YOU WORK AT A FLASK FUCKING FACTORY ) ( IN WHICH CASE ARE YOU HIRING ??? )
Pfiffer
So for my sociology class , I need to know if you 're an asshole .
I know the internet gives people anonymity , and thus confidence , but what I want to know is if everyone becomes a jerk because this , or if you are just a dick all the time .
Are you a dick because of the internet ?
SCIENCE NEEDS TO KNOW .
AYBraham
Salutations , Pfiffer !
Because you decided to ask for help with your homework like an illiterate community college student , you are now the next victim of the Moderator Challenge !
You have 72 hours to complete one of the following :
1 ) Phiffer more like Michelle Pfeiffer
For this challenge , you will need to illustrate , sculpt , compose or write an Epic Love Song for Michelle Pfeiffer .
Before you go about writing some shitty haiku or limerick about banging the teacher of Dangerous Minds , let 's go over the definition of epic :
Epic : very imposing or impressive ; surpassing the ordinary ( especially in size or scale ) ; " an epic voyage " ; " of heroic proportions " ; " heroic sculpture " .
So , for this challenge you may
Write an Epic Love Poem
Draw an elaborate web comic
Paint an impressive portrait
Compose & Sing a beautiful love song
If your entry sucks , you will be banned or probated .
If your entry is awesome , you might even be rewarded .
You only get one entry , so make it count .
2 ) ROWSDOWER !
For this challenge , you are required to dress up and post a picture of your best ROWSDOWER !
impersonation .
I understand it has absolutely nothing to do with the thread , but I am Mad With Power and I 'd like to see some Rowsdower imitations .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRTbW98v8ys -
A Brief History of Rowsdower
Do not fuck this one up - if you do n't have a mullet , a mustache , a Canadian Tuxedo and look comfortable in a pile of random garbage , then do n't bother posting or else you will be banned .
Bonus points if you manage to show off the tattoo , alcoholism and other Last Sacrifice cult members in the shot .
3 ) The Internet Wants To Know About Your Dick For Science
For this challenge , you are going to have sex with an Erlenmeyer Flask , and then post a Lab Report of how effective it was for pleasuring yourself , and document the experiment with photographs & a write up .
Now let 's be absolutely clear : no one here wants to see your junk in an Erlenmeyer Flask .
The experiment must remain work - safe at all times , so as not to compromise the validity of your field work .
Again - you have to manage to Fuck A Flask but keep it professional and PG - 13 .
You also must keep exact measurements ( metric only ) , and follow the following steps :
Observation
Hypothesis
Experiment ( with a control group and a experimental group )
Results
Conclusion
Failure to do so will be in a ban .
I sincerely doubt anyone will do this challenge , but I am morbidly curious if GBS will actually commit to such an atrocious act .
Phiffer :
If you do not successfully complete a challenge , you will be banned .
If you do a half - assed attempt at this challenge , you will be banned .
However , if you successfully complete the challenge , you may give any poster in this thread after this post your choice of an avatar .
However , you will be competing with GBS !
If anyone else successfully completes a challenge before you do , they may decide your fate !
However , if another Goon does a shitty entry , it will backfire and they will be punished !
Normal GBS rules apply , especially the ones about threadshitting , trolling , attention whoring and being creepy .
Good luck !

abraham : if a goon actually fucks a flask for this challenge ill eat my hat
You heard him , folks -- in an IM with me , he said he'd eat his hat if a goon fucked a flask .
Get going , people .
Abe has just been COUNTERCHALLENGED .
AYBraham
I will say that I honestly do n't think it 's possible to complete this challenge while remaining true to all the variables ( HAS TO BE A ERLENMEYER FLASK ; IF I WANTED A GOON TO FUCK A BONG I'D MOD TCC ) , but goons have until Friday Morning to prove me wrong .
I 'll leave the thread open just in case anyone else wants to participate , just for the sake of participating & not doing challenge # 3 , for love of god do n't do challenge # 3 .
Maybe I 'll give out prizes , who knows !
I 'm not eating a goddamn hat unless a goon fulfills every part of the task .
Rest assured though , if for some disgusting and terrible reason this actually happens , I will eat my goddamn hat .
I promise it will be an entire hat , as in an actual headcovering that can be worn outside and be seen in public with , and not some gimmick Cookie Hat .
It probably will happen on Monday if this occurs , but I promise I wo n't halfass my challenge as long as GBS does n't halfass their challenge .
But again , you really should n't fuck a glass flask for the Internet .
You do n't want to be known for the rest of your life as The Flask Fucker .
In the days since Barack Obama ’s speech in Cairo last week there has been a desperate search for substance in between the lines of a great performance .
Where are the policies that can change the lives of people in the Middle East hit by the wars and occupations initiated or supported by the United States ?
Many have read much into Obama ’s speech — that was part of its genius — but it contained no policy announcements .
That does not mean there are no policies .
The Obama administration works differently from its predecessors in at least three ways .
First , it does n’t do business on the basis of public pronouncements .
There will , for example , be no reprise of Bush senior ’s public appeal to the American people that he was “ one little lonely guy ” facing up to a thousand lobbyists from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
At that time , the Bush administration wanted Israel to attend the Madrid peace conference in the wake of the 1990 - 91 Gulf war .
The White House also announced its intention to tie loan guarantees to Israel to ending settlement activity .
In contrast , The Obama administration looks unlikely to make any public threats .
Amazing Wine Labels –
The design of a wine label can make or break the success of a new wine introduced to the market .
Even beyond the quality of the wine itself , the design of a wine label plays a primary role in the purchasing decisions of customers .
It is on this fact that many graphic designers have focused their attention to making creative , compelling wine labels that connect a bottle of wine with its buyer .
To celebrate the work of these designers , TheCoolist has selected 30 of the most impressive wine label designs in recent history .
To read it right , we suggest you enjoy this list over a freshly popped glass of wine …
Inkwell Wine ’s Rorschach - Inspired Wine Bottles
Just as every wine may effect each palette differently , the Rorschach inkblot test ’s meaning is different to each viewer .
With this wine label design , Inkwell Wine asks , “ what do you see ? ”
The crew at /M / A/S/H/ was hired to rejuvenate Inkwell ’s label design and brand identity , and this bottle was precisely what the wine maker needed .
If you can find a bottle of Inkwell ’s 2007 Shiraz , it wears this label proudly .
Even after you drink it , we recommend holding on to this bottle for it ’s simple , compelling wine label design .

Meeta Panesar Wine Label Designs
Meeta Panesar ’s wine bottle designs were created as an homage to the Op Art movement and the work of artist Joseph Albers .
Panesar carried that Op
Art tradition into these conceptual wine labels , some flush with color and geometry , others with tightly wrapped black - and - white lines .
While Meeta Panesar ’s wine labels remain a packaging art concept , we ’d love to see his work commissioned and produced .

Gut Oggau Portrait Wines
The Oggau Estate is an Austrian winery that has given its wine more than just a flavor , but a personality … nine of them , to be exact .
The Gut Oggau Portrait Wines were designed by Jung von Matt to give each Oggau wine label it ’s own unique signature .
Jung von Matt explains : “ Just like every man , every wine has its own individual character ranging from young to mature , from playful to complex .
We assigned a face , a story and a name to these different attributes .
Eventually , this led to a typical family clan with grandparents , parents and children . ” [ link via jvm ]

Neil Ashmead GTS
Elderton Wines of Australia has bottled a wine in tribute to auto ( and wine ) enthusiast Neil Ashmead .
The Neil Ashmead GTS , or “ Grand Tourer Shiraz ” features a racing - styled label bearing Ashmead ’s signature .
This bottle ’s best attribute , however , is its ’ six - speed stick shift screw - on cap .
The creatives at Fuller , an Australian ad agency , deserve plenty of praise for this creative wine label design .

Honey Moon Wine
While we ’ve never had the palette for sweet wines , this bottle by designer Lauren Golembiewski has our sweet tooth a -humming .
Golembiewski created the Honey Moon Wine concept as an annual gift to past and prospective clients in celebration of a budding summer .
The “ honey moon ” is the first full moon of the month of June , known as the perfect moment to begin the harvest of honey .
While the bottle is certainly an achievement of its own , Golembiewski also created the honey moon font as shown in the gallery below .

Versus Wine Pouch
Those who look down their noses at pouch wine should take a note of caution– this design is looking down its nose at you .
The Versus Wine Pouch takes advantage of the new form of packaging by making a clean , clear impression with notes of both purity and royalty .
The waves of wine are endearing to the product , while the golden diamond logo represent a product of rich quality .
While the jury is still out until we taste it , the packaging makes a strong statement on its own .

Return of the Living Red
The crew from /M / A/ S/H/ returns to this list with a special bottle for Redheads Wine .
A collaboration with Redheads Studio yielded a bottle called “ Return of the Living Red ” – a simple , provocative design with a throwback to classic horror films .
Save for a seal of blood - red wax over its cork , Return of the Living Red is only adorned with a simple , aged envelope containing clues about the bottle ’s contents .
The cards within the envelope continue the horror story , showcasing the illustrative handiwork of the /M / A/ S/H/ team .

Sav Sparkling Wine
While Sweden may not strike you as a typical wine producer , the Scandinavian country has some interesting contributions to the world of wine .
Sav Sparkling
Wine is n’t borne of grapes , but a birch sap that is pressed in the virginal wine - making region of Jämtland .
Sav ’s bottle and identity is inspired by the very tree from which this wine is created , the white birch .
After the cover is peeled away , the label is a minimal white with solid black lettering .
We ’re a bit apprehensive to taste a wine made from sap , but we ’re quite pleased with the label alone .

Mini Garage Winery
As long as you do n’t store these wines in your garage ( especially next to the turpentine ) , you ’re in for a tasty treat of packaging design .
The Mini Garage Wines and Brandies by Anthony Hammond have a literal conception– Hammond ’s wine is produced in a former tractor shop in Germany .
The packaging is amongst the most creative on this list , although we ’re skeptical on their ability to preserve the original flavor of the product .
Perhaps its the condition of the rusty turpentine cans in our own garage … [ link ]
Lunar Vine Wine
Lunar Vine
Wine wanted to add a dash of color to their bottles– who better to hire , then , than UK design firm DeathByColor ?
DBC created these wild wine bottles as lush and colorfully explosive as they could be .
While this tends to communicate “ these wines taste like soda pop ” , we can certainly appreciate the artist ’s vision .

Francis Ford Coppola “ Carmine ” Wine Jug
The design crew at Sfaustina created this obelisk of a wine jug for film ’s most noteworthy wine lover , Francis Ford Coppola .

Hypospadias , one of the most common birth defects among baby boys , apparently is not increasing in the U.S. , casting doubt on whether boys are harmed by phthalates and other endocrine - disrupting chemicals thought to trigger reproductive abnormalities .
Researchers have reported that the hypospadias rate stayed the same in New York State between 1992 and 2005 .
An earlier study also found no increase in California boys between 1984 and 1997 .
Hypospadias , a condition in which the urethra opening is on the underside of the penis rather than the tip , occurs in roughly one of every 250 male births .
Surgery is normally required or the condition can lead to infertility .
Some environmental scientists have suspected , based on studies of lab animals , that exposure to chemicals that block testosterone may be partially responsible for the birth defects .
In tests of lab rats , chemicals called phthalates , which are widely used in plastic and personal care products , cause several reproductive abnormalities that scientists have dubbed “ testicular dysgenesis syndrome " or " phthalate syndrome . "
Included are hypospadias , undescended testes , reduced sperm counts and testicular cancer .
In the new study , New York Presbyterian Hospital urologists said that because hypospadias rates are stable , it casts doubt on whether human boys are harmed by phthalates or other endocrine - disrupting chemicals .
The researchers reported in the journal Urology that “ these data suggest that the testicular dysgenesis syndrome described in animal models may not be evident in humans . ”
The lead author was Dr. Harry Fisch , director of the hospital ’s Male Reproductive Center and a professor of clinical urology at Columbia University .
But other experts say the study does not invalidate the theory .
“ The evidence seems to suggest that there has n't been a big increase in hypospadias over recent years , which does weaken the argument that new endocrine disruptors in the environment are causing hypospadias , ” said Kim Harley , a University of California , Berkeley epidemiologist who studies environmental exposures and human health but was not involved with the study .
Nevertheless , she added that it does n’t rule out that phthalates or other chemicals have a role in causing the defects .
Looking at how birth defect rates change over time is not an adequate way of examining environmental connections .
“ Hypothetically , what if there were something that we were exposed to in the past that also was associated with hypospadias ?
If that other exposure were decreasing at the same time as phthalates were increasing , it might wash out the effect and make rates stable over time , ” Harley said .
“ That is why a study like this can only hypothesize based on time trends , but ca n’t make a one - to - one link between a chemical and a disease . ”
Russ Hauser , a Harvard School of Public Health professor of environmental and occupational epidemiology who studies phthalates and other endocrine - disrupting chemicals , agreed .
“ There are many reasons for why hypospadias may or may not have changed over time .
Other risk factors also change over time , " he said .
The cause of hypospadias is unknown , but medical experts suspect that something in the womb disrupts genes that regulate male hormones .
A variety of factors , including the mother ’s age , could be to blame .
The New York study found that hypospadias is more common in boys born to mothers 35 years or older .
Although hypospadias may not be increasing now , several reports previously noted a doubling of rates in the 1970s and 1980s .
Traces of many phthalates have been found in the urine of nearly every human tested .
One study , conducted in Germany , found that some of the compounds have increased in people over the past 20 years , while others have decreased , and that exposure varies greatly from place to place .
Some people exceed the daily levels that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or European Food Safety Authority consider safe .
But whether the chemicals are harming people , particularly boys , has become quite controversial in the past couple years .
Chemical industry representatives have pointed to the hypospadias study as evidence that phthalates , which have been used as a plasticizer in vinyl for about 50 years , are not causing male reproductive abnormalities .
In addition , while some studies have found that men ’s sperm counts have declined substantially , others have reported no decline , which also casts doubt on the human effects of endocrine disruptors .
But Hauser said the hypospadias study does not invalidate the testicular dysgenesis theory because no data was collected on the boys ’ exposure to phthalates or other chemicals .
Researchers would need to collect exposure information on a large number of pregnant women , and then see if the rate of hypospadias among the highly exposed boys is different than those with low exposure , Hauser and Harley said .
The findings are useful for exploring trends in hypospadias over time , not exploring potential causes , they said .
“ Over - interpretation should be avoided , especially using them to try to prove a negative , ” Hauser said .
In addition to animal studies , other research has linked phthalates to reproductive effects .
Hauser and his colleagues reported in 2006 that men with higher levels of one common phthalate had lower sperm concentrations and quality .
And a study of 176 male infants by University of Rochester scientists found that babies exposed to higher amounts of phthalates had a shorter anogenital index ( the length of the perineum ) , which is a sign of feminized hormones .

It is such a useable space and not pre-ordered like so many sheds these days . "
Steven 's shed cost only £ 1,500 to construct and features a composting toilet , bunk beds , and woodburning stove .
He intends to build on his success by erecting a treehouse for his son close to the cabin , connecting them with a ladder .
While the public vote decides the winners in each category - which includes special sections for garden offices , TARDISes and eco-sheds - the overall winner is decided by a panel of judges including television presenter and property developer Sarah Beeny , Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans , inventor Trevor Bayliss , Alex Johnson from shedworking .

The Texan who leads the Senate Republican campaign effort rejected Dallas Rep. Pete Sessions ’ allegation that President Barack Obama is intentionally sabotaging the U.S. economy .
“ I do n’t know where he ’s coming from on it , ” Sen .
John Cornyn said Wednesday .
“ I ’d like some sort of clarification about what he meant . ”
Democrats mocked Sessions -- a member of the congressional GOP leadership who chairs the party ’s House campaign committee -- as paranoid and flirting with conspiracy theories after he was quoted accusing Obama of intentionally destroying American jobs and trying to depress the stock market in order to topple the capitalist system ...
Cornyn explicitly rejected the idea that Obama wants higher unemployment , lower stock prices and general economic malaise .
“ Absolutely not , ” Cornyn told Texas reporters .
... Asked whether he is comfortable with his fellow Texans remaining in place as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee , despite the gaffe , Cornyn deferred to the judgment of House Republicans , who picked Sessions late last year .
The dozen worst Dems in Congress -- mostly Emanuel recruits
McCarthy said such openness is necessary to rebuild the party , which lost control of Congress and the White House in the past two election cycles .
“ We ’re at 178 ” seats in the House out of 435 , he said .
“ You get beyond the majority and people can worry about what they want to purify . ”
That argument is rankling some Republicans , who said the party must continue to distinguish itself from the Democrats .
“ Standing for something is better than standing for nothing , ” said consultant Eddie Mahe .
“ There ’s that age - old saying , ‘ The reason moderates do n’t accomplish much is they do n’t believe in anything enough to fight for . ”
" I belong to the Republican Party , " McCain , 97 , said during an appearance on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno .
" What he represents of the Republican Party has nothing to do with my side of it .
I do n't know what the man means , I do n't know what he 's talking about ...
I think [ Steele ] was exactly right when he defined this man as an entertainer , " she said .
" To my horror , the Republican Party made him back up on it . "
... " I , myself , ca n't figure out that type of person who really more or less gets joy out of denigrating people .
I 'm just not that type of person , I do n't have friends like that , and thank God I am not around people like him . "
Rush just can't his troops in good order .
The latest round started with serial adulterer and corruptionist John Shadegg denigrating Limbaugh by pointing out he 's just a television personality , implying that he is n't the leader of the Republican congressional delegation .
I wonder how long it will take Shadegg , well know in DC as a gutless wonder with no backbone whatsoever , to grovel and apologize for offending his lord and master .
Then the heads of the two GOP congressional incumbent protection committees , two clueless Texas extremists with different agendas , NRSC chair John Cornyn ( who has to appeal to whole states , including some that never seceded from the Union ) and NRCC chair Pete Sessions ( whose strategy is to only appeal to the fringe base in deeply red districts , mostly in the South and Mormon West ) , started fighting with each other .
Sessions has been over the rails lately , bragging his committee 's strategy was culled from the Taliban and more recently accusing President Obama of sabotaging the economy so he could grab power .
Cornyn implied to thethat House Republicans should find someone a little more mainstream than Sessions .
The GOP has brought in another House member to run recruitment , California Congressman Kevin McCarthy who is also an extremist but who understands that to stop hemorrhaging seats the GOP is going to just have to bite the bullet and start recruiting " candidates based less on ideology and more on their chances of winning .
The goal , he said , is to seek out prospects who are ethnically diverse , female , less partisan and even supportive of abortion rights .
So far , these efforts are more concept than reality . "
It 's doubtful McCarthy cleared this with Limbaugh who is likely to go insane when he hears about it since it violates his vision of narrow - cast conservative politics .
Instead of just taking orders from Limbaugh , the way most of his colleagues do , McCarthy claims he 's getting his strategy directly fromby Naftali Bendavid .
The book , written by an Emanuel toady trumpets his blueprint for recruiting Republicans and reactionary Democrats to run for Congress while knocking actual Democrats out of the primaries .
When you look at a list of the dozen Democrats who vote most ffrequently against Democrat values on crucial issues and who most cross the aisle to support the Republican Party 's anti-working family agenda , you find 9 of Emanuel 's recruits -- from bad to worse : Gabby Giffords ( Blue Dog - AZ ) , Zack Space ( Blue Dog -OH ) , Harry Mitchell ( Blue Dog - AZ ) , Chris Carney ( Blue Dog - PA ) , Heath Shuler ( Rahm 's greatest hit , Blue Dog - NC ) , Brad Ellsworth ( Blue Dog - IN ) , Joe Donnelly ( Blue Dog - IN ) and Travis Childers ( Blue Dog - MS ) .
So McCarthy 's plan is to recruit a bunch of social moderates -- even pro-Choice Republicans -- that will drive Limbaugh up a wall .
He 's already started trying to persuade John McKinney , minority leader of the state Senate , to run against Jim Himes .
Although McKinney has " repeatedly refused to provide any responses to " Project Vote Smart on his political stands , his voting record shows that he is relatively pro-Choice , relatively pro-environment , and that he was rated an F by the NRA in 2008 and a D in 2006 .
McCarthy has also recruited fellow Californian Assemblyman Van Tran to run in Orange County against the very popular moderate , Loretta Sanchez .
Tran 's voting record in the Assembly would have to be rated as extreme right wing but he 's gotten better grades from pro-Choice groups than most Republicans and one year even almost sounded like a moderate when it came to civil rights for Asian - Americans and once got an acceptable rating for a gay organization .
In then end , though , Tran is just another garden variety right - wing rubber stamp .
While some Republican leaders -- like Eric Cantor -- says the essence of Republicanism is about greed , selfishness and supporting Big Business , others are upset when the GOP ignores the social issues .
It 's why Huckabee and Cantor are at war for the soul of the Republican Party .
As for McCarthy , it sounds like he 's gonna get waterboarded by Cheney and Limbaugh .
Meanwhile McCain's 97 year old mom took a swipe at Limbaugh for him .
Even the pig-man is n't going to a get into a fight with a 97 - year old lifelong Republican ... well he ?
Rush explains his drug addiction by admitting that hillbilly heroin made him " entirely unreasonable and irrational .
It isyou care about .
Nothing else matters , no matter how important to you otherwise ; it does n't matter as much as the addiction .
Feeding it , the fear of no being able to , is what animates your existence everyday . "
( And he hates bloggers too . )

PETA miffed at Obama 's fly ' execution '
The president has been getting lots of kudos for a lightning - fast , Mr. Miyagi - worthy swipe he employed to slay a pesky house fly that was buzzing him in mid-interview during a taping with CNBC that aired Wednesday .
“ He stopped the interview to track and kill the fly , ” said talk show host Conan O’Brien .

“ That ’s some pretty impressive hand - eye coordination right there , ” Jimmy Fallon gushed .
“ Makes Obama look like a bad ass . ”
But now People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals , calling it an “ execution , ” wants the commander - in - chief to show a little more compassion to even “ the least sympathetic animals . ”
“ Believe it or not , we 've actually been contacted by multiple media outlets wanting to know PETA 's official response to the executive insect execution , ” a blog on the group ’s website explained .
“ In a nutshell , our position is this :
He is n't the Buddha , he 's a human being , and human beings have a long way to go before they think before they act . ”
The group has sent Obama a device that traps a fly so it can then be released outside .
“ We believe that people , where they can be compassionate , should be , for all animals , ” PETA spokesman Bruce Freidrich explained .

The fly saga began Tuesday , and it was the subject of a news report on Italian TV and almost a dozen YouTube postings that have been viewed more than 750,000 times .
Thousands of people also have added commentary , including one who wrote , “ But can he duck a shoe ? ” in reference to a hugely popular video of former president George Bush ducking a shoe thrown at him by an Iraqi cameraman during a news conference in Baghdad .
“ Get out of here , ” Obama said as the fly buzzed him during his interview .
The pest persisted , and when it landed on his left forearm , Obama smacked it .
“ Now , where were we ? ” the president said without missing a beat .
Pleased with himself , he added , “ That was pretty impressive , was n't it ?
I got the sucker . ”
Several observers in the room gave congratulatory shout - outs .
Obama pointed to the floor and instructed an obliging cameraman to get a close - up of the corpse .
“ It ’s like he ’s got one of those fly Terminator targeting systems in his eyes , ” said an awed Jon Stewart .

As a recreational vocalist , I have spent some of the most moving moments of my life engaged in song .
As a college student , my eyes would often well up with tears during my twice - a- week choir rehearsals .
I would feel relaxed and at peace yet excited and joyful , and I occasionally experienced a thrill so powerful that it sent shivers down my spine .
I also felt connected with fellow musicians in a way I did not with friends who did not sing with me .
If you needed an organ transplant , how would you feel about receiving an organ donated from a serial killer ?
Would it bother you to have the heart of a psychotic murderer beating in your chest ?
Should it ?
There are two factors at work here – one intellectual , and one emotional .
The intellectual factor is easier to deal with .
There is no compelling evidence nor any plausible mechanism by which the transplantation of any organ will confer any of the personality of the donor to the recipient .
You might be tempted to quip – unless it is a brain transplant .
But I maintain that there is no such thing as a brain transplant .
If such were possible ( which is currently is not ) it would be better understood as a body transplant – but I digress .
The notion that transplants convey some of the spirit or psychic energy of the donor is pure pseudoscience .
This does not stop some from claiming just that .
Gary Schwartz , professor of Psychology at the University of Arizona , infamous in skeptical circles for his so - called After Life Experiments , believes he has documented cases of personality transplant .
Here is one example case :
In one such case , a young dancer received a heart - and - lung transplant .
Before the operation , she had been very health - conscious ; yet , the very first thing she did on leaving the hospital was to head for a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet , and wolf down an order of chicken nuggets ‹something she would never have done before .
Her personality changed , too : she became aggressive and impetuous whereas , before , she had been calm and conservative .
Let ’s see – aggressive , impetuous , and hungry .
What could possibly cause such changes in someone who just had an organ transplant ?
Those happen to all be typical side effects of prednisone , an immunosuppressant drug that many transplant recipients require .
I do n’t have the details of this case to know that this is actually the answer , but the point is that tranplant recipients often go on numerous medications and may have physiological changes that could result in changes in their personality and behavior .
Schwartz , who has made a career out of self - delusion , did not conduct the kind of research that would have ruled out known physiological effects .
He simply engaged in the typical anomaly hunting followed by confirmation bias .
It turns out the kid who donated the heart also liked KFC – what are the odds ?
Despite a lack of evidence and plausibility , belief in “ personality transplants ” persists in the population , much like any other paranormal belief , like ESP or reincarnation .
Perhaps more interesting , however , is the emotional aspect of this question – even if you reject the pseudoscience , and understand on an intellectual level that a heart is just protein , would it bother you in the least to be living on the heart of a killer ?
This is exactly the question explored by University of Bristol cognitive neuroscientist , Professor Bruce Hood .
He is the author of the recent book Supersense , which is all about how humans are hardwired to feel as if we have a psychic or metaphysical connection to other people and the universe .
For example , during some of his lectures he will hold up a cardigan sweater and ask the audience who would be willing to wear the sweater .
Most hands go up .
Then he informs them that the sweater belonged to a famous serial killer – almost every hand goes down .
He recently conducted a study in which subjects were ask to imagine they needed an organ transplant and were asked to view pictures of people and rate how happy they would be to receive an organ from each person .
They were then told that specific people were either good or bad people , and he showed that subjects were less happy about receiving organs from morally bad people .
This , of course , makes no scientific sense .
He says :
“ This explains the findings that most people were repulsed by the thought of receiving a transplant from a murderer .
“ Essentially they believe they will somehow take on those characteristics of the donor . ”
The source of this repulsion , he argues , is in our evolved emotion of disgust at feeling we are being contaminated by something tainted .
This emotion extends to moral taint , and includes the “ sense ” that we can be tainted through a psychic connection to others – even through a physical object , like a sweater .
Hood is definitely onto something , and such notions have been bandied about in skeptical circles for years .
We seem to be dealing with a species ( humans ) whose default mode of thinking includes magical thinking as well as a self - image as spiritual entities above the muck of the physical world .
We all want to believe Yoda when he said :
“ Luminous beings are we , not this crude matter . ”
Understanding human nature is key to any human pursuit , which includes science and any attempt at understanding reality .
This includes understanding the organization of our brains , which is hierarchical .
This means that our highest and most recently evolved cognitive functions can override our more primitive instincts – even Hood ’s “ supersense . ”
Therefore , in my opinion , it is OK to feel what we feel .
Feeling revulsion at the notion of receiving a transplant from a cold - hearted killer is just part of the human condition .
This is not something to be criticized , but to be recognized .
As long as we exercise our higher cortical functions and make rational decisions despite what our guts might be telling us .
Listen to your gut – but do n’t think with it .
BTW – I will be interviewing Bruce Hood for next week ’s episode of the SGU .

A man has climbed up a BBC building using a pair of vacuum gloves he built himself , in a stunt for a new BBC One science show .
Inventor Jem Stansfield , the presenter of Bang Goes The Theory , used an everyday vacuum cleaner to construct the kit .
He scaled the 40 m ( 120 ft ) high BBC White City building in west London , watched by hundreds of people .
This stunt was carried out by trained professionals following strict safety procedures and should not be attempted or replicated .
Bang Goes The Theory starts on BBC One on Monday 27 July , 2009 at 1930 BST
From 2001 to 2003 , I worked as the local IT admin and jack - of - all - trades for a branch of a collection services company in California .
It was fun in that I got to do a lot of stuff that a larger organization would have compartmentalized , but it was also difficult in that I had no one to back me up when I needed to make an argument .
The boss happened to not only behave like the " pointy - haired boss " in Dilbert , but he actually had pointy hair -- a coincidence that often manifested itself when he showed both his lack of IT knowledge and his poor management decisions .
When I first took the job , the network consisted of a hodgepodge of equipment run on cat3 and coax .
By " hodgepodge , " I mean we had ancient reel - to - reel tape drives and an old mainframe running data " platters " that I had never heard of until then , and the user environment was old orange - screen terminals .

When the day came to upgrade to a new network , I got tasked with the project and spent a couple of weekends pulling Cat5 through suspended ceilings and conduits , and I got to install a textbook server to replace the old mainframe .
I did much of the grunt work myself and planned very carefully , and I was thrilled to see I had quite a bit of money left over in my budget .
I went through the appropriate channels and bought an extra server to use as a mirrored server for fault tolerance .
In the course of a few months , the mirrored server setup prevented costly interruptions to service several times -- and I was pleased with myself for my foresight .
Then I went on vacation .
While I was on vacation , the IT guys from the main office flew out to take my " extra " server to their office to reimage and use as an additional Exchange server .
My manager accepted their explanation that I was wasting company resources with this " extra server " and let them abscond with a very much needed piece of equipment .
That Saturday my pager went off .
I called in to find out that the network was down and 400 collection agents were idling away their time because of the outage .
I apologized to my wife and drive the 450 miles back to the office to find out that my backup server was gone .
After an hour , the lone server was back up and running from a backup tape that was several days old .
My boss demanded to know why the server failed -- and I demanded to know where my backup server was .
He admitted that he let the HQ guys take it , then I reminded him that he gave away a $ 30,000 server that our office had been charged for and that it was not an " extra " server but part of our fault - tolerance system .
To his point of view , my mirrored server was an " extra " because he never saw the system failing .
In retrospect , I suppose I should have put just one server online at the start to illustrate to him why a backup was important .
Seeing the reasons on paper sometimes are n't as effective as seeing the reason in action .
We never got the server back , so what ended up happening was that an additional server was bought for around $ 10,000 .
Then the company went bankrupt later that year , ending my worries about the whole scenario when I helped lock the doors for the last time on Oct. 30 , 2003 .

Embedded Markup Considered Harmful
October 2 , 1997
Theodor Holm Nelson
A new religion , a first - generation religion , starts with a fundamental idea and expands it to fill the universe with visions of Beginnings and Ends - - right and wrong , righteousness and sin , good and evil , Hell and Heaven .
[ 1 ]
It may have strict standards to make sure individuals demonstrate reverent compliance .
A second - generation religion shifts emphasis , because people 's concerns have changed -- perhaps with new lands to conquer , less worry about sin .
The priests adjust the previous fundamental idea to grapple with the new situation .
But in this second generation , priests must also show fidelity to the terminology of the earlier generation , framing their new concerns amongst the old ideas wherever possible .
Everyone is stuck with the concepts already elucidated .
SGML is a first - generation religion .
Its founding idea was to represent nameless fonts and abstracted text blocks at one remove from complete specification , so that the fonts and text blocks could be reformatted by changing a short list of definitions .
This idea was then expanded to fill the universe , becoming a technique for the sequential , hierarchical representation of any data , with embedded tags representing Beginnings and Ends .
Great emphasis was put on formal correctness , defining a strict standard for compliance .
Originally intended to create order in type - font selection , SGML has been extended and extended to fill the universe , becoming a reference language of sequential attributes and now hypertext links and graphics ( HTML ) .
Its believers think SGML can represent anything at all -- at least , anything they approve of .
But now we see a change .
The second generation of the SGML faith is the HTML religion , whose intention and outlook are entirely different , but which preaches in the robes of the old .
A new land has been conquered -- the Web .
There is great prosperity , as in the time of Solomon , so that sin-- formal correctness -- is not a worry .
Embedded Markup
I want to discuss what I consider one of the worst mistakes of the current software world , embedded markup ; which is , regrettably , the heart of such current standards as SGML and HTML .
( There are many other embedded markup systems ; an interesting one is RTF .
But I will concentrate on the SGML - HTML theology because of its claims and fervor . )
There is no one reason this approach is wrong ; I believe it is wrong in almost every respect .
But I must be honest and acknowledge my objection as a serious paradigm conflict , or ( if you will ) religious conflict .
In paradigm conflict and religious conflict , there can be no hope of doctrinal victory ; the best we can seek is for both sides to understand each other fully and cordially .
SGML 's advocates expect , or wish to enforce , a universal linear representation of hierarchial structure .
I believe that if this is a factual claim of appropriateness , it is a delusion ; if it is an enforcement , it is an intolerable imposition which drastically curtails the representation of non-hierarchical media structure .
I will turn to general problems of the embedded method .
I have three extremely different objections to embedded markup .
The first is simple ; the second is complicated to explain ; and the third challenges the claim of generality .
Objection 1 : Editing
The SGML approach is a delivery format , not a working format .
Editing is outside the paradigm , happens " elsewhere . "
If material is to be edited , it generally must be frequently counted to perform the edit operations .
Tags throw off the counts .
This means that while text is being reworked , some other representation must be maintained , or complex tricks invoked to maintain counts .
[ 2 ]
This seems quite wrong .
Objection 2 : Transpublishing a Potential Conflict
This topic will take some explaining .
Network electronic publishing offers a unique special - case solution to the copyright problem that has not been generally recognized .
I call it transpublishing .
Let me explain .
In paper publishing , there are two copyright realms : a fortified zone of copyrighted material , defended by its owners and requiring prior negotiation by publishers for quotation and re-use ; and an unfortified zone , the open sea of public domain , where anything may be quoted freely -- but whose materials tend to be outdated and less desirable for re-use .
Transpublishing makes possible a new realm between these two , where everything may be treated as boilerplate ( as with public - domain material ) , but where publishers relinquish none of their rights and receive revenue exactly proportional to use .
Two different parties have legitimate concerns .
Original rightsholders are concerned for their territory of copyrighted material , as defined by law , so that they may maintain and benefit from their hard - won assets .
But the public ( everybody else , as well as rightsholders in their time off ) would like to re-use and republish these materials in different ways .
What if a system could exist which would satisfy all parties -- copyright holders and those who would like to quote and republish ?
What if materials could be quoted without restriction , or size limit , by anyone , without red tape or negotiation -- but all publishers would continue to furnish the downloaded copies , and would be exactly rewarded , being paid for each copy ?
Transpublication is a unique arrangement -- only possible online -- which can achieve this win-win solution . [ 3 ]
Transpublishing Defined
Transpublishing means including materials virtually in online documents : the new document pulls material from the old , so the original publisher 's system furnishes the quoted material to each user on each download .
( So far this only works for pictures , through the < IMG SRC > tag in HTML , but we are working on a tag for extracting text quotes . ) [ 2 ]
Naturally the original rightsholder must give permission for this in advance ( " transcopyright " ) . [ 3 ]
Transpublishing turns all participating materials into virtual clip art , freely to be recomposited into new online contexts .
Its advantages are special .
It provides a bridge to the original ( a great benefit to understanding the written intent of the author , and possibly the author 's reputation ) .
Furthermore , with a suitable micropayment system , [ 4 ] transpublishing should provide also a means by which the publisher is paid for each manifestation [ 5 ] thus quoted .
Transpublishing versus Embedded Markup
Embedded markup drastically interferes with transclusive re-use .
For one thing , any arbitrary section of an HTML document may not have correct tags ( since the tags overlap and extend over potentially long attribute fields ) .
This means HTML - based transclusion cannot be handled by a simple tag , but probably requires some sort of proxy server .
Second -- and it has taken a long time to get to this point [ 6 ] -- the quoting author may legitimately want to change fonts and and markup .
This is done all the time in scholarly writing and serious journalism , with phrases like " emphasis mine . "
It needs to be possible in transpublishing to change emphasis and other attributes by nullifying the original markup .
Of course , re-emphasizing through markup is an editorial modification , subject to judgment calls and issues of academic etiquette .
But the inquiring reader can always follow the bridge of transclusion to see the original as formatted by the author .
There are two markup solutions to make transpublishing work with SGML and HTML .
Alternative method 1 : parallel markup
The best alternative is parallel markup .
I believe that sequential formatted objects are best represented by a format in which the text and the markup are treated as separate parallel members , presumably ( but not necessarily ) in different files . [ 7 ]
The tags can be like those of SGML , but they are not embedded in the text itself .
They are in parallel streams which reference positions in the text data stream .
Thus each tag is preceded by a count showing how far the tag is after the previous tag .
( This incremental counting , rather than stating each tag 's distance from the beginning , is to facilitate editing . )
This method has several advantages :
Clean data .
The raw text may be counted , scanned , copied , etc. with ease .
Pluralism .
Each markup stream is independent , allowing simultaneously different formatting of the same material .
( Note that schemes are also possible for markup streams to be combined , but that is outside this discussion . )
Editability .
The streams may be edited , though they must be edited in parallel .
Operations of insertion , deletion , rearrangment , and transclusion are all easily definable .
( However , some attention must be paid in the design of appropriate editing programs to such features as paired tags defining attribute fields , and when attribute fields are separated and joined , the editing program must behave accordingly . )
Transclusion with variation .
The text may be transcluded ( re-used by reference as a virtual quotation ) in any online document .
Transcluding authors may apply their own parallel markup streams .
How can parallel markup be fitted into the SGML model ?
Easily , as a variant form to be used for various legitimate purposes .
Taking an SGML file to a parallel format is in most cases a reversible , non-destructive , non-lossy transformation .
Thus I believe we should call it " the Parallel Representation of SGML , " and make it an optional part of the SGML standard .
Alternative method 2 : tag override
Where it is inconvenient to break out the tags into a parallel stream -- i.e. , where they 're already stuck or published in the original -- we may fall back on the method of tag override .
By this I mean simply treating the original tags as if they are not there ; ignoring them while counting through the contents and furnishing instead a parallel tag stream , as in parallel markup .
We do not dislodge the original markup , but simply ignore it .
This is smarmier at the implementation level , losing the benefit of clean counting and requiring a more complex editing apparatus .
Otherwise it has the advantages of parallel markup : pluralism , editability , and transclusion with variation .
Note that this is tag override , not overload , since no symbol is being redefined .
Objection 3 : Structures That Don't Fit
When SGML fanciers say " structure , " they mean structure where everything is contained and sequential , with no overlap , no sharing of material in two places , no relations uncontained .
SGML advocates
I have talked to appear to have the belief that everything is either sequential and hierarchical , or can be represented that way .
What is not expresssible sequentially and hierarchically is deemed to be nonexistent , inconceivable , evil , or mistaken .
I believe that embedded structure , enforcing sequence and hierarchy , limits the kinds of structure that can be expressed .
The question we must ask is :
What is the real structure of a thing or a document ?
( And does it reasonably fit the allowed spectrum of variation within the notational system ? )
You can always force structures into other structures and claim that they 're undamaged ; another way to say this is that if you smash things up it is easier to make them fit .
Enforcing sequence and hierarchy simply restricts the possibilities .
Like a TV dinner , embedded markup nominally contains everything you could want .
" What else could you possibly want ? " means " It 's not on the menu . "
Exactly Representing Thought
and Change
My principal long - term concern is the exact representation of human thought , especially that thought put into words and writing .
But the sequentiality of words and old - fashioned writing have until now compromised that representation , requiring authors to force sequence on their material , and curtail its interconnections .
Designing editorial systems for exact and deep representation is therefore my objective .
This issue creates a very different focus from that of the markup community : the task I see is not merely to represent frozen objects tossed over the transom by an author or management , or format static structures for printout or screen , but to maintain a continuing evolutionary base of material and to track the changes in it .
To find the support functions really needed for creative organization by authors and editors , we must understand the exact representation and presentation of human thought , and be able to track the continuities of structure and change .
This means we must find a stable means of representing structure very different from the sequential and hierarchial - - a representation of structure which recognizes the most anarchic and overlapping relations ; and the location of identical and corresponding materials in different versions ; which recognizes and maintains constancies of structure and data across successive versions , even as addresses of these materials become unpredictably fragmented by editing .
Thus deep version management -- knowing locations of shared materials to the byte level -- is a vital problem to solve in the design of editing systems .
And the same location management is necessary on a much broader scale to support transpublishing .
Embedded markup cannot represent this at all , and merely adds obstacles ( impeded data structure ) to solving these rich addressing problems .
Three Layers
I believe we should find a very general representational system , a reference model which breaks apart in parallel what is represented by SGML and HTML .
This would make the creation of deep editing and version management methods much easier .
By handling contents , structure , and special effects separately in such a reference model , the parts can be better understood and worked on , and far more general structures can be represented .
I would propose a three - layer model : [ 8 ]
A content layer to facilitate editing , content linking , and transclusion management .
A structure layer , declarable separately .
Users should be able to specify entities , connections and co-presence logic , defined independently of appearance or size or contents ; as well as overlay correspondence , links , transclusions , and " hoses " for movable content .
Finally , a special - effects - and - primping layer should allow the declaration of ever - so - many fonts , format blocks , fanfares , and whizbangs , and their assignment to what 's in the content and structure layers .
I believe that a parallel system of this kind will soon become necessary because of the degree of entanglement and unmanageability of HTML .
But we must learn from the recent past and provide sufficient abstractness and generality .
Conclusion
For editing and transpublishing , there are serious shortcomings to embedded markup .
I believe that embedded markup , daily more tangled , will implode and leave HTML as an output format , supplanted by deeper editors and deeper hypermedia forms .
In the meantime it is necessary to find other solutions to its shortcomings for transpublishing , especially parallelized tag models .
Few understand the true nature of hypertext and its relation to thought , let alone the vast interconnection of ideas , and the way that most expressions of ideas sever and misrepresent them .
Today 's popular but trivially - structured Web hypertext has excused people from seeing the real hypertext issues , or being able to create and publish deep complexes of thought .
We greatly need a general structure to represent all forms of interconnection and structure , and changes in both content and structure ; and to visualize and re-use variants and alternatives , comparing them in context in order to understand and choose .
Mapping these serious concerns to an SGML - HTML template is not a minor inconvenience but an impossible violation of the problem .
Of course , people always try to fit information into a familiar mold , even when that structure has shown itself inhospitable , unshaped to that information .
C. Northcote Parkinson has pointed out [ 4 ] that the fullest flowering of a paradigm , at least as seen by its participants -- all gaps closed and issues unseen , the people no longer aware that there are any unsatisfied problems -- may indicate that the paradigm is near its end .

Rockstar , Inc. , the company that makes Rockstar Energy Drinks , has threatened to sue the LGBT blog The Bilerco Project for alleged inaccuracies in a post which called for a boycott of the popular product .
The CEO of Rockstar , Inc. is Russell Weiner , son of the notoriously anti-gay radio personality Michael “ Savage ” Weiner .
The claimed inaccuracies were that Rockstar Energy Drink was co-founded by Michael Savage and that he continues to reap profits from the company .
From Bilerco.com :
Rockstar ’s lawyer complained to me that [ guest blogger ]
Michael ’s article contained two inaccurate sentences and that the gist of the article was “ Michael Savage is a filthy creep and he has deep connections with Rockstar energy drink . ”
While the attorney made it perfectly clear he agreed Savage was a disgusting pig , it was unfair to the company to link Rockstar with Savage just because Michael Savage ’s son , Russell Weiner , is the current CEO of RockStar .
According to Rockstar ’s attorney , Savage only advised his son on the drink and not the company .
They dispute that Savage directly profits from sales of the energy drink as well .
However an archived version of the Rockstar website seems to suggest otherwise ( archive has been blocked and is no longer available ) :
“ I was very fortunate to have been raised by two of the leading herbalists in the world , Dr. and Mrs. MICHAEL WEINER , Ph.D. …
From my earliest walking days , I remember exploring the jungles of the South Pacific on expeditions WITH MY PARENTS .
… MY FAMILY HAS taken that spirit and experience – their lifetime journey – and DEVELOPED the most complete , most unique , most powerful , and most honest energy beverage ever created : ROCKSTAR . ” – CEO RUSSELL GOLDENCLOUD WEINER
Russell Weiner ’s mother , Janet Weiner , wife of Michael Savage , happens to be CFO of Rockstar , Inc .
And while Michael Savage may not be “ directly ” reap profits from the company , the household likely does .
The Bilerco Project is not alone in being targeted by Rockstar ’s legal team .
They have also contacted a number of other websites about the disputed claims and were successful in shutting down a Facebook group with over 12,000 members that had also called for a boycott of the drink .
Since when is it illegal to call for a boycott ?
Christian anti-gay groups do it all the time .

Hey , this Android thing may take off after all !
After wowing virtually no one with the hacker 's delight T - Mobile G1 ( one of the most egregiously ugly phones ever to hit the market ) , T - Mobile and manufacturer HTC have spent nearly a year re-educating themselves about what a cell phone should look like and how it should work .
The result of that hard work is the myTouch 3G , a vastly better cell phone that finally gives the more mature handsets on the market a run for their money .
The most immediately noticeable thing about the myTouch 3G is its new styling .
Gone is the clumsy , Sidekick - like chassis of the G1 , replaced with a classic , scalloped shell and — more importantly — a much smaller size .
At just 4.1 ounces , it 's tiny in comparison to the G1 ( though the screen is almost the same size , at 3.2 inches diagonally ) , easily fitting into a pocket and comfortable to hold .
Unlike the G1 , there 's no physical keyboard on the myTouch , and the small size makes tap - typing on the narrow screen more difficult than , say , on the iPhone .
Autofill / autocorrect features make things move along a little faster , but it 's generally slow going .
The screen also feels a bit less sensitive and accurate than the iPhone's .
The OS is noticeably sluggish , though it 's not oppressively slow .
Good news , everyone !
Applications available in the Android Market have come a long way since the G1 was released , with more than 6,000 apps for download .
As with the iPhone , some of these are fantastic , and some are useless .
But choice is a good thing , and the app store is organized well enough that finding what you want is n't tough .
Android even suggests apps you might like via the preloaded AppPack system .
Naturally , the strong integration with Google services is intact here and is arguably stronger than ever .
You can even search Google with voice commands now .
This works far better than we expected , although it can hang sometimes when you 're starting it up .
Fortunately , you 'll be able to afford to wait when kinks like this arise :
With just over seven hours of talk time ( based on our tests ) , this phone has epic longevity for a 3 - G handset so minuscule in size .
T - Mobile specs put standby time at a whopping 600 hours .
A capable 3.2 - megapixel camera / camcorder rounds out the package .
In all , the myTouch has smoothed out nearly all of the G1's numerous rough edges .
We may not be dumping our iPhones for it just yet , but at least the open source crowd no longer has to be embarrassed about its top - of - the - line handset .
Police chiefs must rethink the controversial tactic of " kettling " participants of mass demonstrations , a report said today .
The practice of holding people in one place for long periods , widely known as " kettling " , cannot always be justified , a committee of MPs found .
Members of the Home Affairs Committee said it is not acceptable to impose a blanket ban on movement and peaceful protesters should be allowed to leave .

They said frontline officers must be given discretion to allow some people to escape highly - charged events .
The findings were contained in a report published by the committee into the G20 protests in the City of London .
More than 35,000 people took to the streets as world leaders met over two days at the beginning of April .
The police have endured a barrage of criticism in the aftermath of the death of newspaper seller Ian Tomlinson who was pushed to the ground during clashes .
Independent investigators have launched several inquiries after footage of officers lashing out at protesters was caught on camera .
The Home Affairs Committee report said a small number of high - profile incidents could damage the confidence of the public in police .
Members criticised senior officers for several aspects of the huge £ 7.2 million policing operation involving several forces .

They said that overall the operation was " remarkable successful " with little disruption to the capital but added an " element of luck " may have helped police .
MPs said images of so - called distraction tactics , shows of controlled violence against hostile individuals , shocked many and could undermine public trust .
They added " urgent action " is required to ensure officers display identification at all times .
Those who do not must face the " strongest possible " disciplinary measures , they said .
Members said they were concerned untrained and inexperienced officers were left in such a " highly combustible atmosphere " at the frontline of the protests .
The committee said police should not spend money on water cannons and other equipment to create distance between them and protesters .
They said the money could be better spent on training and planning .
MPs added that police organisers must also work harder to communicate with protest organisers and the media .
The report concluded : " Above all , the police must constantly remember that those who protest on Britain 's streets are not criminals but citizens motivated by moral principles , exercising their democratic rights .
" The police 's doctrine must remain focused on allowing this protest to happen peacefully . "
Keith Vaz , who chairs the committee , said police must consider whether to continue with tactics such as ' kettling ' and to ensure untrained officers are not left on the frontline .
He said : " The basic principle that the police must remember is that protesters are not criminals - the police 's doctrine must remain focused on allowing protest to happen peacefully .
" In many ways this was a large protest which passed off remarkably well .
But it is clear that concerns about the policing of the G20 Protests have damaged the public 's confidence in the police , and that is a great shame .
" The ability of the public and the media to monitor every single action of the police through CCTV , mobile phones and video equipment should mean they take even greater care to ensure that all their actions are justifiable .
" It is unacceptable for officers not to wear identification numbers at such events , and any officers found to be deliberately removing their identification should face the strongest possible disciplinary measures . "
Chief Constable South Yorkshire Meredydd Hughes , a member of the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) , said : " Every single public order event - from football games and festivals through to large scale protests , provides the service with fresh opportunities to learn and improve the way that we do things .
" Policing must be proportionate , lawful , accountable and necessary , and we accept that we will not get it right every time .
" What 's important is that we take those opportunities , encourage debate and as a service , respond appropriately to criticism .
" The G20 was one of the largest security operations ever mounted in this country and we are pleased the committee recognises its overall success .
" Every weekend , many protests happen across the UK with little or no involvement from the police service - largely due to good communication between protesters and the police .
" What is clear is that there are concerns that we need to address as a service and we will study this report carefully alongside the other reviews and inquiries under way . "
Paul McKeever , chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales , said officers need a wide range of tactics to deal with riots , demonstrations and public order situations .
He said : " We are the lawfully appointed authority designated to accommodate lawful protests but this must continue to be done whilst balancing the rights and needs of the majority to conduct their daily lives as uninterrupted as possible .
" Containment as a tactic allows for the protection of property , the minimising of disorder , the identification of offenders and the ability of others to go about their lawful business .
" We accept however that the employment of this tactic may occasionally result in the detainment of some people not involved in the protest , but what has to be considered is the alternative .
" By choosing a method such as dispersal and allowing groups of demonstrators to roam around areas at will you are allowing , at best , disruption to the lives of non-protesters and at worst serious disorder .
" We support the contention that containment must be proportionate to the circumstances and intelligence gathered .
We also believe its use must always be balanced against the need to take measures against the potential for much greater disorder . "
Leave a Comment and Tell Us How Evil is Monsanto ?
( OrganicJar ) Grinnell Heritage Farm is 152 years old .
Andrew Dunham is the fifth generation of his family to work this land about 50 miles east of Des Moines .
He is a direct descendant of Josiah Grinnell , founder of the town and the man Horace Greeley once famously quoted as having said , “ Go west , young man , go west . ”
Andrew and his wife Melissa are a few months shy of receiving their formal certification as an organic farm .
Across the road , due north of their land , is a field of corn that is owned and managed by the Monsanto seed corn plant .
In Iowa and anywhere commodity corn is grown , it is common practice around this time of year to use chemicals to control fungus .
Often this is accomplished via the use of aerial application , commonly referred to as cropdusting .
On July 6th , a rustic - looking old biplane swooped in to spray Monsanto ’s field .
To put it mildly , the pilot ’s bombardiering skills were not what one would hope .
Dunham ’s crew was in the field picking broccoli and spinruts ( “ turnip ” backwards — a Japanese form of the root vegetable ) .
They witnessed the plane as it failed to shut off its spray mechanism , and the fungicide drifted into their fields .
“ The ground is in the third year of transition and would have become organically certified on September 1st , ” Andrew said .
Now , probably not .
You ’d think that this would be a clear - cut cause of action , as the legal folks would put it .
But the clever folks at Monsanto hire the crop dusters as contractors , and they in turn use a corporate shell with no assets , so when something like this happens and a victim sues , they simply file bankruptcy and then form a new corporation .
A fellow cropduster , Bob Howard did n’t see what the big deal was .
“ If everything was Roundup Ready it would be the greatest thing in the world , if they would all go to Roundup Ready or all go back to conventional farming it would sure be a lot easier on us . ”
It ’s stunning that someone so obviously shortsighted was able to obtain a pilot ’s license .
His apathy toward his community and flagrant self - centered simple - mindedness are indicative of the unconscious conspiracy to which so many are a party .
They have all been bamboozled into believing in “ Better living through chemistry . ”
So much so , in fact , that the methods most farmers have used for a mere few decades are called “ conventional , ” and the few who practice farming as it was done for millennia are the outliers .
Monsanto ’s website even claims that they are “ Growing yield sustainably . ”
Farmers like Andrew Dunham can do little more than stand in their contaminated fields in stunned silence as Monsanto ’s contracted crop dusters continue to fly in the face of logic .
But Dunham and his family still manage to produce excellent food .

[ UPDATED ] Six Seven Members of Congress Say Panetta Testified That CIA Misled Congress
Created : July 08 , 2009 19:26 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Remember how CIA Director Leon Panetta said in May that members of the House Intelligence Committee “ will have to determine ” whether the CIA accurately and appropriately briefed Congress about the agency ’s “ enhanced interrogation program ” ?
It appears that Panetta reached a conclusion himself .
On June 26 , seven Democrats on the committee — Anna Eshoo ( Calif . ) , John Tierney ( Mass . ) , Rush Holt ( N.J. ) , Mike Thompson ( Calif . ) , Alcee Hastings ( Fla. ) and Jan Schakowsky ( Ill . ) [ Update : I received an early version of the letter .
Rep. Adam Smith ( Wash . ) also signed it ] — wrote to Panetta , “ Recently you testified that you have determined that top CIA officials have concealed significant actions from all Members of Congress , and misled Members for a number of years from 2001 to this week . ”
The letter — which does n’t explain what those “ significant actions ” concerned * — asks that Panetta “ publicly correct ” his May 15 statement that it is n’t CIA “ policy or practice to mislead Congress . ”
TWI acquired a copy of the letter , which comes after CQ reported that committee chairman Silvestre Reyes ( D - Texas ) also nebulously stated that CIA “ affirmatively lied ” to the committee .
But CIA spokesman George Little says it ’s “ completely wrong ” to say Panetta determined CIA misled Congress , as the six legislators charge .
“ Director Panetta stands by his May 15 statement , ” Little said .
“ It is not the policy or practice of the CIA to mislead Congress .
This Agency and this Director believe it is vital to keep the Congress fully and currently informed .
Director Panetta ’s actions back that up .
As the letter from these six representatives notes , it was the CIA itself that took the initiative to notify the oversight committees . ”
Little continued : “ As for the Congress , as the Speaker has said , ‘ We all share great respect for the dedicated men and women of the Intelligence Community who are deeply committed to the safety and security of the American people . ’ ”
Here ’s the full letter :

Late Update* : HuffPost ’s Sam Stein nails down that these , uh , “ significant actions ” are indeed torture - related .

It 's a common complaint from gamers when they look at release lists : there are just too many games to play during the holiday season .
Would n't it be better if game releases were spread out throughout the year ?
Research firm EEDAR has taken the time and effort to crunch the numbers , and the data it dug up is interesting ... and wo n't lead to many changes in the behavior of publishers .
" While the fourth quarter does have a significantly higher quantity of releases , so too does it have a significantly higher proportion of the year 's sales , " the report states .
" The thoughts on releasing more games in Q4 seem to run analogous to expanding a sports stadium from holding 20,000 fans to 35,000 fans — if you can fill the seats , than the expansion is justified . "
Sales go up , more games can be supported , so why not release more games ?
The next thing EEDAR looked at was the quality of releases spread across the year , and in fact they found that the quality of games remained consistent , for the most part , across all four quarters .
If anything , you see more bad games coming out near the end of the year .
In the area of " good " review scores , which is games that rate in the 70 to 84 range , there are fewer titles .
You also see an increase of games in the " poor " section , which score 54 or below .
EEDAR 's data shows that game quality is more or less constant throughout the year , judging by review scores
So if anything , the release schedule we 're used to is working , although you can see a slight uptick in " shovelware " in the last quarter .
More people are buying games , more games are being released , and you should be more cautious about what you buy during the holiday season .
It 's that last bit where you start to see the issue , though : for core gamers who buy games throughout the year , the holiday season becomes a nightmare of competing titles .
" Let us assume that a gamer owns all the next - generation systems and instead of calculating based on SKUs , where some games have multiple SKUs that score 85 or higher , we look at it on a per title basis ...
Quarters 1 through 3 , on average , each produce 5 distinct games that score 85 or higher , " the report claims .
" Quarter 4 on average has 15 , a 200 percent increase . "
While a wider range of consumers may be heading into the stores to buy games as gifts for husbands or wives or children and grandchildren , the consumer who gravitates towards high - quality game releases has a much harder time keeping up with games .
How bad is this issue for the discriminating gamer who buys games throughout the year ?
According to this report , if you only buy the highest quality games you could get by on a $ 250 quarterly gaming budget for the first three quarters , but you would need a $ 750 gaming budget to buy all the best games in the fourth quarter .
That 's insane , for even the most hardcore gamer .
The question of whether it would be better for publishers to space those high - quality games out is a complex one .
The gaming market that buys games year round and waits on event titles is large , but it may not be as large as the built - in sales bump your product receives by launching in the fourth quarter .
" Regardless of how you slice the data , games that score 85 or above in quality sell 15 to 20 percent more in their lifetime if released in the holiday than in the off - season , " the report states .
In other words , no matter how much hardcore gamers may complain , we might not be able to fight the power of Christmas .
Eve Online is about the struggle between giant corporations Space trading game Eve Online has suffered a virtual version of the credit crunch .
One of the game 's biggest financial institutions lost a significant chunk of its deposits as a huge theft started a run on the bank .
One of the bank 's controllers stole about 200bn kredits and swapped them for real world cash of £ 3,115 .
As news of the theft spread , many of the bank 's customers rushed to remove their virtual cash .
Space scandal
The theft from EBank took place in early June but only now have details emerged about the amount of money stolen and why it was taken .
The theft was carried out by EBank 's chief executive , a player known as Ricdic , now known to be a 27 - year - old Australian who works in the technology industry .
His full identity has not been revealed save that his first name is Richard .
The stolen kredits amounted to 8 % of the 2.6tn that Ebank had in its virtual vaults .
" Basically this character was one of the people who had been running EBank for a while .
He took a bunch of ( virtual ) money out of the bank , and traded it away for real money , " Ned Coker , of Icelandic company CCP which runs Eve , told the Reuters news agency .
Eve Online has about 300,000 players all of whom inhabit the same online universe .
The game revolves around trade , mining asteroids and the efforts of different player - controlled corporations to take control of swathes of virtual space .
It has now emerged that Ricdic used the cash to put down a deposit on a house and to pay medical bills .
" I 'm not proud of it at all , that 's why I did n't brag about it , " Ricdic told Reuters .
" But you know , if I had to do it again , I probably would 've chosen the same path based on the same situation . "
Ricdic has now been thrown out of the game as trading in - game cash for real money is against Eve Online 's terms and conditions .
The rules governing play within Eve would not have sanctioned Ricdic if he had simply stolen the cash and used it in the game , nor if he had bought kredits with real dollars .
The scandal is not the first to play out in Eve Online .
In early 2009 one of the game 's biggest corporations , called Band of Brothers , was brought down by industrial espionage .

Sue Pederson knows that the teenage boys in her treatment program have trouble making conversation .
They may not know what to talk about ; or once they get started , when to shut up .
That 's one of the striking features of people with Asperger 's syndrome : they struggle with the social skills that come so naturally to others .
But about a year ago , Pederson , a psychologist , and her colleagues at the Fraser Child & Family Center in Minneapolis found a new way to reach these students -- right through their headphones .
They 're using iPods , which play music and videos , to teach them how to fit in .
It may have started out as a form of entertainment , but Pederson says this kind of technology is turning into an unexpected boon for children and teenagers with special needs .
The devices , it turns out , can be crammed with the kind of information they need to get through the day .
While it 's still experimental , she said , " I think it 's going to spread like wildfire . "
With Asperger 's , a form of autism , people lack the inner voice that tells them what is , or is not , appropriate behavior .
At Fraser , Pederson 's staff came up with the idea of programming iPods to act as an electronic substitute for that missing voice .
In this case , the staff helped students create a series of short videos and slide shows on how to behave in different social settings .
Some are barely 30 seconds long :
How to carry on a conversation ( " Let the other person talk AND change the topic ... " ) ; how to respect other people 's boundaries , and think before they speak ( " Use your filter ! " )
In the world of special education , these scripts are known as " social stories , " used to teach basic social skills .
" It 's a mental checklist for things to think about when you 're interacting with other people , " explained Mandy Henderson , who works with Fraser 's Asperger 's program .
As part of the Fraser project , the students can transfer the videos onto their iPods , and replay them over and over , to drive the lessons home .
Little videos replace signs Jack O'Riley , of Eagan , said it 's just what his 15 - year - old son P.J. needed .
" This really hit the mark , " he said .
Like many kids with Asperger's , P.J. is baffled by the normal rhythms of social interaction : in conversation , he may blurt out too much information , or say nothing at all , his father says .
At the same time , P.J. is easily distracted and has a hard time staying on task , another common trait of Asperger's .
For years , O'Riley posted laminated signs around the house to remind his son how to get through the day -- take a shower , brush his teeth , get ready for school .
Now , with the videos developed at Fraser , " we can plug this stuff into his little ' extended memory , ' " O'Riley said .
P.J. is building a library of videos on his iPhone , so they 'll be at his fingertips .
" He can pull up a topic on his ' to do list ' and find everything he needs to know , " his father said .
Sixteen - year - old Myles Lund of Lakeville , another student in the Fraser program , said he 's learned to use the iPod to help control his emotions by playing his favorite music .
" It helps take my mind off of it , " he said .
At the same time , Myles , who says he rarely initiates a conversation , agrees the videos can help in social situations .
" I just pull out my iPod and go through a list of things to talk about . "
The staffers at Fraser came up with the idea after they noticed how students with Asperger 's would use iPods as a calming device , to block out noise or other distractions .
" We just started thinking how else can we use this technology , " said Pederson .
They got a $ 7,500 private grant to buy the iPods and other equipment , and started experimenting .
They 're not alone .
Jim Ball , an adviser to the Autism Society of America , said similar projects are popping up around the country .
Some people are designing adaptations for smart phones , Palm Pilots and other devices to fill the same need , he said .
Pension plans are touching a nerve .
Numerous people sent me links to Pension Calculus Draws New Scrutiny .
A California dustup over large pension payments is shining a spotlight on the practice of spiking -- increasing a salary just before retirement and boosting the lifelong payout .
Pete Nowicki had been making $ 186,000 shortly before he retired in January as chief for a fire department shared by the municipalities of Orinda and Moraga in Northern California .
Three days before Mr. Nowicki announced he was hanging up his hat , department trustees agreed to increase his salary largely by enabling him to sell unused vacation days and holidays .
That helped boost his annual pension to $ 241,000 .
Mr. Nowicki's situation is n't unique .
Contracts that permit a jump in salary just before retirement -- boosting the pension payout -- have been around for years .
But as tough times are putting more scrutiny on public pensions , Mr. Nowicki's case has sparked particular anger from colleagues and local residents .
Some recently demanded an explanation from the department trustees and others have lobbied the Orinda council to divert funds away from the fire department .
The practice is getting more attention amid growing concerns about the sustainability of guaranteed pension payouts for public employees after brutal market losses last year in public pension funds .
In addition to drawing his pension , Mr. Nowicki currently is working for the fire department as a consultant at an annual salary of $ 176,400 while the department searches for his replacement .
Huge Tax Hikes In Oregon
By signing three new tax bills , Oregon Gov .
Ted Kulongoski may have ensured that Oregon voters will face a January ballot measure that pits businesses against unions and consumers .
Kulongoski signed measures that will raise the state ’s corporate minimum tax , raise taxes on the state ’s wealthiest individuals and raise income taxes on businesses .
One bill increases the minimum tax businesses will pay annually from $ 10 to $ 150 .
About two - thirds of Oregon corporations currently pay the $ 10 minimum tax .
Another measure raises tax rates on businesses making more than $ 250,000 , from 6.6 percent to 7.9 percent .
The rate will last for two years , drop to 7.6 percent , then return to 6.6 percent for most corporations .
All money collected above the 6.6 percent rate will help fill Oregon ’s reserves beginning in 2013 .
The third bill raises personal income tax rates on Oregon ’s wealthiest individuals and joint tax - return filers for the next three years .
The current 9 percent tax rate will jump to 10.8 percent for individuals earning more than $ 125,000 and joint filers earning between $ 250,000 and $ 500,000 .
Those earning more than $ 500,000 will pay 11 percent .
“ We are asking corporations and the wealthiest Oregonians to pay their fair share to help protect the vital services we all depend on : education , health care and public safety , ” Kulongoski said .
A group calling itself Oregonians Against Job-Killing Taxes has hired a signature - gathering firm led by former Oregon Republican Party Chairman Kevin Mannix and tax activists Russ Walker and Ross Day .
The group wants to refer the measures to voters in January .
The deadline for 57,000 valid signatures is Sept. 25 .
Philadelphia Stops Paying Vendors
The government of the nation 's sixth most - populous city has stopped paying its vendors and suppliers , citing a cash crisis .
Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter on Friday blamed the drastic move on the failure of the Pennsylvania legislature to act on his request for authorization to raise the city sales tax and change the formula for the city 's contribution to its employee pension plan .
Mr. Nutter said these items are necessary to help close a projected city budget deficit of $ 1.4 billion over the next five years .
The city has about $ 197 million in funds , and with the suspension of vendor payments that money should last through the end of September .
The arrest of black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. , for “ disorderly conduct ” has set off a debate about racial profiling across America .
But for civil libertarians , the incident on a front porch in Cambridge , Mass. , raises a different issue : what they see as a subtle growth in police power since the war on drugs and 9/11 , exemplified in so - called “ attitude arrests ” – when someone challenges or fails to show deference to police authority .
In Mr. Gates 's case , police described his behavior as " tumultuous , " but he broke no discernible laws .
The Cambridge Police Department conceded as much when it dropped the charges , calling the incident " regrettable . "
The local police union backs the arresting officer , who said he did nothing wrong .
" What I see as more significant [ than race ] is the phenomenon of persons being arrested who challenge the authority of police , " says David Rudovsky , a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Law School in Philadelphia .
" It 's street punishment . "
Nearly all police jurisdictions have so - called " cover charges " such as " disturbing the peace " or " disorderly conduct , " which are intended to protect police officers from threat of violence .
The extent to which prosecutors and booking officers accept arrests under such charges – which are often defined vaguely – varies widely across the country .
Some civil liberties advocates say that these arrests can be subjective , and sometimes a response to back talk .
" To put cuffs on somebody is a grave matter , and it has to be for more than an officer just having a bad day , " says George Kirkham , a former cop who 's now a criminology professor at Florida State University in Tallahassee .
As employers and others increasingly use background checks , even a trivial arrest can be potentially damaging .
And subjective arrests of people who challenge an officer 's authority also undermine community trust needed to catch and investigate real criminals , says Radley Balko , a senior editor at Reason Magazine .
Police defenders counter that the citizenry needs to respect officers who , day in and day out , perform a dangerous job , with few accolades .
" The rule is , if a police officer stops you in a car or on the street , he 's the captain of the ship , and whatever he says goes , " says Jim Pasco , executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police 's legislative division .
" If you 've got something to address , do it later .
Do what he says , or else only bad things can happen . "
Some critics suggest the task of training officers has become more difficult since the war on drugs , the " militarization " of US police through the growing use of SWAT teams for even minor antidrug operations , and the increasing use of Taser guns .
They worry that officers lose what former Seattle police chief Norm Stamper calls " the emotional resilience to understand situations like this , and defuse them . "
" The fact is we have the First and Fourth Amendments that protects very basic rights of American citizens , and I think it 's critical that police officers understand that their work has to not only be skillful and competent , but constitutional , " says Mr. Stamper .
[ Editor 's note : The original version left out the opening paragraph . ]
He said " These are days of immense change for Helmand province .
We 're going down there , and we 're going to stay - that 's what is different this time . "
He added : " The intent is to go big , go strong and go fast , and by doing so we are going to save lives on both sides . "

At the height of the swine flu pandemic this spring , when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was recommending that schools with cases of H1N1 be closed for 14 days and Mexico was still on lockdown , the epidemiology community already suspected the world was n’t ending .
Why ?
The numbers came in : case fatality rate ( how many infected people are dying ) and replication rate ( how many others an infected person will transmit the illness to — “ R - zero , ” in disease - speak ) .
H1N1 had an RØ of about 1.3 , high enough to spread the virus but low enough that a strong isolation program could break its back .
Its case fatality rate was a wussy 1.9 percent in Mexico and 0.1 percent worldwide .
By comparison , the 1918 Spanish flu had an RØ of 2.7 and a case fatality rate of up to 5 percent , making it far more deadly .
A real apocalypse , like the killer flu in The Stand — Stephen King ’s opus of epidemiologic eschatology — would be off the chart , with an RØ of 5 to 6 and a case fatality rate of 99 percent .
So , do n’t panic … unless H1N1 surges this fall .

Why It Was Scary
Instead of opportunistically killing only children and the elderly , the 1918 Spanish flu killed many young adults .
As of May 27 , H1N1 was following the same pattern in Mexico .
That ’s a sign of a disease to fear .
Death and Illness
Showing illnesses and deaths on a linear graph makes clear the runaway exponential curve of Captain Trips and the simulated H1N1 , and the more limited growth of real - life swine flu .
Viruses spread exponentially as long as there is something to grow on ( i.e. non-immune carriers ) and a way to spread ( i.e. , no quarantine ) .
Spatial Distribution of Infected
This graphic is based on simulation performed with GLEaM ( Global Epidemic and Mobility modeler ) .
The simulation demonstrates the spread of this iteration of swine flu if it had the same characteristics as the 1918 version in terms of RØ and mortality .
( Compare it with the real - life H1N1 map from GLEaM . )
Ubiquitous air travel spread the simulated disease rapidly , leaving few places to hide — the flu will get to wherever people are .

The car may be rolled out in small to medium UK cities starting in 2010
The manufacturer of a hydrogen car unveiled in London on Tuesday will make its designs available online so the cars can be built and improved locally .
The Riversimple car can reach 80 km / hr ( 50 mph ) with a range of 322 km ( 200 miles ) .
Fuel consumption is claimed to be equivalent to 300 miles per gallon .
The cars will be leased with fuel and repair costs included , at an estimated £ 200 ( $ 315 ) per month .
The company hopes to have the vehicles in production by 2013 .
Next year , it aims to release 10 prototypes in a UK city which has yet to be confirmed .
Riversimple has in partnership with gas supply company BOC to install hydrogen stations for the cars in the city where the prototypes are launched .
' Open source ' model
The car itself is an amalgam of high - efficiency approaches in automotive design .
Its four motors are powered by a fuel cell rated at just 6 kW , in contrast to current designs that are all in excess of 85 kW - required because the acceleration from a standing start requires a great deal of power .
Riversimple 's solution is to power the car also from so - called " ultracapacitors " , which store large amounts of electric charge and , crucially , can release that charge nearly instantly to provide the power needed to accelerate from rest .
The ultracapacitors are charged as the vehicle brakes to a halt , converting the energy of the moving car into stored energy .
Under the bonnet is a comparatively tiny fuel cell Without a combustion engine , gearbox , or transmission , and with a shell made of carbon fibre composites , it weighs 350 kg .
The company claims that it is closer to market than any of its start - up competitors , but what sets them apart is an unusual business model .
" Riversimple has effectively rethought the whole of what in the business school world we call the ' value chain ' of the auto industry , " said John Constable , chair of the Riversimple project .
The company asserts that in the leasing model , the vested interest for the manufacturer is in producing long - lasting , fuel - efficient , high - quality products , since it bears the cost of both hydrogen and repairs .
Its partnership with BOC is designed to resolve the chicken - and - egg question of who would build the infrastructure required to refuel hydrogen cars when there are none on the road .
Meanwhile , would - be hydrogen car buyers are concerned about the dearth of refuelling stations .
" You can incrementally put in a template package of one refuellling point and 50 cars in different cities , and each city one by one can build an urban hydrogen infrastructure , and that incrementally builds a nationwide infrastructure , " said Hugo Spowers , the former race car designer who conceived the Riversimple idea in 1999 .
The company will distribute the engineering designs to the 40 Fires foundation , a not - for - profit organisation that will make the designs " open source " .
The idea , they say , is to allow local manufacturing in small plants .
This stands in contrast to the " economies of scale " that drive current plants to huge sizes and workforces .
In addition , designs can be adjusted for local markets , using locally sourced parts or materials .
The agreement will be such that if the designs are improved by a local manufacturer , those improvements will be sent back , so that what the company refers to as its " network of manufacturers " can contribute to the overall development of the product line .

A cat which disappeared from its home in Cornwall turned up safe and well - on the set of Question Time .
Tango , a tom , had crept into Treviglas Community College 's hall in Newquay where BBC1's political discussion programme was being filmed last week .
He padded out from under a table where David Dimbleby was chairing political discussions with a panel of guests .
The first owner Jackie Ellery knew of his surprise appearance was when a friend rang to say she had spotted him .
' Into mischief '
But she was not the only person to notice the furtive feline - panel guest Julia Goldsworthy , Lib Dem MP for Falmouth and Camborne , had also clocked him , as had many of the studio audience who erupted into laughter at his nonchalant air .
However , although his owner had been watching the programme in her living room , she missed his TV debut .
" I was watching Question Time but I did n't notice him , " said Mrs Ellery , who works at the college as a dinner lady and lives next door to it .
" Then my friend rang up and said : ' Your cat 's just been on the telly ' .

" It did n't surprise me in a way because he 's always in the school and always wandering about .
" He 's always been into mischief and we live right next to the school so this is his playground - all the kids love him .
" It did n't faze him when he walked through with all those people .
" He actually got taken out five times but he still managed to get onto the television . "
Although his TV debut may have been fleeting , it seems that Tango 's screen appearance will go down as one of the more memorable events to happen on the show .
Gill Penlington , Question Time 's editor , said : " Tango is certainly the most unusual guest we 've had in Question Time 's history . "

http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif
Now found in more places than the music store .
Advertisement :
A leitmotif ( pronounced " Light - motif " ) is a recurring piece of music ( or at least melody ) that represents a character , action , or theme .
This is a well - established technique used in almost every medium that involves music and story .
The leitmotif technique was invented ( or at least codified ) by opera composer Richard Wagner in the second half of the 19th Century .
In his later operas , not only would every character have his / her own musical theme , but so did many objects , places , and even abstract ideas .
Leitmotifs are often named simply " < character > 's Theme " or " < noun > Motif . " note
Though the name alone is not enough to establish it as a motif .
They often make up the bulk of movie and anime soundtracks , and a fair chunk of video game soundtracks as well .
This is different from an Image Song in that Image Songs exist only outside of the scope of the show that produced them .
Compare with " I Am " Song .

If a character with a distinctive - sounding Leitmotif is in a production or episode with No Fourth Wall ( or at least some Medium Awareness ) , one of his or her fellows may comment on how loud and annoying their theme music is .
( To which the character will almost always reply , " What theme music ? " )
Can become a Theme Song Reveal for audiences if ( or after ) they recognize the theme .
The character might also have their leitmotif as their own ringtone , for a subtler joke ; see also Left the Background Music On .
Note that if a character 's leitmotif starts playing during an action scene , start running .
Can become a Recurring Riff when used throughout a long - running series .
Bootstrapped Leitmotif is such a variation , where a song that was n't originally intended as a Leitmotif later becomes one .
One especially common leitmotif in video games is the Battle Theme Music , associated with monster battles in general .
( Which also happen a lot . )
If a specific character 's Battle Theme Music is actually a remix of their Leitmotif , it may be a Boss Remix .

Israel Turns on Itself
On their own terms , the recent riots in Jerusalem make no sense .
Doctors discover that a woman from a small , anti-Zionist ultra-Orthodox sect , probably suffering from Münchausen by proxy syndrome , has been starving her 3 - year - old , who has dwindled down to an emaciated 15 pounds .
Social workers scoop up the kid and place him in intensive care at Hadassah hospital , and police scoop up the mother and put her in jail .
And then all hell breaks loose .
A rabbi of the sect declares the event a blood libel , comparing the police to Cossacks .
Immediately , young men in black robes and fur hats take to the streets , setting bus stops and dumpsters ablaze , pelting police with stones , and decrying the doctors of Hadassah as latter - day Josef Mengeles .
Someone sets aflame the government welfare and social services building in the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Me’ah Shearim ; others enter the building , smashing computer screens as they go .
In the first three days after the toddler is taken for treatment , dozens more are sent to the hospital with wounds from stones and broken glass , and hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of city property are burned or smashed .
In response , the new , secular mayor of Jerusalem , Nir Barkat , announces that he will suspend all social services to ultra - orthodox neighborhoods that , being among the poorest in the city , rely on them as a bulwark against Third World kinds of hunger and homelessness .
The secular press — Ha’aretz , Yediot Ahronoth , and Ma’ariv — prints op - eds portraying the ultra - orthodox as child - abusing hooligans .
Yediot devotes pages to the story , adding as a sidebar an item about a delegation of ultra-orthodox Jews from the United States visiting Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh , offering him moral and political support in his fight against the Zionists .
None of this adds up .
Tragedies of mental illness and child abuse are everywhere , and it ’s not surprising — not to social workers and not to rabbis — to find a case of it among the ultra-Orthodox .
There ’s no reason to expect it to become a referendum on religious - secular relations in Israel ’s capital .
Nor , really , is there any reason to expect that ultra-Orthodox street violence would be met by collective punishment , answering thugs by threatening entire neighborhoods with penury .
Nor is there any reason to link the riots to the widespread secular suspicion that underneath all the ultra-Orthodox wool and fur are traitors , that the black clothes cover but fail to hide jet - black hearts .
For these events to make any sense , one must put them into broader context .
Tensions between ultra-Orthodox and secular Jews in Jerusalem have been mounting for months .
November ’s municipal election replaced the affable ultra-Orthodox mayor , Uri Lupolianski , with Barkat , a combative , secular high - tech millionaire .
In the spring , Barkat ordered that a municipal parking lot not far from the Old City be opened for business on Saturday , the Jewish Sabbath , inflaming some ultra-Orthodox leaders who saw it as a violation of the “ status quo , ” or long - standing modus vivendi concerning religious observance in the city .
Protests , sometimes more peaceful , sometimes less , have materialized each Saturday since , as the new mayor - tried to negotiate a compromise involving opening a different lot , farther from the likely path of any ultra-Orthodox Jews .
Then in June , Jerusalem hosted its largest ever gay pride march , which further angered rabbis and their flocks .
Seen against this backdrop , last week ’s riots were about much more than one case of putative child abuse ; the starved kid , it becomes clear , only turned a longer - simmering potion of frustration and anger into a boiling rage .
But this broader view still leaves the basic question unanswered .
None of what ’s happened in Jerusalem since November threatens the lifestyle of the city ’s ultra-Orthodox Jews or diminishes their autonomy .
Speak to any ultra-Orthodox politician in Jerusalem , and he ’ll tell you that the last election was a fluke — the result of disharmony among ultra-Orthodox factions , each straining for a bigger piece of what they all see as a bigger - than - ever pie , rather than the result of increased secular power in the city — and that it is unlikely ever to repeat itself .
For ultra-Orthodox politicians , as for their constituents , Barkat is an interregnum between God-fearing administrations .
Most political scientists agree , basing their views on a cold analysis of population figures :
Thanks to their high birthrates and to a slow but steady secular exodus from the city over the past decade , the ultra-Orthodox are well on their way to being the majority of the city ’s voters .
As a product of this trend , the “ status quo , ” which has actually never been static , has over the past years been shifting slowly toward the ultra-Orthodox , who now have greater independence in school curricula , more control of locally allocated funds , and greater say in every aspect of city government , than they could have imagined a decade ago .
More immediately , whether the parking garage is open or closed has almost no practical affect on ultra-Orthodox life in Jerusalem .
The gay pride march has less impact still , throwing into relief the fact that homosexuality has a public presence in the city for only a single day each year , in stark contrast to Tel Aviv , with its openly gay politicians , clubs , magazines , and celebrities .
The significance of the last few months ’ conflicts is almost entirely symbolic .
So what makes these symbols so important ?
To understand that , one has to see the recent riots in a still broader context .
Israel ’s ultra-Orthodox and secular leaders alike broadcast animal assurance : a full , tempered confidence that their way of seeing the world is singular in its virtue .
But behind the bluster , both communities feel themselves as embattled and endangered .
Ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel are collapsing under the weight of their successes .
Dismissed by Israel ’s founding generations as the last vestiges of a dying way of life , the ultra-Orthodox have grown enormously in numbers and in political power in Israel over the 61 years since the state was established .
They have negotiated for themselves broad exemption from army service , mandatory for everyone else , and a series of entitlements that allow most ultra-Orthodox men to receive a small stipend for studying in religious academies for as long as they wish to do so .
As a result , Israeli ultra-Orthodox males probably spend more time in formal study than any other class of humans ever has in the history of the planet .
But small stipends do not easily support large families , and over time the ultra-Orthodox have become Israel ’s economic underclass , as each generation exceeds the poverty of the last .
Families of a dozen live in 600 - square - foot apartments , stretching their government handouts with canned goods from charitable food pantries .
They have become perpetual objects of scorn for secular Israelis , who resent bankrolling their indolence .
For Israel ’s ultra-Orthodox , the best of times are the worst of times .
Torah study thrives and children go to school in thrice - patched pants with an ache in their belly .
Something has to give .
Secular Israelis , for their part , live in perpetual dismay over the fact that their successes have never led them to where they expected to arrive .
Their parents ’ generation , and that of their parents , expected to be vindicated , that the value and truth of the ideology they embraced would be confirmed by the society they built .
After Zionists produced the Good Society , they reasoned , no one could doubt that Zionism itself is a social good .
And for some time , it seemed that this formula had proven itself to be Israel ’s self - image , broadly , as the country passed through two phases .
In the first phase , Israel saw itself as a model of state - building , the only country in the world in which voluntarist socialist communities — kibbutzim — thrived , producing not only a plurality of the country ’s food , but providing in extraordinary numbers charismatic leaders in government and the army .
Even beyond the green lawns and gates of the kibbutzim ( which accounted , after all , for only a bit over 3 percent of the country ’s population ) , economists determined that Israel was the country with the smallest “ socioeconomic gap ” in the world ; the difference in income between the richest and poorest 10 percent was smaller than anywhere else .
Israel had undertaken and succeeded in massive development projects .
The country had absorbed several times its population in immigrants , many poor , and many refugees arriving from dreadful circumstances .
Israel reversed the regional trend towards desertification , reclaiming tens of thousands of acres of arid land for productive agriculture .
Israelis became agricultural advisors through much of Africa , helping to spark a short - lived but significant increase in African agricultural production .
And of course , Israel had assembled an army and airforce recognized for its effectiveness and creativity .
Generals like Moshe Dayan and Yitzhak Rabin became international celebrities and found themselves dining at the tables of princes and starlets .
No one holds a heroic view of Israel anymore , not abroad and not here .
Today ’s kibbutzim are not a source of national pride .
In the past decade , dozens of them have “ privatized , ” dividing up what was common property ( it took a Supreme Court ruling to stop kibbutzim from selling to developers valuable government - owned lands that had been lent to them for agriculture ) .
Israel ’s social gap is now considered among the greatest in the developed world .
The most recent wave of immigrants , from the former Soviet Union , are largely disgruntled , and surveys suggest that a large percentage of them are not even Jews .
Several of Israel ’s large development projects have caused great harm to the local environment .
Israelis are unwelcome in African capitals .
They are mostly unwelcome anywhere .
And most important of all , Israel ’s military excellence has been tested in a 20 - year misadventure occupying southern Lebanon , and in laboriously maintaining the peace in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
The disastrous last war in Lebanon , and the wrenching recent war in Gaza , won support by most Israelis , and censure by some , but together they have left little doubt that the country ’s army is not heroic in the sense that it once was .
For all these reasons , to be a secular Israeli in 2009 is a demoralizing and demoralized affair .
We are tired : tired of the Palestinians , tired of the bombs , tired of U.N. and EU condemnations , tired of having so much of our daily wages taxed to buy guns and missiles , tired of the army reserves , tired of being hated , tired of going to bed and waking up to reports of kids — Jewish kids , Palestinian kids — watching their parents die or dying in their parents ’ arms .
We are tired of our lives and tired of ourselves .
For two communities in crisis , riots like those that set Jerusalem aflame last week are a welcome relief .
Many ultra-Orthodox find in their city ’s secular government — its social services , police , and mayor — an external source of their malaise .
Locating the cause of their suffering outside their own unsustainable way of life , and attributing it to the malevolence of Jewish Cossacks or Jewish Nazis , ultra-Orthodox leaders defer reflection about the real causes of their distress .
Something similar accounts for the harsh and totalizing reaction that so many secular Israelis have had to the past week ’s events , finding all ultra-Orthodox guilty , first of heartless acceptance of child abuse , and then of wild hooliganism , adding up to a cultural identity of primitive and traitorous barbarism .
For such a view of the ultra-Orthodox does wonders for the self - image of secular Israelis .
Now more than before , we need the ultra-Orthodox torching bus shelters and shattering computers .
These sorts of ultra-Orthodox , and they alone , serve as a token of the continued relevance of the secular Zionist program , at a time when this claim to relevance is no longer evident , certainly in Europe and the United States , but also increasingly within the borders of Israel itself .
Nir Barkat , a mayor with little charisma who has failed to distinguish himself in his first year in office , appears principled and virtuous only when he is staring down a rabble of rabbis .
The riots will pass .
As I write , the child remains under constant attention at Hadassah hospital , where he has gained one third again of his body weight .
Under court order , his mother was released from jail to house arrest , and will receive immediate psychiatric care .
Both will drop from the headlines .
Still , it wo n’t be long before new headlines come , in the ultra-Orthodox press screaming of cruel and godless authorities goosestepping into Meah Shearim to brutishly break up yiddershe families , and in the secular press of religious zombies slavishly following their rabbis ’ orders to torture their kids into mindless obedience .
These headlines will come , and rocks will be thrown and trash bins will be set ablaze , because ultra-Orthodox and secular Israelis are locked in a macabre pas de deux that serves each group as it tries to negotiate its own depressing reality .
For ultra-Orthodox and secular Israelis , decrying loudly the vicious vice of the other is one of the few ways each can still locate virtue in themselves .
The Bare - faced Bulbul , a new species discovered in Laos , is the only known bald songbird in mainland Asia .
Scientists have discovered a rare new bird species with a bald head .
The creature , dubbed the bare - faced bulbul , was found in Laos , and is the only known bald songbird in mainland Asia .
It 's also the first time in over 100 years that a new Asian species of bulbul bird has been uncovered .
" To find a new bird species is very rare these days , " said Peter Clyne , assistant director for Asia Programs at the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York .
" It 's not like we 're finding new species of birds every year .
This is certainly a highly newsworthy event . "
The chrome - domed songbird was discovered by Wildlife Conservation Society scientists Will Duckworth and Rob Timmins and Iain Woxvold of the University of Melbourne as part of a project funded by a mining company , Minerals and Metals Group , that operates in the region .
The bare - faced bulbul lives in the sparse trees and sun-bleached karst limestone of the Laos lowlands .
" Its apparent restriction to rather inhospitable habitat helps to explain why such an extraordinary bird with conspicuous habits and a distinctive call has remained unnoticed for so long , " Woxvold said .
About the size of a thrush , the new bird has olive green feathers on its back and a light - colored breast .
Its large dark eyes dominate its bald pink face .
" Whenever you come across a bird that 's bald , it 's a prominent characteristic , " Clyne told LiveScience .
" Usually , but not always , it 's thought to play some kind of a role in communication between the sexes . "
The researchers describe the bird 's call as a " series of whistled , dry bubbling notes . "
The researchers describe the new species , whose official name is Pycnonotus hualon , in the latest issue of the Oriental Bird Club 's scientific journal Forktail .
For a while it looked like Hurricane Katrina would accomplish what the NAACP never could : reviving civil rights liberalism as a major force in American politics .
There it was for the whole world to see : the United States was two nations , one rich , one poor and largely black , one driving away in the family SUV to sleep in the snug guest rooms of suburban friends and relatives , the other sunk in the fetid misery of the Superdome .
Newsweek , echoing Michael Harrington ’s 1962 landmark book that ignited the War on Poverty , titled its Katrina coverage “ The Other America ” and warned the nation not to return to the “ old evasions , hypocrisies , and not - so - benign neglect ” of the “ problems of poverty , race , and class . ”
Though that liberalism revival only lasted for about five minutes , the post - Katrina insight was correct .
There are millions of poor Americans , living not just in down - on - your - luck hardship but in entrenched , multigenerational poverty .
There is growing inequality between the haves and the have - nots .
And there are reasons to worry whether the American dream is within the reach of all .
But what two - America talk does n’t get is just how much these ominous trends are entangled with the collapse of the nuclear family .
While Americans have been squabbling about gay marriage , they have managed to miss the real marriage - and - social - justice issue , one that affects far more people and threatens to undermine the American project .
We are now a nation of separate and unequal families not only living separate and unequal lives but , more worrisome , destined for separate and unequal futures .
Two - America Jeremiahs usually nod at the single - parent family as a piece of the inequality story , but quickly change the subject to describe — accurately , as far as it goes — an economy that has implacably squeezed out manufacturing jobs , reduced wages for the low - skilled , and made a wallet - busting college education crucial to a middle - class future .
But one ca n’t disentangle the economic from the family piece .
Given that families socialize children for success — or not — and given how marriage orders lives , they are the same problem .
Separate and unequal families produce separate and unequal economic fates .
Most people understand what happened to the American family over the last half - century along these lines : the birth control pill begat the sexual and feminist revolutions of the 1960s , which begat the decline of the traditional nuclear family , which in turn introduced the country to a major new demographic : the single mother .
Divorce became as ubiquitous as the automobile ; half of all marriages , we are often reminded , will end in family court .
Growing financial independence and changing mores not only gave women the freedom to divorce in lemming - like numbers ; it also allowed them to dispense with marriage altogether and have children , Murphy Brown–style , on their own .
( This is leaving aside inner-city teenage mothers , whom just about everyone sees as an entirely different and more troubling category . )
Today , we frequently hear , a third of all children are born to unmarried women .
To put it a little differently , after the 1960s women no longer felt compelled to follow the life course charted in a once - popular childhood rhyme — first comes love , then marriage , then the baby carriage .
Sure , some people got married , had kids , and stayed married for life , but the hegemony of Ozzie and his brood was past .
Alternative families are just the way things are ; for better or for worse , in a free society people get to choose their own “ lifestyles ” - bringing their children along for the ride - and they are doing so not just in the United States but all over the Western world .
That picture turns out to be as equivocal as an Escher lithograph , however .
As the massive social upheaval following the 1960s — what Francis Fukuyama has termed “ the Great Disruption ” — has settled into the new normal , social scientists are finding out that when it comes to the family , America really has become two nations .
The old - fashioned married - couple - with - children model is doing quite well among college - educated women .
It is primarily among lower - income women with only a high school education that it is in poor health .
This fact may not conform to the view from Hollywood ; movies from Kramer vs. Kramer to The Ice Storm to the recent The Squid and the Whale , not to mention unmarried celebrity moms like Goldie Hawn and moms - to - be like Katie Holmes , have helped reinforce the perception that elite women snubbing a conformist patriarchy were the vanguard of a vast social change .
Now it ’s pretty clear that this is a myth saying more about La-La Land than the reality of American family breakdown .
The most important recent analysis of that reality is “ The Uneven Spread of Single - Parent Families , ” a 2004 paper by Harvard ’s David Ellwood and Christopher Jencks .
The Kennedy School profs divide American mothers into three categories by education level : women with a college degree or higher ; women with a high school diploma ( including those with some college , whose trends look very similar to those with high school alone ) ; and women who never graduated high school .
The paper ’s findings are worth pondering in some detail .
Forty - five years ago , there was only a small difference in the way American women went about the whole marriage - and - children question ; just about everyone , from a Smith grad living in New Canaan , Connecticut , to a high school dropout in Appalachia , first tied the knot and only then delivered the bouncing bundle of joy .
As of 1960 , the percentage of women with either a college or high school diploma who had children without first getting married was so low that you ’d need a magnifying glass to find it on a graph ; even the percentage of high school dropouts who were never - married mothers barely hit 1 percent .
Moreover , after getting married and having a baby , almost all women stayed married .
A little under 5 percent of mothers in the top third of the education distribution and about 6 percent of the middle group were either divorced or separated ( though these figures do n’t include divorced - and - then - remarried mothers ) .
And while marital breakup was higher among mothers who were high school dropouts , their divorce rate was still only a modest 8 percent or so .
That all changed in the decades following the 1960s , when , as everyone who was alive at the time remembers , the American family seemed on the verge of self - immolation .
For women , marriage and children no longer seemed part of the same story line .
Instead of staying married for the kids , mothers at every education level joined the national divorce binge .
By 1980 , the percentage of divorced college - educated mothers more than doubled , to 12 percent — about the same percentage as divorced mothers with a high school diploma or with some college .
For high school dropout mothers , the percentage increased to 15 percent .
An increasing number of women had children without getting married at all .
So far the story conforms to general theory .
But around 1980 , the family - forming habits of college grads and uneducated women went their separate ways .
For the next decade the proportion of college - educated moms filing for divorce stopped increasing , and by 1990 it actually starting going down .
This was not the case for the least educated mothers , who continued on a divorce spree for another ten years .
It was only in 1990 that their increase in divorce also started to slow and by 2000 to decline , though it was too late to close the considerable gap between them and their more privileged sisters .
Far more dramatic were the divergent trends in what was still known at the time as illegitimacy .
Yes , out - of - wedlock childbearing among women with college diplomas tripled , but because their numbers started at Virtually Nonexistent in 1960 ( a fraction of 1 percent ) , they only moved up to Minuscule in 1980 ( a little under 3 percent of mothers in the top third of education distribution ) to end up at a Rare 4 percent .
Things were radically different for mothers in the lower two educational levels .
They decided that marriage and children were two entirely unconnected life experiences .
That decline in their divorce rate after 1990 ?
Well , it turns out the reason for it was n’t that these women had thought better of putting their children through a parental breakup , as many of their more educated sisters had ; it was that they were n’t getting married in the first place .
Throughout the 1980s and nineties , the out - of - wedlock birthrate soared to about 15 percent among mothers with less than a high school education and 10 percent of those with a high school diploma or with some college .
Many people assume that these low - income never - married mothers are teen mothers , but teens are only a subset of unmarried mothers , and a rather small one in recent years .
Yes , the U.S. continues to be the teen - mommy capital of the Western world , with 4 percent of teen girls having babies , a rate considerably higher than Europe’s .
But that rate is almost one - third lower than it was in 1991 , and according to up - to - the - minute figures from the National Center for Health Statistics , teens account for only about a quarter of unwed births — compared with half in 1970 .
Today 55 percent of unmarried births are to women between 20 and 24 ; another 28 percent are to 25 - to 29 - year - olds .
These days , it is largely low - income twentysomethings who are having a baby without a wedding ring .
The good news is that single mothers are not as likely to be 15 ; the bad news is that there is now considerable evidence to suggest that , while their prospects may be a little better than their teenage sisters ’ would be , they are not dramatically so .
Race has also added to misperceptions about single mothers .
It ’s easy to see why , with close to 70 percent of black children born to single mothers today — including educated mothers — compared with 25 percent of non-black kids .
But blacks make up only 12 percent of the country ’s population , and black children account for only one - third of the nation ’s out - of - wedlock kids .
Tune out the static from teen pregnancy , race , and Murphy Brown , then , and the big news comes into focus : starting in 1980 , Americans began to experience a widening Marriage Gap that has reached dangerous proportions .
As of 2000 , only about 10 percent of mothers with 16 or more years of education — that is , with a college degree or higher — were living without husbands .
Compare that with 36 percent of mothers who have between nine and 14 years of education .
All the statistics about marriage so often rehashed in magazine and newspaper articles hide a startling truth .
Yes , 33 percent of children are born to single mothers ; in 2004 , according to the National Center for Health Statistics , that amounted to 1.5 million children , the highest number ever .
But the vast majority of those children are going home from the maternity wards to low - rent apartments .
Yes , experts predict that about 40 to 50 percent of marriages will break up .
But most of those divorces will involve women who have always shopped at Wal - Mart .
“ [ T ] he rise in single - parent families is concentrated among blacks and among the less educated , ” summarize Ellwood and Jencks .
“ It hardly occurred at all among women with a college degree . ”
When Americans began their family revolution four decades ago , they did n’t tend to talk very much about its effect on children .
That oversight now haunts the country , as it becomes increasingly clear that the Marriage Gap results in a yawning social divide .
If you want to discuss why childhood poverty numbers have remained stubbornly high through the years that the nation was aggressively trying to lower them , begin with the Marriage Gap .
Thirty - six percent of female - headed families are below the poverty line .
Compare that with the 6 percent of married - couple families in poverty — a good portion of whom are recent , low - skilled immigrants , whose poverty , if history is any guide , is temporary .
The same goes if you want to analyze the inequality problem — start with the Marriage Gap .
Virtually all — 92 percent — of children whose families make over $ 75,000 are living with both parents .
On the other end of the income scale , the situation is reversed : only about 20 percent of kids in families earning under $ 15,000 live with both parents .
Princeton sociologist Sara McLanahan , co-author of the breakthrough book Growing Up With a Single Parent , has fleshed out the implications of the Marriage Gap for children in an important paper in Demography — and they ’re not pretty .
McLanahan observes that , after 1970 , women at all income levels began to marry at older ages , and the average age of first marriage moved into the mid-twenties .
But where mothers at the top of the income scale also put off having children until they were married , spending their years before marriage getting degrees or working , those at the bottom did neither .
The results radically split the experiences of children .
Children in the top quartile now have mothers who not only are likely to be married , but also are older , more mature , better educated , and nearly three times as likely to be employed ( whether full - or part - time ) as are mothers of children in the bottom quartile .
And not only do top - quartile children have what are likely to be more effective mothers ; they also get the benefit of more time and money from their live - in fathers .
For children born at the bottom of the income scale , the situation is the reverse .
They face a decrease in what McLanahan terms “ resources ” : their mothers are younger , less stable , less educated , and , of course , have less money .
Adding to their woes , those children are n’t getting much ( or any ) financial support and time from their fathers .
Surprisingly , McLanahan finds that in Europe , too — where welfare supports for “ lone parents , ” as they are known in Britain , are much higher than in the United States — single mothers are still more likely to be poor and less educated .
As in the United States , so in Europe and , no doubt , the rest of the world : children in single - parent families are getting less of just about everything that we know helps to lead to successful adulthood .
All this makes depressing sense , but when you think about it , the Marriage Gap itself presents a puzzle .
Why would women working for a pittance at the supermarket cash registers decide to have children without getting married , while women writing briefs at Debevoise & Plimpton , who could easily afford to go it alone , insist on finding husbands before they start families ?
For a long time , social scientists assumed , reasonably enough , that economic self - sufficiency would lead more women to opt for single motherhood .
And to listen to the drone of complaint about men around water coolers , in Internet chat rooms , on the Oxygen Network , and in Maureen Dowdworld , there would seem to be plenty of potential recruits for Murphy Browndom .
Certainly when they talk to pollsters , women say that they do n’t think there ’s anything wrong with having a baby without a husband .
Yet the women who are forgoing husbands are precisely the ones who can least afford to do so .
The conventional answer to the puzzle is this : in an economy marked by manufacturing decline , especially in cities , too many of the potential husbands for low - income women are either flipping burgers , unemployed , or in jail — in other words , poor marriage material .
But three facts raise doubts about this theory .
One , it ’s not just unemployed men or McDonald ’s cooks who have become marriage - avoidant ; working - class men with decent jobs are also shying from the altar .
Two , cohabitation among low - income couples has been increasing ; about 40 percent of all out - of - wedlock babies today are born to cohabiting parents .
Why would there be a dearth of marriageable men , when there appear to be plenty of cohabitable fathers ?
And three , marriage improves the economic situation of low - income women , even if their husbands are only deliverymen or janitors .
In a large and highly regarded study , the Urban Institute ’s Robert Lerman concluded that married , low - income , low - educated women enjoyed significantly higher living standards than comparable single mothers .
Joe Sixpack may not be Mr. Darcy , but financially , at any rate , he ’s a lot better than no husband at all .
Still , whatever the arguments against it , the no-marriageable - men theory is entrenched in policy circles and in the academy and is unlikely to go anywhere soon , so let ’s try another approach to the Marriage Gap conundrum .
Instead of asking why poor and near - poor women have stopped marrying before having children , let ’s think instead about why educated women continue to do so — even though , in order to be accepted in polite company or to put food on the table , they do n’t need to .
One possible answer is especially pertinent to the Marriage Gap : educated women know that they ’d better marry if they want their children to succeed academically , which increasingly is critical to succeeding in the labor market .
The New Economy may have made single motherhood a workable arrangement for high - earning mothers in purely economic terms , but it made a husband a must - have in terms of child rearing .
No one understands better than an Amherst or Stanford B.A. that her children will have to go to college one day — the bigger the college name , the better — if they are to keep their middle - class status .
These women also understand how to get their kids college - bound .
Educated , middle - class mothers tend to be dedicated to what I have called The Mission , the careful nurturing of their children ’s cognitive , emotional , and social development , which , if all goes according to plan , will lead to the honor roll and a spot on the high school debate team , which will in turn lead to a good college , then perhaps a graduate or professional degree , which will all lead eventually to a fulfilling career , a big house in a posh suburb , and a sense of meaningful accomplishment .
It ’s common sense , backed up by plenty of research , that you ’ll have a better chance of fully “ developing ” your children — that is , of fulfilling The Mission — if you have a husband around .
Children of single mothers have lower grades and educational attainment than kids who grow up with married parents , even after controlling for race , family background , and IQ .
Children of divorce are also less likely to graduate and attend college , and when they do go for a B.A. , they tend to go to less elite schools .
Cornell professor Jennifer Gerner was baffled some years ago when she noticed that only about 10 percent of her students came from divorced families .
She and her colleague Dean Lillard examined the records of students at the nation ’s top 50 schools and , much to their surprise , found a similar pattern .
Children who did not grow up with their two biological parents , they concluded when they published their findings , were only half as likely to go to a selective college .
As adults , they also earned less and had lower occupational status .
To repeat the question :
Why do educated women marry before they have children ?
Because , like high - status women since status began , they are preparing their offspring to carry on their way of life .
Marriage radically increases their chances of doing that .
This all points to a deeply worrying conclusion : the Marriage Gap — and the inequality to which it is tied — is self - perpetuating .
A low - income single mother , unprepared to carry out The Mission , is more likely to raise children who will become low - income single parents , who will pass that legacy on to their children , and so on down the line .
Married parents are more likely to be visiting their married children and their grandchildren in their comfortable suburban homes , and those married children will in turn be sending their offspring off to good colleges , superior jobs , and wedding parties .
Instead of an opportunity - rich country for all , the Marriage Gap threatens us with a rigid caste society .
So what is it about the nuclear family that makes it work so well for children decades after Americans have declared it optional ?
The economists and sociologists who study these things often answer that question with some variation of what might be called the strength - in - numbers theory .
Kids with two parents are more likely to have two incomes cushioning them during their developing years .
More money means more stability , less stress , better day care and health care , more books , more travel , and , most of all , a home in a good school district — all of which lead to educational and , eventually , workplace success .
A husband and wife can support each other if one is laid off or if the other wants retraining or more education .
They can take turns caring for the children .
Or if they can afford to , they can specialize : the woman ( yes , it ’s still almost always the woman ) can take over as homework helper and soccer - team and church - group chauffeur , while the man earns a salary .
According to the strength - in - numbers theory , then , two parents are better than one much the way two hands are better than one : they can accomplish more .
But this theory finally does n’t explain all that much .
If two parents are what make a difference , then why , when a divorced mother remarries , do her children ’s outcomes resemble those of children from single - parent homes more than they do those from intact families ?
Why do they have , on average , lower school grades , more behavior problems , and lower levels of psychological well - being — even when a stepparent improves their economic standard of living ?
You could posit that children in stepfamilies may well have suffered through their parents ’ divorce or have had a difficult spell in a single - parent home .
But what , then , do we make of cohabiting parents ?
Two cohabiting parents also provide few of the benefits for kids that married couples do .
The Urban Institute ’s Robert Lerman has found that even when cohabiters resemble married couples in terms of education , number of children , and income , they experience more material hardship — things like an empty pantry or no phone or an electricity shutoff — and get less help from extended families when they do .
And poverty rates of cohabiting - couple parents are double those of married couples .
( Lerman ’s study controls for education , immigration status , and race . )
Others take an alternative approach to the question of why children growing up with their own two married parents do better than children growing up without their fathers .
It ’s not marriage that makes the difference for kids , they argue ; it ’s the kind of people who marry .
Mothers who marry and stay married already have the psychological endowment that makes them both more effective partners and more competent parents .
After all , we ’ve already seen that married mothers are more likely to be educated and working than single mothers ; it makes sense that whatever abilities allowed them to write their Economics 101 papers or impress a prospective boss or husband also make them successful wives and mothers .
Many low - income mothers may not have the skills — or , some would argue , the IQ — that would get them their B.A. or a good job , and this lack makes them less likely both to marry or stay married and to raise successful children .
“ Parents with limited cultural and material resources are unlikely to remain together in a stable marriage , ” Frank Furstenberg , a famed family researcher , wrote in Dissent last summer .
“ Because the possession of such psychological , human and material capital is highly related to marital stability , it is easy to confuse the effects of stable marriage with the effects of competent parenting . ”
The problem with this theory is that it merely tiptoes up to the obvious .
There is something fundamentally different about low - income single mothers and their educated married sisters .
But a key part of that difference is that educated women still believe in marriage as an institution for raising children .
What is missing in all the ocean of research related to the Marriage Gap is any recognition that this assumption is itself an invaluable piece of cultural and psychological capital — and not just because it makes it more likely that children will grow up with a dad in the house .
As society ’s bulwark social institution , traditional marriage — that is , childbearing within marriage — orders social life in ways that we only dimly understand .
For one thing , women who grow up in a marriage - before - children culture organize their lives around a meaningful and beneficial life script .
Traditional marriage gives young people a map of life that takes them step by step from childhood to adolescence to college or other work training — which might well include postgraduate education — to the workplace , to marriage , and only then to childbearing .
A marriage orientation also requires a young woman to consider the question of what man will become her husband and the father of her children as a major , if not the major , decision of her life .
In other words , a marriage orientation demands that a woman keep her eye on the future , that she go through life with deliberation , and that she use self - discipline — especially when it comes to sex : bourgeois women still consider premature pregnancy a disaster .
In short , a marriage orientation — not just marriage itself — is part and parcel of her bourgeois ambition .
When Americans announced that marriage before childbearing was optional , low - income women did n’t merely lose a steadfast partner , a second income , or a trusted babysitter , as the strength - in - numbers theory would have it .
They lost a traditional arrangement that reinforced precisely the qualities that they - and their men ; let ’s not forget the men !
— needed for upward mobility , qualities all the more important in a tough new knowledge economy .
The timing could hardly have been worse .
At a time when education was becoming crucial to middle - class status , the disadvantaged lost a reliable life script , a way of organizing their early lives that would prize education and culminate in childbearing only after job training and marriage .
They lost one of their few institutional supports for planning ahead and taking control of their lives .
Worst of all , when Americans made marriage optional , low - income women lost a culture that told them the truth about what was best for their children .
A number of researchers argue that , in fact , low - income women really do want to marry .
They have “ white picket dreams , ” say Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas in Promises I Can Keep : Why Poor Women Put Motherhood Before Marriage , and though the men in their lives cannot turn those dreams into reality , they continue to gaze longingly into the distance at marriage as a symbol of middle - class stability and comfort .
What they do n’t have , however , is a clue about the very fact that orders the lives of their more fortunate peers : marriage and childbearing belong together .
The result is separate and unequal families , now and as far as the eye can see .
As family experts find themselves surrendering to their own research and arguing more and more that marriage is central to the overall well - being of children , they often caution that it is not a cure - all .
“ Is Marriage a Panacea ? ” is the illustrative title of a 2003 article in the scholarly journal Social Problems , and you know the answer to the question without reading a page .
No , shrinking the Marriage Gap may not be a magic potion for ending poverty or inequality or any other social problem .
But it ’s hard to see how our two Americas can become one without more low - income men and women making their way to the altar .
Marriage may not be a panacea .
But it is a sine qua non .

( CNN ) --
An Egyptian court on Thursday confirmed the death sentences of a business tycoon and a former police officer convicted of killing rising Lebanese pop star Suzanne Tamim .
Hisham Talaat Moustafa , a real estate mogul , has been found guilty of Suzanne Tamim 's murder .
In a case that has captivated Egypt and the region because of the fame of the victim and one of the defendants , a judge sentenced to death real estate mogul Hisham Talaat Moustafa and former officer Muhsen el Sukkari last month .
Tamim 's body was found stabbed , with her throat slit , in her apartment in the United Arab Emirates in July 2008 .
The court 's latest decision came after a review of the sentence by Egypt 's grand mufti , the country 's highest religious official .
Because the two men were sentenced under Islamic law , it is widely expected they will be hanged .
The court usually seeks to get the Mufti's " advice only on any death sentence , according to the law , " a legal source in Cairo told CNN .
" However , the Mufti 's advice to the court is not binding at all , " added the source , who asked not to be named .
" Even if the Mufti was against the death sentence , that will not have any effect on the judge 's decision , who will have the final say , " the source said .
Since his 2003 appointment as grand mufti , Sheikh Ali Gomaa has received about 480 cases from the court that included death sentences .
He supported the judge 's decision in 478 and opposed twice , but the rule was implemented according to the court conviction .

Moustafa 's lawyer previously told reporters that he would appeal the conviction , saying there was " a 1 million percent guarantee " the sentence would be overturned .
Prosecutors alleged Moustafa , a parliament member for the ruling National Democratic Party , paid el Sukkari $ 2 million to kill Tamim .
During the trial , Moustafa 's lawyer told CNN his client loved the singer but could not take Tamim as a second wife because his family objected .
Polygamy is legal in Egypt , and it's not unusual for men such as Moustafa , a married father of three , to take on additional wives .
Prosecutors have said Tamim 's death was a " means of taking revenge " but have not elaborated .
Moustafa and el Sukkari claim the prosecution 's evidence could have been fabricated or tampered with by UAE authorities and should not be used against them .
Although Tamim was killed in the UAE , the Egyptian judiciary tried the case in Cairo because the accused were arrested in Egypt .
After Moustafa 's arrest in September , Egyptian authorities indicted him , stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and jailed him pending trial .
He also resigned as chairman of Talaat Moustafa Group -- a conglomerate with construction and real estate arms that was founded by his father , Talaat Moustafa .
Moustafa 's brother , Tarek Talaat Moustafa , now chairs the company .

Gabe Watson was an experienced diver
An Australian court has sentenced a man to four - and - a - half years in prison over the death of his bride on their scuba - diving honeymoon on Great Barrier Reef .
Christina Watson , 26 , drowned while diving with her husband , David Gabriel Watson , an experienced diver , 11 days after their wedding in 2003 .
The sentence came after Watson pleaded guilty to manslaughter having previously denied murder charges .
Prosecutors said he had failed in his duty as his wife 's dive buddy .
' Survival extinguished '
Prosecutor Brendan Campbell said Watson had failed to give her emergency oxygen when she needed it .
Watson allowed Christina to sink to the ocean floor without making any serious attempt to rescue her and also failed to inflate her buoyancy vest or remove weights from her belt to allow her to surface , Mr Campbell said .
" He virtually extinguished any chance of her survival , " he told the court hearing , in Brisbane .
An instructor races to Tina Watson , seen lying on the sea floor
A dive instructor found novice scuba diver Christina Watson lying on the bottom of the ocean after her husband , known as Gabe , had surfaced .
In mid-2008 a coroner found it was likely Watson killed his wife by holding her underwater and turning off her air supply .
The American couple were on their honeymoon in Australia .
Watson , who has since remarried , voluntarily returned to Australia last month to face his murder charge .
Christina 's father Tommy Thomas , her sister Alanda and friend Amanda Phillips travelled from their native Alabama to attend the court hearing .
Prosecutors had sought a five - year jail term for Mr Watson , with the possibility of parole after 18 months .
I was interrupted from peacefully watching a financial news station ( Bloomberg TV lest there be some confusion ) when I got this email : " the sweaty , drunk guy on CNBC is bashing you again . "
Curious , I decided to investigate .
Not surprisingly some more ad pseudonymem amusement ensued :
It 's funny one should mention " allegedly factual " , because ironically the last time a CNBC talking head attacked Zero Intelligence , the whole ploy was scripted from the beginning to boost CNBC 's traffic and viewership ( we have yet to see June 's Nielsen ratings for the outcome : we will promptly provide that once available ) .
As to the BS that blogs like Zero Intelligence spread , it is all based on linked and referenced facts ( yes , that 's what those graphs and hyperlinks in the posts are for , click them , you may be surprised what you find ) .
Charlie , here is a primer on how blogging works ( and no Steve , it is called blogging , and not reporting , just because of the following ) - it is feedback driven : if a blog does provide false and misleading data it is always called upon it , and people lose interest .
Simple as that .
And , as I retorted to your less than primetime spot colleague Dennis Kneale , in blogging the content is king , not the messenger .
To wit :
" Zero Hedge is not about personalities , goatees or glasses - it is about ideas , facts and opinions .
People come to Zero Hedge not because of my chiseled washboard abs , but because they appreciate my insight into things financial and economic .
My personality is not relevant when discussing critical concepts .
Who knows - maybe I do not care for being recognized while having dinner at Campagnola . "
Oh , and here is our manifesto .
Check it out some time .
But Charlie does make a good point : people do in fact get a lot of their information from the Internet .
More and more in fact .
And the reason is because they now openly mistrust organizations which have massive reporting conflicts of interest , compliments of their highly troubled parent companies , whose well being ( and by extension , the paychecks of said TV pundits ) depend on the perpetuation of the confidence and economic soundness fallacy .
Furthermore , Zero Intelligence is not an investment advisor , nor does it promote any securities .
If we did , we would disclose it .
Just like you should disclose at the beginning of every segment that CNBC is a direct subsidiary of GE which is a recipient of over $ 51 billion in taxpayer cash via the FDIC 's TLGP ( see the link to the left ?
click on it ) .
Having your interns actually perform some diligence before that 2 minute soundbite " exclusive " is a great way to spend some of that $ 51 billion .
Try it out .
Nonetheless , Zero Intelligence completely agrees with Charlie that those seeking important , critical , and relevant information should absolutely go to openly satirical websites such as Dealbreaker and Clusterstock .
After all , CNBC knows a thing or two about truth and satire .
In the meantime , please forgive us Charlie and Steve if in our pursuit of the definition of reporting , we stumble upon some other peculiarities about potential conflicts of interest that may or may not involve CNBC pundits .
In conclusion , while we realize that we could never do as good a job as Charlie has done promoting us , Zero Intelligence is in the process of submitting an RFP for purchasing 5 hours of 18,000 subsecond ad blocks on CNBC , to be interspersed within the Power Lunch segment .
We will advise readers on the outcome .
Perhaps we can all split the cost as ironically Zero Intelligence has no external ( and definitely no taxpayer subsidized ) funding , aside from our recurring readers consistently finding interesting content on our pages .
You just polished off some yogurt and , because of that chasing - arrows symbol on the bottom of the container , you assume it should go in the recycle bin .
Right ?
Not necessarily .
Glass , metal , and paper are pretty straightforward , but when it comes to plastic , things get tricky .
The truth is that what you can recycle depends on where you live and what materials your city ’s facilities can handle .
There are many different types of plastic , and they can not all be recycled together .
So unless you ’re diligent about sorting all your plastics , then “ recycling ” that yogurt container may be doing more harm than simply throwing it away .
Recycling is generally far better than sending waste to landfills and relying on new raw materials to drive the consumer economy .
It takes two - thirds less energy to make products from recycled plastic than from virgin plastic .
By the last official measure in 2005 , Americans recycle an estimated 32 percent of their total waste , which averages nearly a ton per person per year , around a third of which is plastic .
Our recycling efforts save the greenhouse gas equivalent of removing 39.6 million cars from the road .
But not all plastic can be recycled , and only about 6.8 percent of the total plastic used in the U.S. actually goes that route — although the rate is higher with bottles : 37 percent for soft drink and 28 percent for milk and water bottles .
The chief problem lies in plastic ’s complexity :
There are as many types of plastic as there are uses .
And since each type can only be recycled with its own kind , plastics need to be carefully sorted before they can be processed .
The presence of enough foreign materials — from food to dissimilar kinds of plastic — can ruin an entire batch of would - be recyclables .
Plastics are chemically categorized by numbers , which are displayed inside the chasing - arrow icon on many plastic containers .
The two most common types are plastic # 1 ( polyethylene terephthalate , or PETE ) , which is used mainly in soda and water bottles , and # 2 ( high - density polyethylene , or HDPE ) , used in things like detergent bottles and milk jugs .
Unfortunately , while plastics marked # 1 or # 2 are generally considered to be recyclable , not all containers with those numbers actually are .
The reason for this is that many plastics contain additives blended into the original resin , and the different additives create discrepancies even within each category .
Every container in the grocery store is made with a unique blend of chemicals — plasticizers , molding agents , dyes — that combine to give a plastic its shape , color , strength , and flexibility ( or lack thereof ) .
As a result , they melt at varying temperatures and respond differently to new additives , and so they cannot all be melted down and recycled together to make a new product .
As a result , most plastic , aside from the ubiquitous clear plastic bottle , cannot , generally speaking , be recycled by most municipalities .
This problem applies to the # 1s and # 2s , as well as yogurt containers or hummus tubs , and Chinese - takeout containers , which are usually made from # 5 plastic .
( It also includes plastic bags and the frustratingly hard plastic packaging that your headphones came in , which do n't even earn a recycling number . )
But many people do n’t know that , so they toss all of them in the blue bin , thereby reducing efficiency at the sorting plant , which is where your plastic goes when it 's collected on recycling day .
Sorting is a crucial part of the recycling process .
Plastic sorting can be done manually , but it ’s tedious and labor - intensive .
Automatic sorting is far more efficient , but the technology is not foolproof :
There are so many types of plastics that sorting equipment can’t look for all possible additives in the materials passing through .
( Ironically , the increasing use of bio-plastics — which are made from renewable materials like cornstarch and are meant to be more earth - friendly than conventional oil - based plastic — has made the job of automatic sorting machines even harder . )
Any contamination in the recycle bin compromises the strength and durability of the recycled plastic that is produced , which in turn compromises its future use as a material for manufacturers .
A recycled container needs to be strong enough to hold the weight of the contents inside , and many container shapes already contain weak spots where the plastic has a reduced thickness — near a bottle 's handle , for example .
While all these complications make it difficult to produce containers with a high percentage of recycled plastic , some companies are still taking on the challenge .
Seventh Generation , a company that makes eco-friendly household products , is increasing the recycled content of all its packaging , with a goal of 75 percent for all products by the end of the year .
But Seventh Generation is an exception to a widespread industry trend .
It is virtually impossible to calculate the industry average for how much recycled plastic goes into packaging , according to Tom Outerbridge , director of municipal recycling for Sims Metal Management , a metals and electronics recycling company .
Without a built - in environmental ethic like the one Seventh Generation has , individual companies are inconsistent in their use of recycled content , and can use anywhere from zero to 100 percent recycled plastic in their products .
But when the quality of the recycled plastic goes down , so does that percentage .
So if you ’re wondering if you should continue to recycle your plastics , here ’s an answer : Yes .
But before you do , educate yourself on which plastics your city collects , and bring other types to outlets where they can be properly sorted .
If you ’re unsure about a plastic — an old CD jewel boxes , perhaps , or Saran Wrap — then putting it in the bin and hoping it will be recycled anyway does nothing for the environment .
It ’s going to be thrown into the garbage after an elaborate and costly sorting process , so you might as well just toss it out yourself .

An al - Jazeera journalist who was imprisoned in Guantánamo Bay plans to launch a joint legal action with other detainees against former US president George Bush and other administration officials , for the illegal detention and torture he and others suffered at the hands of US authorities .
The case will be initiated by the Guantánamo Justice Centre , a new organisation open to former prisoners at the US base , which will set up its international headquarters in Geneva , Switzerland , later this month .
" The purpose of our organisation is to open a case against the Bush administration , " said co-founder Sami al - Haj , an al - Jazeera reporter from Sudan who was illegally detained by US authorities for over six years after being captured while he was working as a cameraman .
He was freed in May 2008 .
" We need to start our organisation first and then we will prepare a whole case .
We do n't want to do this case by case , " said the 40 - year - old journalist during a recent visit to Oslo .
" We are in the process of collecting information from all the people , such as medical evidence .
It takes time , " he said .
He added : " I need them to go to court … we do n't want [ what happened to us ] to be repeated again . "
The legal action may be modelled on an action against General Augusto Pinochet , who was arrested in the UK in 1998 at the request of a Spanish prosecutor for the alleged murders of Spanish citizens in Chile under his dictatorship .
Al - Haj said : " I spoke to my lawyer , who advises me to do this in Europe .
The courts do not have the power to bring [ US officials ] by force , but at least they can't visit European countries .
If they do , [ the authorities ] would catch them and send them to court . "
The Guantánamo Justice Centre , which will be led by British ex-detainee Moazzam Begg , will open a British - based branch this month in addition to its Geneva headquarters .
Al - Haj , who is back at work for the Arabic satellite channel in Qatar , is in frequent contact with Guantánamo detainees , both past and present .
" Torture is continuing in Guantánamo , " al - Haj said .
" Obama needs to close Guantánamo immediately . "
Al - Haj said he was questioned by British intelligence officers during his detention , once in Kandahar in March 2002 , and another time at Guantánamo later that same year .
He said : " They asked me questions about al - Jazeera , whether it had links with al - Qaeda .
They asked me questions about the British detainees at Guantánamo .
" They told me I should cooperate with the Americans and work as a spy , " upon his release .
He said he was not mistreated by the British intelligence officers .

Aaron Bruns , a Washington based Fox News producer , is facing charges of possessing child pornography , which may result in a minimum of 10 years in prison .
Bruns , who was assigned to the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign last year , could also be required to register as a sex offender for the next 15 years .
Police found more than 300 images and at least five movies depicting the sexual abuse of children under the age of 10 , including one younger than five .
Ten years ago , while attending University of Michigan , Bruns faced similar charges .
In that case , police found more than 2,000 child porn images on his computer , but he was given a second chance because of his age , so no official charges were made .
Due to the two cases , the first in 1999 and the second recent one , Aaron Bruns could face a longer prison sentence of up to 20 years .

Collection Fighting for a More Perfect Union : Protest and Politics in America
The role of protest , agitation and struggle in the evolution of the country we live in today .
If there are agreed - upon definitions of the word hero , then Joe Albietz must fit many of them .
This good - natured , upbeat , intelligent , and skeptical man is a pediatrician who gets up every morning so that he can help -- and succeed -- in saving the lives of children .
I 'm proud he 's my friend .
Joe 's written a concise and informative article about the JREF 's vaccine drive in Las Vegas for The Amaz !ng Meeting 7 .
Vaccinations rates in Vegas were very low due to poverty and a transient population , and their herd immunity to diseases like measles and whooping cough is in serious trouble .
Joe came up with the idea of getting donations from the skeptic community to support vaccinations in Vegas , and spearheaded the effort .
For $ 25 you can support a child to get a full series of vaccinations .
You do n't have to attend TAM 7 or do anything else ; just send $ 25 and a child in Vegas will get protected against a raft of potentially life - threatening diseases .
And while those children are getting their vaccinations , we will be at TAM 7 talking about how to fight people like Jenny McCarthy , Meryl Dorey , and all the others who are so vocal in making sure that diseases we once stamped out come back with a vengeance .
We know that vaccinations do n't cause autism , and we know they have wiped out smallpox , and put such scourges as polio on the endangered list .
Help us , so that we can help others .
Go read Joe 's article and see how you can easily support this effort .
What is “ anti-classism ” ?
I may mean a number of different things .
But none of them has much to do with anarchism .
At times , term “ classism ” shows up in a row of various evils “ activists ” are against – for example a group declares that they are “ against racism , sexism , homophobia , transphobia , ageism , ablism and classism ” .
Apparently such groups and initiatives come from certain ( liberal ) anti-discrimination activist paradigm , but also want to put themselves to vaguely anti-capitalist context .
However such declarations fail to do that , as capitalism has nothing to do with classism , that is , “ discrimination on base of the class ” .
Anarchism has two cornerstones – freedom of individual and mutual aid .
Unlike such political theories as liberalism , fascism and social - democracy , anarchism does not admit any fundamental contradiction between these two .
Because anarchism is for individual freedom , just as liberalism , anarchism is obviously against racism , sexism , homophobia and ablism as these constitute hindrances to free development of individuals – but these are also hindrances against mutual aid as any prejudices divide working class and humanity in general .
Liberalism , as ideology of capitalism , is however not concerned about mutual aid .
Ideal society of liberalism is a total survival of the fittest between “ free individuals ” , where only skills of individuals matter , not their backgrounds .
Of course there exists also left - wing liberalism , but it is not really an ideology but rather a self - contradicting compromise between social - democracy and liberalism , endlessly oscillating between the two .
In the end of the day , “ equal opportunities to everyone ” is a fundamentally capitalist idea – everyone should be allowed to participate to the race where one out of million becomes a billionare and all the rest will eat shit all their lives .
Is capitalism for classism ?
No it is not .
If by classism we understand class division , this is obviously something individual capitalists try to maintain in order to preserve their own interests .
However system as a whole needs to exploit enterpreneurship skills of everyone who has them , not just skills of those who got capital by heritage .
There is nothing anti-capitalist from making it from poverty to riches , actually system needs such stories both for its legitimization and renewal .
Class mobility is no any fundamental problem for capitalism , as for any upward movement there will be corresponding downward mobility .
Actually , any hindrances of class mobility in developed capitalism are not due to capitalism itself , but either due to efforts of individual capitalists , due to external restraints or due to residues of the previous system which was fundamentally based on restricting class mobility , that is , feudalism .
And to some extent these residues are still here , for example some UK capitalists come from families which date their privileges back to Norman conquest .
If by classism we understand wage differentials between workers and CEO's , the whole concept is just nonsense .
Corporations do not pay workers less because they are “ prejudiced ” against workers , they pay workers less because that helps them to make more profit .
And when it is profitable to pay more , they will – best football players may earn millions but they are still workers .
Some , even many bosses may hate workers , but this has nothing to do with capitalism – it is rather a feudalist mindset which is a hindrance to capitalism .
Capitalists may use vicious ways to play workers against other , but again in most of the cases it is nothing personal – just for the profit .
In general , capitalism has nothing against workers as such as long as workers do not block capital accumulation .
And even if workers organise , that may be beneficial for capitalism as a whole as long as self - organisation happens on purely economical , business union terms .
In suitable economic situation , increased wages gained by collective action of workers only boost economy and make capitalism more healthier ( however due to increased external constraints of capitalism those days of Keynesian accumulation may be now gone for good ) .
Individual capitalists often engage to activities which benefit themselves alone or are just plain irrational , but are harmful to capitalist system as a whole : they form cartels , evade taxes , mislead shareholders , sack workers just because they do not like them , cut wages which makes recession more severe etc .
However , one should never confuse these typical capitalist deeds with the system as a whole .
For system as a whole , ideal capitalist has nothing against workers , and he is always eager to pick most ambitious and skilled amongst them to be future foremen , managers , shareholders and even executives .
However is such an “ anti-classist ” capitalist any better than his crony class equivalent ?
From point of view of a liberal definitely yes , from point of view of an anarchist there is no difference between them .
Capitalist is always protagonist of the ruthless , exploitative system which will always benefit only few and keep majority at the bottom .
Capitalist who got rid of his feudalist or other prejudices , is no any better than any other capitalist .
Sometimes capitalists may promote racism or sexism in order to divide workers – however they need such methods only if threatened by a mass action of workers , racism and sexism as such have no any value for capitalism .
Migration barriers may benefit some individual capitalists , but fundamentally it is not capitalists but workers of the developed countries who hope to protect their short - terms interests by voting for anti-migration candidates and supporting anti-migration initiatives .
And of course , there are times when capitalism is temporarily using prejudices in their own interests in order to decrease workforce in times of economic downturn .
Women are agitated to be housewifes , blacks were forced to go back to cotton fields ( 19th century method ) or just put to prison ( 21th century method ) , migrants are deported and all this is legitimized by sexist and racist mainstream media .
However , capitalism is based on necessity of accumulation of capitalism , thus no matter how inevitable recessions are in capitalism , they are always just a temporary setbacks .
In the end of the day , capitalism must integrate everyone to a highly mobile and flexible , ever - enlarging system of production – this is why fundamentally capitalism is neither racist , nor sexist , anti-migrant , homophobic , ablist or even classist , quite a contrary .
Anarchism does not want to get rid of prejudices towards workers or towards capitalists .
It is perfectly normal to dislike working - class existence , as there is nothing satisfying in it .
It is also perfectly normal not to like capitalists – their personal qualities do not matter as long as they are exploiters .
Anarchists want to get rid of the capitalist class as whole .
Although anarchists do not want to kill individual capitalists , they want to get rid of that relation of production .
Thus anarchists are not only prejudiced against capitalists as a class , we want to get rid of all of them .
Thus anarchism is perhaps most classist theory of them all .
Thus groups and initiatives which refer to “ classism ” both misrepresent goals of anarchists and fail to get rid of the liberal , pro-capitalist “ anti- discrimination ” theoretical framework where their roots are .
Of course , such terms could be of use when discussing with people who first become politically aware while influenced by some liberal one - case initiatives , we should reach out to these people just as much to everyone else .
But in the end of the day concept of “ classism ” confuses issues , as capitalism not just one form of discrimination .
If even anarchists do not understand what capitalism is about , we may never get rid of it .
Thus next time you come across with people referring to “ classism ” or “ anti-classism ” , please point them to this text .

Great business ideas often come from strange places , but no one expects to find one at the bottom of a river .
Yet that 's what happened to George Goodwin .
When he went fishing in shallow Florida riverbeds during the early 1970s , Goodwin often caught more logs than bass .
" I used to snag my lures on them , " he remembers .
Most fishermen would have cursed their luck ; Goodwin , now 59 , reeled in a multi-million - dollar business instead .
What Goodwin found are known as deadhead logs .
In the 1800s loggers felled centuries - old cypress and pine throughout the South for use in construction .
They would float the logs downstream to the nearest mill , but often the heaviest logs -- those filled with the most resin-- sank to the muddy riverbed .
At a time when the South was blanketed by tens of millions of acres of untouched forest , it was n't much of a loss .
But today overharvesting has reduced that old - growth forest to just 5,000 to 10,000 acres , most of it protected , and the logs once lost to the rivers have newfound value .
As Goodwin got interested in logs , he discovered that , although the outside decomposes after being underwater for nearly a century , resin keeps the inside perfectly preserved .
Prized for flooring and paneling , this interior wood is known as " heart pine " and " heart cypress . "
Goodwin spent $ 105,500 - - his entire savings -- to purchase 20 acres of land in Micanopy , Fla. , ten miles south of Gainesville , and move an old sawmill to the property , where he and his wife , Carol , the company 's 59 - year - old vice president , live and work .
They pay divers $ 2 to $ 3 per board foot of wood in the logs recovered from Florida riverbeds .
Then they clean up the logs and mill them into flooring that sells for $ 5 to $ 20 a foot .
Carol estimates that the demand for antique wood has risen tenfold in the past decade , thanks to the housing boom and changing tastes .
That has sent the company 's annual revenue on a steady climb , from $ 5,000 in 1977 to $ 3 million in 2004 .
By last year their company had 25 employees and enough cash flow to take out a $ 140,000 loan to build a 15,000 - square - foot warehouse for the nearly two million board feet of wood it has in inventory .
That saved a lot of aggravation when several hurricanes tore through the area just months after the building had been completed .
( The Goodwins were unaffected by Katrina and Wilma . )
Had the logs been soaked , the company would have had to spend months drying them out .
Goodwin Heart Pine has supplied flooring for the homes of celebrities such as Paul McCartney , Morgan Freeman , and Ted Turner .
The wood is also popular for historical sites , including the Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum in Key West , Fla .
Six years ago the termite - infested flooring in the 150 - year - old structure needed replacing .
" Goodwin flooring was the closest to what Hemingway had originally , " says Hemingway Home event director Linda Mendez .
The growing popularity of antique wood , however , has more would - be entrepreneurs flocking to the business , not all with the best intentions .
" There 's a joke in the South that anyone with a pickup sells a little bit of heart pine , " says Carol Goodwin .
" But you never know what you 're getting . "
Because there are no up - to - date guidelines on what constitutes heart pine -- the most recent standards were published in 1924 - - unwitting customers may purchase heart pine from younger trees , which is not nearly as dense and durable as what the Goodwins sell .
When a hurricane knocks down any of the remaining old - growth forest -- as happened last year -- the Goodwins often buy that wood .
They also buy and resell antique heart pine salvaged from old barns and buildings .
Branching out from flooring , George and a local cabinet - maker have teamed up to craft and sell a line of wood furniture .
In July the Goodwins opened a showroom in Palm Coast , Fla. , for both their furniture and flooring .
While George Goodwin jokes that " cashing the checks " is one of his favorite parts of the business , he loves the other parts more than he lets on .
" If George had $ 1 million in the bank , he 'd just go and buy more wood , " says Carol , laughing .
