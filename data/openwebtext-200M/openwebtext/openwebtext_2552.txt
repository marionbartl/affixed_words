TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran is aiming to commission its first nuclear power plant in 2009 after years of delays , the official IRNA news agency reported on Tuesday .
Russia has already delivered nuclear fuel under a $ 1 billion contract to build the Bushehr plant on the Gulf coast in southwest Iran .
But the start - up timetable has frequently been put back because of issues such as a row over payments .
Russia agreed to build the plant in 1995 on the site of an earlier project begun in the 1970s by German firm Siemens .
The Siemens ’ project was disrupted by Iran ’s 1979 Islamic revolution and the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war .
“ The commissioning stage of Bushehr nuclear power station has begun and we are hopeful the power station will be commissioned in 2009 as per the agreement we have had with the Russian party , ” the spokesman for Iran ’s Atomic Energy Organization , Mohsen Delaviz , was quoted a saying .
He did not give a more precise date .
“ There is a good environment prevailing in our relations with the Russians and we are hoping they will honor their commitments , ” he added .
Atomstroyexport , the Russian firm building the plant , said in September the plant was nearing completion and that it would start “ technological work ” in December 2008 to February 2009 that would put the plant on an “ irreversible final ” course .
Analysts say Russia has used Bushehr as a lever in relations with Tehran .
It had previously said it expected the plant to start up some time this year .
Iran is at loggerheads with the West over its nuclear program that Tehran says has only civilian aims but which the United States and its allies say is a smokescreen for building atomic weapons .

Um , you came in your pants while you were both wearing clothes but a little came out ??
How does a little come out if you came in your pants that you were wearing ?
Unless the little that came out came into close contact with your girlfriend 's nether regions , you do n't have anything to worry about .
Last month , a research project into risks to kids from social media , commissioned by several State Attorneys General , concluded that there was n't really much risk of pedophiles stalking kids online .
Rather , kids are at risk from each other .
And some kids are at risk of soliciting sex and relationships with young adults , due to their own insecurities .
This conclusion angered many who sincerely believe that the Internet is full of pedophiles , and they 're attacking the study .
danah boyd , one of the researchers , responds :
Now , let 's do some math .
The National Alert Registry has over 491,000 registered sex offenders on its list .
In data collected in December , Pew found that 35 % of American adults are on social network sites .
If sex offenders were a representative population , we 'd expect that 172,000 of them would be on social network sites .
Now , I know nothing of who is on that list , but if they were to skew younger or more urban , we 'd expect even more of them to be on those sites .
Regardless , the number announced by MySpace should not be unexpected or shocking .
One of the worst parts of dealing with quantitative numbers of any kind is our tendency to read into them what we want to read into them .
We see a number like 90,000 and expect that it 's high and outrageous .
But it is not more than would be expected by statistical patterns .
And it 's not an automatic indicator of a problem .
We need to know WHO those registered sex offenders are and WHAT they are doing to get a critical assessment of the risk .
By focusing solely on the number , we introduce a red herring and , in doing so , miss the whole point of our report : there are children online engaging in risky behavior who desperately need our help .
Blocking adults who have raped other adults , while likely desirable in general , does NOTHING to help at - risk kids .
Why are we so obsessed with the registered sex offender side of the puzzle when the troubled kids are right in front of us ?
Why are we so obsessed with the Internet side of the puzzle when so many more kids are abused in their own homes ?
I feel like this whole conversation has turned into a distraction .
Money and time is being spent focusing on the things that people fear rather than the very real and known risks that kids face .
This breaks my heart .
US President George W Bush hands over to Barack Obama next week Outgoing US President George W Bush has warned his successor that a terrorist attack is still the " most urgent threat " to the US .
At his last press conference before handing over to Barack Obama next week , he said there were enemies who wanted to inflict damage on Americans .
Mr Bush said he believed North Korea may have an enriched uranium programme , while Iran was " still dangerous " .
Mr Bush wished Mr Obama good luck , saying he would be well supported .
There 's still an enemy out there that would like to inflict damage on Americans
President George W Bush Appearing before the White House press corps to thank them for their work during his two terms in power , Mr Bush said he had received a security briefing every day except Sundays for the past eight years .
" The most urgent threat he will have to deal with , and other presidents after him have got to deal with , is an attack on our homeland , " Mr Bush said .
" I wish I could report that is not the case , but there 's still an enemy out there that would like to inflict damage on Americans .
That will be the major threat . "
Mr Bush was only eight months into his presidency when terror attacks occurred on 11 September , 2001 , in the US .
In a wide - ranging question and answer session with the media , Mr Bush was asked about his mistakes , the economy , the Middle East and his future .
' Moral standing ' Questioned about America's " moral standing " in the world , he strongly disagreed with suggestions that it had been damaged by the war in Iraq .
But he acknowledged that it had been a mistake to make a speech about US troops in Iraq underneath a banner proclaiming " mission accomplished " in 2003 .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
US troop numbers were subsequently increased , and 140,000 remain in Iraq as his presidency ends .
Other " disappointments " cited by Mr Bush were the prisoner abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib , and " not having weapons of mass destruction " in Iraq - the main reason given by the US for launching a war on Saddam Hussein .
He said he would be willing to ask Congress to release the remaining $ 350bn from the government 's bailout fund , if Barack Obama asked him to .
Mr Bush also said the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 in New Orleans had been fast enough , but conceded that " things could have been done better " .
The Bush administration was widely criticised by local residents who felt abandoned in the immediate aftermath of the disaster .
Leaving office Mr Bush was supportive of Mr Obama , repeatedly saying that he wished him all the best and describing him as " smart and engaging " and also " a much better speech - maker than me " .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The Bush administration demolished the notion of diplomacy Gabe , Lexington
He predicted that the next president would suddenly realise the importance of being president of the US - either " the minute he walks in the Oval Office ... [ or ] he may feel it the minute he gets sworn in " .
He went on : " All I know is , he 's going to feel it .
There 'll be a moment when he feels it . "
As he prepares to leave the White House with his wife Laura , the famously fit president offered a glimpse of a vigorous retirement .
" I just can't envision myself , you know , with the big straw hat and a Hawaiian shirt sitting on some beach . "

The jet - mounted laser anti-missile system , brainchild of Northrop Grumman , Lockheed Martin , Boeing and the US Air Force , has been an ongoing project for quite some time .
Well , it 's progressed into a final test phase , as evidenced by a new video , which shows the plane strapped with a pilot - controlled laser which is able to intercept missiles significantly earlier than other existing anti-missile tech .
The project has plans to continue testing throughout this year , but will also need to be approved by the Obama administration if it is to come to fruition .
Feel free to insert obligatory Dr. Evil joke in comments .
Check out the video after the break , but fair warning : it autoplays .

The self - styled " media watchdogs " are so very predictable .
No sooner has Grand Theft Auto IV : The Lost and Damned been released for download , than the moral fearmongers get up in arms about it .
Responding to the GTA DLC 's full - frontal male nudity , Common Sense Media has begun its panicked clucking in response .
" It is even more controversial than its predecessors because this game has full frontal male nudity , " warns Common Sense .
" The game lets you lead a life of crime as part of a motorcycle gang with plenty of gang violence ... relentless foul language , drugs and alcohol , and sexual references ...
" Families can talk about why Rockstar likes to push the envelope and garner controversy over its games ?
Why did they have to put full - frontal nudity in the game if it 's not integral to the story ?
Do they correlate media outrage with extraordinary game sales ?
Do players expect Rockstar to stir up controversy with each of its titles , including the Manhunt and Bully series ?... "
Common Sense asks why ?
Why did Rockstar put a penis in GTA IV ?
No , it did n't have to do it , but you know what ?
It could and it did .
A flaccid donk is something we 've seen in films and on TV before .
It 's about time videogames caught up .
While Rockstar clearly did it for attention ( yes gamers do expect Rockstar to stir up controversy ) , I think it broke a good boundary and hopefully sets a new precedent for the kind of material videogames can show .
I wo n't pretend that Rockstar 's " penis scene " was n't a very immature sight gag .
However , those who are crowing and complaining because they saw a pecker on a screen for a few moments are being even more immature .
A lot of people in the world have a penis .
We know it 's there , and most of us have seen one .
Grow up and get used to it .
Oh , I should be fair and point out that beyond the penis , they actually like the gameplay !

Sweden is edging closer towards officially approving gay marriage now that three of the four parties in the ruling government coalition have joined forces and tabled a motion to legalise the controversial unions by 1 May .
Of the four parties in the Alliance government , only the Christian Democrats are holding out .
The Local newspaper reports that they are opposed to using the term “ marriage ” when referring to gay unions .
The Liberals , the Centre Party , and the conservative Moderates , however , are all behind the new law that would remove the reference to marriage as being restricted to a union between a man and a woman .
The motion before parliament reads : “ Regardless of sexual orientation , people in stable couple relationships have a need to manifest their feelings and their desire to live together . ”
At present , homosexuals may only register their union in a civil ceremony , and are barred from taking part in a church ceremony .
Even the opposition Social Democrats , Sweden ’s largest political group , support the measure so there should be little to stop the law from being passed in parliament .
If the new law does pass , Sweden will become the seventh country to allow full same sex marriage rights .
Sweden has pioneered the way for gay unions to get equal legal status as heterosexual married couples since 1995 , and this progressive - minded nation looks set to raise the bar again .

Yahoo said the company is for sale at the right price Yahoo said the " For Sale " sign is still on its front lawn and that Microsoft should buy the company .
The internet portal 's co-founder and CEO Jerry Yang made the comment despite the fact Yahoo rejected a $ 33 ( £ 21 ) a share offer from Microsoft back in May .
Mr Yang 's suggestion also came hours after Google pulled out of an internet advertising partnership with Yahoo .
" To this day the best thing for Microsoft to do is buy Yahoo , " said Mr Yang .
" I do n't think that is a bad idea at all , at the right price whatever that price is .
We 're willing to sell the company , " he told a packed ballroom at the Web 2.0 summit in San Francisco .
During the on stage conversation in front of a standing - room only crowd , Mr Yang was asked why the company did not take the $ 33 a share offered back in the summer .
The company 's share price closed Wednesday below $ 14 ( £ 8.80 ) a share .
" They walked away from a public offering and we were ready to negotiate .
We wanted to negotiate a deal .
We felt we were n't that far apart .
" At the end of the day , they withdrew and they have since been clear about not wanting to buy the company , " explained Mr Yang in a rare public appearance .
Microsoft did however come back and offer to buy the search part of Yahoo , but a deal was never struck .
Again Mr Yang said the offer then was not good enough but he still remained open to persuasion .
" As far as a search deal goes , we are open - minded about it .
The last time we felt the deal was not a good one for the company but that does n't mean we wo n't do one . "
When asked if any negotiations were pending with the software giant , Mr Yang said " There is no new news . "
Microsoft declined to comment .
And when quizzed about a possible deal with AOL , Mr Yang played coy with his host John Battelle .
" Buying AOL ?
I can't talk about that , John .
If I told you I would have to kill you . "
' Disappointed '
While Yahoo is still holding the door open to Microsoft , Google closed one earlier in the day on a deal the two companies had struck up over search advertising .
After four months of scrutiny from the Department of Justice , Google decided to back out of the agreement it had made to provide advertising around the internet portal 's search results .
Mr Yang told the summit " I am passionate about Yahoo "
It had been estimated that the venture would have been worth around $ 800 m ( £ 500 m ) a year to Yahoo .
" Pressing ahead risked not only a protracted legal battle but also damage to relationships with valued partners , " said Google 's chief counsel David Drummond .
Mr Yang said he was " disappointed that they [ Google ] did n't want to defend this deal . "
But he felt that in his mind , the government scuppered it .
" I really thought the government in this case does not understand our industry .
They have a market definition that I think is too narrow and I think things like this tend to have unintended consequences for our entire industry .
" So I clearly do n't agree with what the viewpoint is , but they are the government and they can decide on these things . "
Mr Yang pointed out that the Google partnership was not crucial to its bottom line and that it was " incremental " to its overall growth plans .

In today 's Rocky Mountain News , FOX News contributor Michelle Malkin claims she did n't realize she posed for a photo with a man holding a swastika - bearing sign at an anti-Obama stimulus bill protest Tuesday outside the State Capitol in Denver .
Malkin suggests to Rocky reporter David Montero that " Swastika Guy , " as he 's come to be known , may have been a " ringer " trying to discredit her by slipping into the mass of people waiting for a Malkin photo - op after the rally .
But if Swastika Guy was a left - leaning operative , he sure was n't a secret one .
Instead of hiding in the crowd of 300 people , many of whom had strongly worded signs of their own , he stood right at the top of the steps during the protest .
He was one of the first people I noticed as a reporter covering the event .
Even from within the thick of the crowd , his swastika was plainly visible .
It would be tough to believe that rally organizers overlooked him , especially considering how close he was to the action .
Holding his sign , which featured a swastika inside the " O " in Obama , he stood to one side of the podium as local conservatives , including Colorado Republican Party boss Dick Wadhams and former Rep.
Tom Tancredo , addressed the crowd .
Standing next to him was " Hammer - and - Sickle Guy , " who bore a similar sign .
In fact , as captured in the photo at the top of this item , the two Guys stood right behind Malkin .
They were so close that if she turned around -- even for a second -- she was bound to see them .
The Rocky story also quotes Colorado Senate Minority Leader Josh Penry , who criticized the swastika sign , saying it " badly crossed the line . "
But he's in the ProgressNow Colorado photo too , within finger - wagging distance of Swastika Guy and Hammer - and - Sickle Guy .
So why so surprised , Malkin and Penry ?
Gone are the days of Baby Boomers , meet the new faces that surfaced during Election 2008 – the Baby Bamas .
While John McCain was busy talking to Joe the Plumber , Barack Obama was talking to Joe the Spit Upper and hundreds of other tiny toddler constituents who rallied and rattled with loyal support for President Obama , some right out of the womb .
Our new President is undergoing immense scrutiny for his $ 787 billion stimulus package , but lest we forget the points that made us all cry out “ Obamalujah ” only a few short months ago .
Enjoy my picks of Top Ten photo ops featuring Barack Obama and the real issues surrounding Election ‘ 08 … straight from the mouths of babes .
This baby - faced voter has nothing to worry about now , but the next sixty years could easily fly by faster than Dick Cheney ’s trigger finger .
Our country will go through at least half a dozen new Commanders - in - Chief by the time he ’s collecting his Social Security checks , but he wants to know he ’s being looked out for , at least until Election ’16 .
Good news baby , your new President is committed to ensuring that Social Security is solvent and viable for the American people , both now and in the future .
Here ’s looking at Social Security kid .
On the family front , cracking down on Slim Shady Daddies who shirk their child supporting responsibilities is tops on Obama ’s to - do list as well as offering double funding for after - school programs and providing low - income families with refundable tax credits to help with child - care expenses .
A true family man , Barack already has two beautiful daughters of his own , but this little cutie patootie still wanted in , making a play to join the first family in the White House .
Sasha and Malia had no comment .
When it comes to foreign relations , Obama and Biden plan to renew American diplomacy to meet all of the challenges of the 21st century .
Hopefully they will rebuild our alliances with countries that have blown raspberries at us for the past two terms and restore our image in an international sense , making us feel like the great Superpower we once were … that is , before we were Bushwhacked .
On the campaign trail , this happy camper reminded Obama of the healing powers of a good hug .
Just hugging it out and clutching his Bama bro in a tight big bear hug gave our new Prez a few novel ideas concerning foreign diplomacy .
It is rumored that Barack plans to steal this token move the next time he rendezvous with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Korea ’s Kim Jong-il .
Besides eating pureed peas , spitting up , burping and playing with Weeble Wobbles , this baby girl ’s daily routine includes regular visits to Gymboree to maintain her ultimate baby physique .
She ’s had a complex ever since her great Aunt Bertha called her pudgy , and wanted to know where Obama stood on health care for all Americans .
Listen up cutie in the pink hoodie , the Obama - Biden plan is to provide affordable , accessible health care for everyone while building on and improving the existing healthcare system .
With hopes to lower health care costs by $ 2,500 for a typical family by investing in health information technology , prevention and care coordination , you ’ll have no problem covering all those visits to your pediatrician … although you ’ll probably have to front your own Gymboree classes .
It ’s okay , McCain would n’t have paid for them either .
This chickadee makes minimum wage testing cribs at Babies R’ Us , and throws a temper tantrum every week after seeing her miniscule paycheck slashed to bits and pieces .
Most kids leave it to their parents to obsess over financial issues , but this working gal was n’t resting until she heard the words “ No new taxes ” , straight from the Obama ’s mouth .
According to Barack ’s new tax plan , broad - based tax relief will be delivered to middle class families with taxes being cut for small businesses and companies that create jobs in the US .
Once our infant earner heard the promise of restoring fairness to our tax code and a return to fiscal responsibility , she gave Mr. Obama a great big kiss .
Then she wanted to know if her kiss was tax deductible .
Feast your eyes on this infant who is just shy of six months , but has already implemented an all - baby - run recycling program at her local Day Care center .
How ’s that for initiative ?
She has single - handedly encouraged her fellow crib mates to toss those used baby bottles into the recycle bins , save electricity by killing all the lights at naptime , and even talked them into donating the contents of their used diapers to be composted into organic fertilizer .
Following her lead , Obama plans to put 1 million Plug - In Hybrid cars on the road by 2015 , ensure that 10 % of our electricity comes from renewable sources by 2012 ( 25 % by 2025 ) , plus he hopes to implement an economy - wide cap - and - trade program that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 % by 2050 .
I ’d say Obama is doing this tiny do–gooder proud by giving her a greener , safer world to enjoy once she grows out of those Pampers and reaches the legal voting age … and long thereafter .
No child will be left behind on President Obama ’s watch , starting with this clingy dude .
Right now he can spell the word C - A - T , most of the time with a K , but he ’s working on it .
He has high hopes for furthering his education , but with a Brady Bunch set up of 6 college bound kids in the family , the college - fund well might be dried up by the time he sharpens his pencils to take his SAT’s .
Get ready for an educational plan that is too cool for school with Obama and Biden ’s new American Opportunity Tax Credit worth $ 4,000 for college bound students who perform valuable acts of community service .
Barack wants to give back to those who give back to the community covering roughly two thirds of tuition costs at the average public college and a sweet free ride for students headed towards community college .
This kid could n’t wait to tell his parents , brothers , sisters and Alice the housekeeper that in 15 or so years he would indeed be headed to kollege .
As we can see above , this pint - sized Casanova is a true ladies man , so gay and lesbian rights and issues do n’t really matter much to him … but he does have an Uncle ( as most of us do ) who is gay and wants to make sure that his rights are being protected and conserved .
Tell your Uncle that Obama plans to outlaw employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation , enact federal Hate Crimes legislation , and repeal the “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ” policy allowing all service members in the military to serve openly .
Obama also supports full adoption rights for same sex couples but draws the line at same sex marriage .
How does your Uncle feel about moving to California or Massachusetts ?
Do n’t forget Canada .
Getting right down to the nitty gritty , this baby made it no secret that she was n’t a fan of the war on Terror , and has even taken steps in her own play pen by banning her brothers from playing with little green army men for added homeland security measures .
Picking up on her direct , no - nonsense attitude , Obama is giving his Secretary of Defense and military commanders a new mission in Iraq , successfully ending the war .
Obama and Biden will press Iraq ’s leaders to take responsibility for their future and to substantially spend their oil revenues on their own reconstruction .
In other words … Peace out baby .
Part of Obama ’s and Biden ’s “ Blueprint for Change ” involves promises of securing all loose nuclear materials in the world within four years time , and negotiating a verifiable global ban on the production of new nuclear weapons material to curb the spread of nuclear weapons .
Starting with the bomb this kid just dropped in their pants .
The Royal Navy 's plan to fit most of its fleet with command systems based on Windows boxes continues , with the commencement last week of a programme intended to replace the existing commandware of the Service 's Type 23 frigates .
The Type 23s will make up the majority of the British surface fleet for the foreseeable future .
According to the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) , HMS Montrose has now entered a planned docking and refit period during which BAE Systems plc will replace her original DNA ( 1 ) gear with DNA ( 2 ) , said to be " based on the system being fitted to the Royal Navy 's powerful new Type 45 Destroyers " .
This means it will be based on fairly everyday hardware running legacy Windows OSes - people who have worked on these programmes inform us that both Win2k and XP will be in use across the fleet .
Along with replacement computers and cabling ( 12 km of new string will be run aboard Montrose during her refit , apparently ) , the frigate will receive a mid-life update to her Sea Wolf close - in surface to air missile system .
This will no doubt be welcome , as it is no longer a secret that the basic system had reached a level of almost total no -confidence among operators as of the turn of the century .
Commodore Graham Peach , the man in charge of looking after surface warships in the MoD purchasing and maintenance empire , hailed the new off - the - shelf IT approach .
" This docking period is an important milestone in our programme to develop a common command system across the fleet , " he said .
" We have worked closely with the contractor , BAE systems , to develop DNA ( 2 ) and its sister systems which will enable us to provide more efficient support to the fleet , simplify operator training and deliver cost savings in the long term as servicing is required . "
According to the MoD , BAE will " develop a common command system across the fleet " for just £ 30 m under a contract awarded in 2006 , perhaps putting an end to decades of horrifyingly frustrating intership networking problems .
Anyone like your correspondent who has served at sea in the last ten years will recall the use of embarrassing expedients such as reading endless strings of figures across voice channels ( often enough civilian mobile phones or marine VHF ) or re-keying them from hardcopy printouts into another machine in the same ship .
In addition to the frigate and destroyer fleets , the Navy has recently announced conversion to Windows in its submarine flotilla .
It is also understood that the new aircraft carriers , whenever they arrive , will also use similar commandware .
It would seem that one large customer at least is n't having any of this Vista / 7 malarkey , certainly not for the foreseeable future .
Many in the software community have criticised the Navy 's moves , feeling that Windows cannot offer the sort of guaranteed reliability one might wish to see in computers which will sometimes have direct control of powerful weapon systems - and on which Blighty 's fighting matelots may one day depend for their lives .
However , one ought to note that the preceding custom solutions were usually so terrible that a reasonably stable Windows box would actually be a serious improvement .
Furthermore , it is fairly rare in naval combat for there to be any need for " man - out - of - the - loop " operations .
The only common situation where weapons need to be fully autonomous is that of surface ships defending against sea-skimming missile attack , which calls for extremely fast reactions based on limited information .
Existing Phalanx and Goalkeeper auto - gun systems are already commonly switched to autonomous operation as missiles close in - or are thought to be closing in - and this is also done in such situations with American Aegis firecontrol systems in charge of Standard interceptor missiles .
If the new Type 45s ever find themselves trying to beat the dreaded supersonic sea-skimmers of the future to the punch - and if they never do this , they will not have been worth buying : they can't do anything else you might pay a billion quid per ship for - they will need to let their command systems shoot instantly at any fast , close low - altitude track which appears in the command system .
A human , if in the loop at all , will not have time to add anything to the decision - making process .
So yes , there will be scope for errors ; but this is more a problem of surface - based air defence than it is one of OSes .
The danger presented by a combat ready air - defence destroyer in what it considers to be a threat zone would probably exist no matter what software it was running .
Given that the Navy will have its warships anyway , UK taxpayers might at least be pleased at the prices the Service seems to be paying to have its commandware replaced .
Again , regular IT people wo n't be terribly impressed at fairly small numbers of fairly humdrum platforms being replaced for tens of millions of pounds : but in the context of traditional warship computer programmes the ongoing MoD projects are actually looking pretty good .
Whether that 's adequate compensation for the possible attendant security and reliability issues will remain a matter of opinion for a while - until the new war - Windows platforms start seeing widespread , networked - up service . ®

Rainn Wilson says fellow members of his Baha'i faith are being persecuted in Iran .
( CNN ) --
Why is Rainn Wilson , " Dwight " on " The Office , " writing a news commentary for CNN ?
Good question .
It 's a bit strange for me , to say the least ; a comic character actor best known for playing weirdos with bad haircuts getting all serious to talk about the persecution of the fellow members of his religious faith .
Dear readers of CNN , I assure you that what I 'm writing about is no joking matter or some hoax perpetrated by a paper - sellin ' , bear - fearin ' , Battlestar - Galactica obsessed beet farmer .
I am a member of the Baha'i faith .
What is that , you ask ?
Well , long story short , it 's an independent world religion that began in the mid-1800s in Iran .
Baha 'is believe that there is only one God and therefore only one religion .
All of the world 's divine teachers ( Jesus , Muhammad , Buddha , Moses , Abraham , Krishna , etc. ) bring essentially the same message -- one of unity , love and knowledge of God or the divine .
This constantly updated faith of God , Baha 'is believe , has been refreshed for this day and age by our founder , Baha 'u 'llah .
There .
Nutshell version .
Now , as I mentioned , this all happened in Iran , and needless to say the Muslim authorities did not like the Baha 'is very much , accusing them of heresy and apostasy .
Tens of thousands were killed in the early years of the faith , and the persecutions have continued off and on for the past 150 years .
Why write about all this now ?
Well , I 'm glad you asked .
You see there 's a ' trial ' going on very soon for seven Baha'i national leaders in Iran .
They 've been accused of all manner of things including being " spies for Israel , " " insulting religious sanctities " and " propaganda against the Islamic Republic . "
They 've been held for a year in Evin Prison in Tehran without any access to their lawyer ( the Nobel Laureate Shirin Ebadi ) and with zero evidence of any of these charges .
When a similar thing happened in 1980 , the national leadership of the Iranian Baha 'i community disappeared .
And this was repeated again in 1981 .
In fact , since 1979 , more than 200 Baha 'is have been killed , holy places and cemeteries desecrated , homes burned , civil rights taken away and secret lists compiled of Baha 'is ( and even Muslims who associate with them ) by government agencies .
It 's bad right now for all the peace - loving Baha 'is in Iran who want only to practice their religion and follow their beliefs .
It 's especially bad for these seven .
Here 's a link to their bios .
They 're teachers , and engineers , and optometrists and social workers just like us .
This thought has become kind of a cliché ' , but we take our rights for granted here in America .
Imagine if a group of people were rounded up and imprisoned and then disappeared not for anything they 'd done , but because they wanted to worship differently than the majority .
There is a resolution on the situation of the Baha 'is in Iran being sent to Congress .
Please ask your representatives to support it .
And ask them to speak out about this terrible situation .
Thanks for reading .
Now back to bears , paper and beets !

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Leading Republicans warned Sunday that the Obama administration 's $ 800 billion - plus economic stimulus effort will lead to what one called a " financial disaster . "
The country will " pay dearly " if it executes the president 's stimulus plans , Sen. Richard Shelby says .
" Everybody on the street in America understands that , " said Sen. Richard Shelby , the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee .
" This is not the right road to go .
We 'll pay dearly . "
Shelby , of Alabama , told CNN's " State of the Union " that the package and efforts to shore up the struggling banking system will put the United States on " a road to financial disaster . "
But Lawrence Summers , the head of the administration 's National Economic Council , said Republicans have lost their credibility on the issue .
Watch Republicans criticize the stimulus bill »
" Those who presided over the last eight years -- the eight years that brought us to the point where we inherit trillions of dollars of deficit , an economy that 's collapsing more rapidly than at any time in the last 50 years -- do n't seem to me in a strong position to lecture about the lessons of history , " Summers told ABC's " This Week . "
President Barack Obama , his advisers and the Democratic leaders of Congress argue the roughly $ 830 billion measure will help pull the U.S. economy out of its current skid .
Much of the package involves infrastructure spending , long - term energy projects and aid to cash - strapped state and local governments .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported last week that the measure is likely to create between 1.3 million and 3.9 million jobs by the end of 2010 , lowering a projected unemployment rate of 8.7 percent by up to 2.1 percentage points .
But the CBO warned the long - term effect of that much government spending over the next decade could " crowd out " private investment , lowering long - term economic growth forecasts by 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent by 2019 .
In a concession to Republicans , about a third of the bill involves tax cuts .
But the measure is expected to have only minimal GOP support when it goes to a scheduled vote early this week .
Watch South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford warn of " disastrous consequences »
The version of the bill that passed the House of Representatives had no Republican votes .
" We need to spend money on infrastructure and on other programs that will immediately put people to work .
But this is not it , " said Sen .
John McCain , R - Arizona , last year 's GOP presidential nominee .
Senators reached a tentative agreement Friday on a compromise bill largely negotiated by a handful of moderate Republicans whose votes are needed to prevent a filibuster .
But McCain told CBS ' " Face the Nation " that the package should have been about half the size of the one now before senators , and should be balanced between tax cuts and spending .
" We 're going to amass the largest debt in the history of this country , by any measurement , and we 're going to ask our kids and grandkids to pay for it , " he said .
The stimulus bill includes about $ 45 billion in transportation spending , much of which can be spent on projects " that can be implemented immediately , " Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood told CNN .
LaHood , a former Republican congressman from Illinois , said he would talk to his former colleagues on Capitol Hill " and do all that I can to persuade them that this bill really will put people to work . "
He said he invited state transportation chiefs to Washington for a Wednesday meeting on how to create jobs using funding from the stimulus bill .
" There are n't going to be any boondoggles .
This money will be spent correctly , by the book , with no shortcuts , " LaHood said .
The administration is also readying a second phase of the financial bailout program launched by the Bush administration last fall .
Shelby said Obama and his advisers need to address the staggering problems in the U.S. banking system first .
" Until we straighten out our banking system , until there is trust in our banking system , until there 's investment there , this economy is going to continue to tank , " he said .
Shelby also has been critical of other efforts by the federal government to help the struggling economy , including legislation that would have provided a bailout to the auto industry .
But Sen. Kent Conrad , the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee , told CBS the current recession -- which has already produced an unemployment rate of 7.6 percent -- is in danger of a deep downturn " like we saw in the Great Depression . "
" If there is a failure to give a significant boost to this economy , this crisis will only deepen and become far more serious , " said Conrad , D - North Dakota .

Phelps arrest backfiring on sheriff , local publisher says Rachel Oswald
Published : Friday February 13 , 2009
Print This Email This Efforts by a South Carolina sheriff to pursue a criminal investigation into Olympic medalist Michael Phelps for smoking marijuana at a college party in November are backfiring , a local newspaper publisher says .
Since the news Wednesday that at least eight individuals have been arrested and questioned about the November party at a house near the University of South Carolina where Phelps was photographed smoking from a bong , public reaction has been less supportive of Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott .
Lotts decision to pursue a criminal investigation is now drawing questioning of why he even bothered .
 I think the general consensus is that it is a waste of taxpayer money and resources if thats what hes focused on ,  said Paul Blake , publisher of Columbias alternative weekly , the Columbia City Paper .
Blake said Lotts investigation into Phelps could be part of a wider publicity effort to bring attention to himself .
 He is an elected official .
I know he might have aspirations to run for governor but I think basically from the people I m talking to that its backfiring ,  Blake said , adding that it all comes down to perspective .
 I think he just thinks hes doing the right thing . "
The sheriffs department declined to comment to Raw Story directly on the investigation into Phelps but released a statement .
" If someone breaks the law in Richland County , we have an obligation as law enforcement to investigate and to bring charges ,  the statement reads .
 The Richland County Sheriff 's Department is making an effort to determine if Mr. Phelps broke the law .
If he did , he will be charged in the same manner as anyone else .
The Sheriff has a responsibility to be fair , to enforce the law and to not turn a blind eye because someone is a celebrity . "
Attorneys for two of the people arrested told the Associated Press that efforts to build a case against Phelps on what could only be at the most a minor drug charge seem extreme compared to similar cases of drug use .
This begs the question if rather than getting special treatment for his celebrity status , Phelps is being penalized by the sheriff because of it .
Two of the men arrested , who have been charged with misdemeanor marijuana possession , told their attorneys that they were questioned almost entirely about Phelps .
The men said the raids were reportedly carried out like a major drug bust with 12 deputies , guns drawn , bursting into the homes .
" The efforts that are being made here are unlike anything I 've ever seen before , " South Carolina defense attorney Jack Swerling told the AP .
" I know Leon Lott , I know him to be an honorable guy .
I 've known him for 30 something years .
But the efforts here are extraordinary on simple possession cases . "
The public is now questioning why Lott is investing the man-hours in pursuing a case against Phelps when , according to the sheriff departments own Web site , Richland County has approximately 55 unsolved homicides going back several decades .
A particularly snarky petition titled  Opposing Sheriff Leon Lott 's Marijuana Prosecutions  is now circulating around the Internet .
As of Friday morning , it had 194 signatures .
 There was no more harm done to the citizens of South Carolina by people smoking marijuana at a party at some point in the past then was done by ten of thousands of South Carolina citizens who were spending time drinking or smoking cigarettes that night .
In fact , from a public health perspective much less harm was done ,  reads the petition .
 There was no general public outcry for justice in this case .
The citizens of South Carolina largely know how silly these arrests are . 
According to the FBIs Crime in the United States statistics , Richland County in 2007 witnessed 2,282 violent crimes including 23 homicides and 90 reported rapes .
According to CNNMoney.com , Columbias personal crime risk of 307 is much higher than the national average of 100 .
In 2006 alone , there were 1,277 personal crime incidents for every 100,000 residents .
Lott was handily reelected to a fourth term as sheriff of Richland County in 2008 .
He first joined the sheriffs department in 1975 as a patrol officer and has been heavily involved in drug crime investigations throughout his career as a narcotics agent and then later as the Captain of Narcotics Division .
As part of the departments tough - on - crime image , Lott oversaw the acquisition last year of an armored personnel carrier .
The APC , which can travel at speeds of 30 miles per hour , was nicknamed  the Peacemaker and purchased from army surplus .
It comes with a turret - mounted .50 - caliber belt - fed machine gun .
The APC is used by the departments Special Response Team , which responds to high - risk crimes .
This fossilized shit is the best evidence that humans were living in North America 14,000 years ago , a millennium before the Clovis people , long thought to be the first Americans .
Researchers from the University of Oregon studied the coprolites , found the crap in a cave in Oregon 's Cascade Range .
After the discovery , scientists at the University of Copenhagen 's Center for Ancient Genetics analyzed DNA retrieved from the fossilized feces .
The research was published today in the journal Science .
From the New York Times :
Few artifacts were found at the cave , the discovery team reported , which suggested that the occupants ' visits were brief …
The researchers reported that 14 coprolites from the cave sediments were identified as being from humans .
The laboratory studies showed that six samples had genetic signatures associated with American Indians and not shared by other groups .

There are said to be about 400 white - owned farms left in Zimbabwe Scores of white - owned farms in Zimbabwe have been invaded since the country 's national unity government took office , a union chief has told the BBC .
Commercial Farmers Union President Trevor Gifford said 77 properties had been occupied in the last fortnight .
MPs , police , the military and Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe officials had taken part in the invasions , he said .
Many of the farmers targeted recently mounted a successful legal challenge to government land reforms , he added .
The BBC attempted to contact a number of officials from President Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party - including the ministers of agriculture and lands - but no - one was available to comment on the farmers ' union claims .
Attempts to contact the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , whose leader Morgan Tsvangirai was sworn in as prime minister earlier this month , were also unsuccessful .
The Southern African Development Community ( Sadc ) Tribunal ruled in November the Zimbabwe government 's programme of seizing white - owned property for redistribution to landless black farmers was discriminatory and illegal .
The government said at the time that it would not comply with the ruling .
' Ethnic cleansing '
The power - sharing deal between Zanu - PF and the MDC was eventually agreed after disputed elections and months of talks , during which the economy slid into a deepening crisis .
Mr Gifford told the BBC News website the recent spate of invasions was focused on the provinces of Mashonaland Central , Mashonaland West , Masvingo and Midlands .
The CFU president blamed the invasions on a minority of figures close to Zanu - PF who were " using their offices to ensure ethnic cleansing can take place before the prime minister is able to stabilise the country " .
" This is being led by members of the old regime in Zanu - PF who are not willing to see the transition take place to a new unity government , " Mr Gifford added .
" Zimbabwe is facing a severe food crisis and we 're in the midst of the agricultural season so the impact of this will worsen the catastrophe . "
More than half Zimbabwe 's population is in need of food aid and inflation - estimated by some economists at 10 sextillion per cent - has left its currency almost worthless .
Mr Gifford said there were about 400 functioning white - owned farms left in Zimbabwe .
Meanwhile , Roy Bennett - the MDC 's nominee for deputy agricultural minister - faces a bail hearing on Tuesday after he was arrested this month accused of terrorism on charges his supporters say are trumped - up .

Banned in Britain UK Denies Entry for Dutch Politician
Britain made good Thursday on its pledge to bar Geert Wilders , a Dutch populist politician who created a film widely viewed as Islamophobic , from entering the country .
Wilders had planned to screen " Fitna " before the House of the Lords .

Early this morning , NASA 's Orbiting Carbon Observatory ( OCO ) attempted to launch into space from Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara County , but as it took off , the payload fairing failed to separate from the vehicle during ascent .
sending it flying back to earth into the ocean near Antarctica .
The $ 270 million two - year project , headed by the folks at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena , would have studied the entire planet 's atmospheric carbon dioxide , looking to find where green house gases are released into and pulled from the air .
" The mission will help scientists determine carbon dioxide 's sources , or the places on Earth where carbon dioxide is being added to the atmosphere , and also its sinks - where it is being removed , " wrote program executive Eric Ianson on his blog .
" The mystery of carbon dioxide is that we know approximately how much carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere each year from human activity , but we can only account for about half of the carbon dioxide that does n’t remain in the atmosphere . "
And that 's the core issue — we basically know where carbon dioxide comes from , but where and how does it all leave , or sink from , the atmosphere ?
" Identifying such sources and sinks will shed light on how carbon circulates from land to air to sea and back again — a process that remains poorly understood , " finds Wired .
" Things could be much worse if it were n't for what are known as carbon sinks :
Sixty percent of the carbon dioxide emitted by man has been absorbed out of the atmosphere .
But scientists are n't sure where most of the sinks responsible are located , or what determines their efficiency over time . "
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Federal judges on Monday tentatively ordered California to release tens of thousands of inmates , up to a third of all prisoners , in the next three years to stop dangerous overcrowding .

As many as 57,000 could be let go if the current population were cut by the maximum percentage considered by a three - judge panel .
Judges said the move could be done without threatening public safety -- and might improve a public safety hazard .
The state immediately said it would appeal the final ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court .
Trend - setting California , the Golden State , has an immense prison system responsible for nearly 170,000 inmates , and their care has become a major political and budget issue as officials weigh multibillion costs of improved facilities against death and illness behind bars .
State officials say new doctors , nurses and prison rules have improved care and cut the dangers of living behind bars .
Meanwhile California is staggering through budget crisis as its real estate market has collapsed and unemployment has spiked .
The three judges specifically said they planned to order the system , swollen to about double its capacity last year , to cut down to 120 percent to 145 percent of capacity within two to three years .
They did not give a target headcount .
APPEAL VOWED
California already houses some inmates out of state .
Its main in - state prisons and camps had more than 157,000 prisoners , or 188 percent of capacity , as of the end of January , according to state figures , and a cut to 120 percent of capacity would mean letting go about 57,000 prisoners .
“ They ’ve told the state , ‘ You ’re going to lose , ’ ” said Alison Hardy , a lawyer with Berkeley , California - based Prison Law Office , which with other attorneys represented plaintiffs who had sued the state over overcrowding in its prisons .
Attorney General Jerry Brown , the former governor , said he would appeal the final ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court .
“ This order , the latest intrusion by the federal judiciary into California ’s prison system , is a blunt instrument that does not recognize the imperatives of public safety , nor the challenges of incarcerating criminals , many of whom are deeply disturbed , ” he said in a statement .
“ There is no doubt that there is room for improvement .
But significant progress has been made and is continuing to be made at a cost of billions , ” he added .
The three judges made the tentative ruling in a bid to get the opposing sides to work together , and they offered a court - appointed settlement referee to aid in discussions .
They did not say when the final ruling would be made but were clear that they considered the system still in trouble despite progress , with inadequate medical facilities and prisoners three to a cell , increasing spread of disease .
“ There is no relief other than a prisoner release order that can remedy the constitutionally inadequate medical and mental health care , ” the panel led by Court of Appeals Judge Stephen Reinhardt , wrote .
“ The state has a number of options , including reform of the earned credit and parole systems , that would serve to reduce the population of the prison to whatever percentage is ultimately determined to be appropriate without adversely affecting public safety , ” the judges wrote .
The panel ordered the state to consult with the prisoners ’ lawyers to consider what actions to take .

" Now there came a day when [ Job ’s ] sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother ’s house ; and a messenger came to Job and said …
` The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants , and I alone have escaped to tell you !’…
While he was yet speaking , another also came and said , ` Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother ’s house , and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house , and it fell on the young people , and they are dead , and I alone have escaped to tell you … . "
~ Job 1:13,16,18
It was neither a demonic wind nor " the fire of God " that destroyed the home of San Diego resident Dong Yun Yoon .
The culprit was a crippled F / A - 18 Hornet fighter jet that spiraled to the ground out of control after its pilot ejected two miles short of the runway at Miramar Air Station .
The pilot survived the experience .
Yoon ’s family did not .
The crash destroyed his home and killed his wife , daughters , and mother - in - law , none of whom arose that morning expecting to become collateral damage in a military training exercise gone lethally wrong .
After receiving word of the tragedy , Yoon , a 37 - year - old immigrant from South Korea , rushed to his home from his job at a retail store near the Mexican border — but by that time his family was gone and his home was in ashes .
Like Job , Yoon was beaten to the ground by the weight of the sudden , inexplicable loss of everything he cared about .
From the depths of his misery , Job displayed astonishing stoicism .
" Naked came I into the world , and naked shall I return , " he from the abyss of his misery .
" The Lord gives , and the Lord takes away .
Blessed be the Name of the Lord . "
Yoon likewise exhibited astonishing composure in dealing with his life - shattering loss .
Referring to the pilot whose actions precipitated the loss of his family , Yoon declared : " I pray for him not to suffer for this action .
I know he ’s one of the treasures for our country . "
Yoon ’s grief is sacred , and his capacity for forgiveness is worthy of emulation .
The pilot who ditched his plane over the University City neighborhood where Yoon ’s family lived certainly did not intend to hurt anybody ; as he was rescued the pilot described seeing his plane hit a house , and was visibly anxious over the possibility that someone had been killed .
That young man — a Marine lieutenant in his twenties — is indeed a treasure , but for a reason other than Yoon ’s remarks suggest .
He is an irreplaceable human being made in the image of his Creator ; he is somebody ’s son , perhaps somebody ’s husband and father .
The pilot ’s value is a product of his humanity , not a function of the job he has chosen or the clothing he wears to work .
The same can be said of Yoon ’s wife , Yong Mi ; his daughters , 15 - month - old Grace and 2 - month - old Rachel ; and his mother - in - law , Suk Im Kim .
Each of them was a treasure of incalculable worth .
None of these individual human lives should have ended on that morning .
But if one could n’t be spared , it was the moral duty of the pilot to sacrifice his own — assuming , of course , that there is a coherent moral code underlying the institutions of American militarism .
We are incessantly ordered to support , sustain , applaud , and pray on behalf of our " troops " — a term that encompasses pretty much any armed individual in a government - issued costume — whose " service " and " sacrifices " supposedly keep us free .
It is impossible for a mind unclouded by official propaganda or poisoned by puerile sentiment to see how our supposed freedom is enhanced by the discretionary killing of distant foreigners who pose no conceivable threat to us .
But the threat to life and limb posed by warplane left pilotless over a residential neighborhood is very easy to understand .
From what is presently known , the Marine pilot had been conducting a training exercise involving an at - sea landing on the USS Abraham Lincoln , which was approximately fifty miles offshore .
On his way back to Miramar , he reported that one of his plane ’s engines failed .
Although the plane can operate on one engine , its condition posed a risk to anyone on the ground in the flight path back to the Air Station .
This lieutenant thus confronted that rarest of things , an opportunity for a member of the US Armed Forces actually to defend the lives of American civilians .
In this case , he could have done so by turning around and attempting to make it back to the Abraham Lincoln , rather than flying over a heavily populated area aboard a stricken fighter jet .
Had he done so , he may have had to ditch his plane in the ocean and dying at sea .
But he would have protected the civilian population , which is supposedly the reason our government has a military in the first place .
I do not mean to suggest that I wish this young man had died .
Four deaths as a result of this incident are too many .
I am underscoring the fact that it would be ethically perverse to suggest that the proper course of action was to sacrifice the lives of four civilians in order to save the life of a Marine .
Furthermore , it ’s important to recognize that civilian pilots faced with similar crises have taken care to minimize the risk to people on the ground .
Nearly nine years ago , Alaska Airlines Flight 261 was en route from Mexico to San Francisco when the MD - 83 jetliner suffered a catastrophic failure in its tail stabilizer .
Owing either to poor maintenance or some bizarre accident , the jackscrew controlling the stabilizer was damaged , and this had the effect of locking it in the " full up " position — which sent the plane into a nose - first dive .
For eleven minutes , Captain Ted Thompson and First Officer William Tansky struggled to save the airliner and its 83 passengers .
Displaying preternatural calm as their wounded aircraft bucked and dove , the pilots consulted with airline maintenance officials and air traffic controllers in search of an answer .
They requested clearance to land at Los Angeles International Airport , specifying that they wanted to remain over the ocean as long as possible during an attempted emergency landing .
That request reflected , among other considerations , the pilots ’ determination to minimize the risk to people on the ground in the event that they were unable to regain control of the jetliner .
And , tragically enough , the plane eventually went into an irreversible dive , corkscrewing its way into the Pacific .
All eighty - eight people aboard that plane perished despite the genuinely heroic efforts of Thompson and Tansky to save it .
A year after the tragedy , the pilots were posthumously awarded the Gold Medal for heroism from the Airline Pilots Association ( ALPA ) , the first time that commendation had been thus awarded .
In explaining the award , ALPA executive vice president Capt .
Cress Bernard explained that Thompson and Tansky had displayed " amazing grace under unbelievable pressure . "
This is not just because they did what they could to save their passengers and crew , but because they had also acted to protect innocent people on the ground .
Doubtless there are some , perhaps many , military pilots who have done likewise in similar circumstances ; such men are eminently worthy of respect .
Mr. Yoon ’s ability to forgive the pilot whose actions led to the death of his family is likewise admirable .
And it should n’t be forgotten that the pilot had no intention to hurt anyone , and was understandably frantic over the possibility that he had .
I am very concerned , however , that Yoon ’s generous gesture will help fortify an already widespread , and thoroughly pernicious , assumption — namely , that those wearing government - issued uniforms are more valuable than the population at large , and should be protected at the cost of civilian lives .
About a quarter - century ago , while reading a movie novelization by the immensely talented award - winning science fiction author Vonda McIntyre , I stumbled across the concept of Rickover ’s Paradox , which was used to test the moral attitudes of officer candidates at the U.S. Naval Academy .
The most famous version of this conundrum , according to McIntyre ( who , when I asked her , could n’t remember where she had encountered it ) , is the following :
Two individuals , the only survivors of a tragic shipwreck , are adrift in a small , damaged lifeboat .
The water is pitilessly cold and infested with ravenous sharks .
The boat itself is irreparably damaged in such a way that it will only be able to carry one of its occupants .
If nothing is done , both occupants will perish .
But whichever is cast into the sea will die very quickly .
One of those aboard the stricken lifeboat is a highly trained military officer with valuable — perhaps irreplaceable — technical skills .
A huge sum has been spent on his training , which is of critical importance since the country is at war .
The other is an innocent and law - abiding person of no particular achievements or aptitudes .
Few if any would notice that person ’s absence , and the community at large would be impoverished in no discernible way if he were thrown overboard .
Since only one can be saved , which of the two should it be ?
The only morally sound answer to this predicament is that the military officer must sacrifice himself on behalf of the civilian .
That , after all , is what he was trained to do , what he had promised when he enlisted .
To do otherwise would be to nullify the entire stated purpose of having a military establishment in the first place .
Any other conclusion would be based on the assumption that the civilian population exists to defend the military , rather than the reverse .
Those serving the Regime under which we live regularly acts on the latter assumption in ways both great and small .
Consider , for example , how frequently the behavior of police ( who are now effectively part of a militarized internal security force ) reflects a paramount concern for " officer safety , " even when that concern leads to the use of military tactics that leave innocent people dead .
Indeed , the fact that the Regime claims the supposed right ( which remains dormant for now ) to conscript people to kill and die on its behalf reflects how deeply entrenched that second assumption has become .
Rather than forcing civilians to sacrifice their lives for the military , conscription forces civilians to surrender their lives to protect the State and those who control it .
In a July 13 , 1863 editorial commending the Lincoln Regime for imposing the draft , the New York Times discarded the usual persiflage about conscription serving some noble purpose and described the matter with unstinting candor .
Describing conscription as " a national blessing " even as a major armed insurrection against the draft raged outside , the Times demanded that Americans recognize " that our national authority has the right under the Constitution to every dollar and every right arm in the country for its protection … . "
( Emphasis added . )
Although we ’re rarely told that our rulers assume we exist to protect them and serve their needs , that assumption is infused into the warp and weave of the Regime .
It is why the mechanism of military slavery ( the so - called Selective Service System ) still exists .
A closely related attitude is made tangible in the ongoing peculation — through inflation , taxation , and other means — of the national wealth in order to bail out politically connected swindlers :
The Regime has committed more than half of this year ’s GDP toward that objective .
Dong
Yoon ’s gracious gesture , offered amid unfathomable grief , will almost certainly become a pseudo - patriotic proverb recited as part of the sacraments of the cult of imperial militarism : " See how nobly this young father , who came to our country in search of freedom , accepted the sacrifice required of his family in the service of that freedom ! "
The unadorned truth , however , is that Yoon ’s family was taken from him needlessly , killed as collateral damage in the routine operations of the Leviathan State .

An extract made from components of red grapes that are regularly discarded by vineyards may dramatically reduce the risk of heart disease , above and beyond the well - known health benefits of red wine , researchers have found .
In a study published in the journal , researchers from Complutense University of Madrid , Spain , produced an extract called Grape Antioxidant Dietary Fiber ( GADF ) from the seeds and skin of red grapes .
For 16 weeks , they added the GADF extract to the meals of 34 non-smoking adults .
By the end of the study , the blood pressure of participants who had taken the GADF extract had gone down by as much as 5 percent , while their total cholesterol levels had decreased by up to 14 percent .
Levels of LDL ( " bad " ) cholesterol had also decreased significantly .
The GADF extract also appeared to improve participants ' lipid profile , which is a measure of heart disease risk based on a variety of cardiovascular tests .
Among the 13 participants with high cholesterol , the cholesterol reductions were even more striking .
High cholesterol patients who took GADF extract experienced a 14.2 pc reduction in total cholesterol and an 11.6 pc decrease in LDL levels .
These cardiovascular benefits were not seen in nine control participants , whose diet was not supplemented with GADF extract .
" GADF showed significant reducing effects in lipid profile and blood pressure , " researcher Jara Perez Jimenez said .
" The effects appear to be higher than the ones caused by other dietary fibers , such as oat fiber or psyllium , probably due to the combined effect of dietary fiber and antioxidants .
" Most heart health supplements are high in either antioxidants or fiber , both of which are known to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease .
GADF extract , however , contains high levels of both .
A single 7.5 gram supplement taken daily , Perez Jimenez said , could increase the average dietary fiber intake of the Western diet 5 to 10 grams over its current average of 20 grams per day .
" Further research on the relative contributions of fibers and flavonoids to prevent cardiovascular disease is needed , " Perez Jimenez said .
Red grapes have long been praised as a heart superfood , largely due to their high content of the antioxidant chemical resveratrol .
Studies have linked resveratrol to increased life span , decreased risk of heart disease and cancer , and reductions in levels of inflammation and blood sugar .
However , resveratrol alone has never been enough to explain the health benefits of diets that include significant quantities of red wine , such as the Mediterranean diet .
The so - called Mediterranean diet is high in whole grains , legumes , fruits and vegetables and fish , and monounsaturated fats .
It contains low to moderate levels of alcohol - particularly red wine - and low levels of red meat , poultry , dairy products and saturated fat .
Numerous studies have shown that people who regularly eat a Mediterranean diet tend to live longer and have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease than those who eat a Western diet low in fruits and vegetables and high in meat , dairy and saturated fat .
The researchers in thestudy have claimed that a GADF supplement could be successfully used to reduce high blood pressure and cholesterol levels in heart patients .
In those who already eat a Mediterranean diet , they said , it could reduce the risk of heart attacks a further 50 percent .
Cardiovascular disease is one of the biggest killers in the Western world , ranking higher than cancer in the United States .
Heart disease alone - not even counting other forms of cardiovascular disease - is responsible for 30 percent of deaths in the United States .
The major causes of cardiovascular disease are insufficient exercise and poor diet , but factors such as air pollution or tobacco smoke can also play a role .

As part of World News America 's ' Notes to Obama ' series , filmmaker John Waters offers his advice to the president - elect .
When we recently posted a Vietnam - era Bolex camera with a rifle stock attached , we thought the concept was a little nuts .
Then Army Reserve Staff Sgt. and wartime photographer Jeffrey Duran set us straight .
Advertisement
In our original post , we speculated that using a gun stock for shooting a camera seemed like a good way for a photographer to get shot .
And we wondered how common these stocks could be .
Duran wrote back with a short , informed response , but I was able to twist his arm into telling us a bit more .
Pointing a long lens mounted on a stock is indeed a recipe for getting shot if you 're not careful .
In fact in training at Fort McCoy , Wi. , I was " shot " by Soldiers on practice missions .
I was not where they expected me to be ... i.e. mixed in with the opposition who happened to be shooting at them at the time .
Thus , I was " shot " at with blanks during the training even though I was in uniform .
They * saw * what they assumed was a rifle in an area where bad guys were shooting at them ..
This , of course , is why we train .
Even as military media , we need to train in realistic conditions .
It was a learning event for both myself and the Soldiers in training .
At Kajaki Dam in Afghanistan , I was there to get some on the ground coverage for the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) and the Afghan National Army .
The Afghan National Army troops there are " spot on " as the Brits say and the dam has great strategic importance .
There are lots of bad guys .
Advertisement
I took my Bushhawk stock along for the ride out to Kajaki .
The stock is of limited use as in remote regions such as this , the local population has never seen a DSLR so they limited trust when you 're pointing a long lens at them .
In operations where we were going patrols or at night with night vision I 'd use it a lot .
However , when going where the bad guys are , there is little worry as I was with some of the best Soldiers in the world .

Okay , so why risk losing your life .
Good question .
Lemme see if I can figure it out .
Ok .
It is an extremely stable platform to shoot pictures with ( i.e. that 's why rifles are designed that way ) .
It is very natural and comfortable which results in good images .
When using long lenses , holding the camera steady is damn important .
Plus , you can sling the camera stock while walking .
This is very important when trying to keep up with Soldiers that are in * much * better shape than you ( lost 20 pounds during the tour ) .
Although I'm a Reservist , there 's only one standard ... so I have the keep up with Olympic - grade athletes when on Active duty .
Monopods work very well but are a pain in the ass when on the move .
You have to open them , then close them when you 're going to roll out .
Which happens unexpectedly at times :)
Handholding with two hands is about the only way and how most of the world gets it done .
I would not advise * any * media in a war zone to use a stock .
In my case , I 'm a member of the armed forces and I 'm with the guys with the guns .
We used to joke about it in that the Taliban would wonder if we bought some some secret weapon since we were the only Americans at Kajaki .
Either way , the bad guys would shoot at me anyway on any patrols with little regard if I had a camera or a rifle .
My main thing was not to make the local population feel threatened ...
I have to say that there is something inherently fun about shooting a camera like a rifle .
It is really more fun than I should admit .
I found myself grinning every time I used the darn thing .
I guess there 's just something obsessive with me and rifle stocks for cameras .
I actually designed one in drafting class in high - school but it was n't until this last tour that I ponied up the cheese to buy one .
It 's just a lot of fun .

A new report from the Center for an Urban Future ( whose previous report , " Attack of the Chains , " sparked a bidding war between Fox and Warner Bros . ) confirms the obvious : the so - called middle class can no longer afford to live in New York and are relocating in large numbers to the exburbs or far - flung cities like Houston , where $ 50,000 a year gets you the same standard of living as a $ 123,322 salary does in Manhattan .
Do n't scoff ; Space City has theater , opera , ballet , air - conditioned skywalks , a Holocaust Museum — even a lively local weblog , just like the one you enjoy here !
But if you 're really determined to make a go of it here in New York , this report [ PDF ] is as sobering as it is unsurprising .
Focusing on data primarily gathered before the economic deathspin went " full Bale , " the study contends it 's not just Manhattan that 's cost - prohibitive to your average working stiff , but the boroughs as well : Queens is the fifth most expensive urban area in the U.S !
Perhaps that 's why twice as many New Yorkers relocated to Philadelphia ( " the sixth borough ! " ) in 2006 than in 2000 .
Or maybe they were just following orders from the Times Style section .
In all , 151,441 residents left the city in 2006 , a 7 % increase over 2002 .
( The overall population increased due to births and immigration . )
And it 's not just working class families ; the number of New Yorkers with bachelor ’s degrees who left the city rose to 29,370 in 2006 , up 127 % from a year earlier .
The report says the problem is that while everything costs significantly more in NYC — home heating costs , for instance , have risen 125 % in the past five years and are up 243 % since 1998 — wages have remained stagnant , even while Wall Street business was booming .
But Joe Salvo , director of the NYC Department of Planning ’s population division , tells Crain 's the study looked at too narrow a time period and did n't consider the people moving to New York .
And speaking to reporters yesterday , Mayor Bloomberg seemed to shrug off the report , noting , " There is turnover all the time .
That ’s very healthy .
We 're doing fine . "
Then , perhaps realizing how that might sound coming from a gazillionaire , he added , " But it is very worrisome , the number of people who are losing their jobs . "

BANGKOK , Thailand ( CNN ) --
A new boatload of Rohingya refugees washed up on the shores of Thailand early Tuesday , raising questions about the type of treatment they would receive .
Male refugees show scars they say were caused by beatings at the hands of the Myanmar navy .
The boat was carrying about 78 people , Thai police said , and many had severe burns from a fire that broke out on board .
Most were members of neighboring Myanmar 's Rohingya minority , which has been fleeing persecution by the country 's hard - line government for years .
Other members of the Rohingya have allegedly been abandoned at sea after being rounded up by Thai authorities .
A recent CNN investigation found evidence that the Thai military towed hundreds of refugees into open waters only to abandon them .
CNN obtained several photos of this activity including one photo that shows the Thai army towing a boatload of some 190 refugees far out to sea .
CNN also interviewed a refugee who said he was one of the few that survived after his group of six rickety boats were towed back to sea and abandoned by Thai authorities in January .
Watch Dan Rivers ' BackStory on the investigation »
The Thai army has denied this allegation , while the Thai government has launched an inquiry .
But one source in the Thai military , after extensive questioning , did confirm to CNN that the Thai army was operating a dump - at - sea policy .
The source defended it , insisting that each boatload of refugees was given sufficient supplies of food and water .
That source claimed local villagers had become afraid of the hundreds of Rohingya arriving each month , accusing the refugees of stealing their property and threatening them .
That source claimed local villagers had become afraid of the hundreds of Rohingya arriving each month , and that they were accusing the refugees of stealing their property and threatening them .
The Rohingya , a minority in Myanmar , have been fleeing their country in make - shift boats for years in search of a better life , and maintain that they are fleeing persecution by the regime in Myanmar , formerly Burma .
The Thai government maintains that " there are no reasonable grounds to believe " that the Rohingya are fleeing Myanmar out of fear of persecution .
" Their profile and their seasonal travel further support the picture that they are illegal migrants , and not those requiring international protection , " it said in a statement released Tuesday by the foreign ministry .
In that statement , the Thai government maintained that its policies in dealing with all illegal migrants are in accordance with its laws and international guidelines .
It said " basic humanitarian needs " are given to the migrants before they are returned home .
" We have upheld our humanitarian tradition and ensured that new arrivals are adequately provided with food , water and medicines , with necessary repairs to their boats , " the ministry 's statement said .
The government noted that Thailand has already been inundated with as many as 20,000 illegal migrants -- most of them Rohingyas -- and " accepting those arriving in an irregular manner would simply encourage new arrivals . "
The government " categorically denied " media reports blaming Thai authorities for mistreating the illegal migrants , and intentionally damaging their boats .
It said it would seriously investigate such cases if any " concrete evidence " is presented .

August Cole reports on the Pentagon .
The nominee for the Defense Department ’s No. 2 job got a pass on President Barack Obama ‘s tough new ethics rules .
After a long stint as a senior Washington operations executive at Raytheon Co. , William J. Lynn is poised to head back to the Pentagon to become the deputy secretary of defense .
He was a registered lobbyist for the giant defense contractor from 2003 through June 2008 .
Peter Orszag , director of the White House Office of Management and Budget , said in a statement that “ it is in the public interest to grant the waiver given Mr. Lynn ’s qualifications for his position and the current national security situation . ”
Specifically , the waiver covers a “ revolving door ban ” designed to address appointees ’ conflicts of interest with former employers or clients during and after their government service .
Sen . Carl Levin , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said he was satisfied with the waiver and expected Lynn will follow the relevant ethics rules .
Sen . John McCain , who lost to Obama in the November election , was less than happy with the waiver .
“ I am disappointed in President Obama ’s decision to waive the ‘ revolving door ’ provisions of the executive order for Mr. Bill Lynn , ” McCain said in a statement .
“ While I applaud the president ’s action to implement new , more stringent ethical rules , I had hoped he would not find it necessary to waive them so soon . ”
Still , McCain did n’t say he would vote for or against the 55 - year - old Raytheon official , adding , “ I intend to ask him to clarify for the record what matters and decisions will require his recusal . ”
Every time I imagine baseball with more bunts and 1 - 0 “ pitching duels , ” my blood goes cold .
If intolerable tedium interested me , I would have turned my attention to soccer or golf years ago .
Baseball ’s singular purpose , some seem to have forgotten , is to entertain us .
So the moral panic surrounding Alex Rodriguez ’s steroid use is unquestionably counterproductive .
If an athlete decides to sacrifice his testicles to the gods of baseball , who am I to object ?
Speaking of which , Congress is once again revving up its un-American war on the home run .
This week , All - Star shortstop Miguel Tejada was charged with lying to Congress about steroids .
Surely , all of us can amass a colossal list of issues the nation ’s top legislative body should probably be tackling before a once - great shortstop .
Now , there is no doubt that the morality and ethics of performance - enhancing drugs need to be debated .
But Washington , where players are treated like former members of the Khmer Rouge , is the last place this discussion can be held .
Moreover , baseball just is n’t that important .
Despite what some fans believe , Fenway Park is n’t a sacred temple , baseball records are not registered in the Book of Deuteronomy and Congress is not the Sanhedrin .
( They wo n’t even let you put an asterisk next to “ Thou shalt have no other gods before me . ” I checked . )
Right now , a doctor somewhere in this country is prescribing steroids for an ailment .
The uses of enhancers is far more complex than your run -of - the - mill didactic senator would have you believe .
And if these drugs have the ability to help an athlete recover from an injury faster — often the stated purpose of professional athletes — why would Major League Baseball ban its usage outright ?
If these drugs can help professional athletes remain more durable , build strength , and enjoy longer careers with negligible health risks , why treat it like crack ?
And if all drugs in sports are evil , why are shots of cortisone handed out like resin bags ?
Despite the overwrought coverage of this issue , there is a dearth of information ( outside of the anecdotal ) about the long - term consequences of performance - enhancing drugs .
With all that said , those who used enhancers after 2002 were , without argument , a bunch of cheaters .
This kind of behavior is supposedly illegal in Major League Baseball .
( “ Supposedly , ” because baseball could easily put an end to the problem today by instituting a real test attached to real consequences . )
A league has the right to define the parameters of competition .
So , yes , A - Rod is a liar , just like Barry Bonds and countless others .
( Worse , he sported a .245 batting average with players in scoring position for my Yankees . )
In 2007 , former Sen. George Mitchell reported that 89 major leaguers were tied to performance - enhancing drugs .
A - Rod was only one of 104 players to test positive for performance - enhancing drugs in 2003 .
Who knows how many players were doping ?
For many , it is the difference between a pedestrian salary and an All - Star check , a place in the majors or a life in the minors , retirement or another record broken .
The incentive is too high and the penalty is too feeble .
But let ’s not forget that we ’re hypocrites , as well .
How many fans who marveled at Mark McGwire ( despite his progressively Lou Ferrigno - ish appearance ) are now feigning outrage ?
It ’s the Sosas , the Bonds , the Giambis we paid to see .
Few fans are interested in plunking down hard - earned cash for a .250 hitter with 15 homers — even if he has that go - get - ’em attitude .
Americans love their home runs . . . always have .
So though you hate the sinner , do not hate the sin .
A home run , after all , is a noble feat .

Microsoft ( MSFT ) has gone and done it , they 've filed suit in U.S. District Court claiming Linux violates their patents .
The case centers on portable GPS device maker Tomtom , which uses Linux in its device .
Despite Microsoft claiming for years that parts of Linux infringe on its intellectual property , the case is believed to be the first time Microsoft has tried to prove a case against Linux in court .
No word yet on the finer points of the dispute , all we know so far is Microsoft claims eight patents were infringed .
Tech Flash surfaced the story :
Five of the patents in dispute relate to in - car navigation technologies , while the other three involve file - management techniques .
Gutierrez said Microsoft has reached licensing agreements with with other in - car navigation vendors over the same patents , and it remains open to " quickly resolving " the TomTom dispute through licensing .
Microsoft has said previously that Linux and other open - source programs violate more than 200 of its patents -- elevating the tension that has long existed between Microsoft and the open - source community .
Asked if this TomTom case is the start of a broader legal campaign over those alleged violations , Gutierrez said no .
" Microsoft respects and appreciates the important role that open - source software plays in our industry and we respect and appreciate the passion and the great contribution that open - source developers make in our industry , " Gutierrez said .
He said that respect and appreciation is " not inconsistent with our respect for intellectual - property rights . "
We 're expecting fireworks before this one is done :
It pits the unstoppable force of Linux advocacy versus the immovable object of Microsoft tenacity .
( CNN ) --
Researchers may be getting closer to an effective way of preventing age - related macular degeneration , one of the leading causes of vision loss among older Americans .
A new study found that vitamins B6 , B12 and folic acid may help prevent age - related macular degeneration .
A new study finds that women who took a combination of B6 and B12 vitamins along with a folic acid supplement had lower risks of developing age - related macular degeneration .
The women who got the supplements , compared with those taking a placebo , had a 34 percent lower risk of developing any form of AMD , and a 41 percent lower risk of more severe forms of AMD .
Epidemiologist and study author William G. Christen , Sc.D. , of Brigham and Women 's Hospital and Harvard Medical School , expects that if these findings are successfully replicated in future studies , " the combination of these vitamins might become the first prevention method of early stages of age - related macular degeneration other than avoiding cigarette smoking . "
Christen also noted that although the study was conducted among women age 40 and older , there is no particular reason to believe the same results would not hold true in a similar group of men .
Christen and his colleagues examined the role of vitamins B6 and B12 and folic acid in AMD partly because previous studies have shown these vitamins are known to lower levels of homocysteine , an amino acid found in the blood that when elevated has been associated with higher risks of AMD .
Visit CNNhealth.com , your connection for better living
The 5,442 women who participated in the randomized , double - blind clinical trial already had heart disease or at least three risk factors for cardiovascular disease .
The majority of them did not have AMD at the start of the study , which lasted more than 7 years .
Christen explains that the underlying mechanism of AMD likely involves the vascular system , and researchers widely believe that cardiovascular disease and AMD share common risk factors .
Age - related macular degeneration is a vision disease common among people older than 60 , involving the deterioration of tissues in the macula , the central part of the retina .
The condition impedes the performance of critical everyday functions such as reading and driving because it affects the ability to see items that a person is looking at directly , as opposed to items even a few degrees off to either side of the direct line of vision .
" If you affect that central part of your vision , no one goes blind from it but it really interferes with your quality of life , " explains Dr. Roy Rubinfeld , ophthalmologist and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology .
There are two types of macular degeneration : wet and dry .
Wet forms of AMD are caused by abnormal blood vessels growing beneath the macula , which can rupture and bleed .
The dry form is generally caused by cells in the macula degenerating over time and thus losing function .
While some treatments do exist for the wet form of the disease ( including laser surgery , photodynamic therapy and injections into the eye ) , there is currently not much in the way of treatments for the more common dry form .
When asked if the study results mean that people at high risk for AMD should begin taking a vitamin supplement that provides vitamins B6 , B12 and folic acid , retina specialist Dr. Robert Frank of the American Academy of Ophthalmology suggests probably not yet .
" If you do anything , I would take a supplement of antioxidant vitamins containing high doses of vitamins A , E , C and zinc , " suggests Frank , who has no financial interest in the vitamin supplement industry .
These antioxidant vitamins were found to prevent the progression of age - related macular degeneration in the 10 - year Age - Related Eye Disease Study conducted by the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health .
However , Frank does say that while it still remains to be seen whether people currently taking a multivitamin containing the B vitamins and folic acid will be able to prevent early AMD from developing -- answers which will probably not be found for several years , after a large - scale clinical trial is begun -- there is little risk for most people in taking a daily multivitamin .

Yesterday , ( edit : thus , 2009 - 02 - 26 ) Microsoft attacked free software and GNU / Linux users with software patent claims against the Tom Tom Navigator and its implementation of the FAT file system .
But do they have a sword or a wet rag ?
There have been interesting patent rejections coming from the USPTO ’s Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences ( BPAI ) since the Bilski ruling was handed down by an en banc hearing of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ( CAFC ) .
One is the rejection of one of IBM ’s database query patents .
It was rejected because the innovation is n’t “ tied to a particular machine ” .
So it ’s a happy coincidence that MS claims their technology is running on all sorts of devices .
Foot , meet mouth .
The BPAI goes on to justify the rejection by pointing out that the “ system ” on which the innovation operates is “ not recited in terms of hardware or tangible structural elements ” , which is to say that the patent is rejected because the elements of the claim are “ implemented solely in software or algorithms ” .
Does the FAT patent about converting long filenames to short filenames sound like it would pass any of these tests ?
The Bilski court case was the focus of EndSoftwarePatents in 2008 under Ben Klemens ’ direction .
Great to see that work bear fruit .
100×20-digg-button.png
With widespread support for GNU / Linux becoming a reality , are these patent claims an attempt to chill adoption by spreading fear , uncertainty and doubt ( FUD ) ?
If so , then we need to make sure everyone knows about Bilski .

New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd has written a column ( January 28 , 2009 ) full of withering hatred and contempt for many of today 's most prominent businessmen , first and foremost the heads of the Wall Street Banks .
She singles out Citigroup and Merrill Lynch in particular , denouncing the first for going ahead with taking delivery of a $ 50 million luxury jet at the very time the firm was losing billions , and the last CEO of the second , John Thain , for spending $ 1 million to redecorate his office , also in the midst of his firm 's suffering major losses .
Her column leaves the reader with a view of these people and , by implication , of practically the whole economic class to which they belong , i.e. , virtually all businessmen and capitalists , as having a mentality that combines the worst features of Marie Antoinette and Nero .
The former , of course , was Queen of France until 1793 , when she was beheaded .
She is famous for allegedly having said in response to being informed of the peasantry 's lack of bread , " Let them eat cake . "
And Nero was the Roman emperor who is known for having fiddled while Rome burned , and who died in 68 AD , committing suicide when he learned that the Roman Senate had ordered that he be flogged to death .
Having led her readers to such an assessment of these people , she concludes her column with the declaration , " Bring on the shackles .
Let the show trials begin . "
If they do begin , Dowd will be there , perhaps with knitting needles , in the role of a modern - day Madame Defarge , the Dickens character who knitted while watching aristocrats being guillotined during the French Revolution .
The day after Dowd 's column appeared , a news story in The Times reported that , " Despite crippling losses , multibillion - dollar bailouts and the passing of some of the most prominent names in the business , employees at financial companies in New York , the now - diminished world capital of capital , collected an estimated $ 18.4 billion in bonuses for the year .
That was the sixth - largest haul on record , according to a report released Wednesday by the New York State comptroller . "
The day after that , President Obama called the bonuses " shameful . "
The Fate of Capitalism
It is very easy to interpret the kind of facts that have been described , as an indictment of the capitalist system , which is exactly how they are being interpreted .
Millions of people have lost their jobs ; millions more fear that they will lose theirs .
These millions cannot avoid the further fear that they and their families will be utterly impoverished .
And they are being led to blame their losses on capitalism , in large part by being led to blame it on the persons of individual businessmen or capitalists whom they perceive as hateful .
What is present and being inflamed is the psychology of an angry mob .
Its sympathies are with innocent victims who have suffered a great wrong .
It 's sure it knows who is responsible and how .
The next step will be for someone to yell , " Get a rope ! "
Already , businessmen and capitalists are starting to cower in fear .
Corporations are racing to get rid of their private jets .
Next it will be their private dining rooms and limousines .
Private profit and personal luxury at any level are in danger before the onslaught of a collectivist mentality that holds that if many are suffering , all must suffer , and , further , that those who do not suffer are responsible for the suffering of those who do .
Anyone whose head is above the crowd will risk being a target .
This is the time for everyone to recall whatever instances in his life that he remembers when angry mobs turned out to be wrong .
Perhaps it 's only a scene from a movie or book , in which someone is able to present a few facts that the mob does n't know and that begin to place things in a different , calmer light .
Let me be that someone now and begin with one very important and fundamental relevant fact .
Today 's Economic System Is A " Mixed Economy , " Not Laissez - Faire Capitalism
And that is that even if all of the facts as presented were absolutely true , it would not imply any reason whatever to condemn capitalism .
Capitalism is a system in which absurd , self - destructive behavior severely punishes whoever is guilty of it .
Such people suffer losses , go bankrupt , and lose their ability to have significant further economic influence .
Their example then serves as a lesson to others to avoid such behavior .
However , we are very far from having capitalism today , certainly not capitalism in its logically consistent form of laissez - faire capitalism .
What we have today is a " mixed economy , " that is , a severely hampered , distorted form of capitalism .
In such a system , such behavior can continue , thanks to government subsidies , grants of monopoly privilege and suppression of competition , and now by means of government " bailouts . "
A mixed economy is an economy which remains capitalistic in its basic structure , but in which the government extensively intervenes with the initiation of physical force to compel actions that are against the interest of individuals and / or to prohibit actions that are in the interest of individuals .
For example , today it compels people to pay an income tax , which is against their interest but which they pay in order to stay out of jail .
It also prohibits them from engaging in various business mergers or paying wages below a certain amount , things which it would be to their interest to do but now do not , because they wish to avoid being fined or imprisoned .
( In my recent article " The Myth that Laissez Faire Is Responsible for Our Financial Crisis , " I present an extensive description of the extent of government intervention . )
A mixed economy lacks the fundamental moral - political principles that are needed to determine what is proper or improper for a government to do .
Its only principle , if one can call it that , is that the government can do anything that enough people believe will accomplish what they think is " good , " according to an undefined standard .
Our mixed economy rests on the effective discarding of the United States Constitution , which placed severe limits on government power and thus stood as a bulwark in defense of an economic system that was almost one of laissez - faire .
The Constitutional protections were discarded by a process of pretending that the Constitution could somehow " grow " or " evolve , " which actually meant nothing other than choosing to ignore it .
In a mixed economy , every significant - sized business must fear what the government can do to it .
It needs protection , in the form of political connections .
It secures these through appointing former government officials to its board of directors , paying such officials lavish consulting fees , and giving lavish campaign contributions to candidates for public office .
In these ways it buys the protection it needs .
But soon businesses learn that their protectors can also be used to gain lucrative government contracts , government subsidies , and monopolistic privileges ranging from tariffs and licensing laws to antitrust suits against competitors .
Thus , it is not long before the upper echelons of large firms become populated not only with men who cower before the government but also with those who seek to manipulate the government to their advantage , which is where we are today .
Certainly not all big businessmen are this way , and probably only a few of those that are , are so through and through .
For the most part , they still have real jobs to do in running their companies , and to the extent they simply do those jobs , they are productive .
But probably most big businessmen are morally compromised if only because they must live in fear of the government and are helpless to do anything about it .
Responsibility for the Financial Crisis
There is a sense in which an important sub - group of businessmen does have genuine responsibility for the present economic crisis and for all previous crises of financial contraction and deflation .
This is the sub - group of commercial bankers .
Ironically , the way in which they have been responsible is by means of doing something that almost everyone very much wants them to do , above all , the government , and even when the crisis comes , still wants them to do or to get back to doing as soon as possible .
This something is the practice of credit expansion .
Credit expansion is the lending out of new and additional money that is created out of thin air , with the encouragement and support of the government .
Governments value and encourage credit expansion both in the mistaken belief that it is a source of prosperity and in the knowledge that it is a ready source of money to finance government spending .
Credit expansion is what creates a delusion of prosperity while it lasts and economic depression when it ends .
It is all that needs to be stopped to end the boom - bust cycle .
( In this brief article , I must ask the reader who wants to understand the process , and how to stop it , to be content merely with references to further reading , namely , Chapters XX and XXXI of Ludwig von Mises 's Human Action and Chapters 12 and 19 of my own Capitalism : A Treatise on Economics .
Concerning the role of credit expansion in our present crisis in particular , please see my articles " The Myth that Laissez Faire Is Responsible for Our Financial Crisis , " " Our Financial House of Cards and How to Start Replacing It With Solid Gold , " and " The Housing Bubble and the Credit Crunch . " )
I want now to deal with the subjects of bonuses and corporate jets .
Bonuses
Granting bonuses to employees and buying jet planes are perfectly legitimate for private business firms .
In today 's context , this means firms that have not received government bailout money .
Giving bonuses and buying jet planes are purely business decisions .
It 's only a question of whether the bonuses motivate the employees who receive them to bring in profits to the firm that are greater than the bonuses paid , or not .
If the answer is yes , then it makes sense to pay the bonuses .
To the chief executive of a privately owned , non-taxpayer supported Wall Street firm , the payment of bonuses even in a year of calamitous losses may appear as still making economic sense , at least if the firm expects to stay in business .
This is because the bonuses are not paid to people who have incurred the firm 's losses .
Those losses are in the assets the firm owns .
They are not in its day - to - day trading operations , which may continue to be profitable .
The situation is analogous to that of a retail chain which has had massive losses because of such things as fire or hurricane damage to its warehouses , but whose stores are still making money .
The Wall Street firm is still executing customers ' orders in buying and selling securities , it is still trading in currencies and in the futures markets , and still arranging mergers and acquisitions , and divestitures and breakups .
All of these aspects of its business may well still be profitable .
The brokers and traders , the mortgage and acquisition specialists et al. , and their various assistants and supporting staffs , have contributed very substantially to these operating profits .
The same is true of many of the economic and financial researchers and analysts that the firm employs in connection with its still profitable operations .
Money is set aside out of the year - end totals to pay bonuses to the members of such groups , based on their respective individual profitability .
The bonuses are accumulated employee compensation , similar in nature to the commissions paid to retail sales clerks .
If the firm expects to be in business in the following year , and wants to retain the services of these employees , who , despite the firm 's massive losses in its accumulated assets , have performed well , it probably needs to pay them their bonuses .
John
Thain , the then president of Merrill Lynch tried to explain this fact to an interviewer , when he said , " If you do n't pay your best people , you will destroy your franchise " and they 'll go elsewhere , he said .
Ms. Dowd apparently does not know the difference between an operating profit and a balance - sheet loss .
She apparently does not know the difference between the due of a successful salesman in a retail - store and the due of someone whose actions have served to burn down the store 's warehouse .
But she does know how to be furious .
She responded to this explanation by exclaiming :
Hello ?
They destroyed the franchise .
Let 's call their bluff .
Let 's see what a great job market it is for the geniuses of capitalism who lost $ 15 billion in three months and helped usher in socialism .
Despite her ignorance and her collectivism - inspired refusal to draw distinctions between individuals and their respective individual performances and responsibilities , Ms. Dowd does have something of a point .
Namely , if because of the bankruptcy and closing of many Wall Street firms , there should be a glut of brokers and traders et al. , then the remaining Wall Street firms would be in a position to reduce their compensation .
But that would be something they would typically announce before the fact , not after the fact of an agreed - upon compensation having been earned .
My discussion of bonuses was in the context of the operations of a privately owned business firm , not one that has to be financially supported by the government and is operated with funds provided by taxpayers .
In awarding bonuses after Merrill Lynch 's receipt of government bailout money , which started in September of 2008 , Mr. Thain did not realize that he was no longer in charge of a private firm .
He did not realize what difference this made to the fundamental character of his firm .
Neither did very many other people at the time .
But more on this later .
Corporate Jets
I turn now to the subject of corporate jets .
If a corporation can afford to buy a jet and having it will enable extremely high - paid executives to avoid wasting time waiting at airports and be able to be more efficient in working in the time spent in flight , then over time its purchase may actually save more money than it costs .
If so , then it will be a good business decision to buy the plane .
It may even be a good business decision to buy it , if the executives who fly in it simply prefer it because it 's more comfortable and enjoyable .
In such a case , even if the plane saves nothing in costs or not enough to justify its purchase , it can still make good economic sense for the firm to buy the plane .
This will be the case if it is in a position to reduce the compensation paid to the executives in question by as much or more than the amount that it must expend for their personal benefit .
Thus , for example , if the plane falls short of covering its cost through increased productivity on the part of the executives by , say , $ 1 million per year , the firm will have the benefit of more satisfied executives at absolutely no net cost to itself , if it gets the executives to accept $ 1 million less per year in monetary compensation .
In that way , it is the executives who effectively bear the cost of the plane that is otherwise uncovered .
And the firm will have whatever indirect monetary gains that may result from better satisfied executives .
Indeed , to the extent that the executives are willing to forgo an amount of compensation that is greater than what is required to cover any otherwise uncovered cost of the plane , the firm has a clear saving in monetary terms .
Thus , if the executives can be paid $ 2 million less per year , while the otherwise uncovered part of the cost of the plane is still $ 1 million , the firm has a monetary saving of $ 1 million per year by buying the plane .
( Today 's tax laws work in this direction .
The replacement of $ 1 million in monetary compensation with $ 1 million in indirect compensation , serves to reduce the executives ' after - tax monetary compensation by perhaps as little as $ 500 thousand , while saving the corporation the full $ 1 million . )
Situations such as this actually occur all the time , throughout business .
Again and again , firms provide fringe benefits that are of value to their employees but which do not cover their cost through increased productivity .
They are motivated to provide them by being able to save more in what they would otherwise have to pay the employees in take - home wages than the cost of the fringe benefits .
For example , imagine the situation of employees having to choose between two employers .
One of them provides air conditioning .
The other does not .
In the heat of summer , it is a comparative pleasure to work for the one , and extremely uncomfortable to work for the other .
If the employees can earn $ 1,000 per week by working for the employer who provides air conditioning , and they value that air condition sufficiently , then in order to be induced to work for the second employer , they might require a wage of $ 1,100 per week .
If that second employer can provide air conditioning at a cost to himself of , say , $ 10 per worker per week , then he will save $ 90 per worker per week if he provides it .
Because in that case , he can obtain his workers for a take - home wage of $ 1,000 plus an air - conditioning cost of $ 10 , instead of for a take - home wage of $ 1,100 plus no cost on account of air conditioning .
Obviously , such conditions compel the employer to provide air conditioning .
It is his recognition of such conditions that led the first employer to provide air conditioning to begin with , i.e. , simply because employees value having it far more than the reduction in their take - home wages that is needed to pay for it .
This discussion has application to the $ 1 million office remodeling that so offended Ms. Dowd .
Please keep in mind that the remodeling was commissioned in late 2007 , when the executive in question started his position .
At that time , Merrill Lynch had not yet received any government money and was thus still a fully privately owned company .
The executive in question , John Thain , was a man in charge of the use of hundreds of billions of dollars of capital .
And , therefore , if he was indeed the right man for the job , which is certainly what was hoped , he was easily entitled to compensation at least as far into double - digit millions as that paid to Hollywood movie stars and leading athletes .
With this many millions in compensation , the value to him of $ 1 million more or less , may not have been terribly great .
( Hollywood stars have weddings that cost more . )
It may well have been far below the value he attached to spending his hours of working time in an office that was made to personally please him in every possible respect , and which he may have expected to occupy for many years .
In such a case , instead of his firm paying him however many millions it otherwise would have paid him , it could pay him a million dollars less , or even more than a million dollars less .
In that case , it was he who bore the cost of the office , out of compensation to which , in the judgment of the parties concerned , he was entitled .
Alternatively , it 's entirely reasonable that providing such an office and the optimum working environment that it provided , could be expected to improve his efficiency with respect to deciding the pattern of investment of his firm 's hundreds of billions of dollars of assets .
It would not have taken a great deal of such improvement with respect to the use of sums so vast to be able to earn an additional billion or more of profit for his firm .
Understanding this , the firm may well have given him his office in the belief that doing so would add vastly more to its profits than the cost of the remodeling .
When Ms. Dowd discussed this million - dollar office remodeling , her reaction was one of incredulity , outrage , and utter contempt .
Here 's what she said ( referring to an interviewer of the executive ) :
Bartiromo pressed :
What was wrong with the office of his predecessor , Stanley O'Neal ?
' Well — his office was very different — than — the — the general décor of — Merrill 's offices , ' Thain replied .
' It really would have been — very difficult — for — me to use it in the form that it was in . '
Dowd then asked in a triumph akin to that of crushing a cockroach :
Did it have a desk and a phone ?
I can't help wondering , if when Dowd may need a surgical operation someday , she will be satisfied if her surgeon has a table and a knife .
Bailouts
Government bailouts put everything in a different light .
They give everyone in the country the right to second guess every decision of the firms that have received the bailouts , on the grounds that the money used by those firms is theirs , the taxpayers .
Understandably , the taxpayers become furious about things like bonuses , corporate jets , and expensive office remodelings .
They see themselves simply as being made to pay for these things .
This is because , unlike the shareholders of a private company , the taxpayers will never have any possible financial benefit even if the expenditures might actually be perfectly reasonable and well made if they took place in the context of a privately owned company .
And unlike the shareholders of a private company , they were never given a choice about whether or not they wanted their funds to be turned over to this or that company .
Their funds were simply seized in order that others might have the means with which to pay bonuses and financially profit from and / or personally enjoy such things as corporate jets and expensive offices .
Bailouts represent a collision between two incompatible modes of operation — between what Mises calls " profit management " and " bureaucratic management . "
That is , they represent a collision between operation according to the principle of striving to make profits and avoid losses , which characterizes private business , and operation according to the dictates of rules and regulations , which characterizes government .
The companies bailed out expected to go on operating as private businesses , but with government money .
That 's how the bailouts were advertised .
But that is impossible .
Once government money enters the picture , the firms are effectively nationalized , even though the outward guise and appearance of private ownership may remain .
This is because their operations are no longer based on profit - and - loss considerations but on satisfying the government and whatever sectors of public opinion are loud enough at the moment to influence the government 's decisions .
What precise actions the government will take are unclear at the moment and appear contradictory .
For example , the front - page lead article of The New York Times of February 5 , 2009 carries the headline " Executive Pay Limits Seek to Alter Corporate Culture , " followed by the subhead , " Obama Announces a $ 500,000 Cash Cap at Companies Getting Future Aid . "
Nevertheless , a careful reading of the article shows that $ 500,000 is a limit only on annual salary .
Payment of stock options will still be possible , but they will not be able to be exercised until all of the company 's debt to the government is repaid .
Even the limit on annual salary appears to be not very firm .
In most cases , it can apparently be waived by means of a " nonbinding shareholder vote . "
The article declares ,
Even the new rules allow companies some leeway .
While giving shareholders a say in bonuses above the cap and restricting when stock incentives can be cashed in , the rules do not place limits on the size of such awards , which have become the biggest part of many compensation packages .
In addition , the toughest new rules apply only to large companies seeking government assistance to survive … .
And companies that seek aid but do not need exceptional government assistance can waive the $ 500,000 pay cap , as long as they submit their executive pay policies to a nonbinding shareholder vote .
Very significantly , the article notes that
The rules would not prohibit a lower - level executive , like a stock trader or investment banker , from continuing to receive tens of millions of dollars in pay .
( My italics . )
If this last is true , then one must wonder exactly what the brouhaha about bonuses was all about in the first place .
Because , with this last provision , they appear to be back in , almost in full force .
The current version of the proposed pay caps is clearly contradictory and bound to disappoint Wall Street 's critics .
It reads like a compromise forged of a competition between whose lobbyists could get to which politicos with the largest bribes or greatest threats first .
At this point , there is no telling what the final proposal will look like .
The Times 's article notes that " Officials also emphasized that several of the proposals would not be made final until after public comments had been considered . "
What would be required to satisfy the rhetoric of Wall Street 's critics would be the total abolition of bonuses and a maximum limit on total executive compensation in the nationalized firms to $ 500,000 for any one individual .
That , of course , would mean the destruction of the nationalized firms as viable institutions .
With such a level of compensation , further discussion of such things as corporate jets and expensive office remodelings would disappear , at least as far as the nationalized firms were concerned .
This is because the low pay ceilings on executive salaries , and thus the kind of low quality executives likely to be attracted , would eliminate the context in which an economic calculation could justify the purchase of a jet or an expensive office remodeling .
Executives whose salaries are limited to $ 500,000 are not going to be able to afford to accept the kind of reduction in take - home wages that would be necessary to cover any significant part of the cost of providing a jet or an expensive office remodeling .
Nor is any enhanced productivity of such executives likely to be great enough to justify the cost .
The head of a government controlled firm may inherit a luxurious office but all that he can afford or that can be afforded on his behalf is not very much more than a desk and a phone — and volumes of rules and regulations that he can consult and scrupulously follow , in order to be able to prove that whatever losses may strike his firm were not his fault .
But the destruction of bailouts is not limited to the crippling of the firms that are bailed out .
It also taints the operations of the firms that are operating without bailouts .
As already pointed out , they too have given up their jets and are keeping their heads down , despite the fact that economic rationality implies that they should keep their jets .
They have been cowed by a raging hostility toward capitalism and wealth .
Symbolism
I quote the words of a prominent New York Times reporter , who sees the facts of the situation , even describes some that I omitted , and yet approves of what has happened .
He writes :
When you get right down to it , the purchase of a new plane or an office renovation is pretty meaningless for companies as large as Citigroup or Bank of America [ Merrill Lynch is now part of Bank of America ] .
It 's not unheard of for executives to spend $ 1 million or more on remodeling when they get the corner office .
It 's pocket change .
And companies can usually make a halfway decent business case to justify a new airplane .
( It goes longer distances than older planes , can take more executives to meetings , allows the top brass to be more efficient and productive , etc. , etc . )
The question of whether bailout money was used to pay for these perks — as alleged by The New York Post , which broke the Citi airplane story — is , at best , ambiguous .
Indeed , breaking the airplane contract and sending the jet back to the manufacturer will probably cost the bank more than keeping the plane .
None of that matters .
You could make the same argument about the auto executives who flew on corporate jets when they came to Washington to ask Congress for help : surely , it was a better use of their time to fly rather than drive from Detroit , as they did the second time around , after being spanked for taking the jets .
That did n't matter either .
What matters is the symbolism .
At a time when the country is in such trouble — and executives are asking for bailouts — anything that smacks of plutocracy is going to arouse justifiable populist anger .
( Joe Nocera , " It 's Not the Bonus Money .
It 's the Principle , " New York Times , January 31 , 2009 , p. B1 .
My italics . )
So here we have it .
What the outrage is really all about is the hatred of great wealth and its possessors .
The goal is to attack them in the name of an alleged duty of the individual to sacrifice his wealth , pleasure , and enjoyment , and ultimately his life , for the benefit of others less fortunate .
Seen in this light , the furor raised about corporate jets , office remodelings , and the like is understandable .
It is the kind of symbolism appropriate to a campaign on behalf of self - sacrifice and against the pursuit of happiness .
In sharpest contrast and opposition to the philosophy of self - sacrifice and to the role of government as the enforcer of sacrifice , stand these famous lines :
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . —
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men… .
These words are from the Declaration of Independence , which is the founding document of the United States .
Their meaning is that the United States was established for the purpose of securing the right of the individual to pursue his own happiness , which includes material prosperity .
In the United States , the individual and his rights are supreme .
Government exists only in a subordinate role , that of a servant dedicated to protecting and securing the individual and his rights from the aggression of common criminals at home and of despots abroad .
What symbolism would be appropriate to this conception of the relationship between the citizens and their government ?
How would it differ from the present such symbolism ?
The present symbolism depicting the relationship between the government and the citizen is that the head of the government , the President of the United States , has at his disposal , with no objection from anyone , Air Force One , which is a Boeing 747 jet plane that costs hundreds of millions of dollars and , when configured for commercial operation , carries more than 450 passengers .
At the same time , howls of anger and fury go up when one of the largest private corporations in the country dares to order a 12 - seat jet plane for $ 50 million .
The acceptance of this relationship symbolizes the total reversal of the relationship between government and citizen that the founding of our country was intended to establish and maintain .
The symbolism appropriate to that relationship would be that while private citizens are free to fly in 747s , or Lunar Landers for that matter , depending only on how successful is their individual pursuit of happiness , the President of the country , who is merely the chief night watchman of the nation , and is its servant , is consigned to a 12 - seater jet .
Of course , this is not to begrudge the President of the United States the use of a 747 in today 's world , in which he may require such a plane merely in order to have necessary means of communication at his disposal .
But it is to remind all those seeking to deify the government and raise it above the citizens , that they are encouraging a servant to forget his place and to become the master of those whom it is his duty to serve .
Dear Cecil :
The recent item on your Web site about gentiles who have visited the holy places of the Mormons got me thinking .
Have any non-Muslims ever visited Mecca , the holiest city of Islam , which is forbidden to infidels ?
Curious in Diego Garcia
Cecil replies :
Oh , sure , plenty , but one in particular stands out .
If we unbelievers had to elect one guy to represent us in defiling Islam ’s most sacred sites … eh , not the most diplomatic way of putting it .
If there were one outsider whom Allah would have allowed to see the Kaaba without having his gizzard handed to him , it ’s this man : Richard Francis Burton ( 1821 - ’90 — no relation to the actor ) , a legendary adventurer , scholar , and ( I realize this is an abrupt segue ) sexual explorer .
Not only did he visit Mecca , he translated the Kama Sutra with the confidence of one who ’d been there , done that .
Like T.E. Lawrence , Burton was one of those brilliant eccentrics without whom , one suspects , the British Empire would have collapsed in a week .
An athletic , rowdy youth , he had an extraordinary facility with languages — he could master one in a few months .
( Eventually he learned 25 — 40 including dialects . )
Thrown out of Oxford after a year for disciplinary infractions , he joined the military and was posted to India , where he demonstrated a knack for the undercover operations Kipling later termed the Great Game .
A strikingly handsome man of Gypsy - like appearance , he used his command of language and talent for disguise to blend effortlessly into the native population , passing himself off as a merchant or religious wanderer as the occasion dictated , sometimes on missions for his imperial employers and sometimes just for sport .
He was fascinated with Eastern religions , ostensibly becoming at various times a Hindu Brahman , a Sikh , and a Sufi , among other things .
A prolific writer , he produced 43 books , many of them acute observations of local cultures that were much admired by subsequent anthropologists and ethnographers .
He also embraced Eastern sexual practices , taking concubines , frequenting brothels , and later in life translating the erotic classics .
But you asked about Mecca .
Having left India under a cloud — supposedly a report he was ordered to write on the homosexual brothels of Karachi implicated high - ranking British officials — Burton repaired to Europe for a few years of R and R .
There he cultivated the idea of visiting Mecca , which he proceeded to do in 1853 , disguised as an Afghan Muslim .
Strictly speaking , he may not have been a non-Muslim ; although he adopted many Eastern religious trappings as a convenience and was habitually opaque regarding his true feelings , he wrote warmly about Islam and may have considered himself an adherent .
( For what it ’s worth , Muslims do n’t seem to have held the trip against him . )
Nor was he the first European to make the pilgrimage and live .
Nonetheless , he took a considerable risk : although he had a servant and made friends along the way , he was essentially on his own .
His six - month journey involved a lengthy passage through country overrun by bandits , and his party was attacked on several occasions .
But Burton pulled it off .
He reached Medina and then Mecca , kissed the sacred black stone , inspected the Kaaba , paced off measurements , made drawings , did everything but carve his name on the Prophet ’s tomb , taking care at all times to adhere to the religious formalities and displaying a coolness and presence of mind at which this brief account can only hint .
When news of his exploit emerged upon his return , he was lionized in the press , and he remained a celebrity the rest of his life .
There ’s a great deal more to his story , but it would take a fat book to tell it ( and has , several times over ) .
Burton became the first European to visit the forbidden eastern African city of Harar , sought the source of the White Nile , visited Salt Lake City to write about the Mormons , served in various posts for the British foreign office , wrote books on an astonishing variety of subjects ( although the ones on sex naturally garnered the greatest interest ) , published an unexpurgated translation of The Arabian Nights that ’s still considered a classic , and generally scandalized his fellow Victorians .
He also married a devout Roman Catholic and was knighted ( go figure ) .
I make no special claims for his character : he was a bigot , a snob , and a reactionary , and for all his fascination with sex , seems to have had only superficial relationships with women .
Nonetheless , he lived a life that we whose idea of adventure is bungee jumping can only regard with awe .

Researchers have solved the first step in treating the common cold , by mapping its entire genome , or genetic map , teams from the University of Maryland and the University of Wisconsin - Madison reported Thursday .
The common cold , also known as the human rhinovirus infection
" We have the pieces all in place .
They can't go in any other way .
Now we have to understand what the pictures are telling us , " said Dr. Stephen B. Liggett , professor of medicine and physiology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and director of its Cardiopulmonary Genomics Program .
The research was published in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday afternoon .
' American Morning ' Dr. Sanjay Gupta reports on the cold genome
Friday , 6 a.m. ET on CNN see full schedule »
Technically known as the human rhinovirus infection , the common cold is responsible for half of all asthma attacks and is a factor in bronchitis , sinusitis , middle - ear infections and pneumonia .
The coughs , sneezes and sniffles of colds impose a major health care burden in the United States -- including visits to health care providers , cost of over - the - counter drugs for symptom relief , often - inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions and missed work days -- with direct and indirect costs of about $ 60 billion annually .
How mapping the cold genome may lead to a cure »
" We generally think of colds as a nuisance , but they can be debilitating in the very young and in older individuals and can trigger asthma attacks at any age , " Liggett said .
" Also , recent studies indicate that early ... infection in children can program their immune system to develop asthma by adolescence . "
Finding a cure for the common cold has been elusive .
That 's because the rhinovirus is so complex .
Made up of at least 99 different strains , it can infect different people with different symptoms .
Visit CNNhealth.com , your connection for better living .
By mapping the genome of the common cold and assembling the results into a " family tree , " scientists can see how the virus strains are related , as well as their differences .
Liggett , who is also the study 's senior author , says this is a breakthrough in solving the common cold puzzle because .
" At least now we have an understanding of which virus one might have . "
Now that the pieces are together , drug companies can work on developing new treatments that would either halt or prevent the cold virus before it begins to spread .

Researchers found that human rhinoviruses are organized into about 15 small groups .
So the idea of one drug fits all probably wo n't work , Liggett says .
" Our mindset right now is to consider more along the antiviral treatment , rather than vaccines , but always keep an open mind to the new technology of vaccine development . "
Investigators are so optimistic with their findings that they predict the development of new drugs within the next two to five years , depending on Food and Drug Administration approval , which could mean one day soon , runny noses caused by colds may be a thing of the past .

Mississippi lawmakers have passed a bill to protect the state ’s residents during martial law .
On the Office of the Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi website , Phil Bryant announces the passage of SB 2036 .
The legislation “ restricts the power of a peace officer to confiscate firearms and ammunitions in an emergency or during a time of martial law , ” according to the website .
Senator Merle Flowers
It is significant that Lieutenant Governor Bryant mentions the law applies to martial law .
Mississippi senator Merle Flowers authored the bill and referred it to the Judiciary on January 6 .
It passed the Senate on February 4 .
According to the Mississippi bill status website , the act amends Section 33-7-303 of Mississippi Code of 1972 and “ explicitly restrict the power to confiscate firearms and ammunitions in an emergency . ”
Mississippi passes the law reaffirming the Second Amendment at approximately the same time a number of states are introducing and passing resolutions and bills declaring sovereignty from the federal government and buttressing the Tenth Amendment .

We are in the habit of taking beer suggestions from friends .
Taking someone 's word on a beer can be a dangerous proposition , but much like America 's slow transition to thinking of sushi as something appetizing and not as something that could potentially be a hot bed for dining free from sanitation , it can be tragic to never know .
With this thought firmly in hand , we took a fellow suds - guzzling comrade to ye old beer shoppe to have him assist us in choosing a beer for this week 's review .
The result : Maudite , a concoction brewed by Unibroue in Chambly , Quebec .
Yet as our dear friend handed us a 12 .
Oz bottle , we could help but notice that Satan adorns the cover .
The lord of darkness on a beer ?
As we popped the cap , we wondered if this beer would steal our souls or simply be devil - licious .
Tastes : like a delicious Belgian brew .
This had us confused .
We like Belgian beer .
Perhaps the dark one knew this and is attempting to trick us .
If that 's the case , he also knows we enjoy smooth - bodied beer with a generous hoppy taste that is not overly fruity .
Clever .
Acquired : at AJ 's Fine Foods for less than $ 2.50 per bottle .
Goes with : food .
One of our Brew Review comrades insisted that this drink goes better with something more solid to plug your gob with .
We are leaning toward agreeing , but feel that enjoying a bottle or two post - mastication might serve us just as well .
Verdict :
We really enjoyed drinking this beer .
It 's incredibly delicious and fulfilling in ways that we were uncertain 12 ounces of anything could ever be .
In fact , we may like it too much .
Now if you 'll excuse us , the dark lord is having us spend the next few millennia drinking beer that empties itself the closer it gets to our mouths .
Happy drinking ... while you still can .

I just noticed a small update on the 2D Boy ’s announcement of the GNU / Linux version for World of Goo .
Update 4 : It ’s only been 2 days since the release of the Linux version and it already accounts for 4.6 % of the full downloads from our website .
Our thanks to everyone who ’s playing the game on Linux and spreading the word .
Here are a couple of nifty stats : About 12 % of Linux downloads are of the .rpm package , 30 % are of the .tar. gz package , and 57 % are of the .deb package .
More copies of the game were sold via our website on the day the Linux version released than any other day .
This day beat the previous record by 40 % .
There is a market for Linux games after all 🙂
( Emphasis mine )
This is the kind of update that deserves its own blogpost just to make this heard .
It is excellent news and I believe sends out quite a strong message to anyone who is paying attention .
As it ’s difficult to repost the same URL to social news sites , I ’m making this new post just to raise attention to this factoid .
I ’m quite excited to see how much of the total pie the GNU / Linux versions will grab .
We have already passed an amazing threshold where 1 % of the OS market ( or so we ’re told ) has managed to buy the game almost 5 times as much .
Here ’s to reaching 10 % and beyond .

Why do we participate in these various synchronized activities ?
A new study , published in the journal Psychological Science , suggests that when people engage in synchronous activity together , they become more likely to cooperate with other group members .
Stanford University psychologists Scott S. Wiltermuth and Chip Heath conducted a series of experiments to see how synchronous movement affects group interactions .
In the first experiment , two groups of volunteers walked around campus - one group was told to walk normally and the other group was told to walk in - step .
Following the walks , the volunteers participated in an economics game that measures expectations of cooperation - the more the volunteers cooperate , the larger the payoff they would receive at the end of the experiment .
.
In the second experiment , volunteers listened to music via headphones and had to move cups back and forth in time to the music .
The volunteers were divided into different groups , so that some of the groups listened to the same music and thus moved their cups in a synchronous manner .
In the other groups , the volunteers listened to music at different tempos , so their movements were not synchronized .
This was again followed by an economics game where more cooperation would result in larger payoff .
This final game was designed so that players could put tokens in a public account , or keep the tokens for themselves .
The general economic strategy in this game is to behave selfishly keeping one 's tokens in a private account while at the same time taking advantage of others ' contributions to the public account .
The results showed that synchrony fosters cooperation - even when all of the volunteers had financial incentives to cooperate , the volunteers from the synchronized groups tended to be more cooperative during the games ( and ended up earning more money ) than volunteers from groups who had moved asynchronously .
And even more interesting , in the last economics game , participants from the synchronized groups were more willing to contribute tokens to the public account , sacrificing their own money to help their group .
In addition , volunteers from the synchronous groups reported greater feelings of being on the same team .
Thus , the synchronous participants cooperated during the games in part because they felt as though they were part of a team .
Societies rely on cooperation among their members to thrive and be successful .
These findings suggest that cultural practices which involve synchrony ( such as dancing , singing or marching ) may enable groups to produce members who are cooperative and willing to make personal sacrifices , for the benefit of the group .
The authors conclude that " synchrony rituals may have therefore endowed some cultural groups with an advantage in societal evolution , leading some groups to survive where others have failed . "
DETROIT , Michigan ( CNN ) --
It 's 7 a.m. at Henry Ford Hospital , and surgeons are preparing to remove a cancerous tumor from a man 's kidney .
A doctor posts updates on social - networking site Twitter during a recent operation in Detroit .
It 's potentially a risky surgery , but everything 's ready :
The doctors and nurses are in the operating room , the surgical instruments are sterilized and ready to go , and the chief resident is furiously Twittering on his laptop .
That 's right -- last week , for the second known time , surgeons Twittered a surgery by using social - networking site Twitter to give short real - time updates about the procedure .
Following the February 9 operation online were other doctors , medical students and the merely curious .
Watch surgeons Twittering from the operating room »
" Here 's something different : HenryFordNews is live tweeting surgery today , getting some buzz , too , " wrote one Twitter participant from Massachusetts .
" I find this fascinating ! " tweeted another Twitter user from Swansea , United Kingdom .
" It 's an interesting use of technology , but I can't help but feel a bit ' eeewww ! ' about this , " wrote a third tweeter from New York .
Why twitter a surgery ?
Whether it's new and cool or merely yicky , observers say there 's no question that more and more doctors -- and patients -- will be sharing the blow - by - blow of medical procedures on sites like Twitter and Facebook .
Dr. Craig Rogers , the lead surgeon in the Henry Ford surgery , said the impetus for his Twittering was to let people know that a tumor can be removed without taking the entire kidney .
" We 're trying to use this as a way to get the word out , " Rogers said .
Observers say Twittering about a procedure is a natural outgrowth of the social networking media revolution .
" Doing this removes a real communication barrier .
It helps make something scary much more comprehendable , " said Christopher Parks , co-founder of the Web site changehealthcare.com .
" It brings us closer together and makes us more engaged . "
Four months ago , Park 's colleague , Robert Hendrick , tweeted his own varicose vein removal surgery here as it was happening ( he was , obviously , under local anesthesia ) .
" It redirected my attention and allowed me to minimize some of the nervousness around what was going on .
It felt like I had family and friends there to support me , " Hendrick wrote in an e-mail .
" I wanted a record for other people who might be interested in the same surgery , " added Hendrick , who also posted photos and video of his surgery .
" It later allowed me to connect with others with the same issues . "
As time goes by and the younger generation moves into medicine , expect even more sharing online of private medical procedures , Parks says .
" Newer and newer generations are used to putting their life online , " he said .
" This generation shares everything . "
" Gosh , this is big "
Twitter users -- those " tweeple " -- who kept up with the Henry Ford procedure online got to share some medical drama in real time .
( You can read the " Tweetstream " or watch video of the tumor removal on YouTube ) .
As Rogers got closer to the tumor , he realized it was far larger than it had appeared on a CT scan , and he wondered out loud whether he would have to remove the entire kidney -- something he'd been trying to avoid .
" Gosh , this is big , " he said to his colleagues in the operating room .
" Could I have picked a harder case for this ? "
As Rogers worked away on his robotic machinery , the chief resident , Dr. Raj Laungani , Twittered : " Dr. Rogers is saying because the tumor is so large he may have to do a radical ( total ) nephrectomy . "
After conferring with Laungani and others in the operating room , Rogers decided he could remove just part of the kidney .
Then came another challenge :
In a surgery like this one , doctors have to restrict blood flow to the kidney with clamps while they remove the tumor .
Those clamps then have to be removed within 30 minutes so the kidney is n't damaged by the lack of blood .
iReport.com : Would you allow your surgeon to " tweet " ?
" The goal is to keep the clamp time below 30 minutes , " Laungani Twittered .
" 25 minutes left ! ! ! "
Approximately 25 minutes later , Laungani shared his relief with all of Twitterville : " Tumor is excised , bleeding is controlled , we are about to come off clamp , " he wrote .
In the end , Rogers had the last tweet .
" The robotic partial nephrectomy was a success , " he wrote .
" Thank you for joining us today . "

And just how important is China -- clearly now the largest single holder of Treasury bonds -- to the market ?
Both questions matter more than ever -- to the market , and to the US government .
There is no doubt that central banks and sovereign funds , led by China ’s reserve managers , were huge buyers of Treasuries in 2008 .
The work I have done with Arpana Pandey suggests that central banks bought close to $ 600 billion Treasuries in 2008 -- with China accounting for a bit over half the total .
Total central bank reserve growth likely was around $ 1 trillion in 2008 ( though obviously it was much higher earlier in the year than later in the year ; $ 600 billion is consequently a plausible sum .
That estimate is far higher than the number reported in the TIC data -- but the TIC data also is known to under count central bank purchases .
Watch what happens when the survey data comes out .
$ 600 billion is also a record .
Back in early 2004 -- at the peak of Japanese purchases -- total purchases of Treasuries only reached $ 300 billion .
The US must then now be completely dependent on the central bank bid .
Not really .
Total ’ marketable "
Treasury issuance - if the marketable Treasuries that the Fed sold to finance its lender of last resort activities are counted as increase in the outstanding stock of marketable Treasuries -- topped $ 1.6 trillion in 2008 .
That implies , if the Pandey / Setser estimates for official purchases are right , that private investors snapped up more Treasuries than the world ’s central banks .
Central bank demand accounted for a far smaller share of total issuance than in the past few years .
In 2007 , for example , central bank purchases easily exceeded total issuance .
The big increase in demand for Treasuries in 2008 came from private investors in the US .
The " money " graph :
Moreover , with global reserve growth slowing -- total reserve growth was close to zero in q4 , and it may not be all that much higher in q1 -- central bank demand for Treasuries is likely to fall .
Central bank purchases in the last part of 2008 were inflated by a shift out of Agencies , but that ( presumably ) wo n’t continue forever .
That implies , I think , that the ability of the US to finance large deficits at low rates depends far more than it has in the past on private investors willingness to buy Treasuries .
That was in doubt a few weeks ago when the markets were focused on the risk of a Treasury bubble and the scale of the Treasury issuance associated with the stimulus and various bailouts .
Now the market is more focused on the risks tied to a strong global downturn -- and the remaining risks in the financial sector ...
Net / net is the US more or less reliant on China ?
That is an issue that seems to be on everyone ’s mind .
Andy Xie expresses the common concern over at the New York Times :
China is the largest owner of the U.S. treasury bonds .
Some estimates put China ‘s holdings of the U.S. debt papers at $ 1.7 trillion .
Since President Obama ’s $ 783 billion fiscal stimulus will be financed by issuing more treasuries , there ’s no doubt China ’s continued buying of the bonds will be essential .
In one sense , Xie is right :
The sheer scale of the United States ’ governments borrowing makes every buyer more important .
If China suddenly stopped buying Treasuries in the way it stopped buying Agencies last June , it would almost certainly have an impact on the market .
Unless , of course , the Fed stepped in -- but that too would have consequences .
On the other hand , today ’s world is very different from the world of 2005 , 2006 , 2007 or even the first half of 2008 .
The United States ’ current account deficit is smaller , which means that there is less money for the surplus countries ( in aggregate ) to recycle back into the Treasury market .
Nor are emerging market central banks recycling private capital inflows back into the Treasury and Agency market .
Conversely , America ’s household savings rate has increased – and Americans , after long shunning low yielding Treasuries in favor of risk assets with more ( potential ) upside --- have rediscovered the joy of knowing that you will get your money back , with a small amount of interest .
A world with $ 1750 billion US fiscal deficit and a $ 500 billion US current account deficit only works if Americans are willing to buy an awful lot of Treasuries .
The borrowing need of the US government is now far too big to be covered by the ( much reduced ) growth in the emerging world ’s reserves .
That leaves aside the possibility that key central banks might reallocate their portfolios .
Americans could buy a lot of Agencies , allowing a country like China to finance Treasury purchases through Agency sales .
But setting aside flows into the Treasury market from the ongoing sale of Agency debt , the slowdown in global reserve growth implies a slowdown in central bank financing of the US .
Even as issuance rises .
The overarching assumption behind the stimulus is that a rise in US household savings ( linked to the fall in US household wealth ) will create a pool of domestic savings that will flow , given the ongoing contraction in private investment , into the Treasury market .
The rise in private savings and fall in private investment will allow the US government to borrow more even as the US economy as whole borrows less from the rest of the world .
The key to the Treasuries rally in 2008 was the surge in private demand , not the strengthening of official demand .
My guess is that the Treasury market will be driven by developments in the US – not developments in China – in 2009 .
If the US issues $ 1700 b of marketable Treasuries in 2009 , China would need to buy around $ 250 billion to maintain a 15 % share of the total market .
That is n’t at all implausible if capital outflows from China subside .
Let ’s say other central banks buy another $ 200 billion ( which implies a further reduction in central banks ’ share of the outstanding stock of Treasuries in the market ) .
Custodial holdings of Treasuries over at the New York Fed have continued to creep up in the first two months of 2009 , even as overall global reserve growth remains subdued .
The resulting $ 450 billion in total central bank purchases would be the second highest level of demand for US treasuries from foreign central banks on record .
But the math only works if private investors snap up $ 1250 billion of Treasuries , or a little more than they bought in 2008 .
Thanks to Paul Swartz and Arpana Pandey for help with the collection and analysis of the Treasury issuance and TIC data .
The data on the outstanding stock of marketable Treasuries comes ( via bloomberg ) from the monthly statement of the public debt .
The adjustment for Treasuries held at the Fed is based on the Fed ’s balance sheet data .
Our methodology for estimating true official purchases of Treasuries is explained in our recent paper on China ( watch for an update ) .
Charles Gasparino , the CNBC reporter , published an op -ed in The New York Post yesterday .
Here ’s the interesting bit
Earlier this year , high - flying hedge fund Paulson & Co. retained [ former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan ] for its “ advisory board . ”
The firm is a noted “ short seller ” of banks and financial stocks – meaning it makes money when these companies ’ shares fall .
The thing is , Greenspan is making public comments that inevitably influence public policy and the markets – and some of those comments may well have led to his clients making a nice profit .
In a recent speech to the Economic Club of New York , Greenspan said the recession would likely “ be the longest and deepest ” since the Great Depression and that Congress might have to allocate more money to save the beleaguered banking system on top of the billions already gone for the Troubled Asset Recovery Program .
Then he told the Financial Times : “ It may be necessary to temporarily nationalize some banks in order to facilitate a swift and orderly restructuring ” of their troubled balance sheets .
Such a move would wipe out stockholders , sending shares of banks even lower – thus likely benefiting Paulson .
It would also protect bondholders , helping another Greenspan client , the large bond - firm Pimco .
The question is :
Why did n’t Gasparino , or anybody else , say this on CNBC ?
Hedge fund crony Paul Kedrosky appeared on the network to criticize Greenspan ’s relationship with Pimco , but there was no mention of the former Fed chairman spewing negativity for Paulson ’s short selling operation .
More importantly , no proper journalist at CNBC has reported that short sellers use many other tactics ( such as planting false stories on CNBC and manufacturing phantom stock ) to demolish public companies and crush the markets .
At our nation ’s leading business network , only Jim Cramer reports on this scandal .
Only Jim Cramer tells America about one of the most important causes of the worst financial crisis since the 1930s .
He does so with funny sound effects while prancing around the Romper Room set of a program that is called “ Mad Money . ”
It is surreal , to say the least .
Software vulnerabilities are no stranger to modern , highly - connected smartphones and feature phones alike , and fortunately , the big guys have been pretty good about staying on the ball and patching the serious stuff in a reasonable amount of time .
The latest problem discovered in the Android browser 's multimedia subsystem really sucks , though -- it 's so bad , some security dudes are advising customers to " avoid " using the it altogether until it gets fixed -- and the most frustrating part about it is that it actually is fixed in the Android code trunk , it 's just that no one 's bothered to roll out an update to G1 users yet .
In the meantime , the dude who discovered the problem is advising users to only visit trusted sites and avoid WiFi , so yeah , just do n't browse or anything , okay ? [ Via ReadWriteWeb
Bush overpaid $ 78 billion for bank shares in bailout , report finds John Byrne
Published : Friday February 6 , 2009
Print This Email This Bush Treasury Sec. ' subsidized ' his ex-firm with $ 2.5 billion President George W. Bush overpaid $ 78 billion for investments in the nation 's largest banks and brokerages , according to a Congressional report released late Thursday .
The findings showed that government investment in the banks amounted to a nearly $ 80 billion subsidy of an industry that seems to have recently excelled at flushing money down the drain .
Ironically , the " subsidy " itself was doled out by Bush Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , the former chief executive of investment bank Goldman Sachs .
According to the report , Goldman got an effective $ 2.5 billion subsidy from the Treasury Department .
While at Goldman , Paulson earned upwards of $ 10 million a year and was the richest member of the Bush Administration at the cabinet level or above .
The largest other purported subsidies were paid to : Citigroup ( $ 9.5 billion ) , JP Morgan Chase ( $ 4.4 billion ) and Morgan Stanley ( $ 4.2 billion ) .
The second round of bailout financing also added another $ 10 billion to Citigroup 's alleged subsidy , and the second AIG bailout , $ 25 billion .
By contrast -- the entire amount the US government spend on higher education in 2006 was just over $ 50 billion -- less than the " subsidies " issued to the banks in the first round .

Flowers and chocolate are n't the only big sellers for Valentine 's Day .
There 's also spyware .
The use of tracking devices and hiring of private investigators surge around this holiday — an opportune time to catch a cheating spouse .
CUPID ON THE CHEAP : Valentine 's shoppers expected to spend less SURVEY : Couples say they 'll cut back on gifts , not sex BETTER LIFE : Help with your Valentine 's Day plans " If there 's anything going on , a spouse will more than likely make contact with a lover on Valentine 's Day , the day before or the day after , " says Ruth Houston , author of the book , Is He Cheating on You ?
829 Telltale Signs .
Private investigators agree .
" Valentine 's Day is a day of lovers , and sometimes the lover is not a spouse , " says Jimmie Mesis , editor of PI magazine .
That 's why , he says , investigators are often busy this time of year .
Mesis says suspicious spouses are also turning to spyware , which costs less than a detective .
" They do their own CSI work , " he says .
His website 's sales of GPS trackers are more than 20 % higher in the three weeks before Valentine 's Day than at other times of the year .
Sales of spyware to track spouses — his customer service representatives talk with buyers about how they 'll use the items — were 141 % higher in the past four weeks than the monthly average for the preceding six months , says Todd Morris , CEO of BrickHouse Security .
Such devices , retailing for $ 50 to $ 400 , include cameras hidden in alarm clocks , light scanners to detect evidence of sexual activity and devices to monitor e-mail .
Morris says he expected more people to stay home with their spouses in a weak economy , but sales suggest otherwise .
" Apparently , " he says , " money troubles do n't stop the philandering . "
The dismal economy is making it more difficult , though , for people to afford a private investigator .
David Hill , an investigator in Tuscaloosa , Ala. , says he has had lots of inquiries in recent weeks , but often callers cannot afford his $ 1,500 retainer .
This Valentine 's Day is one of the few in the past two decades that has not triggered a surge in clients , says Kelly Riddle , owner of Kelmar & Associates in San Antonio , a firm of 39 private investigators .
It 's the economy , Riddle says : " If they have a cheating spouse with a job , now is not the time to rock the boat . "
How often spouses are unfaithful is unclear , because studies report varying results .
In a 2006 survey of 3,000 adults by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago , 22 % of men and 13 % of women admitted to infidelity .
The heartbreak is tough to watch , especially after a spouse sees proof of the infidelity on video , Riddle says .
He recalls a Valentine 's Day case of a man who had lunch with his wife and dinner with his lover of nine years , with whom he had a child .
The man basically had two wives , Riddle says .
" He brought a dozen roses to each of them . "

My theory is that Barack Obama , among his various superpowers , has the ability to reach out to groups of people across the world and subtly re-arrange their DNA .
How else are we to explain this ?
In the study made public on Thursday , Dr. Friedman and his colleagues compiled a brief test , drawing 20 questions from the verbal sections of the Graduate Record Exam , and administering it four times to about 120 white and black test - takers during last year ’s presidential campaign .
In total , 472 Americans — 84 blacks and 388 whites — took the exam .
Both white and black test - takers ranged in age from 18 to 63 , and their educational attainment ranged from high school dropout to Ph.D .
On the initial test last summer , whites on average correctly answered about 12 of 20 questions , compared with about 8.5 correct answers for blacks , Dr. Friedman said .
But on the tests administered immediately after Mr. Obama ’s nomination acceptance speech , and just after his election victory , black performance improved , rendering the white - black gap “ statistically nonsignificant , ” he said .
The study has n't yet been published ( or accepted ) , and does n't seem to be online ; here is the press release .
Via DougJ at Balloon Juice , who says everything that needs to be said .
Including that this is no surprise at all , at least to people who recognize the phrase " stereotype threat . "
Studies have shown that simply reminding women or minorities that they are women or minorities causes them to do statistically worse on tests involving subjects that they are , stereotypically , supposed to be bad at .
One is almost tempted to conclude that scores on standardized tests might be influenced by factors other than one 's genetic background .
Who could have guessed ?

In their zeal to oppose the lunacy of the so - called " stimulus " plan , many radio talk show hosts and other pundits have fallen into the Keynesian trap .
Rather than the politicians spending nearly a trillion dollars , they argue , it would provide much more stimulus if the government gave massive tax cuts .
This would " put money back in the pockets of average Americans " and they would go to the mall and " get that money into circulation and boost the economy . "
Although the instincts behind such arguments are sound , they often betray an underlying Keynesian mindset .
By justifying tax cuts on the grounds that the taxpayers will go out and spend the money , these critics actually concede the entire case .
After all , why take a chance on those fickle taxpayers , who might selfishly decide to pay down some debt or to stick the extra cash under the mattress ?
If buying stuff is the way to promote recovery , then nobody can top the DC politicians .
Consumers Don't Cause Recessions
The biggest mistake in the " let taxpayers spend the money " argument is that it buys into the Keynesian notion that recessions are due to a sudden bout of squeamishness on the part of consumers .
This mindset pervades our financial press .
Analysts wonder whether the holiday shopping season will " pull the economy out of its doldrums , " and even Nobel laureates lament that the American consumer has finally thrown in the towel .
Now it is certainly true that ultimately , a consumer needs to buy the finished good or service in order to make a given production process worthwhile .
It would be pointless for workers to toil day in and day out on a project , if there were n't a consumer at the end of the pipeline eager to buy the finished item .
But this just proves how silly it is to " fix " the economy through manipulation of consumption spending .
If Americans are worried about the future and want to restrict their purchases of iPods , DVDs , and expensive nights out on the town , we should n't throw our hands up and worry that this will wreck " the economy . "
The purpose of an economic system is n't to provide jobs ; it 's rather to provide goods that consumers desire .
If people want to cut back on their purchases of certain items , the economic system should respond to those changed preferences .
Scarcity is a regrettable feature of the world .
This means that there are always tradeoffs involved in any decision .
There are not enough resources available to satisfy all human desires .
In particular , human labor is needed to transform nature 's gifts into items that are more pleasing to people .
The hard part of economic affairs , then , is to produce things .
After the product is available , consuming it is a piece of cake .
To hear some crude versions of Keynesian thinking , you would get the impression that businesses are in trouble because Americans all of a sudden just decided that they did n't like steak and they did n't enjoy plasma screen TVs .
Of course that 's not what happened .
Instead , what happened is that American consumers decided they were n't prepared to spend as much on these nonessential items .
To prove that our recession is n't due to a lack of consumption desire per se , imagine that car dealerships announced they would sell each vehicle on the lot for $ 1 .
Or , those trying to sell their homes and finding " no buyers " could charge $ 10 for each property .
Does anyone doubt that these firesales would unload all the excess inventory in a matter of hours ?
" If buying stuff is the way to promote recovery , then nobody can top the DC politicians . "
Of course , car dealerships and house flippers would n't want to slash their prices to such lows , because they hope to get more if they wait things out .
More generally , they were n't expecting to charge merely $ 1 or $ 10 per item , when they invested money over the years to arrive in their current predicament , sitting on unsold inventories .
And now we finally see the problem : the businesses right now that are struggling made bad forecasts .
This does n't mean the people in charge are immoral or dumb , and it could be true that their forecasts would have been accurate , were it not for foolish decisions that other people made .
But whatever the excuses , nonetheless there are lots of businesses that used up scarce resources creating products based on the assumption that they would fetch more for these products than consumers are actually willing to pay .
In a market economy , the profit - and - loss system regulates the use of scarce resources .
If a firm is suffering losses , what that really means is that it squandered valuable inputs ( natural resources , labor hours , capital equipment ) in making a product , when those inputs were more urgently needed elsewhere in the economy .
In a market economy , the customer is always right .
If consumers are n't willing to buy the products and services currently being churned out by businesses , then the businesses are at fault for not anticipating the desires of their customers .
The recession is not caused by a sudden bout of irrational anxiety on the part of consumers .
On the contrary , our present mess is the fault of the Fed 's decision to lower interest rates after the dot - com crash and 9/11 attacks .
Alan Greenspan did n't want to deal with a sharp recession then , and so he papered over the problems by flooding the credit markets with cheap money , courtesy of the printing press .
This set in motion an unsustainable boom , especially in real estate and Wall Street .
Even if consumers wanted to keep their buying habits up the way they had been living during 2002 –2006 , this would ultimately prove to be physically impossible .
China was not going to forever send electronics goods in exchange for claims on McMansions that had no tenants .
It is because of these real imbalances in the global structure of production that American consumers have cut back on their discretionary purchases , and it is why American producers need to adapt to the new realities as well .
The government is simply trying to freeze the US economy in the unsustainable configuration of the boom years .
All Money Is in " Circulation "
Related to the fallacy of thinking consumers need to " spend " in order to rescue the economy , is the idea that money only serves a social purpose when it is " in circulation " as opposed to sitting in somebody 's piggy bank .
This is just silly .
At any moment in time , all cash in the economy is in somebody 's possession ; there is no such thing as money that is " in transit . "
When you buy groceries , at 12:02 and 15 seconds the $ 45 is in your hand , and then at 12:02 and 16 seconds it is in the possession of the clerk and hence constitutes part of the grocery store 's cash holdings .
So long as the government does n't interfere with the price system , any amount of money can get the job done .
If people become fearful and decide they want to increase their cash holdings , this means that each dollar bill will change hands less frequently .
In general , prices will tend to fall .
But that means that the same per capita amount of cash will now have a higher purchasing power , which is exactly what the so - called hoarders wanted .
Why Tax Cuts Are Better Than Government Spending
Let me be clear : I wholeheartedly agree that it makes much more sense for the government to cut taxes , rather than spend money , in order to improve the economy .
But what I have been arguing is that the reason for this superiority is not , " Let taxpayers spend money and create jobs rather than the politicians . "
But if job creation from spending is a bad argument , what are the valid reasons for supporting tax cuts ?
First is the simple moral argument .
That money was earned by the taxpayers , and so prima facie it is always a good idea to take ( i.e. , steal ) less from them .
" The purpose of an economic system is n't to provide jobs ; it 's rather to provide goods that consumers desire . "
Second there is an incentive argument .
Especially if the tax reduction comes in the form of lower marginal rates ( rather than lump - sum rebates ) , then individuals have the incentive to produce more .
Notice that this is the exact opposite of the standard Keynesian analysis .
In other words , the pragmatic argument for tax cuts is n't to give consumers more money to go buy stuff , but rather it's to give producers the incentive to go make stuff .
In conclusion , the critics of the nearly trillion - dollar " stimulus " plan are certainly correct to call for tax cuts rather than more government spending .
However , many of these critics couch their justifications in ways that actually prove the superiority of government spending .
A correct analysis shows that it is better to let taxpayers keep more of their money , even if they use 100 % of the savings to pay down debt .
There is nothing magical about consumption spending , and in fact it was overconsumption that got us into the present mess .
Barely a few paces from the Egyptian border stands a large white tent , fashioned from plastic sheeting and pockmarked with jagged shrapnel holes .
Inside , as in the hundreds of identical tents dotted to the left and right , is a scene of energy and illicit industriousness : a dozen Palestinian smugglers sweating to overcome the punitive economic blockade on Gaza .
A stone 's throw away on the opposite side of the border is an Egyptian police post , with relaxed uniformed officers standing on the roof .
They gaze down without a hint of concern .
One unanswered question of Israel 's three - week war in Gaza is why the air strikes , artillery shells , tank fire , bulldozing and detonations that caused such devastation and loss of life across the territory did so little damage to the hundreds of smuggling tunnels under Gaza 's southern border with Egypt .
Those tunnels , which bring in food , clothes , machinery as well as weapons and ammunition , were supposed to be one of Israel 's key targets .
On the final day of the conflict alone , the Israeli military said it had hit 100 tunnels .
Gazans in the border town of Rafah spoke of night after night of enormous air strikes that shook cracks into the walls of their houses and shattered their windows .
But while the sandy border is marked with many large craters , the damage caused to the tunnels was , in many cases , repaired within days .
Already some are operating again and new tunnels are being dug under the close eye of Hamas officials , who walk from one tent to the next clutching their walkie - talkies .
The smugglers believe their tunnels were simply too deep to be badly damaged , even by the heavy 500 lb or one - tonne bombs dropped by Israeli F - 16s .
In most cases , the serious damage was only to the entrances to the tunnels , which were soon uncovered again by the Palestinians using bulldozers and then rebuilt .
It may be that the focus of the Israeli attacks was on the weapons tunnels , which are closely guarded by Hamas and other armed groups and not open to public view .
Inside the large white tent is a wooden coat rack from which hang the jackets and spare clothes of a dozen men or more .
To the right is an electrical circuit board with five sockets .
From the back , the wires run out of the tent , across the sand dunes and directly into the public electricity supply of the municipality of Rafah .
From the front , a cord runs out to power a winch .
Outside , a large black plastic water butt with a tap provides the thirsty workers with fresh drinking water - again , courtesy of the municipality .
All of this is registered and paid for .
Smuggling in Gaza is a semi-official business .
The focus of activity is the tunnel 's well : a 15 m deep shaft lined on its four sides by planks of wood .
Three metal beams are positioned pyramid - shape over the well and support the electric winch , whose cable runs down the shaft to the sandy floor below .
There , two men crouch low and operate two more winches that run horizontally 300 m to the south along the tunnel , stretching out of Gaza and into Egypt .
One of the winches draws in the goods from the Egyptian side , a train of boxes and sacks sliding over the sand on plastic containers .
The second winch sends back the empty containers for reloading .
It took about eight weeks to dig this tunnel ; a team of men worked long days underground using a pneumatic drill to dig out the soil , which they then carried out in large , plastic containers and dumped nearby .
By the time it was finished , the tunnel was tall enough for a man to stand with his head bowed , and nearly a metre wide along its full length .
The tunnel walls are bare soil with regular wooden supports to prevent collapse - although it still remains a dangerous business .
Around 40 Palestinian tunnellers were killed last year in cave - ins .
It is midday and the work is constant .
Every 30 seconds one of the men below shouts " Raise " and a man sitting over the mouth of the well switches on the winch and pulls up another sack .
So far this morning , they have contained : dry , yellow chickenfeed ; spare parts for cars ; a box of coat hooks ; microwaves ; kerosene cookers ; packets of rather dowdy women 's underwear ; and now several large , 5.5 kW generators .
Notably absent are drugs and alcohol , which are forbidden by Hamas ; cigarettes , which are heavily taxed by Hamas ; and anything even resembling weaponry or military material , which come in through more discreet tunnels far from the public eye that may or may not have been more seriously damaged by the war .
" Without these tunnels , everything would stop in Gaza , " says one of the workers , who gave his name only as Abu Zeid , 22 .
" And they say we are terrorists .
Where are the terrorists here ?
The world knows very well what 's going on , but they do n't want us to live .
If they opened the crossings , why would we need to do this business ? "
Since Israel pulled its soldiers and settlers out of Gaza in mid-2005 , it has imposed an ever - tighter economic blockade on what it calls the " hostile entity " .
For the past year and a half , that has meant closures of the crossings : banning all exports and prohibiting all imports , save for a limited list of humanitarian goods .
Even the UN secretary - general Ban Ki-moon called it " collective punishment " - illegal under international law .
It has left more than 80 % of Gazans reliant on aid .
The policy was designed to weaken Hamas and convince the Palestinians they had made a mistake when , in 2006 - in what was widely acknowledged as one of the most free and fair elections in the Arab world - they voted in strength for the Islamists .
Egypt has also kept its border crossing at Rafah largely closed .
" It 's politics , dirty politics , " says Abu Zeid .
Most of the workers in this tunnel were once employed as daily labourers within Israel , but Palestinians have long been refused such jobs .
Now in Gaza there is barely any work available .
Some at this tunnel are former policemen once employed by Hamas 's bitter rival , Fatah ; others are farmers whose livelihoods collapsed with the ban on exports .
" There is nothing for us except the tunnels , " says another worker .
" I have a house , and land and money but I want to go abroad , " says Abu Eyash , 28 , a tunneller who once spent four years in an Israeli jail for his connections with Fatah .
" I 'm not satisfied here .
There 's always war and never any security . "
These men may not earn much from the tunnels , but others do .
The tunnel cost around £ 100,000 to build and the owners say they earned that back within the first two months .
The original owners of the land are given a 10 % commission and Egyptian security officials on the other side earn healthy bribes .
As his staff worked , one of the owners took out a thick fold of dollar bills , from which he was to send the equivalent of £ 13,000 to the Egyptians , enough to provide protection for the tunnel for around 10 days until the next payment was due .
In the last two weeks since the end of its war in Gaza , Israel has launched several more air strikes against the tunnels after militants from small , non-Hamas groups fired rockets and mortars into southern Israel .
This tunnel was one of those hit , although the workers said the damage would take only a few days to repair .
Not everyone celebrates the tunnel industry .
A short walk back from this tent is the home of Mohammad Abu Saud , 40 , who is spending the day covering his broken windows with plastic sheeting and wondering how he is ever going to repair the massive cracks in his walls caused by the bombing of the tunnels .
" I do n't earn any benefit from the tunnels and I 'm suffering because of them - you can see the cracks here and the windows gone , as well as the fact that the prices in the market have risen a lot , " he says .
" I think the tunnels are delaying a solution , " says his brother Ala'a , 35 .
" If there were no tunnels , there would be such a heavy price that it would force Hamas to sit and find a solution and the only solution is to reopen the crossings .
I 'm not even asking them to liberate Palestine , just open the crossings . "
Around half an hour 's drive north from the border are the recently destroyed remains of what , a month ago , was one of the largest food - processing factory compounds in the Gaza strip , owned by the wealthy al - Wadeya brothers .
Yaser al - Wadeya has a PhD in industrial engineering from Cleveland State University and little sympathy for Hamas .
He estimates the damage caused by the Israeli military to his biscuit , ice - cream , snacks and dessert factories is worth around £ 15 m .
Even if he had the money for repairs , Israel 's restrictions mean he would not be able to import new machinery .
Even before the war , Al - Wadeya directed some of his Israeli suppliers to give up waiting for the Israeli crossings to open and ship their products to Egypt , then for them to be smuggled under the border into Gaza .
" The main reason for all of this is to destroy the economic infrastructure of the weak Palestinian economy , " he says .
" They want to make sure that we will never have a state in Palestine . "
Israel 's military said it was conducting " post- operation investigations " into accounts of civilian casualties and property damage , but added that it " does not target civilians or civilian infrastructure , including factories , unless it is being used by the Hamas for terrorist purposes " .
However , Palestinians , including al - Wadeya , disagree and argue that much of the bombing during this war was aimed directly at civilian infrastructure .
Among the other targets hit were the largest cement factory in Gaza , the largest flour mill , the only parliament building , a major sewage project and the leading private school , not to mention the 21,000 homes and more than 200 factories completely or partially destroyed .
Al - Wadeya argues that Israel has allowed the commercial tunnel economy to function as part of a broader campaign to break Gaza 's economic and political links with Israel and to force it towards a dependent relationship with Egypt .
" During the occupation , from the beginning until now , our whole relationship is with Israel .
You ca n't just break it and move towards Egypt , " he says .
Some senior Israelis have spoken publicly in recent years of their desire to hand over responsibility for Gaza to Egypt , and to keep most of the Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank while handing the remaining Palestinian cantons over to Jordanian control .
Ironically , Hamas , with its insistence on opening the Rafah crossing with Egypt to give access to the rest of the Islamic world , appears at times to be pushing for the same future for Gaza .
The Islamists appear not to have grasped the full extent of the devastation suffered in Gaza , or the people 's frustration .
Shortly after the war , a Hamas official arrived at the rubble of the factory and offered £ 3,500 towards its repair .
" I told him to get the hell out of here , " says Al - Wadeya .
" What would that buy ?
Not even new locks for the doors .
" I really believe that if we stay where we are with Hamas and Fatah and this political issue , we will never do anything in Gaza .
It will become like Somalia or Sudan , " he says .
" We need two peaceful states , Palestine and Israel , living together .
Without this we will be at war for the next century . "
Going underground : a history of wartime tunnel systems
Afghanistan Tora Bora
Financed by the CIA and created by the mujahideen during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan , the Tora Bora complex contains miles of tunnels , bunkers and fortified caves .
Close to the White Mountain range near the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad , the complex is where Osama bin Laden is believed to have hidden with 1,000 Taliban fighters .
The caves and passages apparently have ventilation and power systems running on electric generators .
Gibraltar
The galleries
Inside the Rock of Gibraltar is a honeycomb of tunnels known as the galleries .
The first passages were built during the great siege in 1779 - 1783 , when Spanish troops attacked the Rock .
Soldiers from the garrison dug through the stone to a promontory on the north face , which allowed them to fire on the Spanish below .
In total , 304 m of halls , passages and openings were created .
More tunnels were added during the second world war when the British feared Gibraltar would be attacked .
The tunnel system was expanded and the rock became a keystone in the defence of shipping routes to the Mediterranean .
Bosnia Sarajevo tunnel
In 1993 , citizens in Sarajevo began constructing a 1.5 m high , 800 m long underground passage .
Their city was under siege from Serbian forces and the tunnel led to the UN - designated neutral area of Sarajevo airport .
Bosnian volunteers worked in eight - hour shifts using picks and shovels to create a way for food , aid and weapons to come into the city , and people to escape .
The tunnel was most famously used to transport the former Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic in his wheelchair out of the city .
Vietnam Cu Chi and Vinh Moc tunnels
During the Vietnam war American soldiers came up against the Viet Cong 's Cu Chi tunnels .
This huge system of underground passages stretched from the Cambodian border in the west to the outskirts of Saigon , running below the jungles of Vietnam .
Used to mount surprise attacks against US troops , the tiny tunnels led to subterranean rooms , some of which were big enough to be used as hospitals , arms stores and even theatres .
The first passages were built during the 1948 war of independence with France to link villages .
Later , the Viet Cong painstakingly expanded them by hand until they covered 250 km .
To attack the tunnels , the US created a volunteer force made up of soldiers small enough to fit down the passages .
After negotiating hidden traps of sharpened bamboo spikes , they had to fight their enemy in the tunnels .
The complex has now become a war memorial park .
Under the former demilitarised zone that ran between the communist north and capitalist south , lie the Vinh Moc tunnels .
They were built to shelter people from the intense bombing of the area and included wells , kitchens , rooms for each family and spaces for healthcare .
Around 60 families lived in them - and as many as 17 children were born inside .
Jersey War tunnels
Created during the German occupation of the island in the second world war , these tunnels were built by more than 5,000 slave labourers brought to Jersey .
Many of the Russians , Poles , Frenchmen and Spaniards died of malnutrition or disease .
Originally constructed as an ammunition store and artillery barracks , the tunnels were later converted to a casualty clearing station as D - Day drew nearer .
Poland Stalag Luft III
Immortalised in the film the Great Escape , Tom , Dick and Harry were the tunnels created by the prisoners of the Stalag Luft III camp in Poland .
Work on the tunnels began in 1942 and during the night of March 24 , 1944 , 76 inmates managed to escape down a 101 m tunnel .
All but three of the men were recaptured ; the Gestapo shot 50 and returned the remainder to captivity .
France Catacombs
Organised in a section of Paris 's vast network of subterranean tunnels , the catacombs were a tourist attraction in the early 19th century .
This cemetery covers a portion of Paris ' former mines near the Left Bank 's Place Denfert - Rochereau .
During the second world war , both Parisian members of the French resistance and German soldiers used the tunnels .
Homa Khaleeli
The problem started when Apple CEO Steve Jobs appeared last June to unveil the new generation of iPhone .
Dressed in a black sweater that billowed around a thinned - out frame , Jobs delivered a tech message that was immediately drowned out by questions about his health .
An Apple spokesperson explained away Jobs ' gaunt appearance , saying he was getting over a " common bug . "
The unlikely explanation , and the fact that Jobs survived a 2004 bout with pancreatic cancer , caused investor panic .
Apple stock fell more than 6 per cent in two days .
Rumours of heart attacks and Jobs ' imminent death continued to batter the stock up until the year 's end .
Yesterday , Jobs revealed in an open letter the " very personal " news that he is suffering from a hormonal imbalance that robs his body of nutrients .
With treatment , he hopes to regain his lost weight by the end of the spring .
After the letter 's release , Apple stock jumped more than 4 per cent .
While Jobs ' position as Apple 's prime mover makes his appearance and health legitimate concerns for investors , this raises a thorny workplace issue :
When is my weight other people 's business ?
The short answer is never .
" I would never approach a person and say , ` You 've gained a lot of weight , or lost a lot of weight , ' " said Ruth Clark , senior vice - president of human resources at Hill & Knowlton Canada , recoiling from the idea .
" That 's very personal . "
Instead , Clark said , companies have begun steering their employees en masse toward healthier lifestyles through programs like subsidized gym memberships .
" We treat our people as the adults they are , " Clark said .
" If someone is off sick a lot , you 're going to talk to them about that , but you 'd never start off with ` I noticed you lost some weight . ' "
But people do notice .
And that could change the way some co-workers are treated , for good or ill .
Beginning in 2005 , Toronto city councillor Shelley Carroll shed " almost 100 pounds " in just over a year .
She 's kept the weight off and can't help noticing small changes in how she 's treated .
" There really is no getting around the fact that sizeism exists , and it exists in professional life , " Carroll said .
" I still have people who feel they have to comment that they think it 's an amazing achievement that you can keep ( the weight ) off .
I have to wonder if I 'm having a conversation with someone who would n't have bothered before . "
Oprah Winfrey enjoyed the same sort of popularity bump when she thinned down to a size - 10 jean 20 years ago .
In the intervening decades , Winfrey 's yo - yoing weight has become her defining personal narrative .
Yesterday , she relaunched her TV show with a series entitled " Oprah 's Best Life Week . "
It 's not clear how much of Winfrey 's nearly $ 3 billion fortune rests on her weight battle , but it is clearly part of her appeal .
However , if you 're not Oprah , gaining a few pounds can cost you .
Literally .
Professor John Cawley of Cornell University has studied the effect of weight gain on workers ' wages .
" Heavier women tend to earn less .
For men , it 's much less consistent .
In some cases , heavier men tend to earn more , " Cawley said , describing the so - called " portly banker " effect .
" For guys , it can be a status symbol , showing that you 're so successful you do n't have to care about your appearance .
For women , it 's pretty consistently a negative relationship . "
Cawley 's research shows that for each 7.2 pounds a woman gains , she will earn 1 per cent less than a female colleague whose weight has not changed .

According to Cawley , the effect is cumulative : gain another seven pounds , lose another percentage point of wages .
The U.S. - based study showed the effect is more pronounced for white women than for black or Latino women .
So is the opposite true ?
Will losing weight equal a higher wage ?
" The data tends not to be good enough ( to say ) , " Cawley said .
" And another issue is , what is it that led you to lose the weight ?
Some people are doing very unhealthy things to lose weight , which creates its own problems . "

I 'm really bored with the gay marriage issue .
How about you ?
I wish it would just go away .
Why do some straight people care what gay people do ?
I care about my marriage , but not about anyone else 's .
Why should other straights care if the issue does not affect their own marriages ?
The issue comes up again as Rhode Island 's state senate considers a bill to legalize gay marriage :
Rhode Island is bounded by the only two states that recognize gay marriage : Connecticut and Massachusetts .
In both states , the courts , not the Legislatures , acknowledged the right of same - sex couples to marry .
I do not consider myself an " advocate " for gay marriage .
I just think it 's an issue not worth arguing over and that it 's none of my business .
The religious right ought to get over it and find something more meaningful to fight about .
I understand the fight on abortion rights .
I do n't believe that life begins at conception and neither , quite frankly , do I know or care exactly when it begins .
To me , the abortion debate is a matter of privacy .
Either you talk yourself into believing abortion is murder and decide to meddle in other people 's medical decisions , or you do n't .
I do n't agree with pro-lifers but I do understand where they 're coming from .
I can't say the same about gay marriage .
Can we move on , please ?
Al Franken Loses Major Legal Battle .
He 's In Trouble , Worried , and Can't Be Seated
You Can Help .
Dear Friend :
Al Franken would have you believe he is already the U.S. Senator from Minnesota .
But I have some good news .
He has suffered a major setback in the courts and with your help he may never get seated .
And now , the vile liberal comedian is getting desperate in his race with Republican Senator Norm Coleman .
He is desperate thanks to the efforts of the Republican National Lawyers Association ( the RNLA ) and others .
We have been able to fight Al Franken 's efforts to steal a seat in the United States Senate .
Just this past Tuesday the Election Contest Court dealt Al Franken a major blow .
This special Minnesota court ruled in favor of Norm Coleman 's request to review almost 4800 Absentee ballots that Franken and his Democrat ally , Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie , blocked from counting in the sham " recount " .
As you may know , Ritchie has been backed by far left billionaire George Soros and groups like ACORN .
Harry Reid still wants to seat Al Franken in the Senate now , before all votes have been counted in Minnesota .
Many Republican Senators have angrily denounced the efforts of Democrats to force Franken in the Senate before Minnesota 's finishes its election contest .
We have no doubt that Franken and Reid will try to ignore the will of the people and the Courts .
That 's why our job is so important .
The Republican National Lawyers Association --- the RNLA --- will keep fighting for Minnesota law to be respected and to keep Reid from seating Franken before the election is over .
You can help us in this critical cause --- Donate now --- Go Here Now .
Franken is so contemptuous of the legal process and voters in Minnesota , he has now gone to the Minnesota Supreme Court to ask that Minnesota law be ignored and he be seated in the Senate now .
Franken fears if the truth comes out and all the legal votes are only counted once --- he will lose .
He knows the truth is not on his side .
He knows that the Republican National Lawyer 's Association is fighting him every step of the way .
In fact , his allies in the Democratic Party in filed a frivolous complaint with the FEC to silence us .
The arrogance of Franken and his liberal friends is beyond belief .
Harry Reid is so desperate to seat Franken .
Reid said : " " There 's not a question in anyone 's mind , an assertion by anyone , that there 's been any fraud or wrongdoing in this election . "
And he also claimed , without the election recount being completed , " Norm Coleman will never ever serve [ again ] in the Senate . "
But the truth --- and votes --- are against Reid and Franken .
Every newspaper in Minnesota has demanded the Election Contest be allowed to finish , which Franken does not want .
Franken 's lawyer , Mark Elias , even said that the Senate should seat Franken now and would not have to remove him if Coleman WINS the contest .
Elias said the Senate can do whatever it wants .
He said , " They can declare me the next senator for the state of Minnesota . "
That is why it is critical to Franken he be seated now , so he can not be removed for months and maybe forever .
The Republican National Lawyers Association is here to say " not so fast . "
The election is not finished until all legal ballots are counted .
Even Democratic election officials have stated during the trial that votes have been " wrongly excluded " and it " is absolutely correct " that people have been disenfranchised .
We need to continue our fight .
We need to advocate for a fair election in Minnesota until only the true winner of the Election Contest is seated .
Help us now --- Go Here Now .
The RNLA is the leading Republican group fighting vote fraud in the United States .
The Wall Street Journal has stated if it was n't for us in 2004 , John Kerry likely would have won the presidency .
RNLA is the leader in fighting against ACORN'S fraudulent election activities and for open , fair and honest elections .
Fox News analyst Dick Morris has stated we are leading the fight for a fair election in Minnesota .
And Morris has noted what 's at stake .
If Franken wins the Democrats get one vote closer to total control of the U.S. Senate and will be able to pass any radical legislation --- including the Democrats massive spending plan that is currently masquerading as a " stimulus " bill .
Please help us continue our fight today --- Go Here Now .
Sincerely ,
Michael Thielen
Executive Director
RNLA
P.S. On Election Night Coleman was up by 725 votes and was also winning after the canvassing .
Now Franken claims a lead --- but even Democratic election officials admitted at trial the recount was incomplete and not competently conducted .
More than ever Harry Reid needs to short - circuit the Minnesota Election process and seat Franken now .
With your help RNLA will remain vigilant to ensure it is the legal voters of Minnesota and not the corrupt or incompetent election officials that will determine who is the next Senator .
Please help us today .
Go Here Now .
World 's First Fuel Cell Tractor Debuts in Italy
February 11th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Attention , farmers : New Holland introduced the world ’s first fuel cell tractor today in Turin , Italy , and it looks like a fun ride .
The tractor ’s fuel cell generates 106hp , and its hydrogen tank can hold enough to power the tractor for 1.5 to 2 hours .
New Holland ’s tractor lacks a gearbox or clutch .
Instead , drivers increase or decrease the motor ’s power to speed up or slow down .
While hydrogen obviously requires electricity ( often derived from fossil fuels ) , New Holland believes that farms are an ideal place for a hydrogen - powered vehicle since many of them make their own fuel or produce electricity from wind and solar sources .
The company says that the tractor will be out for testing in 2011 , with a full roll - out expected in 2013 .
New Holland is staying silent about the pricetag , but the fuel cell alone costs € 300,000 .

Britain must embrace nuclear power if it is to meet its commitments on climate change , four of the country ’s leading environmentalists – who spent much of their lives opposing atomic energy – warn today .
The one - time opponents of nuclear power , who include the former head of Greenpeace , have told The Independent that they have now changed their minds over atomic energy because of the urgent need to curb emissions of carbon dioxide .
They all take the view that the building of nuclear power stations is now imperative and that to delay the process with time - consuming public inquiries and legal challenges would seriously undermine Britain ’s promise to cut its carbon emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The volte - face has come at a time when the Government has lifted its self - imposed moratorium on the construction of the next generation of nuclear power stations and is actively seeking public support in the selection of the strategically important sites where they will be built by 2025 .
The intervention is important as it is the first time that senior environmental campaigners have broken cover and publicly backed nuclear power .
It will be a welcome boost to the Government , which is expecting strong protests about the new generation of nuclear power stations at the planning stage .
The four leading environmentalists who are now lobbying in favour of nuclear power are Stephen Tindale , former director of Greenpeace ; Lord Chris Smith of Finsbury , the chairman of the Environment Agency ; Mark Lynas , author of the Royal Society ’s science book of the year , and Chris Goodall , a Green Party activist and prospective parliamentary candidate .
Mr Tindale , who ran Greenpeace for five years until he resigned in 2005 , has taken a vehemently anti-nuclear stance through out his career as an environmentalist .
“ My position was necessarily that nuclear power was wrong , partly for the pollution and nuclear waste reasons but primarily because of the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons , ” Mr Tindale said .
“ My change of mind was n’t sudden , but gradual over the past four years .
But the key moment when I thought that we needed to be extremely serious was when it was reported that the permafrost in Siberia was melting massively , giving up methane , which is a very serious problem for the world , ” he said .
“ It was kind of like a religious conversion .
Being anti-nuclear was an essential part of being an environmentalist for a long time but now that I ’m talking to a number of environmentalists about this , it ’s actually quite widespread this view that nuclear power is not ideal but it ’s better than climate change , ” he added .
None of the four was in favour of nuclear power a decade ago , but recent scientific evidence of just how severe climate change may become as a result of the burning of oil , gas and coal in conventional power stations has transformed their views .
“ The issue that has primarily changed my mind is the absolute imperative of reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
Fifteen years ago we knew less about climate change .
We knew it was likely to happen , we did n’t quite realise how fast , ” said Lord Smith , who described himself as a long - time sceptic regarding nuclear power .
“ What ’s happened is that we ’ve woken up to the very serious nature of the climate - change problem , the essential task of reducing carbon dioxide emissions and the need to decarbonise electricity production over the course of the next 20 to 30 years , ” he said .
Renewable sources of energy , such as wind , wave and solar power , are still necessary in the fight against global warming , but achieving low - carbon electricity generation is far more difficult without nuclear power , Lord Smith said .
Mark Lynas said that his change of mind was also a gradual affair borne out of the need to do something concrete to counter the growing emissions of carbon dioxide created by producing electricity from the burning of fossil fuels .
“ I ’ve been equivocating over this for many years ; it ’s not as if it ’s a sudden conversion , but it ’s taken a long time to come out of the closet .
For an environmentalist , it ’s a bit like admitting you are gay to your parents because you ’re kind of worried about being rejected , ” Mr Lynas said .
“ I ’ve been standardly anti-nuclear throughout most of my environmental career .
I certainly assumed that the standard mantra about it being dirty , dangerous and unnecessary was correct , ” he said .
“ The thing that initially pushed me was seeing how long and difficult the road to going to 100 per cent renewable economy would be , and realising that if we really are serious about tackling global warming it the next decade or two then we certainly need to consider a new generation of nuclear power stations . ”
The long moratorium on building nuclear power plants in Britain came about largely because of intense lobbying by environmentalists in the 1970s and 1980s – a campaign that may have caused more harm than good , Mr Lynas said .
“ In retrospect , it will come to be seen as an enormous mistake for which the earth ’s climate is now paying the price .
To give an example , the environmentalists stopped a nuclear plant in Austria from being switched on , a colossal waste of money , and instead [ Austria ] built two coal plants , ” he said .
The four will now join the ranks of those like Sir David King , the former chief scientific adviser to the Government and now director of the Smith Centre in Oxford , who was sceptical about nuclear power until he was presented with data on the scale of the climate - change problem .
Regular smoking was linked to the most aggressive form Frequent or long - term marijuana use may raise a man 's risk of testicular cancer , American research suggests .
The study of 369 men , published in the journal Cancer , found being a regular marijuana user doubled the risk compared to those who never smoked it .
The results suggest that it may be linked to the most aggressive form of the cancer .
A spokesman for Cancer Research UK said that no previous studies had found a link between marijuana and the disease .
What young men should know is first , we know very little about the long - term health consequences of marijuana smoking , especially heavy marijuana smoking
Dr Stephen Schwartz
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Institute Testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers in younger men , with approximately 2,000 new cases each year in the UK .
Incidence in Europe and North America is far higher than in some other parts of the world , and has been rising steadily for no apparent reason .
Known risk factors for the cancer include previous injuries to the testicles , a family history of the disease , or suffering from undescended testicles as a young child .
The study from scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle is the first to look specifically at marijuana use in relation to the disease .
They studied 369 men aged 18 to 44 , who had been diagnosed with testicular cancer , and quizzed them about marijuana use .
Their replies were compared to those from almost 1,000 apparently healthy control subjects .
Even after adjusting the figures to take account of the other known risk factors , marijuana use remained a clear risk factor for testicular cancer .
Just being a marijuana smoker seemed to carry a 70 % extra risk , while those who smoked it regularly , or had smoked from an early age , had twice the risk compared to those who had never smoked it .
A connection was made to nonseminoma , a fast - growing form of testicular cancer which accounts for approximately 40 % of all cases , and tends to strike younger .
Puberty chance Dr Janet Daling , one of the authors , said that puberty might be a " window of opportunity " during which boys were more vulnerable to environmental factors such as the chemicals in marijuana .
Testicular cancer is usually easily treated " This is consistent with the study 's findings that the elevated risk of nonseminoma - type testicular cancer in particular was associated with marijuana use prior to 18 , " she said .
Another research , Dr Stephen Schwartz , said : " What young men should know is first , we know very little about the long - term health consequences of marijuana smoking , especially heavy marijuana smoking , and second , our study provides some evidence that testicular cancer could be one adverse consequence . "
The next step , he said , would be to look more closely at cells in the testicles to see if any of them had receptors set up to respond to cannabis chemicals .
Henry Scowcroft , from Cancer Research UK , said : " As the researchers themselves point out , this is the first inkling that there is any association between chronic marijuana use and testicular cancer .
" But the researchers only interviewed a relatively small number of men .
" So before we can reach any firm conclusions about whether this is a cause - and - effect relationship , rather than a statistical blip , the result needs to be replicated in a much larger study . "

I ’m writing this a little early this year – _Independence Days_ is due in a couple of weeks , and I anticipate a great deal of distraction as the end - of - the - year predictions really start pouring out , so I thought I ’d jump the gun and make mine now .
But first , how did I do last year ?
( And note , just ’ cause I got some right last year does n’t mean that you should take my word as gospel – I do n’t think that everything that comes out of my ass is the high truth , and neither should you )
I called this year “ Here be Dragons ” arguing that this was when the maps we use to make sense of the world begin to fail us .
I think that was pretty accurate – I think most people still do n’t really understand how badly our maps have failed us , how the operation of our economy , our ecosystem , our culture is simply different than what we ’ve been taught .
I think we can all see that most experts are pretty lost too - not because they are simply stupid , but because they are n’t prepared to work off the map .
The stories we tell ourselves shape what we can see in the world – and the conventional narratives have undermined our understanding of the realities .
Here are my predictions for 2008 and my comments on how they came out :
1 . This year , the words “ peak oil ” will go mainstream , but this mainstreaming will not be matched by a subtle or nuanced understanding of what the words mean .
That is , peak oil will be used for political purposes , and not necessarily ones anyone will approve of .
- I called this one .
As oil prices rose , CNN and the rest of the MSM could n’t get enough of PO poster boys Simmons and Kunstler .
But , of course it was n’t really possible to create , in that media , a complex enough understanding for people to realize that peak oil has n’t gone away just because prices have collapsed , that , in fact , for the long term , the collapse of prices probably ensures that we ’re past peak oil .
2 . By the end of the year , there will begin to be runs on preparedness equipment and food storage , a la Y2K .
- It was n’t quite as dramatic in the equipment department as Y2 K , although woodstoves and electric bikes were backordered like crazy .
But the big story was people fighting over bags of rice at Costco and other stores back in the spring .
And unfortunately , for other reasons , I think we may see this one again .
Called it .
3 . The NeoCons will not go gently into that good night – there will be at least one serious surprise for us .
G -d willing , it wo n’t involve the word “ nukuler ” or any of its cognates .
- I ’d give myself 50 % on this one – I think the build up with Russia was indeed a final Neo-con attempt to make themselves seem like the best answer to a scary world ( and Alaska as our DMZ ) , but it was n’t as dire as I feared .
4. Hillary will not win the 2008 election .
Neither , despite all the people who keep sending me emails saying he will , will Ron Paul .
- Got it .
5 . The economy will tank .
Yup , I ’m really going out on a limb here .
- Got it .
6 . Many of us will find we are being taken more seriously than we ever expected .
We will still be taken less seriously than any celebrity divorce , however .
- This was certainly true for me – I do n’t really know how John Michael Greer , Kunstler and Orlov , for example , felt about it , but I was surprised at how seriously my predictions were taken , and how few people thought I was over - reacting , even when doing , say ABC affiliate radio interviews .
But , of course , there are limits to seriousness - fairly few people really critiqued the worldview , but comparatively few people paid attention , either .
7 . We ’ll see food riots in more nations and hunger will increase .
The idea of Victory Gardens wo n’t seem so crazy anymore .
- Yup. 31 nations and counting had some form of food riot this year .
And Michael Pollan wrote “ Farmer in Chief ” and the “ White House Farm ” idea hit the blogosphere .
8 . The biofuels craze will begin to be thought the better of – not in time to prevent the above .
- Called it .
The collapse of oil prices of course is doing its own work , but even before that , we were finally seeing serious questioning of the premise of biofuels hit national discourse , at least in Europe .
9 . We will see at least one more image of desperate people , walking out of their city becuase there ’s no other alternative .
And a lot of images of foreclosures .
Part one of this is the only one I got wrong , and that only partly .
People were walking out of Houston , and a whole lot of people were walking around looking for Gas in Memphis and Atlanta , but it did n’t quite have the resonance of Katrina or 9/11 – the media was n’t paying attention , so it was n’t the kind of iconic image that I was expecting .
The second part I called .
10 . TEOTWAKI , if it ever happens , will be delayed long enough for my book to be released this fall and to make back at least the advance , so my publisher wo n’t have any reason to try and sue me .
- I ’m not sure , but I think I might have actually made back my advance by now ( all 4 K of it ) , and my publisher is still in business .
Who knows , I might actually make a pittance !
Ok , what about the coming year ?
While I think 2008 was when most people first realized something was wrong , I ’m going to go out on a limb here ( ok , not a huge limb , but a limb ) and say that 2009 will be the year we say that things “ collapsed . ”
I do n’t think we ’re going to make it through the year without radical structural changes in the nature of life in most of the world .
I ’m calling it , a la Yeats ’s “ Second Coming ” the “ The Year ‘ Its Hour Come Round at Last ’ ”
What do I mean by collapse ?
We throw that word around , but it is easy to misunderstand .
I mean that the US is likely to undergo a financial collapse a la the Great Depression - widespread unemployment , lots of people facing hunger , cold and the inability to get health care , a disruption of what we tend to assume are birthright services , and a sense that the system does n’t work anymore .
I do n’t claim that we are headed by Thursday to cannibalism , however – what I think will be true is that we will often do surprisingly well in the state of collapse , as hard as it is .
In previous years , I was fairly lighthearted about my predictions – this year , I do n’t find it possible to be .
I really hope I ’m wrong about this .
And I hope you will make decisions based on your own judgement , not mine .
These are predictions , the results of my analysis and my intuitions , and sometimes I ’m good at that .
But I do not claim that every word that comes out of my mouth or off my keyboard is the truth , and you should not take it as such .
You are getting this free on the internet – consider what you paid for it , and value it accordingly .
1 . Some measure of normalcy will hold out until late spring or early summer , mostly based on hopes for the Obama Presidency .
But by late summer 2009 , the aggregate loss of jobs , credit and wealth will cause an economic crisis that makes our current situation look pretty mild .
With predictions of up to a million jobs lost each month , there will simply come a point at which the economy as we understand it now cannot function – we will see the modern equivalents of breadlines and stockbrokers selling apples on the streets .
2 . Many plans for infrastructure investments currently being proposed will never be completed , and many may never be started , because the US may be unable to borrow the money to fund them .
The price of globalization will be high in terms of reduced availability of funds and resources – despite all the people who think that we ’ll keep building things during a collapse , we wo n’t .
We will have some variation on a Green New Deal in the US and some nations will continue to work on renewable infrastructure , but a lot of us are going to be getting along with the fraying infrastructure , designed for a people able to afford a lot of cheap energy , that we have now .
The most successful projects will be small , localized programs that distribute resources as widely as possible .
I pray that we will have the brains to ignore most other things and set up some kind of health care system , one that softens the blows here .
If not , we ’re really fucked – the one thing most of us ca n’t afford is medical care as it works now in a non-functioning economy .
Unfortunately , my bet is that we do n’t do something about this , but I hope to God I ’m wrong .
3. 2009 will be the year that most of the most passionate climate activists ( and I do n’t exclude myself ) have to admit that there is simply not a snowball ’s chance in hell ( and hell is getting toastier quickly ) that we are going to prevent a 2C + warming of the planet .
We are simply too little , too late .
That does not mean we will give up on everything – the difference between unchecked emissions and checked ones is still the difference between life and death for millions – but hideously , regretfully and painfully , the combination of our growing understanding of where the climate is and the economic situation will force us to begin working from the reality that the world we leave our children is simply going to be more damaged , and our legacy smaller and less worthy of us than we ’d ever hoped .
4. 2008 will probably be the world ’s global oil peak , but we wo n’t know this for a while .
When we do realize it , it will be anticlimactic , because we ’ll be mired in the consequences of our economic , energy and climate crisis .
Lack of investment in the coming years will mean that in the end , more oil stays in the ground , which is good for the climate , but tough for our ambitions for a renewable energy economy .
Over the long term , however , peak oil is very much going to come back and bite us all in the collective ass .
5 . Decreased access to goods , services and food will be a reality this year .
Some of this will be due to stores going out of business – we may all have to travel further to meet needs .
Some will be due to suppliers going under , following the wave of merchant bankruptcies .
Some may be due to disruptions in shipping and transport of supplies .
Some will be due to increased demand for some items that have , up until now , been niche items , produced in small numbers for the small number of sustainability freaks , but that now seem to have widespread application .
And some may be due to deflation - farmers may not be able to harvest crops because they ca n’t get enough for them to pay for the harvest , and the connections between those who have goods and those who need goods may be thoroughly disrupted .
Meanwhile , millions more Americans will be choosing between new shoes and seeing the doctor .
6. Most Americans will see radical cut backs in local services and safety nets .
Funding will simply dry up for many state and local programs .
Unemployment will be overwhelmed , and the federal government will have to withdraw some of its commitments simply to keep people from starving in the streets .
Meanwhile , expect to see the plows stop plowing , the garbage cease to be collected , and classrooms to have 40 + kindergarteners to a class – and potentially a three or four day school week .
7. Nations will overwhelmingly fail to pony up promised commitments to the world ’s poor , and worldwide , the people who did the least harm to the environment will die increasingly rapidly of starvation .
This will not be inevitable , but people in the rich world will claim it is .
8 . We will finally attempt to deal with foreclosures , but the falling value of housing will make it a losing proposition .
Every time we bring the housing values down to meet the reality , the reality will shift under our feet .
Many of those who are helped will end up foreclosed upon anyway ( as is already the case ) and others will simply see no point in paying their mortgage when , by defaulting , they could qualify for lowered payments ( as is already the case ) .
Ultimately , the issue will probably self resolve in either some kind of redistribution plan that puts people in foreclosed houses with minimal mortgaging , with foreclosures dragging down enough banks that people find it feasible to simply stop paying mortgages that are now unenforceable , or with civil unrest that leads people simply to take back housing for the populace .
I do n’t have a bet on which one , and I do n’t think it will be resolved in 2009 .
9 . By the end of the year , whether or not we will collapse or have collapsed will continue to be hotly debated by everyone who can still afford their internet service .
No one will agree on what the definition of collapse actually is , plenty of people will simply be living their old lives , only with a bit less , while others will be having truly apocalyptic and deeply tragic losses .
Some will see the victims as lazy , stupid , alien and worthless , no matter how many there are .
Others will look around them and ask “ how did I not see that this was inevitable ? ”
Many people will be forced to see that the poor are not a monolith of laziness and selfishness when they become poor .
We will know that we are in our situation only in retrospect , only in hindsight – our children will have a better name for the experience than we will , caught up in our varied personal senses of what is happening Meanwhile , each time things get harder most of us will believe they are at the bottom , that things are now “ normal ” and adapt , until it becomes hard to remember what our old expectations were .
10 . Despite how awful this is , the reality is that not everything will fall apart .
In the US , we will find life hard and stressful , but we will also go forward .
People will suck a lot up and retrench .
It will turn out that ordinary people were always better than commentators at figuring out what to do – that ’s why they stopped shopping even while people were begging them to keep buying .
So they ’ll move in with their siblings and grow gardens and walk away from their overpriced houses , or fight to keep them .
Some of them will suffer badly for it , but a surprising number of people will simply be ok in situations that until now , they would have imagined were impossible to survive .
We will endure , sometimes even find ways of loving our new lives .
There will be acts of remarkable courage and heroism , and acts of the most profound evil and selfishness .
There will be enormous losses – but we will also discover that most of us are more than we think we are – can tolerate more and have more courage and compassion than we believe of ourselves .
An early Happy New Year , everyone .
May you know better than you deserve and see others at their best in these hard times .

Bertrand Russell remarked that
Everything is vague to a degree you do not realize till you have tried to make it precise .
I ’m mulling over automatic differentiation ( AD ) again , neatening up previous posts on derivatives and on linear maps , working them into a coherent whole for an ICFP submission .
I understand the mechanics and some of the reasons for its correctness .
After all , it ’s " just the chain rule " .
As usual , in the process of writing , I bumped up against Russell ’s principle .
I felt a growing uneasiness and realized that I did n’t understand AD in the way I like to understand software , namely ,
What does it mean , independently of implementation ?
How do the implementation and its correctness flow gracefully from that meaning ?
Where else might we go , guided by answers to the first two questions ?
Ever since writing Simply efficient functional reactivity , the idea of type class morphisms keeps popping up for me as a framework in which to ask and answer these questions .
To my delight , this framework gives me new and more satisfying insight into automatic differentiation .
What ’s a derivative ?
My first guess is that AD has something to do with derivatives , which then raises the question of what is a derivative .
For now , I ’m going to substitute a popular but problematic answer to that question and say that deriv ∷ ⋯ ⇒ ( a → b ) → ( a → b ) -- simplification
As discussed in What is a derivative , really ? , the popular answer has limited usefulness , applying just to scalar ( one - dimensional ) domain .
The real deal involves distinguishing the type b from the type a :-* b of linear maps from a to b .
deriv ∷ ( VectorSpace u , VectorSpace v ) ⇒ ( u → v ) → ( u → ( u :-* v ) )
Why care about derivatives ?
Derivatives are useful in a variety of application areas , including root - finding , optimization , curve and surface tessellation , and computation of surface normals for 3D rendering .
Considering the usefulness of derivatives , it is worthwhile to find software methods that are simple ( to implement and verify ) ,
convenient ,
accurate ,
efficient , and
general .
What is n't AD ?
Numeric approximation
One differentiation method numeric approximation , using simple finite differences .
This method is based on the definition of ( scalar ) derivative : deriv f x ≡ lim h → 0 ( f ( x + h ) - f x ) / h
The left - hand side reads " the derivative of f at x " .
To approximate the derivative , use deriv f x ≈ ( f ( x + h ) - f x ) / h for a small value of h .
While very simple , this method is often inaccurate , due to choosing either too large or too small a value for h .
( Small values of h lead to rounding errors . )
More sophisticated variations improve accuracy while sacrificing simplicity .
Symbolic differentiation A second method is symbolic differentiation .
Instead of using the definition of deriv directly , the symbolic method uses a collection of rules , such as those below : deriv ( u + v ) ≡ deriv u + deriv v
deriv ( u * v ) ≡ deriv v * u + deriv u * v
deriv ( - u ) ≡ - deriv u
deriv ( exp u ) ≡ deriv u * exp u
deriv ( log u ) ≡ deriv u / u
deriv ( sqrt u ) ≡ deriv u / ( 2 * sqrt u )
deriv ( sin u ) ≡ deriv u * cos u
deriv ( cos u ) ≡ deriv u * ( - sin u )
deriv ( asin u ) ≡ deriv u / ( sqrt ( 1 - u ^ 2 ) )
deriv ( acos u ) ≡ - deriv u / ( sqrt ( 1 - u ^ 2 ) )
deriv ( atan u ) ≡ deriv u / ( u ^ 2 + 1 )
deriv ( sinh u ) ≡ deriv u * cosh u
deriv ( cosh u ) ≡ deriv u * sinh u
deriv ( asinh u ) ≡ deriv u / ( sqrt ( u ^ 2 + 1 ) )
deriv ( acosh u ) ≡ - deriv u / ( sqrt ( u ^ 2 - 1 ) )
deriv ( atanh u ) ≡ deriv u / ( 1 - u ^ 2 )
There are two main drawbacks to the symbolic approach to differentiation .
As a symbolic method , it requires access to and transformation of source code , and placing restrictions on that source code .
Implementations tend to be quite expensive and in particular perform redundant computation .
( I wonder if this latter criticism is a straw man argument .
Are symbolic methods necessarily expensive or just when implemented naïvely ?
For instance , can simply memoized symbolic differentiation be nearly as cheap as AD ? )
What is AD and how does it work ?
A third method is the topic of this post , namely automatic differentiation ( also called " algorithmic differentiation " ) , or " AD " .
The idea of AD is to simultaneously manipulate values and derivatives .
Overloading of the standard numerical operations ( and literals ) makes this combined manipulation as convenient and elegant as manipulating values without derivatives .
The implementation of AD can be quite simple , as shown below : data D a = D a a deriving ( Eq , Show )
instance Num a ⇒ Num ( D a ) where
D x x ' + D y y' = D ( x + y ) ( x ' + y ')
D x x ' * D y y' = D ( x * y ) ( y ' * x + x ' * y )
fromInteger x = D ( fromInteger x ) 0
negate ( D x x ' ) = D ( negate x ) ( negate x ' )
signum ( D x _ ) = D ( signum x ) 0
abs ( D x x ' ) = D ( abs x ) ( x ' * signum x )
instance Fractional x ⇒ Fractional ( D x ) where
fromRational x = D ( fromRational x ) 0
recip ( D x x ' ) = D ( recip x ) (- x ' / sqr x )
sqr ∷ Num a ⇒ a → a
sqr x = x * x
instance Floating x ⇒ Floating ( D x ) where
π = D π 0
exp ( D x x ' ) = D ( exp x ) ( x ' * exp x )
log ( D x x ' ) = D ( log x ) ( x ' / x )
sqrt ( D x x ' ) = D ( sqrt x ) ( x ' / ( 2 * sqrt x ) )
sin ( D x x ' ) = D ( sin x ) ( x ' * cos x )
cos ( D x x ' ) = D ( cos x ) ( x ' * ( - sin x ) )
asin ( D x x ' ) = D ( asin x ) ( x ' / sqrt ( 1 - sqr x ) )
acos ( D x x ' ) = D ( acos x ) ( x ' / ( - sqrt ( 1 - sqr x ) ) )
-- ⋯
As an example , define f1 ∷ Floating a ⇒ a → a
f1 z = sqrt ( 3 * sin z )
and try it out in GHCi : * Main > f1 ( D 2 1 )
D 1 . 6516332160855343 ( - 0 . 3779412091869595 )
To test correctness , here is a symbolically differentiated version : f2 ∷ Floating a ⇒ a → D a
f2 x = D ( f1 x ) ( 3 * cos x / ( 2 * sqrt ( 3 * sin x ) ) )
Try it out : * Main > f2 2
D 1 . 6516332160855343 ( - 0 . 3779412091869595 )
The can also be made prettier , as in Beautiful differentiation .
Add an operator that captures the chain rule , which is behind the differentiation laws listed above .
infix 0 >-<
( >-< ) ∷
Num a ⇒ ( a → a ) → ( a → a ) → ( D a → D a )
( f >-< f ' ) ( D a a ' ) = D ( f a ) ( a ' * f ' a )
Then , e.g. , instance Floating a ⇒ Floating ( D a ) where
π = D π 0
exp = exp >-< exp
log = log >-< recip
sqrt = sqrt >-< recip ( 2 * sqrt )
sin = sin >-< cos
cos = cos >-< - sin
asin = asin >-< recip ( sqrt ( 1 - sqr ) )
acos = acos >-< recip ( - sqrt ( 1 - sqr ) )
-- ⋯
This AD implementation satisfy most of our criteria very well :
It is simple to implement and verify .
Both the implementation and its correctness follow directly from the familiar laws given above .
It is convenient to use , as shown with f1 above .
above .
It is accurate , as shown above , producing exactly the same result as the symbolic differentiated code ( f2 ) .
) .
It is efficient , involving no iteration or redundant computation .
The formulation above does less well with generality :
It computes only first derivatives .
It applies ( correctly ) only to functions over a scalar ( one - dimensional ) domain , excluding even complex numbers .
Both of these limitations are removed in the post Higher - dimensional , higher - order derivatives , functionally .
What is AD , really ?
How do we know whether this AD implementation is correct ?
We can't begin to address this question until we first answer a more fundamental one : what does its correctness mean ?
A model for AD I 'm pretty sure AD has something to do with calculating a function 's values and derivative values simultaneously , so I 'll start there .
withD ∷ ⋯ ⇒ ( a → a ) → ( a → D a )
withD f x = D ( f x ) ( deriv f x )
Or , in point - free form , withD f = lift A2 D f ( deriv f )
Since , on functions , lift A2 h f g = λ x → h ( f x ) ( g x )
We do n't have an implementation of deriv , so this definition of withD will serve as a specification , not an implementation .
If AD is structured as type class instances , then I 'd want there to be a compelling interpretation function that is faithful to each of those classes , as in the principle of type class morphisms , which is to say that the interpretation of each method corresponds to the same method for the interpretation .
For AD , the interpretation function is withD .
It 's turned around this time ( mapping to instead of from our type ) , as is sometimes the case .
The Num , Fractional , and Floating morphisms provide the specifications of the instances : withD ( u + v ) ≡ withD u + withD v
withD ( u * v ) ≡ withD u * withD v
withD ( sin u ) ≡ sin ( withD u )
⋯
Note here that the methods on the left are on a → a , and on the right are on a → D a .
These ( morphism ) properties exactly define correctness of any implementation of AD , answering my first question :
What does it mean , independently of implementation ?
Deriving an AD implementation
Now that we have a simple , formal specification of AD ( numeric type class morphisms ) , we can try to prove that the implementation above satisfies the specification .
Better yet , let 's do the reverse , and use the morphism properties to discover the implementation , and prove it correct in the process .
Addition
Here is the addition specification : withD ( u + v ) ≡ withD u + withD v
Start with the left - hand side : withD ( u + v )
≡ {- def of withD -}
liftA2 D ( u + v ) ( deriv ( u + v ) )
≡ {- deriv rule for (+ ) -}
liftA2 D ( u + v ) ( deriv u + deriv v )
≡ {- liftA2 on functions -}
λ x → D ( ( u + v ) x ) ( ( deriv u + deriv v ) x )
≡ {- (+ ) on functions -}
λ x → D ( u x + v x ) ( deriv u x + deriv v x )
Then start over with the right - hand side : withD u + withD v
≡ {- (+ ) on functions -}
λ x → withD u x + withD v x
≡ {- def of withD -}
λ x → D ( u x ) ( deriv u x ) + D ( v x ) ( deriv v x )
We need a definition of (+ ) on D that makes these two final forms equal , i.e. , λ x → D ( u x + v x ) ( deriv u x + deriv v x )
≡
λ x → D ( u x ) ( deriv u x ) + D ( v x ) ( deriv v x )
An easy choice is D a a ' + D b b' = D ( a + b ) ( a ' + b ' )
This definition provides the missing link and that completes the proof that withD ( u + v ) ≡ withD u + withD v
Multiplication
The specification : withD ( u * v ) ≡ withD u * withD v
Reason similarly to the addition case .
Begin with the left hand side : withD ( u * v )
≡ {- def of withD -}
liftA2 D ( u * v ) ( deriv ( u * v ) )
≡ {- deriv rule for (*) -}
liftA2 D ( u * v ) ( deriv u * v + deriv v * u )
≡ {- liftA2 on functions -}
λ x → D ( ( u * v ) x ) ( ( deriv u * v + deriv v * u ) x )
≡ {- (*) and (+ ) on functions -}
λ x → D ( u x * v x ) ( deriv u x * v x + * deriv v x * u x )
Then start over with the right - hand side : withD u * withD v
≡ {- (* ) on functions -}
λ x → withD u x * withD v x
≡ {- def of withD -}
λ x → D ( u x ) ( deriv u x ) * D ( v x ) ( deriv v x )
Sufficient definition : D a a ' * D b b' = D ( a + b ) ( a ' * b + b ' * a )
Sine Specification : withD ( sin u ) ≡ sin ( withD u )
Begin with the left hand side : withD ( sin u )
≡ {- def of withD -}
liftA2 D ( sin u ) ( deriv ( sin u ) )
≡ {- deriv rule for sin -}
liftA2 D ( sin u ) ( deriv u * cos u )
≡ {- liftA2 on functions -}
λ x → D ( ( sin u ) x ) ( ( deriv u * cos u ) x )
≡ {- sin , ( * ) and cos on functions -}
λ x → D ( sin ( u x ) ) ( deriv u x * cos ( u x ) )
Then start over with the right - hand side : sin ( withD u )
≡ {- sin on functions -}
λ x → sin ( withD u x )
≡ {- def of withD -}
λ x → sin ( D ( u x ) ( deriv u x ) )
Sufficient definition : sin ( D a a ' ) = D ( sin a ) ( a ' * cos a )
Or , using the chain rule operator , sin = sin >-< cos
The whole implementation can be derived in exactly this style , answering my second question :
How does the implementation and its correctness flow gracefully from that meaning ?
Higher - order derivatives Given answers to the first two questions , let 's , turn to the third :
Where else might we go , guided by answers to the first two questions ?
Jerzy Karczmarczuk extended the D representation above to an infinite " lazy tower of derivatives " , in the paper Functional Differentiation of Computer Programs .
data D a = D a ( D a )
The withD function easily adapts to this new D type : withD ∷ ⋯ ⇒ ( a → a ) → ( a → D a )
withD f x = D ( f x ) ( withD ( deriv f ) x )
or withD f = lift A2 D f ( withD ( deriv f ) )
These definitions were not brilliant insights .
I looked for the simplest , type - correct possibility ( without using ⊥ ) .
Similarly , I 'll try tweaking the previous derivations and see what pops out .
Addition Left - hand side : withD ( u + v )
≡ {- def of withD -}
liftA2 D ( u + v ) ( withD ( deriv ( u + v ) ) )
≡ {- deriv rule for (+ ) -}
liftA2 D ( u + v ) ( withD ( deriv u + deriv v ) )
≡ {- ( fixed - point ) induction withD and (+ ) -}
liftA2 D ( u + v ) ( withD ( deriv u ) + withD ( deriv v ) )
≡ {- def of lift A2 and (+ ) on functions -}
λ x → D ( u x + v x ) ( withD ( deriv u ) x + withD ( deriv v ) x )
Right - hand side : withD u + withD v
≡ {- (+ ) on functions -}
λ x → withD u x + withD v x
≡ {- def of withD -}
λ x → D ( u x ) ( withD ( deriv u x ) ) + D ( v x ) ( withD ( deriv v x ) )
Again , we need a definition of (+ ) on D that makes the LHS and RHS final forms equal , i.e. , λ x → D ( u x + v x ) ( withD ( deriv u ) x + with ( deriv v ) x )
≡
λ x → D ( u x ) ( withD ( deriv u ) x ) + D ( v x ) ( withD ( deriv v ) x )
Again , an easy choice is D a a ' + D b b' = D ( a + b ) ( a ' + b ')
Multiplication Left - hand side : withD ( u * v )
≡ {- def of withD -}
liftA2 D ( u * v ) ( withD ( deriv ( u * v ) ) )
≡ {- deriv rule for (*) -}
liftA2 D ( u * v ) ( withD ( deriv u * v + deriv v * u ) )
≡ {- induction for withD /(+ ) -}
liftA2 D ( u * v ) ( withD ( deriv u * v ) + withD ( deriv v * u ) )
≡ {- induction for withD /(*) -}
liftA2 D ( u * v ) ( withD ( deriv u ) * withD v + withD ( deriv v ) * withD u )
≡ {- lift A2 , ( * ) , (+ ) on functions -}
λ x → lift A2 D ( u x * v x ) ( withD ( deriv u ) x * withD v x + withD ( deriv v ) x * withD u x )
Right - hand side : withD u * withD v
≡ {- def of withD -}
liftA2 D u ( withD ( deriv u ) ) * liftA2 D v ( withD ( deriv v ) )
≡ {- liftA2 and ( * ) on functions -}
λ x → D ( u x ) ( withD ( deriv u ) x ) * D ( v x ) ( withD ( deriv v ) x )
A sufficient definition : a @ ( D a0 a ' ) * b @ ( D b0 b' ) = D ( a0 + b0 ) ( a ' * b + b ' * a )
Because withD u x ≡ D ( u x ) ( withD ( deriv u ) x )
withD v x ≡ D ( v x ) ( withD ( deriv v ) x )
Sine Left - hand side : withD ( sin u )
≡ {- def of withD -}
liftA2 D ( sin u ) ( withD ( deriv ( sin u ) ) )
≡ {- deriv rule for sin -}
liftA2 D ( sin u ) ( withD ( deriv u * cos u ) )
≡ {- induction for withD /(*) -}
liftA2 D ( sin u ) ( withD ( deriv u ) * withD ( cos u ) )
≡ {- induction for withD / cos -}
liftA2 D ( sin u ) ( withD ( deriv u ) * cos ( withD u ) )
≡ {- lift A2 , sin , cos and ( * ) on functions -}
λ x → D ( sin ( u x ) ) ( withD ( deriv u ) x * cos ( withD u x ) )
Right - hand side : sin ( withD u )
≡ {- def of withD -}
sin ( liftA2 D u ( withD ( deriv u ) ) )
≡ {- liftA2 and sin on functions -}
λ x → sin ( D ( u x ) ( withD ( deriv u ) x ) )
To make the LHS and RHS final forms equal , define sin a @ ( D a0 a ' ) ≡ D ( sin a0 ) ( a ' * cos a )
Higher - dimensional derivatives I 'll save non-scalar ( " multi-variate " ) differentiation for another time .
In addition to the considerations above , the key ideas are in Higher - dimensional , higher - order derivatives , functionally and Simpler , more efficient , functional linear maps .
Bertrand Russell remarked that Everything is vague to a degree you do not realize till you have tried to make it precise .
I ’m mulling over automatic differentiation ( AD ) again , neatening ...
The Obama administration on Friday lost its bid to halt a lawsuit charging that President George W. Bush broke the law when he authorized warrantless spying on terrorism suspects , the only such case to make it to federal court .
A federal appeals court rejected the Justice Department ’s bid to halt the lawsuit by a now - defunct Islamic charity over warrantless wiretapping .
The failed attempt was the second time this month that Obama officials argued that the presidential “ state secrets privilege ” trumped federal law in national security matters , a position consistently maintained by President Obama ’s predecessor .
The administration said national security would be compromised if the lawsuit by the Oregon chapter of Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation went forward .
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ’ decision could clear the way for a court to rule on whether the previous administration ’s practice of warrantless wiretapping was legal .
Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 , Congress created a special national security court to vet sensitive warrant requests , but Bush bypassed it in pursuit of terrorism suspects after the Sept. 11 attacks .
The government could seek an emergency injunction from the U.S. Supreme Court as a last resort to prevent pre-trial proceedings from going forward before U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker in San Francisco .
Walker had given the administration until Friday to present its position on evidentiary and procedural questions .
It was n’t clear whether the government met that deadline ; a recording on the phone in Walker ’s chambers said the judge was unavailable until next week .

Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller said the administration had no comment on the 9th Circuit ruling , including whether it would seek Supreme Court intervention .
The Obama White House has continued to defend Bush ’s claims to expanded powers to shield controversial counter - terrorism actions from lawsuits , alarming civil rights advocates who had expected a change in policy with the new president .
“ I think all of us are incredulous that the Obama administration seems to be taking the precise same extreme positions as the Bush administration , ” said Jon Eisenberg , an Oakland lawyer representing Al - Haramain .
“ Maybe they just have n’t had enough time yet to get up to speed .
But as the weeks pass and no change is in the offing , one becomes increasingly worried that we ’re not going to see any change we can believe in with regard to the Obama administration ’s approach to state secrets privilege . ”
In another case challenging the presidential privilege , the Obama administration urged the appeals court on Feb. 9 to throw out a lawsuit about CIA clandestine operations in the alleged kidnapping and torture of terrorism suspects .
A ruling on that case , Mohamed vs. Jeppesen DataPlan Inc. , is pending .
In both the Al - Haramain and Mohamed cases , all three judges on the 9th Circuit panels are appointees of Democratic presidents .

Earlier this month , Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. ordered a review of all cases in which the government has fought off lawsuits by invoking the state secrets doctrine .
The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups have repeatedly attempted to take the government to trial over warrantless wiretapping but have been thwarted by federal court rulings that they lacked standing to sue unless their individual privacy rights had been violated .
Of more than 50 challenges to warrantless wiretapping , only in the Al - Haramain case has evidence emerged that names U.S. citizens subjected to surveillance .
The case stems from classified documents that the Bush administration accidentally sent to the charity ’s Oregon chapter .
Lawyers Wendell Belew and Asim Ghafoor , who represented the charity when it was being investigated by the Treasury Department , learned that their attorney - client discussions had been subject to eavesdropping by the National Security Agency .

The Bush administration declared the documents were state secrets and ordered them secured and available only to those with top national security clearances .
In a 2007 ruling , the 9th Circuit upheld the president ’s right to declare the documents confidential but sent the case back to Walker ’s court to decide whether the 1978 surveillance law preempted the state secrets privilege .
Walker ruled in July that Bush could n’t rely solely on the state secrets privilege to justify warrantless spying .
Recognized by the Supreme Court 54 years ago in U.S. vs. Reynolds , the privilege bars disclosure of information in court proceedings when “ there is a reasonable danger that the compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which , in the interest of national security , should not be divulged . ”
The effect of Friday ’s 9th Circuit ruling appears to leave it up to Walker , not the Justice Department , to decide whether lawyers representing the foundation who have recently acquired top security clearances should have access to the classified documents and be able to use them , perhaps under seal , to establish standing to sue .

Al - Haramain , based in Saudi Arabia , was a global network of charity offices that funneled aid to Muslims under siege in places like Bosnia and Chechnya .
The Saudi government closed down the foundation after the U.N. Security Council said it had ties to Al Qaeda and the U.S. Treasury Department froze its assets and branded it an operation supporting terrorism .

Felicia Day Interview
It ’s really rare that we get the chance to interview someone about something other than the video game they are working on or whatever product they are hawking so we jumped at the chance to interview Felicia Day .
If you do n’t know who she is she ’s the director / writer / star of The Guild , an online show about a guild of World of Warcraft players .
She ’s also a veteran Hollywood actress who ’s appeared in Buffy the Vampire Slayer , House , and will be starring in an upcoming episode of Dollhouse .
Gaming was my # 1 pastime as a kid .
I was homeschooled and it was the best thing I did to pass time at home alone with my brother .
We would fight over who got to play :) .
My earliest memory was playing Zork on my grandpa ’s “ Laptop ” , which was so huge , it was the size of a desk , haha .
One time we ran up a 300 dollar phone bill calling into the Sierra hint line for King ’s Quest .
That did n’t my Mom very happy at the time .
I got into WOW several years ago because my brother recruited me into his guild , but I ’ve always played every RPG out there for the PC .
For this year , I am definitely looking forward to more about the KOTOR and Star Trek MMORPGs and Diablo 3 of course : Diablo 2 was almost the death of my college career .
I play at least 10 - 20 hours a week .
I have a Wii and an Xbox , a DS , games on my iPhone and of course games on my Mac / PC .
I definitely do n’t get to play as much as I would LIKE due to all the work I ’m doing on my web shows , but it ’s never a tossup between going OUT and staying IN to play games : the games always win the Friday night .
For season 2 I wrote the whole season at once , it turned out to be 100 pages , feature length , and rewrote the episodes between shoots on the weekends .
We averaged a day and a half an episode this season , because we had more locations , more crew and actors , and were shooting on HD .
It was a much bigger affair for Season 2 .
The hardest lesson I guess was learning how to roll out episodes 1 x a week instead of 1 x a month .
A lot of logistics to work out and get the episodes delivered on time .
The easiest episodes are the ones where the cast are at their computers separately , and the hardest episodes were the last four of Season 2 because we had like 20 extras , were shooting in small quarters , fight scenes , etc .
It was a lot to chew off on such a small budget !
The good will of the fans comes in handy for our show ; we ’re so lucky that they ’re talented and want to help make the show what it is .
I did n’t set out for this to continue indefinitely , but it seems like these characters have a will of their own , stories for them keep popping up in my head , so I ’ll continue as long as that happens !
Interesting question !
Codex has been my handle all my life , it ’s from the Ultima games .
I definitely remember Zaboo ’s name was “ Puck ” at one point , and Clara ’s was “ Muffins ” , until I had the idea of her using her own name .
I definitely do n’t make my living off the internet , I ’m an actress and pay my bills that way :) Yes , we deliberately use generic RPG terminology , at first to avoid copyright , and then after that to make sure we focused on the characters and not arguing about crit ratings etc .
It ’s a delicate balance between satisfying the gaming aspects and the non-gaming aspects , but at the end of the day , these characters are people who game , they ’ve created a community through gaming , but they ’re more than their labels of “ gamers . ”
As we all are .
Strangely , not a lot !
I ’m not sure that we have subtitles in Korean through Xbox Live or not , but I ’d love to get the word out over there .
Maybe a Korean version of The Guild with Korean actors ?
That would be cool ! :) I do n’t think anyone would accuse me of that .
I set out to show the world that gamers are not sullen dudes living in their mom ’s basement , like mainstream media portrays them .
Adults play , parents play , pretty girls play .
This is a rich culture , and I try to be careful about making FUN of the characters vs. HAVING fun with them .
Apart from that , I personally AM socially awkward , so whatever , I ’m writing what I know .
I knew I wanted a love interest for Codex for the season who WASN ’T a gamer , and it took 2 months for me to come up with a non-cheesy character my audience would n’t hate on sight and was n’t a cliché .
I ’ve worked with lots of stunt guys in my time as an actor , so when I stumbled on the idea , everything fell in place .
He ’s a GREAT actor , we were so lucky to have him as part of the cast .
The Guild predated Dr. Horrible , so no the inspiration did n’t come from it , but the webcam conceit is n’t exactly new , I did n’t invent it .
I fought using it for quite a while when I wrote the script , but the visceral connection of a person staring out at you is powerful when watching things on a tiny internet screen .
And Codex is such an introverted person that we find out much more about her personality through the webcams than when she interacts with other people .
They are great supporters of the show , we went to Blizzcon and gave a panel and they provided us with a booth .
I love everyone I ’ve met over there .
We are great fans of each other haha !
We started shooting Episode 1 of Season 2 of The Guild on our DVD money because I did n’t want to sell the rights to the show to a production partner , and that was what everyone wanted to fund the show .
We stuck to our guns , and then magically Xbox came in and wanted to partner to deliver the show to a whole new audience .
They got the show , they did n’t want ownership , and they got Sprint on board to sponsor .
We have a huge number of new fans through Xbox Live , and the show is downloadable on people ’s TVs right next to traditional Hollywood shows in their Marketplace .
It ’s an amazing distribution opportunity , and they are so supportive and fun to work with .
It ’s a dream come true .
, As far as opening new doors , it has to a certain extent , but Hollywood still does n’t look at web video as quite“ legitimate ” , so it has n’t really helped my acting career that much .
I do think having the confidence of running my own show has made me a better actor .
I ’m not begging for approval anymore , which was why I started doing this in the first place .

As expected , the venture industry is seeing the fallout from the economic crisis , with fourth - quarter investments dropping to a total of $ 5.4 billion invested in 818 companies , according to a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association based on data provided by Thomson Reuters .
That ’s a 33 percent plunge from the $ 8.09 billion invested in 1,051 companies in the fourth quarter of 2007 .
With the exception of a few industries , these fourth - quarter numbers show a sharp pullback by VCs between the third and fourth quarters of 2008 .
Indeed , VCs are nursing their growing portfolios of later - stage companies that are unable to exit through a public sale or an initial public offering — and waiting for the economic fallout to subside .
As we reported after the third - quarter NVCA conference call , valuations are down for venture - backed companies seeking additional rounds of financing .
With exit markets essentially closed , there remains a cluster of later - stage deals cluttering up venture portfolios .
Pascal Levensohn , of Levensohn Venture Partners , notes that this is an expecially good time to get a better deal on later - stage companies willing to settle for early - stage valuations .
“ Capitalization models are out of sync with the reality of the market , ” he says .
The MoneyTree data also tries to look on the bright side , noting , for example , that in all of 2008 , VCs made the most seed - stage investments since 2000 .
They put $ 1.5 billion into 440 companies , compared to $ 1.3 billion into 450 companies during 2007 .
However , those seed investments fell along with all the other investments during the last three months of the year , with $ 199 million going into 62 startups — a 47 percent drop in dollar terms and a 43 percent slide in terms of companies over the fourth quarter of 2007 .
And the fourth - quarter dive caused 2008 to be the first since 2003 that venture capital investing has declined on an annual basis .
With venture firms pondering their investment strategies , so far startups in the media and entertainment business and cleantech are still seeing a slight increase in deals , making it appear that venture firms are pulling back most strongly from the software , semiconductor and Internet technology sectors .

Yesterday , I mentioned that the economic stimulus bill included some measures designed to help small business in these times of economic turmoil .
There are also some changes to the way business taxes will be figured for 2008 .
Here are some of the things to be aware of for your home business when figuring your 2008 taxes :
Self - employment tax
This one is actually a bit of a bummer .
The amount of your income from your home business subject to Social Security tax used to be $ 97,500 .
Now it is $ 102,000 starting in tax year 2008 .
Deferred compensation plans
It used to be that deferred income from compensation plans was made in the year of the deferral .
Now , however , things have changed .
Unfortunately , the rules are complex and difficult , and different situations are taken into account .
You should probably check with the IRS or a tax professional to see what your situation requires .
Mileage rate
If you drive a lot for your home business , you can deduct some of your expenses .
In 2008 , the new mileage rate is 50.5 cents per mile for the first six months , and 58.5 cents per mile for the second half .
This rather generous change was due to the spiking gas prices last summer .
Look for the mileage rate to come down in 2009 , I think .
Write - offs for business purchases
For 2008 , the amount you can write off has increased .
You can write off a total up to $ 800,000 .
Additionally , the new allowance ( for tax year 2008 only ) for property and / or business equipment is $ 250,000 .
If your home business is organized as an S - corporation , you should also consult the IRS or a tax professional about the new income situation — which includes losses to the S - corp .
when selling stocks or real estate in volatile 2008 .
You can learn more about 2008 tax rules at IRS.gov , or buy contacting an accountant or other tax professional .

Documents unsealed by a federal court in the " Vista Capable " lawsuit reportedly reveal that Microsoft would have to come up with as much as $ 8.5 billion to settle accounts with customers affected by its 2006 " Vista Capable " marketing debacle .
Keith Leffler , a University of Washington economist and expert witness for the plaintiffs , estimates that it would cost a minimum of $ 3.92 billion to as much as $ 8.52 billion to upgrade the 19.4 million PCs that were sold as Vista Capable to hardware capable of running premium versions of Windows Vista .
( Source : computerworld.com )
Leffler said in a heavily - redacted report that he used data provided by Microsoft to arrive at the number of " Vista upgradeable " PCs sold in the U.S. from April 2006 when the Vista Capable marketing campaign started to January 2007 when Vista hit retail shelves .
Leffler estimates that of the 19.4 millions PCs , 13.75 million notebooks and 5.65 million desktop computers were classified as Vista Capable but were not able to meet the more stringent requirements for the " Premium Ready " label .
Leffler estimated how much it would cost to upgrade each Vista Capable machine to 1GB of memory and a graphic card capable of running Aero .
He figured it would cost a maximum of $ 155 to upgrade each desktop and between $ 245 and $ 590 to upgrade each notebook .
The fluctuation in costs of upgrading notebooks were due to the more expensive replacement of a graphics chip set .
Leffler said that in some cases , notebooks would not be able to be upgraded sufficiently to handle any other version of Windows Vista but Home Basic , alluding that some notebooks would have to be replaced with a new machine .
In all , Leffler estimates it would cost Microsoft $ 832.7 million to upgrade Vista Capable desktops and between $ 3.08 billion and $ 7.69 billion to upgrade Vista Capable notebooks .
Microsoft responded by filing papers saying that " plaintiffs seek a remedy that would give them a Premium Ready PC even though they paid for a non-Premium Ready PC , " and that it would be a windfall to millions .
The criteria set by Microsoft and used by computer makers said that Vista Capable meant the machine was ready to at least run Windows Vista Basic , but may not be able to run a more powerful version .
A ' Premium Ready ' logo meant that the PC was able to run a higher version of Windows Vista , such as Vista Home Premium , Vista Business and Vista Ultimate .
The lawsuit is set to go to trial in April .

With global economic growth having come to a shuddering halt , credit markets on life support , currencies faltering , and unemployment rates forging upwards , the United States Army is finally enjoying some relief .
Overworked and stressed out , its recruiters have started to meet their annual goals with appreciably less effort , as unemployed young men , defeated by the recession , walk into their offices to sign up for what they hope will be one or two tours .
“ I ’m doing this for eight years , ” 22 - year - old Sean O’Neil told the New York Times .
“ Hopefully , when I get out , I ’ll have all my fingers and toes and arms , and the economy will have turned around , and I ’ll have a little egg to start up my own guitar line . ”
After an apprenticeship in St. Louis that did n’t pan out , O’Neil had found himself $ 30,000 in debt ; a stint in the military looked like the next best option .
When one reflects on it , there is a remarkable disconnect between the public image of well - scrubbed , idealistic young men from middle - class families ( you can visualize either a Normal Rockwell painting or a Soviet propaganda poster , as is your wont ) volunteering to serve their country , and the reality of lower - class kids with no job prospects being cajoled by aggressive recruiters into signing up .
“ What else are you gonna do , kid ?
Work at McDonald’s ?
Collect welfare ?
You think your momma ’s going to be proud of you ? ”
Demoralized and insecure eighteen - year - old boys do n’t normally have good answers to questions like those .
Yet as a democracy and a republic , America is the home of a deep - seated belief in the essential nobility of the citizen - soldier , a belief that carries with it the unspoken assumption that the U.S. military is representative of the society it protects .
This idea is traceable to the Civil War era , when whole towns of young men would sign up at once — and , sometimes , would die at once — a collective act that made “ our boys ” an expression of the literal truth .
With the creation of federally - administered war cemeteries , which turned individual bodies into “ the nation ’s dead ” ( see Drew Gilpin Faust ’s This Republic of Suffering for an excellent discussion of this evolution ) , a national myth was born , a myth reinforced over time by images of American “ doughboys ” going off to World War I , of average guy G.I.s slogging through World War II , and of college graduates joining the Army after 9/11 .
In the days of their own republic , the Romans too shared a similar kind of belief .
To them , military service was an essential part of a citizen ’s life , and public office could not conceivably be attained without at least ten years duty in the army .
So honourable was it , in fact , that criteria for eligibility was comparatively high : a wealth standard kept out the poorest citizens , while richer ones could join ( in order of ascending personal wealth ) the light infantry , the heavy infantry , or the cavalry .
Since most soldiers were farmers , each year ’s military service primarily consisted of a short campaigning season , followed by a mustering out and a return to one ’s farm .
Service was a duty to the state , not a professional career .
This began to change for the Romans with the increasing distance and duration of campaigns , something brought about both by the expansion of Roman territory — putting the frontier further and further away — and by the increasing scale of warfare .
The Punic Wars against Carthage were Rome ’s most extensive to date , and the military soon found itself coping with rising discontent in the ranks as farmer - soldiers fighting in Africa realized that they would not be getting back to their crops in time to avoid serious reductions in their family incomes .
Garrison duty on the borders of the expanding Roman state became unpopular for the same reasons .
To escape this constraint on manpower and morale , the late Republic and later the Empire began hiring soldiers from the ranks of the poor , which changed the Roman army from a citizens ’ militia into a professional , full - time force .
Unfortunately , the myth of the citizen - soldier continued to maintain its grip on the Roman mind , and because the Senate therefore refused to pay the professionals very well , generals who could obtain the most benefits and plunder for their troops soon commanded more loyalty than did the Roman state itself .
“ By the time of the late Empire , ” wrote Jane Penrose in Rome and Her Enemies , soldiering was no longer considered to be a honourable or desirable profession . ”
Although by tradition the sons of soldiers were expected to serve , additional volunteers had to be tempted with bounties , and village by village conscription was instituted annually in order to fill the remaining gaps .
Desertion became a serious problem , and recruits en route to their units would be kept overnight in jails to prevent them running away , or branded on the arm to facilitate capture and dissuade escape .
The army also responded to the declining quality of conscripts by recruiting foreigners , usually Germans .
Eventually , perhaps only partly deliberately , the military achieved an almost total separation from Roman society , and became a powerful contributor to the collapse of the state it was sworn to defend .
The lessons for today ’s United States are obvious – or rather , they would be , if it was n’t for the British experience .
As Britain became a major military power in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries , its need for troops rose quickly .
Yet Britain was at the same time in possession of an essentially feudal form of social organization , which meant that concepts like “ citizen ” , and therefore citizen - soldier , were as foreign to the British as they were natural to the republican Romans .
The British , furthermore , were nervously aware of the importance to their national survival of the continued efforts of manual labourers and farmers to keep the economy rolling .
Thus , the policy was to recruit only the unemployed if possible .
“ The proper men to recruit and supply your troops are the scum and outcast of cities and manufacture , ” said MP Charles Turner in 1775 during a parliamentary debate on the establishment of a militia .
“ To take the honest , sober , industrious fellow from the plough , is doing an essential mischief to the community and laying a double tax . ”
The successful execution of this policy was famously confirmed by the Duke of Wellington thirty - eight years later when he observed in a dispatch to Lord Bathurst , the War Minister , that “ we have in the service the scum of the earth as common soldiers . ”
British army recruiting , therefore , remained formally voluntary and aggressively focused on the poor .
Enlistment was for life , and motivations for making such an iron commitment ranged from the temptation of money bounties , to the thirst for adventure , and even ( perhaps often ) simple hunger .
Press gangs were illegal but frequently used nonetheless , and in the 1690s some regiments even stooped to using “ crimps ” , thugs who would kidnap potential recruits and sell them to the army .
Direct legislative action helped too : the 1704 Recruiting Act , for example , allowed justices of the peace to conscript the unemployed .
Despite all this , the British army in Flanders during the Nine Years ’
War was thirty percent below strength , and foreign mercenaries comprised up to two - fifths of the army ’s active troops in this era — not only were mercenaries easier to find than British recruits , but they were significantly cheaper too .
In fact , what many British politicians were trying to avoid in holding the army apart from society was the feared militarization of the populace .
Even a part - time militia , argued the Duke of Newcastle in the mid-eighteenth century , “ would breed up our people to a love of arms , & military government ; & divert them from their true business , husbandry , manufacture , etc … ”
This philosophy turned republican Roman belief — which welcomed a military - oriented society , and which thought little of merchants and traders — on its head .
And yet , perhaps because of its ability and willingness to pay its professional soldiers properly , Britain never ran the risk of a military coup .
Today , both Britain and the United States , along with Canada and many other modern nations , have attained a comfortable status as prosperous commercial democracies , whose societies are as non-militarized as can be imagined , and who maintain relatively small militaries staffed entirely by volunteers .
For the majority of citizens who need not fear the discomfort and inconvenience of a two - year spell of conscripted military service , this is a wonderful situation .
But the Roman , British , and American experiences do warn us of one thing .
An army must give its loyalty to someone , and if by paying it well we ensure that this someone is not the generals , then we should be glad of that ; but we should also consider that by exempting ourselves from service , the army has been left free to give its loyalty to the state rather than to us .
We should n’t be surprised to find it engaged in war after war , defending “ interests ” we do n’t quite understand , and fighting ever longer and ever farther away from home .
What is there , after all , to hold it back ?
Isolongifolenone , a natural compound found in the Tauroniro tree ( Humiria balsamifera ) of South America , has been identified as an effective deterrent of mosquitoes and ticks , report researchers writing in the latest issue of Journal of Medical Entomology .
Derivatives of the compound have long been used as fragrances in cosmetics , perfumes , deodorants , and paper products , but new processing methods may make it as inexpensive to produce as DEET , a potent and widely available synthetic insect repellent that works by blocking the aroma of human sweat .
The authors , led by Aijun Zhang of the USDA ’s Invasive Insect Biocontrol and Behavior Laboratory , found that isolongifolenone deters the biting of the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi “ more effectively than the widely used synthetic chemical repellent N , N - diethyl - 3 - methyl benzamide ( DEET ) in laboratory bioassays ” and repels blacklegged ticks and lone star ticks “ as effectively as DEET ” .
Since “ isolongifolenone is easily synthesized from inexpensive turpentine oil feedstock , ” the authors write , “ we are therefore confident that the compound has significant potential as an inexpensive and safe repellent for protection of large human populations against blood - feeding arthropods . ”
Tauroniro — which is also known as Bastard bulletwood , Oloroso , Couramira , or Turanira — is found in marshy forests in the Guianas , Colombia , Venezuela , and the Brazilian Amazon , according to the U.S. Forest Service .

Colonel Sadatullah is the highest - ranked Pakistani national to be implicated in the three - day siege which left 164 people dead
Indian police have named a Pakistani colonel who they say was connected to November 's Mumbai terror attacks which left 164 people dead .
An 11,509 - page charge sheet filed by the Mumbai police yesterday named the officer as Colonel Sadatullah , the highest - ranked Pakistani to be implicated in the three - day siege of two luxury hotels and other sites that strained tensions between the two neighbours .
Sadatullah is a colonel in the special communications organisation ( SCO ) , a telecommunications agency of the Pakistani government run by officers from the army 's signal corps .
The SCO operates only in the Pakistani side of the divided province of Kashmir and Pakistan 's restive northern region .
According to the Times of India , a total of 284 calls totalling 995 minutes were made to Pakistani handlers by the terrorists using mobile phones from the Taj Mahal hotel , Oberoi - Trident and Nariman House , a Jewish centre .
Indian investigators say the calls were made using voice over internet protocol , or VoIP , a cheap way of making international calls .
They were traced to an IP address created with CallPhonex , a VoIP service provider based in New Jersey , in the US .
Payments for the calls were made by opening an account in the name of Kharak Singh , from India .
However , payments to the account were made by wire transfer through MoneyGram and Western Union Money Transfer by two Pakistani nationals , Javed Iqbal and Mohammed Ishtiaq .
The two used the email address ID kharak_telco@yahoo.com to communicate with CallPhonex .
Indian investigators say there was contact between this email address and Sadatullah 's official email , pmit@sco.gov.pk , which police say is the email service for all SCO officers .
Indian officials have charged a Pakistani national , Mohammed Ajmal Kasab , 21 , who was captured in the early hours of the attacks .
The sole surviving attacker faces 12 criminal charges , including murder and waging war against India .
He could face the death penalty if convicted .
The other nine attackers were killed .
India 's special public prosecutor , Ujjwal Nikam , said he expected the trial to begin in the coming weeks and conclude within six months , but the legal process could drag on for decades .
The trial for the country 's deadliest terror attack , the 1993 Mumbai bombings which killed 257 people , lasted 14 years .
The Kasab trial could further inflame tensions with Pakistan as it sets out the role of Pakistani groups in the assault .
India blames the attack on Lashkar - e - Taiba , an Islamist militant group widely believed to have been created by Pakistani intelligence agencies in the 1980s to fight Indian rule in Kashmir .
But the charges do not mention Pakistan 's powerful intelligence agency .
India says all 10 attackers were from Pakistan .
Pakistani officials have acknowledged that the attacks were partly plotted on Pakistani soil and announced criminal proceedings against eight suspects .
The case against Kasab includes his confession , accounts from more than 2,000 witnesses and closed circuit television footage that shows him and an accomplice walking into Mumbai 's crowded Chhatrapati Shivaji train station and opening fire .
“ When we think about diabetes , we think about heart disease and all the consequences for the rest of the body , but we usually do n’t think about the brain , ” he said .
“ This is something we ’ve got to be really worried about .
We need to think about their ultimate risks not only for cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders , but also about their cognitive skills , and whether they will be able to keep up with the demands of education and a fast - paced complex society .
That ’s the part that scares the heck out of me . ”
Previous observational studies have shown that physical activity reduces the risk of cognitive decline , and studies have also found that diabetes increases the risk of dementia .
Earlier studies had also found a link between Type 2 diabetes and dysfunction in the dentate gyrus .
Sheri Colberg - Ochs , an associate professor of exercise science at Old Dominion University in Norfolk , Va. , said her research has found that regular exercise , even light physical activity , can offset the potentially negative effects of Type 2 diabetes on cognitive function .
It is not clear what the mechanism is , she said , but may have something to do with the effect of insulin .
“ This new study is interesting in that it allows for a greater understanding of which region of the hippocampus is likely most affected by poorly controlled diabetes , ” she said .
But the elevations in blood glucose seen in the new study are more subtle and would not be considered a disease state , Dr. Small said .
“ It ’s part of the normal process of aging , much like wrinkling of skin , ” he said .
“ It happens to all of us inexorably , and it worsens progressively across the life span . ”

There are 52 giant jumping rats in captivity in Europe .
A giant jumping rat has been born at Bristol Zoo after a successful " love match " to boost the European captive population of the endangered species .
The zoo had not bred the rabbit - like species for more than four years until a female was brought from a zoo in Prague .
She was introduced to a mate in November and the baby , whose sex is still unknown , was born in mid-January .
Malagasy giant jumping rats are only found on the island of Madagascar .
' New parents '
Katie Cummins , of Bristol Zoo , said : " The birth of this baby is great news for Bristol Zoo as well as for the European captive breeding population .
" The baby is doing very well , gaining strength and becoming more adventurous , but it still stays close to mum and dad who are proving to be very attentive new parents . "
There are 52 Malagasy giant jumping rats in captivity in Europe , five of which are at Bristol Zoo .
The species is listed on the International Union for Conservation 's red list for endangered species , and has a decreasing population currently estimated at around 11,000 .
Based on current rates of habitat loss and predation , it is predicted that the species could be extinct in the wild within about 24 years .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner defended his financial stabilization plan Tuesday , telling senators it is " fundamentally different " than the one pursued by his predecessor , Henry Paulson .
Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee , Geithner conceded that the plan he outlined Tuesday morning lacked some details , including how much it might cost and how much additional funding might be necessary beyond what 's available under previous congressional authorizations .
But even without those sorts of details , Geithner said he felt it important to " lay out the broad architecture of what we need to do . "
The comments came after financial stocks plunged Tuesday .
The KBW Bank Index plummeted 14 % , wiping out the past week 's rally .
Big banks Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) each dropped at least 10 % .
Investors had hoped to see a plan that would address two of the biggest problems in the banking sector : the toxic assets keeping banks from lending , and the shortage of capital at major institutions at a time when losses are expected to rise sharply .
While Geithner pledged to raise as much as $ 500 billion from public and private sources to relieve banks of toxic assets , he did n't explain how the program would bring together buyers and sellers who have been locked in a stalemate for 18 months .
In response to a question from Sen. Mike Crapo , R - Idaho , Geithner said the administration intends to provide longer - term financing that has been absent during the credit crisis .
The presence of stable financing could allow investors to accept lower returns in exchange for greater leverage , which magnifies returns .
And while he pledged to provide " capital support " for banks that need more money , skeptics note that Treasury has just over $ 100 billion available for capital infusions -- which surely wo n't be enough to tide over an industry facing losses that could reach into the trillions of dollars .
Promise to spend money wisely
Asked about the size of the problem facing the financial sector , Geithner declined to project how much money he might need but said he wanted to be " candid " about the rising costs of the bailout .
Treasury has $ 320 billion available under the Paulson - era Troubled Asset Relief Program , though Tuesday 's plan earmarked more than half of that for lending and housing programs .
" I think this is going to be a substantial problem for the nation that will require substantial resources , " Geithner said Tuesday afternoon in response to a question from the committee 's ranking member , Sen. Richard Shelby , R - Ala .
" We will move to use existing resources as efficiently as possible . "
Asked by Sen. Jim Bunning , R - Ky. , to specify how much money the administration would need to solve the financial crisis , Geithner reiterated his promise to spend whatever resources Treasury has at its disposal wisely .
" At this point we do not have a judgment about whether and how much additional resources we will need to solve this , " Geithner said .
Though Geithner 's vagueness may not help him win over critics , he has stressed that his plan is n't in danger of turning into a rerun of the troubled Paulson plan .
" You need to change the basic public perception around how this is going to be managed by bringing a new set of values and sense of responsibility , " Geithner told Fortune in an interview Monday .
" These banks need to understand that access to government resources is a privilege , not a right .
It 's not for the banks .
It 's for the people , and companies depend on that . "
Nobody liked the old TARP
The original TARP has drawn scorching criticism from both sides of the aisle in Congress for its failure to lay out clear goals , account for how taxpayer funds were spent or demand adequate compensation for taxpayers .
The Congressional Oversight Panel appointed by the Senate reported last week that the Paulson Treasury paid $ 254 billion in 2008 capital purchases for stock and warrants that were worth just $ 176 billion .
What 's more , Paulson sold Congress last fall on a plan to solve the toxic asset problem -- and then changed his mind without telling anyone until weeks later .
That is one reason why lawmakers were so insistent on hearing more details from Geithner before committing to support his approach .
" I 've been down that road before , " said Sen. Robert Menendez , D - N.J .
" We 're not going there again . "
Geithner said that while there are " common elements " to his and Paulson 's approaches , he promised to impose more transparency and tougher conditions on recipients of federal funds .
" The path we have taken to date was too limited , " he told the Senate Tuesday ..
Though observers agree with Geithner 's assessment of the Paulson regime , some wonder whether he 's falling into a similar trap - promising clarity and then not delivering .
" Geithner was right that they screwed up before , " said Simon Johnson , a finance professor at MIT who writes the Baseline Scenario blog covering the financial crisis .
" But why should we trust him now ? "

Verizon , one of the biggest telephone companies in the US , today apologised to the president - elect , Barack Obama , over a security breach involving his phone bill records .
Lowell McAdam , the president of Verizon , issued a statement saying : " This week we learned that a number of Verizon Wireless employees have , without authorisation , accessed and viewed President - elect Barack Obama 's personal cell phone account . "
All staff who accessed the account , whether authorised or not , have been put on immediate paid leave pending an inquiry .
Verizon and Obama 's team said that the cell phone had not been active for months .
Obama 's spokesman , Robert Gibbs , said Verizon had informed the Obama team that his phone records had been improperly accessed .
Gibbs said the records could have shown numbers and the frequency of calls but little else .
Verizon has yet to establish why some of their employees allegedly sought access .
McAdam said : " Employees with legitimate business needs for access will be returned to their positions , while employees who have accessed the account improperly and without legitimate business justification will face appropriate disciplinary action .
" We apologise to President - elect Obama and will work to keep the trust our customers place in us every day . "
Pragmatism , purity and JSON content types
I started a conversation about this on Twitter the other day , but Twitter is a horrible place to have an archived discussion so I ’m going to try again here .
If you ’re producing a JSON API for other people to use ( as opposed to an API that ’s only really meant for your own local Ajax responses ) , you need to decide which Content - Type to use .
The best option is not entirely obvious .
RFC 4672 defines JSON and reserves application / json as the preferred media type .
The problem is that most browsers will prompt you to download the file rather than displaying it inline ( as they would for text / plain or application / javascript ) .
One of my favourite qualities of REST - style APIs is that they enable exploration and debugging using just a browser — using application / json throws a big , frustrating road block in the way .
There are ways of telling your browser to treat application / json in the same way as text / plain but that does n’t really help you if your aim is to create an API that ’s easy for other developers to use .
It ’s also worth mentioning that if you are returning JSONP ( with an extra callback function wrapped around the JSON response to enable the dynamic script tag hack ) you HAVE to serve as application / javascript — otherwise the script you are providing wo n’t be executed by the browser .
Do n’t forget to include charset=UTF8 as well ( for both types of response ) .
So , it ’s pragmatism v.s. purity .
The correct thing to do is to return application / json , but doing so makes your API harder for developers to use .
In a brief , non-comprehensive review of some existing JSON APIs ( FriendFeed , Flickr , Google Social Graph etc ) I could n’t find any that were using application / json , presumably for this exact reason .
Using the Accept : header
The Accept : header is one of my least favourite parts of HTTP .
I like to be confident that if I send a URL to someone , they ’ll get back exactly the same bytes as I did when I retrieved it myself ( I distrust language negotiation for the same reason ) .
However , a number of people suggested it on Twitter and it looks like it could be a useful solution to this problem .
I ’m currently considering the following : ONLY use the application / json Content - Type in reply to requests that include application / json in their Accept header — essentially allowing clients that care about the correct content type to opt - in to receiving it .
Everyone else ( browsers included ) gets application / javascript , which is less correct ( though not an all - out lie , since JSON is a subset of JavaScript ) but solves the usability problem .
A couple of things worry me about this .
Firstly , is this a reasonable thing to use Accept for ?
Secondly , is there a chance that browsers might add application / json to their Accept header at some point in the future ?
Safari currently sends text / xml , application / xml , application / xhtml+xml , text/html ; q=0.9 , text / plain ; q=0.8 , image / png,*/* ; q=0.5 while Firefox sends text / html , application/xhtml+xml ,application/xml ; q=0.9,*/* ; q=0.8 .
Would it be smarter to look for */* and serve the incorrect Content - Type to those requests and the correct one to everything else ?
A new neuroimaging study on stressed - out students suggests that male humans , like male rats , do n't do their most agile thinking under stress .
The findings , published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , show that 20 male M.D. candidates in the middle of preparing for their board exams had a harder time shifting their attention from one task to another than other healthy young men who were not under the gun .
Previous experiments had found that stressed rats foraging for food had similar impairments and that those problems resulted from stress - induced changes in their brain anatomy .
The new study , using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to scan the stressed students ' brains , is a robust example of how basic research in an animal model can lead to high - tech investigations of the human brain .
" It 's a great translational story , " says Bruce S. McEwen , head of the Harold and Margaret Milliken Hatch Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology at The Rockefeller University , who worked on the project with colleagues at Weill Cornell Medical College .
" The research in the rats led to the imaging work on people , and the results matched up remarkably well . "
The work holds good news too , for both rats and humans :
Their brains recuperate quickly .
Less than a month after the stress goes away , they are back to normal .
" The message is that healthy brains are remarkably resilient and plastic , " McEwen says .
To probe the effects of stress , the researchers scanned the brains of volunteers , some stressed and others relatively relaxed , performing two subtly different kinds of mental tasks , either an attention - shift or a response - reversal .
Lying inside the scanner , the subjects looked at two discs : one red and one green , with one moving up and the other down .
In a series of trials , they were prompted to choose a disc according to motion or color .
By ordering when the subjects did which tasks , they challenged their volunteers ' brains to either switch focus from color to motion , or to suddenly reverse their choice of a disc in the same category .
" It 's like the old story about the American crossing the road in England , " says Conor Liston , an M.D. - Ph.D. student at Rockefeller and Cornell , who led the research .
A response - reversal requires the brain to override the habitual impulse to first look left instead of right for oncoming cars .
An American in Venice might require an attention - shift , by contrast , to seek out boats instead of evading cars .
In earlier research on rats , neuroscientists found that these two tasks place demands on different circuits in the brain , and the circuits are affected in different ways by stress .
In particular , collaborative work by McEwen and John Morrison at Mount Sinai Medical Center have shown that repeated stress on rats shriveled nerve cells of the medial prefrontal cortex , and that a shrunken prefrontal cortex is linked to slower performance on attention - shifting tasks .
In those experiments , rats learned to dig through a certain texture , like sawdust , in the presence of an irrelevant odor to find food ; then the researchers made odor , rather than texture , the clue for finding the food and measured how long it took the rats to switch their foraging strategies .
But while the restricted prefrontal cortex — a larger version of which is thought to play a role in the " executive function " in humans — slowed the rats ' performance on attention - shifts , it did not change their performance on response - reversal tasks .
In fact , neurons in a different part of the brain thought to be involved in response - reversals , the orbital frontal cortex , actually grew larger from the stress .
The new research suggests that something very similar may happen to distressed humans .
Liston , working with B.J. Casey at the Sackler Institute at Weill Cornell , used fMRI to explore his hunch that the brains of rats and men have some basic processes in common — that stress would also impair performance on attention - shifting tasks and diminish activity in the medial prefrontal cortex .
He found that male med students who said they were stressed out one month before they were to take their boards fared much worse on attention - shifting tasks than similar healthy adults who claimed to be taking it easy .
The high stress levels , gauged by an established measure called the perceived stress scale , were also tightly associated with diminished activity in the prefrontal cortex .
But their performance on response - reversals was unimpaired .
Finally , as was found in the rats , when Liston scanned the students again one month after the test , he discovered that their attention - shifting performance had returned to normal along with their brains .
The uncanny similarities surprised even the researchers .
" I certainly do n't want to say that rat brains are just like human brains , " Liston says .
" But it does show that you can use research in animal models to help interpret human neuroimaging results . "
Liston plans to next explore how stress impacts the rest of the brain .
He also wants to investigate whether or not there are differences in how the brains of men and women respond to stress .
" Stress is doing a whole lot of things in your brain that we do n't understand yet , but we know that it is intimately involved in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders , " Liston says .
A mechanistic understanding of stress could lead to insights into associated psychiatric problems , he says .

There is no getting around the fact that living with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) can be rife with difficulties .
Most people often think of the physical ones , like pain , fatigue , and mobility issues .
But you may also confront emotional challenges like anger , changes in your social interactions , and practical issues that may make simply getting through the day hard .
You can learn to weather all of these to the best of your ability .
The key is not tackling everything all at once .
Focus on one issue or related set of issues at a time , and you can see your life improve , bit by bit .
Verywell / Brooke Pelczynski
Emotional
If you have MS , there may be times when you feel pretty terrible and have a hard time finding anything to be happy about .
That 's natural .
You are allowed to have these feelings .
The key is to not get stuck in them .
Acknowledge When Things Are Tough
Sometimes the best thing to do is to allow yourself to feel sad or angry .
Trying to force yourself to be happy can lead to frustration or even despair .
Rather than giving into negative thoughts , overcome them by reminding yourself that these bad feelings are temporary .
You may not believe it at first , but keep saying it to yourself .
Recognize When You Are Happy
Constantly battling MS symptoms can eat up so much time that when you do get a break , you may forget about the positive things in your life .
Even worse , when your symptoms are less severe , you might spend much of the time worrying about when they 'll return .
Check in with yourself a couple of times a day and see if you can find times when you are happy .
Spend some time thinking about the best parts of your life .﻿﻿
You may also find it helpful to start a gratitude journal .
3:38 3 MS Patients Share Their Tips for Managing Stress
Do n’t Compare Yourself to Others
People may think they are being helpful when they say things like , " Other people have it so much worse than you .
Think about them and you 'll realize your life is n't so bad . "
Of course , that 's often not helpful at all .
It also might make you feel worse to think about how hard others ' lives must be — or make you feel guilty for complaining . ​
Do your best to avoid going down the comparison path .
Remember that someone else 's pain does n't invalidate your own .
Build Your Resiliency
An ability to cope with and adapt to problems in a healthy way is called resiliency , and it's an important thing to have when you 're living with a chronic condition .
You likely face barriers to resiliency due to your MS .
Several of these were identified by a study published in Disability and Rehabilitation .﻿﻿
They include :
Social isolation and loneliness
Stigma
Negative thoughts and feelings
Fatigue
The good news is that you can learn or improve this ability to " bounce back " from adversity .
Some methods for this involve specific types of treatment and therapy , such as getting treatment for depression and anxiety , if they 're problems for you .
If you believe you need help improving your resiliency , consider seeking the assistance of a psychologist .
Cope in a Healthy Way
Anger is a common issue in MS .
Not only is it a natural consequence of having a chronic condition , the brain lesions MS causes may trigger anger just as they can blur your vision or make you clumsy .
A study published in the journal Multiple Sclerosis suggests that keeping anger bottled up can worsen the quality of life for people with this disease .﻿﻿
Whether you 're struggling with anger or other emotions , it 's imperative that you find healthy ways to cope .
What will be most helpful for you will be very personal , but it 's a good idea to speak with a therapist who can help put a name to what you 're feeling and provide you with strategies that work best for you .
You may also find it helpful to speak with and hear from others with MS who very intimately understand the experience of this disease .
You can search for a support group in your area by visiting the National Multiple Sclerosis Society 's website .﻿﻿
A Special Note About Alcohol Using alcohol to " numb " feelings is never a good solution for anyone .
And while alcohol dependency can be damaging enough on its own , drinking can also make MS symptoms temporarily worse .
Some MS medications can have dangerous interactions with alcohol as well .
Furthermore , people with MS because are more prone to abusing alcohol due to depression that can result living with a chronic , often limiting health issue .
Pay careful attention to how much alcohol you consume , how often , and how it affects you .
And if you find that it 's your feelings that have you reaching for a drink , speak with a therapist about ways you can cope without alcohol .
Physical
MS causes a lot of physical symptoms that can get in the way of your functionality and quality of life .
It is important that you keep working with your doctor to find treatments that effectively manage your physical symptoms .
The invisible symptoms of MS are often the hardest to deal with .
For many people , the major ones are pain , fatigue , and cognitive dysfunction .
Pain
Pain is a reality for about 50 percent of people with MS .﻿﻿
It happens because demyelination causes nerve signals to get misdirected to pain receptors , which in turn send pain signals to your brain .
When your brain receives a pain signal , you feel pain , even if it seems there 's no reason for you to hurt .
Pain that 's related to nerve damage is called neuropathy or neuropathic pain .
In MS , types of neuropathic pain can include burning , tingling , or numbness ; trigeminal neuralgia , MS hug , and optic neuritis .
MS also involves something called paroxysmal pain — often intensely painful sensations that come on suddenly and go away quickly .
The spasticity and gait problems of MS can lead to joint and muscle pain .
A complex set of pain symptoms requires a complex approach .
Your doctor can help you find medications that lessen your pain .
You may also benefit from massage , physical therapy , or home treatments like heat or topical pain relievers .
MS : Painless ?
Doctors used to be so certain that MS was a " painless disease " that complaints of pain caused them to move it down the list of possible diagnoses .
Fortunately , that 's no longer the case .
Fatigue
Fatigue is among the most debilitating symptoms of MS .﻿﻿
It can result from the disease itself , as well as MS medications , related depression , stress , and overlapping sleep disorders .
It 's important to work with your doctor to uncover the cause (s ) in your case and find treatments that work .
This might involve changing medications , changing the time of day you take certain drugs , treating sleep disorders , and improving your sleep hygiene .
Cognitive - behavioral therapy may help you manage stress , as well .
Additionally , you can try daily naps , meditation , yoga , or other gentle exercise .
Cognitive Dysfunction
Cognitive problems impact at least 50 percent of people with MS .﻿﻿
Commonly , this involves issues like not remembering names , difficulty processing new information or solving problems , and inability to concentrate , among other things .
Depression , poor sleep , and some medications may only make these issues worse .
These symptoms can be frustrating and even embarrassing .
When they 're severe , they may become a major reason for leaving a job or opting for isolation over social events .
You may have success with finding ways to compensate , such as keeping a highly organized calendar or setting up alerts on your phone to remind you of appointments .
But if cognitive issues are significantly impacting your life , talk to your doctor about cognitive rehabilitation , which can help you improve your memory and ability to cope with these problems .
You may also want to consider medications such as Ritalin ( methylphenidate ) , which can improve concentration and attention .
Social
This aspect of dealing with MS is one that takes many people by surprise .
Relationships can be affected in a host of ways that are important to be aware of .
Here 's a look at some of the common social challenges of MS .
Telling People
What to tell people about your health , and when , is unique for just about every situation .
The conversations you have with your family and close friends , for example , will likely be very different from those you have with , say , your boss or someone you 're newly dating .
In some cases , it can be a real benefit to have a conversation early .
For example , if your manager does n't know you have a chronic illness , she may not be understanding about problems like missing work or making a mistake .
Disclosing your health status at work entitles you to reasonable accommodation as well , which may make it easier to keep working .﻿﻿
On the flip side , just because it 's illegal to discriminate against an employee because of their disability does n't mean it never happens .
Some people are justifiably afraid that they 'll be passed over for promotions or otherwise penalized at work because of their MS .
In the end , you 're the only one who can decide when to tell people about your condition and how much to share .
Talking With Others About MS
When deciding to disclose the fact that you have MS , consider things such as : Your comfort level with the person
The level of emotional closeness in the relationship
How comfortable you are talking about your condition altogether
How much they need to know in order to understand things that may happen , such as canceling plans , calling in sick to work , or your reaction to sudden , intense pain
Potential negative consequences of telling them now versus later
Parenting
MS can be a challenge for everyone in the family , and it can make you worried about the kind of parent you can be .
A key thing to remember is that a lot of people with MS and other debilitating diseases have raised healthy , happy , well - balanced children .
Love and support can go a long way .
Experts believe it 's best to be open with your child from the start .
Kids often know something is wrong even when they 're not told , and that can cause them a lot of worry and stress .
Research suggests that children who have an age - appropriate understanding of MS can deal with it better .﻿﻿
Children can have different reactions to your illness , both at first and even years after your diagnosis .
If they react with anger or frustration , remember that they 're young and grappling with something difficult .
Try not to take it personally , even if the way they express it feels personal .
If your child is having a lot of trouble , you may want to look into counseling or family therapy .
Talk to your pediatrician as well as your own healthcare team for guidance .
Having a parent with a chronic illness can even have an upside .
Many children of parents with MS say they have more empathy and a better perspective on what 's important in life .
It may also help strengthen their ability to cope .
Intimate Relationships
While sex is a physical act , it 's one that plays an important role in a marriage or other intimate relationship .
It 's important that you and your partner talk openly about how MS may be impacting this part of your life .﻿﻿
Couples ' counseling can help you both articulate your feelings and find ways to restore intimacy .
These can be difficult conversations to have .
When you do :
Be honest with your partner about what you are and are n't feeling .
Help them understand what you ’re experiencing so they can help find solutions .
Reassure your partner that you still desire them .
Do n't assume they " already know " or think you 're showing them enough .
Say it .
Do n’t create false expectations .
Focus on small changes and see what happens .
Understand that your partner may be hesitant about or avoiding sex because they 're afraid they could hurt you .
Teach them what does and does n't cause you pain so they can be more confident and comfortable .
You Might Also Consider ...
Experimenting with new sex positions , if some are painful .
Using a water - based vaginal lubricant to ease discomfort during intercourse .
Exploring the use of vibrators , especially if you are experiencing numbness or impaired sensation .
It can also be very helpful to expand your idea of what sex is .
Just because you do n’t have the energy for intercourse does n’t mean you can't have a satisfying intimate experience .
Hugging , kissing , touching , mutual masturbation , and even talking can help you connect and be every bit as arousing .
It 's worth talking to your doctor about how your MS may be impacting your sex life , too .
Physical factors , such as sexual dysfunction , loss of libido , and reduced genital sensitivity , can certainly compound psychological factors that interfere with sex , and there may be simple solutions that can help .
Medications prescribed for MS may cause sexual dysfunction as well .
In most cases , this can be improved by adjusting the timing of the dose .
In other cases , a similar drug may have a lower risk of this side effect .
Here are some examples of how meds can be managed :
If you have been prescribed an anticholinergic to treat a bladder control problem , take it 30 minutes before sex to minimize bladder contractions and prevent urinary leakage during intercourse .
If you are taking injectable disease - modifying medications , coordinate the timing of the shots so that the side effects are less likely to interfere with sex .
If you are taking an antidepressant and experiencing low libido , speak with your doctor .
Antidepressants are commonly associated with sexual impairment .
It is possible that a simple change of drugs is all that is needed to improve your state .
If you are on medications to combat fatigue , take them an hour before sex so that your energy levels peak at just the right moment .
If you take a drug that makes you tired , do n't take it until after you 've had sex .
Practical
A key to living well with your illness is to acknowledge and accept your limitations .
Fighting them takes too much of your limited energy , and , as you 've likely already discovered , it does n't help your situation .
2:16 3 Women Share Their Experiences Managing MS in the Cold
Taking Care of Yourself
A crucial step to practical management of your symptoms is learning to listen to your body .
Pay attention to the signals that you 're overtaxing yourself .
Learn what can trigger relapses and what helps you achieve and sustain being in remission .
Something that 's especially important is learning to say " no . "
While you technically could attend a dinner you committed to , for example , you 'll be better able to manage your illness if you back out and get the rest you need on a day you feel particularly exhausted .
This can be difficult and might take some time on your part .
And as you adjust , those around you must too .
While you may not be living up to their expectations with the decisions that you make , you will be doing what 's best for you — and that is something that most people who care about you will come to value , even if they might not seem to at first .
Prioritize your needs .
Say " no " and be firm about it , with yourself and others .
And put your energy into commitments when you have it to give .
Travel
Travel can be stressful and physically challenging when you have MS .
If you prepare well for your trip , though , you can avoid some common pitfalls :
Transporting medication : Especially if you 're traveling overseas , it ’s smart to carry the original prescription and letter from your doctor indicating that the drugs are " chronic - illness medications delivered by injection for personal use . "
This will help in the event you are questioned by security .

This will help in the event you are questioned by security .
Keeping medication cold :
If you have to keep drugs cold , a small cooler is a good option .
If you 're flying , make sure it 's approved as a carry - on so you do n't have to check it and risk it being lost .
Also call ahead to your hotel and ask if a mini-refrigerator can be placed in your room .
( Note : Some keep - cold medications may be able to be kept at room temperature for a short period of time .
Ask your pharmacist if this applies to those you take . )

Seeking help when flying : ﻿ ﻿ Check ahead to see how far apart your gates are for connecting flights .
If it 's very far , call in advance to organize wheelchair assistance or a ride on an electric cart .
Ask about any other accessibility services the airport offers to make pre-flight security and check - in easier .

Stay hydrated : Doing so can help prevent constipation , mitigate some of the negative effects of jet lag ( including fatigue , irritability , and lack of concentration ) , and reduce the risk of an airborne infection .
Special Occasions
Special events can really de-rail your efforts at managing your symptoms .
Remember that you do n't need to keep up with everyone and that you can ( and should ) pick and choose what you will do , contribute , and participate in .
Attending and staying for just a short time is a good strategy if you feel that 's all you can handle .
To navigate some of the challenges that can come with MS and socializing , consider :
Avoiding parties where you do n’t know many people so you 're not stressed about learning names ( helpful if you have cognitive dysfunction )
Finding quiet corners where you can have more intimate conversations
Getting vaccinated against both seasonal flu and H1N1 , and avoiding visiting with people who are sick ﻿ ﻿
﻿ Eating before you go to a gathering so you can socialize without triggering swallowing problems
Dressing in layers so you can remove or add clothing to compensate for temperature sensitivity
Being as strict as possible with your bedtime and scheduled naps
The holidays can be particularly stressful and difficult on your symptom management .
It can help to :
Shop before the seasonal rush or , even better , shop online
Plan all menus far in advance and get groceries delivered
Limit the number of holiday invitations you will accept
Use disabled parking spaces if you have a permit
Delegate whenever possible
A Word From Verywell
Learning to manage all of this can be overwhelming .
Educate yourself and the people close to you , and take it one thing at a time .
Eventually , it will all become second nature and you wo n't have to put so much thought into it .
An internet chat room was shut down earlier today after a number of users started what the organizers are calling a ‘ reasonable and intelligent debate ’ in one of the forums .
Although details are sketchy , the outbreak of the sensible discussion was apparently characterized by polite disagreement , constructive criticism , and mild language .
The discussion thread on ukfilmforum .
co.uk was started by a user who wished to discuss the new Batman film .
Several other users joined , at which point the discussion seems to have taken off .
As one shocked - looking moderator stated , ‘ Generally someone will disagree with something said by another forum user , at which point they write ‘ batman is gay lol ’ .
The first person usually responds with something along the lines of ‘ your mom sucks goat rofl ’ , then the first person calls the second a bint or a tart , and from then on the messages become increasingly obscene , vitriolic and nonsensical .
It ’s standard forum etiquette . ’
But it appears that the visitors discussing Batman ignored all the well - established conventions , causing offence and some distress to more experienced forum users .
One maverick forum visitor commented that he found ‘ the directing to be of the highest quality , and Heath Ledger ’s final performance worthy of the utmost praise ’ , while another ‘ had certain reservations about the underlying thematic content , but described it as a haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy ’ .
When the writers began to use both upper and lower case on their keyboards , alarm bells rang that the discussion was breaking all the rules of internet chat rooms and moderators quickly moved in to close the whole thing down .
Although some have suggested that this censorship was slightly heavy - handed , the website owner defended his staff , saying “ What is the world coming to if four or five angst - ridden teens ca n’t gain a tiny bit of satisfaction from starting a puerile and meaningless argument with people they ’ve never met ?
It ’s what the internet is all about ’ .
One disgruntled user disagreed , saying ‘ this kind of gratuitous dumbing - down is exactly what ’s wrong with today ’s society , and I must protest with the utmost vigour ’ , before concluding ‘ ps – your mom is totally gay lmao !!!!!!’
Team Biscuit
It was raining this weekend so I was unable to show houses and had no open houses scheduled .
Therefore my options were to read or study the MLS .
Reading makes me sleepy so the MLS won out .
Each day I hear a great deal from the real estate pundits trying to predict the housing market .
Have we seen the worst of it ?
Are some neighborhoods at bottom ?
Where are the best deals for first time home buyers ?
Where are the best deals for investors ?
All , very important questions .
Many say the next “ wave ” for the distressed property market is in adjusting mortgages .
I have been unable to find a source that tells me how many home loans are adjusting in San Jose .
The challenge with that idea is that many loans are actually adjusting down not up .
In general the logic is missing on why that would be the next wave except how it might apply to negative amortization loans .
To me the next wave of housing challenges are completely related to job loss .
More specifically blue collar , manufacturing job loss .
Why ?
The largest group to purchase homes using exotic loan products were the very people looking for a way to afford a house in the Bay Area on an average blue collar income .
This very group were more likely to pool incomes from different family members and when one of those sources loses their job , the house payment is in jeopardy .
Loan modifications are not offered to the unemployed , recently disabled , or recently divorced .
The home becomes under water quickly .
Which leads us to the short sale process .
Oh my , do n’t get me started .
Bottom line , short sales are not being approved as quickly or as often as they should be to stem the tide of foreclosures .
More and more short sales will move toward foreclosure .
Another guaranteed , downward pull on the market .
The potential areas for deals are where the distressed property inventory is the largest proportion of the total active listings .
This first graphs shows the number of short sale and REO listings as a percentage of the total active listings .
There is no “ bottom of the market ” per se when short sales are a large majority of the active listings as those are the very listings that will move toward foreclosure and become bank owned .
Next the condominium and town home ( attached ) market .
The Gilroy market has really taken a beating with the REOs .
One of the listings , a 2 - bedroom , 2 bath condo is for sale for $ 98,900 .
If that does not scream “ investor ” , I am not sure what will .
Yet , there are more deals to be had closer to Silicon Valley and this may be the reason why the condominium market has not moved faster in Gilroy .
But obviously the majority of the inventory for Santa Clara County resides in the city limits of San Jose .
Therefore , I wanted to break down by neighborhood the distressed market , to see what patterns might present .
I am going to go out on a limb and say that Blossom Valley , Santa Teresa , and Down Town San Jose are going to become the next hot bed for REOs .
All three neighborhoods are seeing 2 - 5 % per month drops already .
The short sale process does not work well in dynamic markets .
Whereas a REO agent sends an updated market analysis each month .
The short sale agent only sends in a market analysis when an offer is received .
By the time the loss mitagator gets to the file ( If you are lucky , within 30 days . ) , the market can drop another 2 % and not surprising , the buyer has found a better deal somewhere else .
Is the condominium and town home market any different for San Jose neighborhoods ?
I believe we can say that the investors and first time buyers will be scooping up the Alum Rock condominium and town home market .
Close to down town .
Great student rentals .
Again , pulling out my crystal ball , I would say Berryessa is prime territory for the next wave of good deals on REOs .
So what to make of all these pretty graphs ?
First , a large portion of the distressed homes are still being kept up in the air by short sales .
The process is not working to reduce these homes quickly .
Second , we all know that the sooner we reduce the inventory of over priced or slow moving homes ( because of repairs , location , etc. ) we will have a better chance of stabilizing the market .
If you are a seller , you should be tidying your house and adjusting your price down at least every month .
Third , the key to a market turn around is showing buyers how they can be pre-approved in this new loan market and how to find the great deal in the neighborhood they want .
Finally , we must do this all quickly before the next wave of job losses place more homes in jeopardy .
If you are an agent reading this , I encourage you to throw your opinion into the hat so readers can hear professionals discuss the market in Santa Clara County .
If you are a buyer or seller , you need to be working with an agent who is as determined as a bull dog to work this market .
Agents who are shy about short sales , hesitant to recommend FHA loans , or ca n’t manage an REO will not be the professional that gets you through this current market .
One last point .
Many of the neighborhoods have less than 20 % of their inventory in distressed listings .
It may be raining but much like our beautiful hills , sometimes it takes a good rain to make everything all green again .
As the economy continues to sour , the trend toward bitch - slap advertising intensifies .
Best Buy kicked around Circuit City , but that was n't much of a challenge , as the latter had already gone belly up .
Now , perhaps revved up on its own java and triple - glazed treats , Dunkin ' Donuts gets all up in Starbucks ' grill in a newspaper ad from Hill , Holliday .
The copy takes Seattle 's finest to task for brewing decaf in the afternoon only by special request .
Brags Dunkin ' : " We do n't work around our schedule , we work around yours .
Get what you want , when you want it .
Because at Dunkin ' Donuts , you kin ' do it . "
My advice :
They kin ' grab a decaf and chill .
The recession 's ad wars have just started .
And if that Jack in the Box freak recovers from getting hit by that bus , I shudder to think of the paid - media carnage to come !

The sanctity of marrying gay rights with Osama Bin Laden
by Jeremy Hooper
Earlier today , we pointed you to yet another instance of onetime singer Pat Boone crooning his favorite tune of recent :
The one in which he compares gays to " jihadists " and " terrorists . "
And while that mention was kooky yet mostly silly - seeming , the folks at GLAAD have just sent us another blip from this rapidly growing " gay marriage = radical suicide bomber " meme that should raise a few more alarm bells in this collective experiment that we call humanity .
Why ?
Well , because this time the person who 's making the frighteningly off - base link is not a former entertainer who has eschewed the Branson circuit for the Dobson one .
No , no -- this time it 's the founder and chairman of one of this nation 's largest religious non-profits !
Yes , that 's right --
On this morning 's edition of KPFA 's " Morning Show , " Seamus Hasson , founder and chairman of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty , quite literally compared Prop 8 protestors to Al Qaeda .
No , we 're not joking :
" SH : Well , whether it ’s an organized movement like Al Qaeda or whether it ’s the Al Qaeda - like , um , inspired acts of terrorism elsewhere , people are right to be concerned about , um , radical Islamist violence - "
Pretty extreme , yes ?
And remember :
This is the same Becket Fund that is taking out full page NY Times ads with the sole purpose of protecting majority tyranny from coming under reasoned scrutiny .
The same Becket Fund that is accusing the anti-Prop 8 community of engaging in nastiness has a founder and chairman who thinks it 's perfectly appropriate to go on radio shows and link a group 's choice to stand up for minority rights with another group 's choice to bring down the World Trade Center !
Go check out the GLAAD Blog for more details / context .
That is , of course , if you can make yourself to the link without having to stop to first plot a jihad :
Founder of Becket Fund Compares Prop. 8 Outcry to Al - Qaeda [ GLAAD Blog ]
Your thoughts
Nothing that those people do shocks me any more !
Their compulsion is to hate , and they have zero qualms with using any tactic to ensure that they get as many people as they can to hate us .
And , obviously , at the same time , they attempt to paint themselves as the humble , hapless , maligned victims .
Hasson should be ashamed of himself , but I seriously doubt that shame is weakness that he suffers from .

These guys must be called out on the carpet on this .
It is absolutely unacceptable .
It 's time that the media was contacted and that these kinds of remarks be exposed for what they are , outrageous anti-gay Evangelical propaganda created to terrify and create more division and hate for God 's GLBT children .
Posted by : Benjamin Clark | Dec 9 , 2008 11:03:56 PM
It must be easy for them to do as they are just dragging out the good old interracial marriage boogy men Communists ... ... and changing the wording to the current topic and villain .
That could be a fun game to play ... lets see for Anti-sufferage it would be the Spanish Empire . for the Anti-Slavery movement , the Confederates ... and for the Western Pioneer , the Indians ... for the Revolutionsist the Tories ...
As I recall it goes back and back and back ... to Adam and Eve right ?
Aha .. I knew it had something to do with religion .

The alleged defacement of 10 churches is nothing compared to turning millions of people into second - class citizens .
Posted by : Johnny M | Dec 10 , 2008 5:55:17 AM
I have to say I find all these wild accusations rather comforting .
It 's the most obvious sign so far that they 're losing , they know it and they 're desperate .
The most delicious irony of the entire situation ( fortunately lost on them ) is that the bigger the lies they tell the less likely the undecideds are to take them seriously .
They 're doing half our job for us !

This look at Wells Fargo ( WFC ) strangely begins with an investigation into 3.875 % mortgage loans - fixed for 30 years - offered by Arbor Custom Homes near Portland Oregon .
3.875 % is rather interesting given that current mortgage rates are much higher as the following Table of Mortgage Rates from Bloomberg shows .
The Lending Partner for Arbor Homes is Wells Fargo .
How can Wells offer a fixed rate of 3.875 % for 30 years given the current rate term structure and conditions in the MBS / CDO markets ?
The only answer I can come up with is Wells Fargo is going to promptly bundle and dump those securities straight into the insolvent arms of Freddie Mae ( FNM ) and Fannie Mac ( FRE ) .
Who else would take them ?
Furthermore , the Portland area is saturated with homes already ( see the section Happy Valley Foreclosed in Housing gridlock : Trapped in Suburbia for more details ) .
Leading the Way Home
Wells Fargo claims to be Leading the Way Home to Stabilize Hard - Hit Communities .
Wells Fargo Merger Gives 478,000 Wachovia Customers Access to New Wells Fargo Solutions if Their Mortgage Payments Become At - Risk .
Through active calling and letter - writing campaigns , workshops , regional outreach events and door - to - door contact , Wells Fargo Home Mortgage has reached 94 percent of its customers who are two or more payments past due .
For every 10 of these customers , it has worked with seven on a solution , two declined the help , and the remainder cannot be reached or a solution simply cannot be found .
Of the customers who received a loan modification , one year after the loan was modified approximately seven of every 10 of these customers were either current on their loans or less than 90 - days past due .
30 % of Wells Fargo 's reworked mortgage loans are 90 days past due or longer , one year after loan modification .
Wells Fargo 4th Quarter Earnings
“ Despite the unprecedented contraction in the credit markets , we remained ‘ open for business ’ and continued to lend to credit - worthy customers .
We made $ 106 billion in new loan commitments during 2008 to consumer , small business and commercial customers and originated $ 230 billion of residential mortgages .
The allowance for credit losses , including unfunded commitments , totaled $ 21.7 billion ( Wells Fargo and Wachovia combined ) at December 31 , 2008 , compared with $ 8.0 billion ( Wells Fargo only ) at September 30 , 2008 .
The Wachovia acquisition was completed on December 31 , 2008 , and therefore Wachovia ’s results are not consolidated in Wells Fargo ’s income statement .
Wells Fargo ’s balance sheet includes Wachovia ’s period - end balance sheet data net of closing purchase accounting adjustments .
Wells Fargo's Balance Sheet
Off - Balance Sheet Exposure
OFF -BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
AND AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
Almost all of our off - balance sheet arrangements result from securitizations .
Based on market conditions , from time to time we may securitize home mortgage loans and other financial assets , including commercial mortgages .
We normally structure loan securitizations as sales , in accordance with FAS 140 , Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities – a replacement of FASB Statement No. 125 .
This involves the transfer of financial assets to certain qualifying special - purpose entities ( QSPEs ) that we are not required to consolidate .
What Exactly Are QSPEs ?
Basically , an off–balance - sheet entity is created by a party ( the transferor or the sponsor ) by transferring assets to another party ( the SPE ) to carry out a specific purpose , activity , or series of transactions .
Regardless of their legal form , off–balance - sheet entities share the following characteristics :
They are often thinly capitalized .
They typically have no independent management or employees .
Their administrative functions are often performed by a trustee who receives and distributes cash in accordance with the terms of contracts and who serves as an intermediary between the SPE and the parties that created it .
If the SPE holds assets , one of these parties usually services them under a servicing agreement .
The challenge for investors is the difficulty in spotting these transactions .
Unfortunately , the magnitude of the dollar amounts involved in these transactions notwithstanding , any available disclosures about them are buried in footnotes .
There is no easy way of estimating the amount of assets or liabilities that are subject to these arrangements .
As the Enron crisis brought attention to the use of SPEs , FASB responded by issuing a proposed interpretation of existing accounting principles aimed at putting many off–balance - sheet entities back onto the balance sheet of the companies that created them .
The current accounting standards require an enterprise to include in its consolidated financial statements subsidiaries in which it has a controlling financial interest .
The existing common definition of “ control ” is met when a parent company has more than 50 % of the voting stock in a subsidiary .
Over the years , however , companies have found ways to obtain economic control of other entities without owning 50 % of the voting stock , thereby avoiding consolidation of these entities .
Not Practical To Tell The Truth
FASB Postpones Off - Balance - Sheet Rule for a Year
On July 30th , FASB Postpones Off - Balance - Sheet Rule for a Year .
The Financial Accounting Standards Board postponed a measure , opposed by Citigroup Inc. and the securities industry , forcing banks to bring off - balance - sheet assets such as mortgages and credit - card receivables back onto their books .
FASB , the Norwalk , Connecticut - based panel that sets U.S. accounting standards , voted 5 - 0 today to delay the rule change until fiscal years starting after Nov. 15 , 2009 .
The board needs to give financial institutions more time to prepare for the switch , FASB member Thomas Linsmeier said at a board meeting .
" We need to get a new standard into effect , " Linsmeier said , though " it 's not practical " to begin requiring companies to put assets underlying securitizations onto their books this year .
Citigroup 's Mysterious Shadow Assets
Of that $ 11 trillion in total bank off balance sheet entities , Citigroup has $ 1.1 trillion of it .
Enquiring minds may wish to consider Citigroup 's $ 1.1 Trillion in Mysterious Shadow Assets .
If Citigroup is looking for an award , it can take the blue ribbon for greed , arrogance , and stupidity in the off balance sheet category .
There are plenty of other categories and more blue ribbons will be awarded .
Nominations are being taken now .
Balance Sheet Is The Future
The income statement is the past .
The balance sheet is the future .
Before They Were Famous Guess Who ?
02/09/2009
After several small parts , this actor received his first major television role only after Matthew Broderick turned it down .
He secured the role from a phone booth because he had no home phone .
One of the show 's producers tried to have him replaced saying " this is not the kind of face you 'll ever find on a lunchbox . "
He replaced Eric Stoltz in his first major film role .
The film was number one at the box office for 11 consecutive weeks .
His real - life wife once played his on - screen girlfriend .
He is currently semi-retired from acting .
Who is he ?
Continue reading for the answer .
Michael J. Fox played Alex P. Keaton on the television show " Family Ties " from 1982 - 1989 .
The role was originally offered to Matthew Broderick .
Fox negotiated the deal for " Family Ties " from a phone booth outside a Pioneer Chicken restaurant in Hollywood because he had no phone at home .
He was told the network would need to call , and he said he was only home between the hours of four and five .
He waited for the call , and fortunately he was there to answer it and secure the Family Ties role .
Producer Brandon Tartikoff felt that Fox was too short for the role , and tried to have him replaced .
Tartikoff reportedly said that " this is not the kind of face you 'll ever find on a lunchbox . "
After his later successes , Fox presented Tartikoff with a custom - made lunchbox with the inscription " To Brandon , this is for you to put your crow in .
Love and Kisses , Michael J.Fox . "
Tartikoff kept the lunchbox in his office for the rest of his NBC career .
A few years into Family Ties , the show 's creator , Gary David Goldberg , was approached and asked to let Fox star in a Steven Spielberg film about a time - travelling teenager .
Initially , Goldberg did not tell Michael about the offer , not wanting to lose Michael to film stardom .
Months later , Goldberg was again asked about Michael because Eric Stoltz , who had been chosen for the part after Goldberg stated that Fox was n't available , was reportedly not giving the energetic performance that Robert Zemeckis , the director , was looking for .
Goldberg finally told Michael about the offer and he quickly agreed to play the role of Marty McFly in the film Back to the Future .
Fox would rehearse for Family Ties from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM .
After he was done , he would be rushed to the Back to the Future set where he would rehearse and shoot until 2:30 A.M .
This schedule lasted for two full months .
On July 4 , 1985 Back to the Future was number one at the box office .
The film was number one for 11 consecutive weeks .
Fox met wife Tracy Pollan on the set of " Family Ties " when she played his girlfriend , Ellen .
The two were reunited during the shooting of the film " Bright Lights , Big City " and were married on July 16 , 1988 .
In 1998 , Fox disclosed that he was diagnosed with Parkinson 's disease in 1991 .
As the symptoms of his disease worsened he semi-retired from acting in 2000 .

A male suspect has been arrested by police after complaints that a man with HIV had unprotected sex with a number of women .
Devon and Cornwall Police said the women live in the east Devon area .
The women told officers they had had unprotected sex with the man , who had failed to disclose his HIV status .
A 39 - year - old man from the Bournemouth area of Dorset was arrested on Friday and has been released on police bail until 11 May .
Devon and Cornwall Police said in a statement it could confirm a number of women had come forward regarding allegations of their having had unprotected sex with a man who they now believed to be HIV positive .
The women allege he failed to tell them .
Random dungeon generators go way back to the early days of computer games .
Text - based dungeon crawls like Hack and Moria randomly created their dungeon levels using ASCII characters , but even they have since been given graphics front - ends .
A dungeon generator can save you some time when you ’re getting ready for your next game session .
Two of the generators below can save you even more time by listing the contents and some aspects of each room .
However , you may need to adjust these descriptions or throw them out completely to fit your needs .
One also lists the dungeon ’s general description ( type of rock , climb difficulty , lighting , etc . )
All of the generators below scored very well in at least one way .
It is not my intent to put down anyone ’s work –I know from my own projects how much inspiration , effort and knowledge it takes to do anything like these .
But each also has room for improvement so hopefully my critiques will be taken constructively if the people working on these see them .
“ The Demonweb ” Random Dungeon Generator
The first search result I had was for “ The Demonweb ” Random Dungeon Generator .
( This also came up as a separate result with a different name . )
The first page lets the user choose several options such as dungeon name , level , motif ( undead , vermin , arcane , etc. ) , size , room size , room placement ( sparse , scattered , or packed ) .
The user can click a “ Random ” button to set each of these randomly .
Or the user can set each and click “ Construct ” to build the dungeon .
The result is a much larger and un-cropped version of the picture to the right .
Importantly , the developer of this random dungeon generator now created images for all but the “ HTML ” dungeon motif .
Earlier versions had issues printing the maps , but this fix addresses those issues .
Below the dungeon map is short general description of the dungeon including the type of walls , temperature and illumination .
After that is a short description of each numbered location .
Each of the room ’s entrances described : “ Locked Stone Door ( Open Lock DC 25 , break DC 28 ; hard 8 , 60 hp ) ” for example .
Then the room ’s contents are listed such as “ Fireplace , Sconce , Winch and pulley . ”
Finally , a trap or list of monsters ( including their OGL 3.5 - ish stats ) is noted .
Of course , any of this can be modified or completely thrown out if it does n’t work for the game master .
Scores : Customizability : B ; Aesthetics : B+ ; Variety : C ; Completeness : B ; Printing : B ; Text Descriptions : B
( Customizability refers to how many options are available to the user .
Aesthetics is how pretty are the maps the generator creates .
Variety is the number of styles of rooms and corridors and other things on the map .
Completeness is how well does the generator aviod too many dead ends or other things that do not make sense .
Printing notes how well the dungeon ( particularly the map ) looks when printed .
Text Descriptions refers to the detail of the text descriptions created by the generator if the generator provides them . )
Myth Weavers ’ Random Dungeon Generator
The next random dungeon generator search result is at Myth Weavers .
As in the previous dungeon generator , the user can set the size of the dungeon , the sparseness , and level .
Additional options include percentage settings for secret and concealed doors and settings for the room sizes .
However , the Myth Weavers generator does n’t include options for a dungeon theme / motif as The Demonweb ’s generator allows .
Taking the default settings except for requesting “ Many ” rooms and allowing for rooms that are between two and seven squares high and wide instead of two to five squares creates a dungeon like the one to the left .
The Myth Weavers random dungeon generator also provides bullet - point style text details about the dungeon ’s rooms .
However , because a user ca n’t set a theme to the dungeon it is hard to get a random dungeon with a particular concept such as a mad wizard ’s labyrinth or an undead crypt .
Printed maps created with this generator look just like the on - screen maps .
You may need to select the map ’s specific web page frame to print it .
For very large dungeons , you may need to scale down the size you use to print the page or else the map will extend off the page .
You can easily save the map image to your computer so you may edit it with an image editor or print a larger version .
Although enlarging images usually loses some detail , since the Myth Weavers ’ dungeon maps are very simple this is not an issue .
Scores : Customizability : B+ ; Aesthetics : C ; Variety : C+ ; Completeness : B ; Printing : C+ ; Text Descriptions : C
Gozzys ’ Random Dungeon Generator
The third random dungeon generator search result is from a site called Gozzys .
Like the others , it gives the user several options then the user clicks a button and the next page is the random map result .
The Gozzys site actually gives the options for two different random dungeon generators on the same page , divided in two sections .
The first section is titled “ Wandering Room Type ” and it includes options for map size , density maximum room width , maximum room height , background , tile set , and randomness .
This represents fewer options than the other generators above offer .
The background and tileset offer nice color options , however .
The second section is titled “ Random Room Type . ”
It offers options for just map size , density , background and room set .
The maps it generates have a similar look , but as the title suggests the rooms can vary greatly in shape .
It would be very interesting to see these two combined , but that may make for a rather complex algorithm to write .
In any case , neither of Gozzy ’s random dungeon generators provide text descriptions of the rooms or the dungeon in general .
Printed maps created with these generators look just like the on - screen maps .
Like the Myth Weavers generator , you can easily save the map image to your computer so you may edit it with an image editor or print a larger version .
In this case enlarging the map may look a little bit worse if you chose the more interesting tile and background colors because some detail will be lost .
But the maps are still fairly simple so this is a very minor issue .

Hack / ’s Random Dungeon Generator
The next random dungeon generator is offered by hack / .
It generates dungeon maps in a graph paper style .
See the example to the left .
The inclusion of caverns and multiple elevations on the same level ( see the example ’s vertical corridor crossing over a horizontal corridor and room ) make this generator worth a closer look .
The generator relies on the dungeon being cut up into a number of 10 ×10 square tiles and each tile has a join corridor at the same spot along each of the four walls .
This constrains the dungeon ’s design .
One improvement would be to allow for some tiles to have fewer of these join points and for the generator to know that some tiles ca n’t fit because a tile ’s edge may not have a corridor to join .
A bunch of new dungeon tiles have recently been added to this random dungeon generator .
Unfortunately , the hack / dungeon generator does n’t allow the user to choose any options .
You simply refresh the web page until you get a design you like .
However , if you want a dungeon that is mostly caverns , is very labyrinthine , has very densely packed rooms , etc. , you probably wo n’t ever get a design you like .
Printed maps created with this generator look just like the on - screen maps .
However , because the maps are a set of smaller images , you ca n’t just save the map image to your computer .
You would need to get a screen shot and import that to your image editor if you want to edit or enlarge the image .
Once you do that , because the maps are fairly simple enlarging the image will only lose a small amount of detail .

MapMage ’s Random Dungeon Generator
Next up is MapMage .
It is a paid product , running about $ 25 , that you download and install .
It seems to run only on Windows , but it has been “ updated ” for Windows Vista .
You can choose the room size , corridor types , dungeon size ( in pixels ) , iterations ( it seems the more iterations the “ better ” your dungeon will be–fewer dead - ends other things that make no sense ) , and some other options for a river , chasm , etc .
The generated map includes information about the contents of each room , but it is system neutral because it does not offer any game statistics .
This information is shown when you hover over a room .
The website offers a screenshot and a portion of one of those maps is to the right .
The MapMage site also offers several other random generators that may not have as many good and free alternatives for cities , caverns , whole worlds , buildings and more .
This review ca n’t include how well these maps print because a copy of the product is required .

Skeleton Key Games ’ Random Dungeon Generator
[ I was under the impression that the Skeleton Key Games random dungeon generator was official or permissible .
But it was removed with a note that it was “ taken down due to a request by the rightsholders of Skeleton Key Games tiles . ”
But I ’m keeping this review in place because it may help others get ideas for creating or improving another random dungeon generator . ]
The final random Dungeon Generator in my search results ( that worked , was not ASCII art and was within the first few pages of results ) was the Skeleton Key Games random dungeon generator .
The tiles used for the map creation look beautiful , and they can be enlarged up to 300×300 pixels each .
Larger versions are available as pdfs for purchase .
Customization is an issue however .
The generator lets you select between a number of different tilesets , but it does not allow you to set how frequent you want the rooms to be or how large or most of the other options the other generators allow .
In addition to the tile set and tile size , you may only select the dungeon ’s number of tiles wide and high .
The dungeons this generator creates also often do n’t make sense .
It has many more dead ends ( actually , the dead ends here are worse –they sometimes end with an open wall ) and rooms that are not connected .
The Skeleton Key games generator also does not provide text descriptions of the dungeon or its rooms .
However , the tiles are so detailed that they somewhat make up for that .
If you want to print a dungeon created by this generator , you ’ll need to adjust the number of tiles wide and high to fit a sheet of paper , or else adjust the sizes of the tiles or adjust the printing options .
Alternatively , you should make sure your web browser ’s print function includes the ability to span multiple pages in width and you need to be comfortable pasting them together .
If you want to enlarge the maps , the built in option to change the tilesize works well .
Unfortunately if you want to get a copy of the dungeon ( especially if you set a large tile size ) you may need to do several screenshots or save each tile image individually , then paste them together in an image editor .
The largest tile size setting ( 300×300 ) is n’t designed to be printed such that each square in a tile is one inch for minatures use , but it will look ok .
If you truly want to do that , you should consider purchasing the pdf versions .

Wizards of the Coasts ’ Mapper Random Dungeon Generator
Amazingly , the random dungeon generator from Wizards of the Coast did n’t turn up in my initial web search .
Based on suggestions from readers , it is now added to this set of reviews .
Despite being tagged “ beta ” ( although Google has long betas for very usable software , and everything on the internet is evolving if it is n’t falling into disuse ) it offers many features .
Dungeon size , room size , corridor size , secret doors and porticullises are some of the major map options .
Additionally , a user can request room descriptions .
For this feature the user can set the dungeon “ level , ” theme ( although there are only three options for this –The Demonweb ’s dungeon generator had many ) , simple adventure hooks , and one can turn on or off several things like wandering monsters and intro text .
The user can also set which Dungeons and Dragons v3.5 books to use as resources for stocking the dungeon .
As one would expect for an official D&D resource , this is one of the better dungeon generators , although others are better in at least some ways .
It is one of the few that offers descriptions complete with stocked monsters , but as mentioned above it has fewer themes to choose between .
The maps are nice looking , although a few other dungeon generators produce maps that are just as nice and the tiles used by the Skeleton Key games dungeon generator look even nicer .
Also lacking are any cavern options and like most of the other dungeon generators the rooms are basic rectangles and the corridors are pretty simple and do n’t bend much or go in odd directions from rooms .
Printing is comparable to the Myth Weavers dungeon generator and this generator has the same issues .

Dyson ’s Random Morph Map
Dyson ’s Random Morph Map currently has 95 tiles ( and is actively growing every few days ) but the variety of tiles seems even larger for some reason .
Aside from that , the generator is hard to review in that it is so similar to Hack / ’s .
Maybe I ’m missing something , but I do n’t see a difference in the functionality .
( Although I ’m fairly certain it is different code . )
To be sure the artistic style of the tiles is much different ( more sketch - like ) but that ’s just an aesthetic issue .
Like the Hack / generator it has drawbacks related to saving the map and it does n’t try to key the rooms or describe them in any way .
But what it does it does well .

Risus Monkey ’s Mapper
The Risus Monkey Mapper currently has 80 tiles ( according to the site as I write this ) .
The code for it is based on Dyson ’s Random Morph Map , but the tile style is slightly different .
The style is still sketch - like , but a little different from Dyson’s .
I truly do n’t have a preference between either style .
Although Dyson ’s has more tiles and the variety seems greater than Hack / ’s , the Risus Monkey ’s Mapper seems to have even more variety for some reason .
However , at this point we ’re splitting hairs and I can’t give the two different grades .
Because it seems to be the same code as Dyson ’s , it has the same drawbacks ( as with Hack / ’s ) .
Saving the map ca n’t be done by clicking on the map , and it does n’t try to key the rooms or describe them in any way .
But as with Dyson ’s , it does the grunt work of creating a random map well .

Adventure Generator ! from Dizzy Dragon Games
A new ( I ’m writing this in September 2010 , but I saw it a month or two ago ) and innovative random dungeon generator comes from Dizzy Dragon Games .
It is innovative in how it combines the tile based generator concept while still being able to key the adventure areas .
( As a programmer , I have an idea of it does this but I have n’t tried to look at the code behind it . )
Tile based generators typically have an issue with keying the rooms because each time the generator runs , a different set of tiles are produced so there is no easy way to assign rooms or parts of rooms numbers without :
Reusing numbers or
Deciding beforehand to key one tiles rooms 1 - 20 , the next as 21 - 40 , and so on .
And in this case you completed map may have a set of tiles with numbers 21 - 40 , 400- 421 , 160-180 , 320-360 , and so on .
But Adventure Generator !
seems to predetermine where to place numbers and then places them as the tiles are determined which allows for one continuous numbering .
Adventure Generator !
also lets the user choose between several random dungeon stocking methods , dungeon dressing approaches and choose to either make a geomorphic dungeon or a 1e wilderness map .
( Although the wilderness map is not currently stocked , described , etc. )
I like the style of the tiles and the variety , although maybe I like Hack / ’s a touch better .
Still , that ’s nit-picking and a personal taste issue .
Also one ca n’t click the map and save it , but as mentioned above that is a general limitation of tile based map generators .
The only negative that I can give it is that it really is n’t an “ Adventure Generator ” yet .
Sure , it creates a dungeon , stocks it with monsters , traps , treasure and some flower text based on a few options but that is n’t really an adventure .
What would be really cool would be if the generator spit out a bullet point plot and stocked the monsters , traps and treasure based on that plot .
But do n’t take the criticism above as too negative .
That ’s really reaching for the stars , and I would n’t be surprised to see something like that added by an obviously talented creator if that person sees that direction as a good idea .

Random Dungeon Generator from Inkwell Ideas
Full disclosure in case it is n’t obvious :
This random generator is by me , the reviewer , so I wo n’t grade it but I ’ll try to review it as fairly as I can .
I reviewed most of the above random generators before starting my own .
The Inkwell Ideas tile - based random generator differs from the other tile - based generators in one way : the tiles join in multiple ways .
For simplicity , most of the tile generators join tiles together by having one or two openings on each side of the tile .
( But each generator only uses one join type , not both one opening and two openings . )
These openings are typically used for corridors ( whether they are finished dungeon corridors or narrow cave corridors ) or sometimes as parts of rooms .
But the Inkwell Ideas ’ generator ’s edges may each have two openings , two larger openings , one opening or none .
And each tile may have any combination of these for its four edges .
This versatility does come at some cost : one must make sure that all combinations of tile edges have existing tiles .
For example , when determining which tile to place , one must pick a tile that has the same number / size of openings on its top edge as the tile above it has on its bottom edge .
The tile you are placing must have the same number / size of openings on its left edge as the tile to the left has on its right edge .
And so on .
And by using the edge type as a marker for caverns , it is possible to group cave tiles together .
( All caves tiles have two larger openings on at least one edge . )
The customizability is very limited because it it a tile - based generator and it does not currently do dungeon stocking / dressing .
The only option at present allows you to approximately set the mix of finished dungeon tiles to cave tiles .
Like the hack / and Dizzy Dragon tile generators , saving is limited to taking a screenshot and using an outside image editing tool .

Age of Fable ’s “ Tunnels and Trolls ” and “ Labyrinth Lord Mutant Future ” dungeon generators : Both of these generated very simplistic maps .
They did include good additional text information , but the maps simply showed how the rooms were connected .
The rooms were uniform in shape on the “ map . ”
Also here at Inkwell Ideas is a random inn / tavern generator that does floorplans , menus , and a list of staff & patrons .
Summary
Unfortunately none of the random dungeon generators stands out in every way .
Each category has a clear winner , but the winner of that category is average at best in some of the other categories .
Hopefully some of the people working on these generators will see what the others have done and improve their own such that one or more will score highly in each category .
The universal mobile phone charger , which relies on the micro-USB connection found in the new BlackBerry Storm , will appear later this year .
Photograph : PR
The mobile phone industry plans to introduce a universal charger as part of a drive to improve its previously patchy environmental record .
The plan from industry body the GSM Association ( GSMA ) is just one of a raft of " green " announcements at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona .
Not only will it mean phone users no longer have to hunt for the right charger , but the specifications for the new device include a 50 % reduction in standby energy consumption .
All five of the UK 's mobile phone companies have signed up to the universal charger , as have the major handset manufacturers , and phones which can use the new charger - which relies upon the micro-USB connection found in the new BlackBerry Storm - will start appearing later in the year .
By 2012 , the GSMA has pledged that the majority of phones shipped around the world will use the universal charger .
The mobile phone industry has been attacked by environmental campaigners in the past for being one of the least green areas of technology , but mobile phones made from recycled materials or sporting solar panels have been one of the most interesting features in Barcelona so far .
Samsung unveiled the Blue Earth touchscreen phone which has a solar panel on the back that can charge the phone .
Available in the UK in the second half of the year , the handset is made from recycled plastic from water bottles and is also free from harmful substances such as brominated flame retardants , beryllium and phthalate .
Samsung Blue Earth - Mobile World Congress 2009
It also includes an in - built pedometer which tells the user how much CO2 they have saved by walking instead of using motorised transport .
Samsung 's SGH - F268 handset was last year named as the industry 's greenest in a survey by Greenpeace .
A range of solar - powered phones are also being created by Dutch company Intivation , in a joint venture with ZTE , China 's largest mobile phone manufacturer , and mobile phone network Digicel , which has operations in such remote places as the South Pacific islands .
And Sweden 's Flexenclosure has showcased the latest in wind - powered mobile phone masts .
LG pledged yesterday that it would remove brominated flame retardants , chlorinated flame retardants and polyvinyl chloride from the manufacturing process by next year .
It also pledged to use green packaging across its entire line of 2009 mobile handset models .
The company has used the trade fair to unveil a handset equipped with a solar panel battery cover as part of what it termed an " aggressive green initiative " .
" Using renewable solar energy in a mobile handset is an example of our ongoing efforts to help create a safer , cleaner environment for our customers , " said LG 's chief executive , Skott Ahn .
Exposing the phone to the sun for 10 minutes gives it enough power for a three - minute call .
Left in natural light for long periods , the solar panel generates enough standby power to enable the phone to be used without any further charging .

I just received this assessment in a newsletter from Euro Pacific Capital .
The author is Derek Gates , President and Chief Investment Officer of Sustainable Wealth Management Ltd.
Citing global oil demands remaining high , dwindling new crude oil discoveries , major exporters reaching their production limits , and Canada having the largest proven reserves of oil in the world , he concludes that investors should take advantage of today ’s “ absurdly low ” prices and invest in Canadian Oil Sands producers .
He predicts investors can , in the long term , expect “ inflation protection and leverage to oil prices while collecting a substantial yield in a currency that should benefit from rising energy prices . ”
The article :
Is the energy boom over or was 2008 part of a natural cycle that sets the stage for the next bull market ?
I tend to believe that 2008 is similar to previous lows we have seen in 1998 and 2002 when oil prices were at cycle lows .
Investment Yields in the Sector are at Record Highs
The chart below gives you a long term view of the distribution history of an index that covers the Canadian Royalty Trusts and Oil Sands oil producers .
Despite the record drop in energy prices and corresponding decrease in income distributions , the yields are at record highs .
Global Oil Demand Remains High
Economic contraction has only curbed demand for crude oil by 300,000 barrels / day in 2008 during one of the worst global recessions in decades .
New Crude Oil Discoveries are Dwindling
Global oil discoveries have declined each decade since the 1960s ( see chart below ) .
Major Exporters are near their production limits
The International Energy Agency and the US Energy Information Administration believe that the major producers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia will be able to increase production dramatically by 2030 .
I think the historical evidence does not support this viewpoint .
Saudi Arabia reached its peak crude oil production in 1980 and is experiencing declining production from their main fields .
Russia peaked during the cold war and has chased foreign investment away via quasi-nationalization of crude oil and natural gas reserves .
Canada will become a Top Crude Oil Exporter by 2030
Canada is one of the few oil producers expected to increase production significantly over the next two decades .
Meanwhile , many of the OPEC producers are experiencing major increasing internal demand because of rapid population growth and rising per capita consumption .
In addition , many countries heavily subsidize gasoline which encourages overconsumption locally .
The charts below show the expected breakdown of crude oil exporters for 2015 and 2030 based on IEA data and SWM estimates .
Canada Has the Largest Proven Reserves of Oil in the World
OPEC oil producers are assumed to have the world ’s largest oil reserves however their reserves have n’t been independently verifies for decades .
In the mid 1980s the national oil companies of the OPEC nations increased their proven reserves on paper by 100 % to 200 % without any reasonable justification .
After extensive study of the available reserves data , adjustments were made for the paper reserves created in the 1980s and for cumulative production from the OPEC producers since the 1980s .
The results show that Canada should be recognized as having the largest crude oil reserves in the world and that OPEC reserves could be significantly overstated .
My advice to investors is to take advantage of today ’s absurdly low prices and invest in the good quality Canadian oil sands producers and royalty trusts that will benefit from the major trends developing in the global energy sector .
Long term , you can expect inflation protection and leverage to oil prices while collecting a substantial yield in a currency that should benefit from rising energy prices .
Just 1 unintended consequence of Stimulus Share
This :
The Obama Stimulus Package received next - to - no reflection and , so , it invites unintended ( tho ' often predictable ) consequences to define what it will achieve in practice .
Case in point ...
On January 30 , the Globe and Mail ran
Why is a Canadian newspaper analyzing U.S. legislation from the '30s ?
The
America 's largest trading partner is Canada .
Thus , the Stimulus package -- if passed as a new type of Smoot - Hawley Act -- would not only violate the current agreed - upon terms of trade ( e.g. the North American Free Trade Agreement ) but also deal a body blow to Canada 's economy .
All the while , of course , it would raise prices for goods / raw materials being sold in the U.S and reduce exports due to retaliatory tarrifs .
If free trade is a prerequisite of peace , then tariffs are a prelude to hostility .
Of course , Buy American provision of the Stimulus Package .
U.S. trade officials have already offered assurances that the president can waive parts of the Stimulus Bill if they violate obligations of NAFTA .
Meanwhile , the Senate may well expand the Bill 's protectionism to include manufactured goods ; the proposed Senate provision states that a project may not be funded " unless all of the iron , steel and manufactured goods used in the projects are produced in the United States . "
Let 's see who wins ... commitments from the past or the current Buy American mania .
Obama 's scheduled visit to Canada should be an interesting one .
His first formal television interview was to the Arabic cable TV network Al - Arabiya ( Dubai - based , pro-American ) in order to tell Muslims that " America is not the enemy . "
Maybe he 'll deliver another one on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ?
It would probably be just as effective .

I believe that unintended consequences are the most powerful forces in human life .
I do not diss the power of making plans and seeing them through but , as John Lennon once said , " life is what happens while you are making other plans . "
An unintended consequence of attending a protest rally years ago was meeting the young , bearded revolutionary to whom I 've been married for 20 +.
Despite the foregoing , unintended consequences are in - and - of - themselves neither good nor bad ; like reality , they are value neutral .
But they can interfere or assist with human values like prosperity or achieving intended goals .
Happily , through reflection , it is possible to decrease unintended consequences that are predictable and , so , to make your overall plans / life a bit more secure .
For example , if you look both ways before crossing the street , you decrease the predictable chance of being run over while crossing .
( Do n't worry about losing the delightful and awful " surprise ! " factor in life ; it will always be there in bucketfuls . )
The Obama Stimulus Package received next - to - no reflection and , so , it invites unintended ( tho ' often predictable ) consequences to define what it will achieve in practice .
Case in point ... On January 30 , the Globe and Mail ran a commentary entitled " SMOOT - HAWLEY ACT PROVED DISASTROUS LEGISLATION IN 1930s . "
According to Wikipedia , the Smoot - Hawley Tariff Act ( sometimes known as the Hawley - Smoot Tariff Act ) was an act signed into law on June 17 , 1930 , that raised U.S. tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods to record levels .
In the United States 1,028 economists signed a petition against this legislation , and after it was passed , many countries retaliated with their own increased tariffs on U.S. goods , and American exports and imports plunged by more than half .
In the opinion of some economists , the Smoot - Hawley Act was a catalyst for the severe reduction in U.S. - European trade from its high in 1929 to its depressed levels of 1932 that accompanied the start of the Great Depression .
Why is a Canadian newspaper analyzing U.S. legislation from the '30s ?
The D.C. Examiner explains , House Democrats insisted on including â€ œBuy Americanâ€ provisions in the $ 825 billion economic stimulus bill .
The provisions â€ “ which are mirrored in the Senate Democratsâ€™ version of the legislation - require that federal funds for stimulus projects can only be spent on steel and iron from domestic producers .
Thatâ€™s another way of telling foreign producers to keep out .
America 's largest trading partner is Canada .
Thus , the Stimulus package -- if passed as a new type of Smoot - Hawley Act -- would not only violate the current agreed - upon terms of trade ( e.g. the North American Free Trade Agreement ) but also deal a body blow to Canada 's economy .
All the while , of course , it would raise prices for goods / raw materials being sold in the U.S and reduce exports due to retaliatory tarrifs .
If free trade is a prerequisite of peace , then tariffs are a prelude to hostility .
Of course , Canada is optimistic about being exempted from theprovision of the Stimulus Package .
U.S. trade officials have already offered assurances that the president can waive parts of the Stimulus Bill if they violate obligations of NAFTA .
Meanwhile , the Senate may well expand the Bill 's protectionism to include manufactured goods ; the proposed Senate provision states that a project may not be funded " unless all of the iron , steel and manufactured goods used in the projects are produced in the United States . "
Let 's see who wins ... commitments from the past or the current Buy American mania .
Obama 's scheduled visit to Canada should be an interesting one .
His first formal television interview was to the Arabic cable TV network Al - Arabiya ( Dubai - based , pro-American ) in order to tell Muslims that " America is not the enemy . "
Maybe he 'll deliver another one on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ?
It would probably be just as effective .
Let them filibuster

Tonight , President Obama will take to the airwaves for his first “ primetime ” press conference as president .
He will speak from Elk Hart , Ind. , a particularly hard - hit area of a state that ’s been particularly hard - hit by the ongoing economic crisis / recession .
The president will , presumably , make the case as to why the massive stimulus package , currently being held up in Congress by a bankrupt minority with no ideas , should be passed .
Here ’s hoping the president dares the Republicans , whose only idea to stimulate the economy is the same bullshit battle cry of tax cuts they have been pushing for decades ( despite no indication that tax cuts have EVER spurred the economy or created jobs ) , to filibuster the bill .
I hope he makes those bastards stand up there and explain themselves before a nation that everyday sees news reports about continuing job losses , underwhelming earnings reports and giant corporate bailouts .
Let the Republicans in the Senate explain how tax cuts create jobs , despite never having worked before ; or how Obama ’s tax cuts are n’t big enough despite the fact that are technically larger than anything Bush did ; or how they oppose giving money to the states to prevent the states from having to cut back on essential services and jobs ; or why they are opposed to spending , even though the spending creates jobs by rebuilding the country ’s crumbling infrastructure .
Let them explain why their 42 - person minority thinks it is speaking for America , especially since the presidents approval rating hovers above 60 percent while theirs , well , does n’t .
Christ , even the Democrats in Congress have better numbers than them , that ’s how bad it ’s gotten .
Make the bastards filibuster .
It would be political suicide and highlight their inability and unwillingness to compromise , despite the Democrats already removing legislation ( some of which that rightfully should have been removed ) to try and reach across the aisle .
The president and the Democrats should NOT back down on this .
We voted for change , not more of the failed bullshit policies that led us to here , i.e. , tax cuts only .
( Also important to note that Harry Reid is such a piss - poor majority leader that even with 58 senators in his party he still ca n’t get shit done .
New Leadership is needed and that milquetoast motherfucker from Nevada is NOT it . )
But calling this a “ primetime ” news conference kind of annoys me .
While the president is speaking , at least one whole time zone ( with a population of nearly 46,000,000 people – or about 13 percent of the country ) will be stuck in traffic on their evening commute .
Pushing this conference until 9 p.m. on the east coast would not really change the audience out there and would allow the west coast a better shot at being able to see the president speak .
Damn East Coast Bias .
It ’s bad enough football starts out here at 10 a.m .
The least the president could do if he was hoping to address the whole country would be to push this back another hour .

In addition , funding for the bank - rescue plan is unlikely to exceed the $ 350 billion currently available under the TARP , another source said .
" We do n't know yet whether we 're going to need additional money or how much additional money we 'll need until we see how successful we are at restoring a level of confidence in the marketplace , " President Obama said in a news conference Monday night .
A Treasury Department source said the plan was essentially complete with only minor “ tweaks ” being applied .
The plan is being presented to members of Congress this evening , according to sources .
Based on details coming out that presentation , the plan calls for :
Some $ 100 billion will be committed to new capital injections
Another $ 100 billion will go to the Federal Reserve 's TALF program
And $ 50 - 100 billion on housing measures , as expected , according to the source
The package will be unveiled Tuesday by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner at 11 am EST .
CNBC.com will carry the speech live .
CNBC will also interview Geithner after the speech at 12 Noon EST .
It will be his first television interview since becoming Treasury Secretary
There ’s been great speculation in recent days about both the measures and terms involved in the bank - rescue plan .
In particular , there ’s been great uncertainty about the inclusion of the " bad bank " concept , where the government would set up an aggregate bank and buy up billions of dollars of bad debt from banks .
For Investors
At the moment , the idea of involving private capital in the purchase of bad assets “ is gaining speed , ” said the source , who is familiar with the discussions .
In that way , the government might simply encourage firms to buy the assets or provide some sort government subsidy covering some of the costs .
“ You do n’t need as many dollars , " the source explained , and “ the market sets the price . ”
Such a model would also reduce the likelihood of bank nationalization by demonstrating that the “ company is strong enough to attract private capital . "

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Brain scans using magnetic resonance imaging may be able to detect signs of multiple sclerosis long before symptoms of the disease appear , U.S. researchers said on Wednesday .
They said nearly a third of people who showed signs of the disease on brain MRIs developed the disease within five years .
Multiple sclerosis occurs when the immune system attacks the myelin sheath protecting nerve cells .
It affects 2.5 million people globally and can cause symptoms ranging from vague tingling to blindness and paralysis .
Dr. Darin Okuda of the University of California , San Francisco studied brain scans done on 44 people for various health reasons , such as migraine or head injuries .
All had abnormalities similar to those seen in people with MS , but none had been diagnosed with the disease .
Okuda continued to follow these people to see if they developed the disease and found that within 5.4 years , 30 percent had developed MS symptoms .
“ More research is needed to fully understand the risk of MS for people with these brain abnormalities , but it appears that this condition may be a precursor to MS , ” Okuda , whose study appears in the journal Neurology , said in a statement .
He said further research is needed before doctors begin treating people with these pre-MS abnormalities .
Dr. Dennis Bourdette of the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland said in a commentary in the journal that an MS diagnosis can be upsetting and may mean treatment with strong drugs that could cause side effects .
He cautioned that people should not be told they have MS unless they have symptoms of the disease .
“ Patients must have symptoms to receive a diagnosis , ” Bourdette wrote .
“ For now , it ’s best to remember the wise advice that we ‘ treat the patient , not the MRI scan . ’ ”
This Thursday , the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars will host a panel discussion about the future of environmental journalism .
According to a press release , “ Even as interest in environmental issues skyrockets , the reporters who cover these topics are being laid off left and right . ”
[ social_buttons ]
The claim that reporters who cover environmental news are being laid off in huge amounts does not ring true to me personally , even though I have no evidence .
Currently the mainstream media , along with a multitude of sites across the internet , seem to be giving more attention to environmental and scientific issues than I can ever recall in the past .
One thing I am curious to hear the panel discuss : why do they think environmental and science reporters are so much more expendable than other types of writers in the eyes of the people who manage media organizations ?
If you are interested , the discussion will will be broadcast live on the internet this Thursday , February 12th at 10:00 A.M. EST .
It will include 3 or 4 notable speakers , with current or past experience working for news organizations like CNN , National Public Radio ( NPR ) , and the Associated Press .

6 : This post has been updated .
Former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson said last October that the taxpayers should n't fret about putting $ 250 billion in the nation 's banks : " This is an investment , not an expenditure , and there is no reason to expect this program will cost taxpayers anything . "
But a draft report from the Congressional Oversight Panel for the TARP says Paulson should have known better .
According to the panel 's analysis , the preferred stock and warrants Treasury received are worth far less than the investments themselves , amounting to at least a $ 43 billion subsidy to the banks .
That shortfall , they found , was inevitable from the structure of the investments .
That 's because the analysis âdemonstrates that the value received â including the marketâs estimate of its future worth â was considerably less at the time of the transaction than the amount paid by Treasury .â 
In other words , there was every reason to believe the program would cost taxpayers a lot .
The subsidy climbs even more , to $ 78 billion , when you add in Treasury 's investments to prop up ailing institutions like AIG and Citigroup .
As of the report 's completion , the Treasury had used $ 254 billion to buy stakes in banks and AIG , meaning about a third of that was a giveaway .
A breakdown of the panel 's analysis of the size of the subsidies by institution is below the fold .
Update :
The panel has posted the final version of the report here ( PDF ) .
First , the eight largest bank investments , excluding the extra help given to ailing Citigroup and Bank of America :
Amount Invested Estimated Value Subsidy % Subsidy $ Citigroup $ 25 billion $ 15.5 billion 38 % $ 9.5 billion Wells Fargo $ 25 billion $ 23.3 billion 7 % $ 1.8 billion JP Morgan Chase $ 25 billion $ 20.6 billion 18 % $ 4.4 billion Bank of America $ 15 billion $ 12.5 billion 17 % $ 2.6 billion Morgan Stanley $ 10 billion $ 5.8 billion 42 % $ 4.2 billion Goldman Sachs $ 10 billion $ 7.5 billion 25 % $ 2.5 billion PNC $ 7.6 billion $ 5.5 billion 27 % $ 2.1 billion U.S. Bancorp $ 6.6 billion $ 6.3 billion 5 % $ 0.3 billion
Next , an analysis of two of the emergency interventions ( the analysis was done before Bank of America received an extra $ 20 billion last month ) :
Amount Invested Estimated Value Subsidy % Subsidy $ AIG $ 40 billion $ 14.8 billion 63 % $ 25.2 billion Citigroup $ 20 billion $ 10 billion 50 % $ 10 billion
As always , you can see a complete , up - to - date list of the banks and other companies that have gotten bailout money here .
Since the report 's completion , the Treasury has continued buying stakes in the nation 's banks .
That means the giveaway amount has continued going up .
Assuming about a third of the $ 285 billion invested to date is a kind of subsidy , that means the total subsidy has climbed to $ 85.4 billion .
The report , signed by the panel 's chair , Harvard Law Professor Elizabeth Warren , cautions that it 's possible the Treasury 's investments might pan out miraculously well .
It 's also possible it will be worth much less .
The panel hired an international valuation firm to perform the analysis .
An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office last month came to a similar conclusion .
The reason for the shortfall , Warren writes , was inherent in the way Treasury structured the deals : they were " certain to create significant subsidies . "
For one , the terms were crafted to attract a broad array of participants .
And they were one size fits all , regardless of the credit risk of the bank .
Even in the cases of AIG and Citi , where the Treasury crafted unique terms , they were generous .
Warren does allow that the purpose of the Treasury 's program was not to make a buck , but rather to support the financial system .
For the purpose of this report , at least , she sets aside the question of whether these subsidies are a bad idea .
But she does hint that Paulson was n't straightforward about the costs , and that 's got to change : " if TARP is to garner credibility and public support , a clear explanation of the economic transaction and the reasoning behind any such expenditure of funds must be made clear to the public . "

Iceland :
Angry protests over economy force early elections
By Jordan Shilton
24 January 2009
Special forces had to rescue Iceland 's Prime Minister Geir H. Haarde in the early hours of Thursday morning , as ongoing protests over the country 's economic crisis erupted into angry clashes outside parliament .
On Friday , Haarde announced early elections for May 9 .
During the protest , Haarde had been trapped in his car , as several hundred protesters gathered outside the building , threw paint , eggs and tins at the vehicle and called for immediate elections .
Police used teargas to disperse the protesters , and extricate the prime minister .
The protest began on Tuesday , when parliament reconvened for its first session after the Christmas break .
At least 2,000 people attended in what was described as a " tense " atmosphere , with demonstrators chanting , " The USA is getting rid of Bush today , we want to get rid of you . "
Over 100 policemen were deployed and pepper spray was used repeatedly to disperse the crowd .
At least 30 protesters were arrested by police , but the protest continued well into the night .
Large crowds reassembled on Wednesday at lunchtime , forcing the day 's parliamentary session to be abandoned .
Instead , Haarde held emergency talks with other party leaders , attempting to hold together his ruling coalition with the Social Democrats .
It was after Haarde attempted to leave his office later that night that protesters surrounded his car , and began pelting it .
The recent protest is thought to be the largest seen in Iceland in 60 years .
Demonstrations also took place in other towns , including Egilsstadir and Akureyri .
Later Wednesday , the Social Democrats Reykjavik section held a meeting at which a recommendation was passed calling for the party to pull out of the coalition with Haarde 's Independence party .
Gunnar Helgi Kristinsson , a political scientist of the University of Iceland , is just one of the commentators predicting that the current coalition will not survive the coming weeks .
" I think it is more likely than not ( that the government will fall ) , " he stated .
" It could happen today , next week or the weekend at the end of the month , especially since the Independence Party convention will be held next weekend . "
Less than 48 hours later , Haarde called a May general election .
They were not constitutionally required until 2011 .
Haarde said that he would not be standing in the elections because of a recent diagnosis of a throat tumour , and that he had decided to stand down as leader of the Independence Party at its national congress in March .
The protests are being driven by a dramatic deepening of the social and economic crisis now confronting whole sections of the island 's population .
December figures revealed a massive jump in the number of those out of work , as the effects of the banking collapse continues to spread — up from 45 percent compared with November , reaching 4.6 percent of the workforce .
The new figures represent a seven - fold increase since the same period in 2007 .
The sharpest rise in unemployment is amongst young people and in Reykjavik , Iceland 's capital .
The difficulties facing the unemployed , as well as the population at large , are compounded by the continuing weakness of the Icelandic krona ( ISK ) which is currently trading at nearly 200 to the Euro .
For those living on savings or fixed incomes , such as unemployment benefits , there has been sharp rises in prices for imported commodities .
Even for those employed , the situation is dire .
A recent survey revealed that 62 percent of Icelanders held mortgages with interest linked to inflation , which remains high .
Added to this , 30 percent of respondents held loans in foreign currency , which have risen in price dramatically as the krona collapses in value .
Thirty percent of respondents added that they felt it " very likely " that they would have difficulty meeting their costs in the coming period , with the figure rising to 57 percent of those who are out of work .
The firm who conducted the poll , Capacent Gallup , stated in a press release , " Car loans in foreign currencies are common among higher earners , whereas the house loans in foreign currencies are more popular among students than those in full - time employment .
Payments on so called ‘ basket of foreign currencies ' loans have nearly doubled in a year due to the weakness of the krona . "
As the ruling elite has tried to extricate itself from the crisis in which it is implicated , the debate over beginning membership negotiations with the European Union has intensified .
On January 16 , the opposition Progressive Party voted to work towards EU membership .
EU membership is to be discussed at the Independence Party 's congress at the end of January .
While substantial sections of the political establishment have traditionally been hostile to EU membership , the scale of the economic crisis has forced many to change their minds .
The finance ministry has been compelled to vastly downgrade its estimates for economic performance in the coming years .
Its latest forecast sees a contraction of 9.6 percent of GDP for this year and 2010 .
Unemployment is predicted to reach 8.6 percent next year , although this figure may still be an underestimation .
A recent survey indicated that fully 70 percent of Icelandic companies were technically bankrupt , raising the possibility of an explosion in the unemployment rate .
The same survey put the rate of personal bankruptcies at 40 percent of the population .
It is under such circumstances that demands are growing for new elections , and the resignation of the central bank chief David Oddsson .
A petition demanding a complete change in government has been issued by the " movement for a New Republic in Iceland " .
The petition states in part , " We , the People of the Republic of Iceland in this period of economic turmoil and near national bankruptcy , declare to the International Monetary Fund , to the Central Banks of all our neighbouring countries and to their respective governments , that it is not in the interest of the people of Iceland that our current government receive loans from anyone . "
Blaming " corruption in government and severe mismanagement of economic and monetary policy " to the banking collapse , it states that funds should be withheld until a new government and " a new professional governance structure " has been achieved .
" Since the start of the kreppa [ the Icelandic term for financial crisis ] there have been no changes at all made in the make - up of the government ...
No one has resigned and no one has been fired .
They are hard at work at getting what little is left here back into the hands of those who crashed our economy to begin with , " commented one of the protesters .
But without addressing the fundamental source of the economic crisis in the private ownership and control of the financial system , a mere change in personnel will do nothing to resolve the social catastrophe .
Moreover , the IMF can hardly be held up as a counter - weight to the efforts of the Icelandic elite to extricate itself from the crisis at the expense of the population .
Under the terms of the $ 2.1 billion loan agreed between the IMF and the government , plans are being made to scale back pension payments and implement vast cuts in public spending on social services .
In a bid to placate its critics , the government had announced plans to move forward with its own investigation into the banking collapse .
The character of this investigation , however , is far from exhaustive , a fact demonstrated by the decision to appoint a local government official to head the probe .
Whereas a number of commentators have urged a team of international experts be sent to fully examine the banks and their dealings , there is a clear desire to restrict any investigation that takes place , lest it raise unwelcome questions about the role of the entire ruling establishment .
A HAMPSHIRE teenager who told “ outright lies ” and falsely claimed she had been raped has been locked up .
Charlotte Lane told police that she had been raped by a stranger at an unknown address in July last year .
In a police interview the 18 - year - old said she had felt “ tipsy ” after sharing three bottles of wine with friends in Southampton city centre .
She claimed that she decided to go on alone to another bar in the city centre to see a friend when she was accosted by a man in a taxi .
The teenager said she was then pulled from the car and taken to the side of a house where she claimed she was raped on a patio table .
After inquiries were made with the taxi driver police arrested a 19 - year - old man who said he had consensual sex with Lane .
Carl Anderson , prosecuting at Southampton Crown Court , said that as the police investigation progressed “ significant doubt ” emerged about Lane ’s version of events .
He said numerous witness statements , CCTV footage and mobile phone records all confirmed the account given by the initial suspect .
Lane , of Chadwick Road , Eastleigh , pleaded guilty to one charge of perverting the course of justice .
Alistair Wright , mitigating , said that Lane had a “ disturbed history ” growing up , including the death of her father in a road traffic accident .
He said that she made up the allegation as an “ expression of regret ” for having had sex with the man , failing to see that regret was not the same as a lack of consent .
He added : “ She ( Lane ) appears to recognise part of the impact on the community but not the levels of seriousness . ”
Judge Derwin Hope sent Lane , who has a previous conviction for battery , to a young offenders ’ institution for 20 weeks .
“ An enormous amount of police time was taken up with the police investigation while you persisted with the lies , ”
he said .
“ I am in no doubt that this matter is so serious only a custodial sentence will do . ”

DENVER  President Obama has not ruled out a second stimulus package , his press secretary , Robert Gibbs , said on Tuesday , just before Mr. Obama signed his $ 787 billion recovery package into law with a statement that it would “ set our economy on a firmer foundation . ”
The president said he would not pretend “ that today marks the end of our economic problems . ”
“ Nor does it constitute all of what we have to do to turn our economy around , ” Mr. Obama said at the signing ceremony in the Denver Museum of Nature and Science .
“ But today does mark the beginning of the end , the beginning of what we need to do to create jobs for Americans scrambling in the way of layoffs . ”
Mr. Gibbs , speaking to reporters aboard Air Force
One on the way to Denver , said , “ I think the president is going to do what ’s necessary to grow this economy . ”
While “ there are no particular plans at this point for a second stimulus package , ” he added , “ I would n’t foreclose it . ”
Mr. Obama began the first leg of a two - day trip , using the museum ceremony to spotlight the bill ’s clean - energy provisions .
The president will also visit Phoenix , where he will unveil his new housing plan on Wednesday .

8 Hooligan
How it 's Used :

What You 're Actually Saying :

Wait ,
What ?
The earliest use of the word " hooligan " dates back to British newspaper and police reports in the summer of 1898 .
They seem to have adapted the word from the Houlihan family , a group of Irish immigrants living in London .
The family became known for their hilarious drinking songs , jigs and their enthusiastic police brutality that tended to ensue ( to a word , " Irish - ness " ) .
But despite the beatdowns , the Houlihans continued to fight for their right to party , and did their motherland proud by forever associating their ethnic surname with stupid teenagers who like to play paintball on the interstate .
It was a typical Monday morning .
Traffic was n't moving and many morning travellers were handling this traffic jam the same as they had hundreds of times prior ; that is everyone except for Jenkins .
Her morning did n't start out so typical and little did she know when she woke up this particular morning she would be arrested and go through a psych evaluation all before noon .
It was a very cold morning so Jenkins went outside to warm up her car .
Her car was old and it took some time to heat up .
When she turned the ignition her hand slipped off the key and she hit the ' on ' button for the radio and broke it off .
To top it off the volume was the same button and now her radio was stuck in the ' on ' position with the volume just a little bit loud .
When the car was warm she started on her way , and to make the best of the loud music Jenkins decided to sing along with every song .
After a few miles she ran into a dead - stop traffic jam .
No worries for her as she was enjoying her Christmas music , drinking coffee and having a wonderful time .
Two hours passed .
Passengers in other cars later described the scene as frightening .
" The driver door opened at a normal speed " said the driver who was in the car parked behind Jenkins .
" She very normally exited the car and walked casually to the trunk .
I really though she was just going to get something out . "
Well get something out she did .
" She reached in the trunk and dragged out a huge sledge hammer .
She pulled it behind her , dragging the sledge portion on the ground with one hand .
She then leaned back and to the side and then that sledge hammer went right over her head and she began to smash her car ! "
Unable to turn off her radio because she accidently broke the knob off in the morning , Maryln Jenkins had an overload of Christmas music and she went a bit mental by destroying her car while parked in a traffic jam .
It was a typical Monday morning .

Her morning did n't start out so typical and little did she know when she woke up this particular morning she would be arrested and go through a psych evaluation all before noon .
" It was the music " said LT .
Swanson .
" She could n't take it anymore .
She tried and tried to turn the radio down or off " Swanson continued , " but there was nothing she could do .
When she ran out of coffee and still had n't moved she get very anxious and snapped .
It did n't help that she had to go to the bathroom .
It 's called Trafficcrazeanemia ( tra - fik - craze - a - knee - me-ah ) and recently was brought up in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) .
It can be very serious .
Everyone is lucky it was only the car that she attacked . "
Jenkins was detained and is currently in a holding cell .
Her car was totalled .
Trafficcrazeanemia with the right set of circumstances can afflict anyone .
There are signs that you can watch out for .
Dr. Zingerdim has been studying this for several years now , and although it 's not a perfect science he says the fist sign could be something as normal as a jittery knee or a nervous tick .
Becoming easily agitated as well as having the feeling that you are late for something are all signs .
Make sure you have no weapons or large objects in your car to minimize damage if you are overtaken by Trafficcrazeanemia .
Unfortunately all of the signs that Trafficcrazeanemia may be affecting you with are all the same signs that most people feel when in a traffic jam .
When Dr. Zingerman says the science is n't perfect we can rest assure that is the one thing that is true .

And so Wheeler 's thought experiment and the predictions of quantum mechanics were brought to the laboratory for testing . [ 2 ]
This is what happens .
" If what you say is true , " he said ( in effect ) , " then I may choose to know a property after the event should already have taken place . " [ 1 ]
Wheeler realized that in such a situation , the observer 's choice would determine the outcome of the experiment â€ “ regardless of whether the outcome should logically have been determined long ago .
J ohn Archibald Wheeler is one of those thinkers who takes the ideas of quantum mechanics seriously .
After studying the Copenhagen explanation of the double slit experiment â€ “ with its emphasis on what the observer knows and when it is known â€ “
Wheeler realized that the observer 's choice might control those variables in a test .
5 . If the screen is removed , we reveal two telescopes .
The telescopes are tightly focused on , watching , observing , just the narrow space of one slit only .
The left telescope watches the left slit ; the right telescope watches the right slit .
( The mechanism / metaphor of the telescope assures that if you are looking through the telescope , you will see a flash of light if the photon went either wholly or in part through the slit on which it is focused ; otherwise not .
Therefore , you will obtain " which - path " information about the photon hit . )
Or the screen can be left in place .
This is the experimenter 's choice , which is delayed until after the photon has passed the slits ( 2 ) in whatever manner it happens to do so .
The screen can be removed , as indicated by the dotted line .
It can be removed quickly , very quickly , after the photon has passed the double slits but before the photon reaches the plane of the screen .
That is , the screen can be removed while the photon is in transit in region 3 .
4 . First , we have a screen ( or other detection system that can measure the horizontal placement of a photon hit , but is not able to distinguish where the photon came from ) .
2. Photon passes through double slit unobserved , logically either through one , through the other , or through both .
To obtain an interference pattern , we surmise that something must pass through both slits ; to obtain a particle distribution , we surmise that the photon must pass through one or the other .
Whatever the photon does , it presumably does it now when it passes through the slits .
New research from the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has found that drugs prescribed to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) can cause hallucinations in children , even when taken as directed .
Children have hallucinated worms , bugs or snakes crawling on them while under the influence of this prescribed medication .
[ social_buttons ]
49 clinical studies were conducted by drug makers , and the results showed they can cause psychosis and mania in some patients , even those without obvious risk factors .
The following ADHD drugs were studied : Novartis AG ’s Ritalin and Focalin XR , Shire Plc ’s Adderall XR and Daytrana patch , Johnson & Johnson ’s Concerta , Eli Lilly and Co ’s Strattera and Celltech Pharmaceuticals Inc ’s Metadate CD .
Dr. Andrew Mosholder and colleagues wrote in Pediatrics about these possible side effects :
Patients and physicians should be aware of the possibility that psychiatric symptoms consistent with psychosis or mania .
As a parent , I am would seek alternative treatments if I had a child with ADHD , such as removing food coloring and additives from their diet .
Since I am not such a parent , of course I ca n’t speak first hand about the neccessity of such medication , but the research is cause for alarm , especially since the drugmakers themselves have found these results .
I am always amazed that the FDA relies on drug companies to conduct their own research .
There is certainly a conflict of interest there , so when they actually do find harmful side effects , it should be taken seriously .

Apple is famous for either inventing , or popularising , innovative technology .
The mouse , the trackpad , LCD monitors , Firewire , USB , unibody aluminium laptops ... the list is long .
Apple is also famous for summarily deleting tech when it decides it 's time to move on , causing hand - wringing and cursing from the most effected users .
This anger dissipates and eventually disappears as users come to realise Apple was right , and they 're better off with whatever the replacement tech was .
Mind you , sometimes Apple was ' right ' simply because you wanted to stay with Apple , so there was no feasible alternative when you wanted a newer , faster computer .

There were terrible grumbles when new Macs first appeared without floppy drives .
My very first Mac ( this was n't all that long after computers used cassette tapes as storage ! ) did n't even have a hard drive .
If you wanted to use software other than the floppy - based operating system , you had to swap the system floppy and the software floppy in and out repeatedly in a crazy and frustrating shuffle .
But floppies became cheap and cheerful portable file storage when hard drives became more widespread , and many companies and individuals had cases and cases of them , all filed away .
At first Mac floppies held about 400 KB of data ( 1984 ) and then , a couple of years later , the double - sided drive allowed 800 KB disks to be used .
The 1.4M SuperDrive arrived in 1988 .
The story goes that if you typed out Tolstoy 's epic novel War and Peace in Microsoft Word , the resulting file would be about a megabyte - so it was n't until 1988 that you could fit War and Peace on a floppy , and on a Mac .
One thousand and twenty four torpid Russian novels - I mean megabytes - makes up a gigabyte .
The pitiful storage available on a floppy seems crazy now with the proliferation of gigabyte drives ; before too long it will be Terabytes ( a Terabyte is 1021 gig ) that we measure everything in .
Anyway , when the very first iMac appeared in 1998 , gone was the floppy drive .
This was the G3 ' Bondi ' all - in - one with the CRT .
And that was n't all .
Steve Jobs ' designers also deleted the SCSI interface most commonly used to connect scanners ( but hid one cunningly inside the box itself ) .
Also gone were the ADB ports ( for keyboards and mice ) and serial ports .
All to save space and to move things along .
With the introduction of the USB ( Universal Serial Bus ) in the iMac , the ADB and Serial ports at least had been replaced .
But the floppy drive ?
Nope .
You could buy one as an external USB unit , and many did .
But this was the era of Jaz and Zip disc , and CDs that had become a lot cheaper ( at first , although CDs held about 450 times more than floppy discs , they had cost $ 25 each .
You 'd go off to the shop and buy ... one . )
Anyway , Apple knew best , although it seemed to be several years before PCs also deleted their floppy drives .
In fact , even the most vocal of Mac moaners on the floppy disc deletion subject probably found themselves looking at PC users ' floppies a couple of years later and saying , pointedly , " What 's that thing ?
Oh , right , I remember those ... "
Nostalgia trippers and the inveterately curious can read more about Apple 's floppy drives at this SoCal site .
Apart from mucking about and seemingly redesigning display connectors nearly every year - mostly , from what I can tell , to make them smaller and more convenient - what 's Apple going to delete next ?
The answer 's pretty clear : optical drives .
It 's already missing from the MacBook Air laptop , being one of the primary reasons for the Air 's sleek and svelte form .
" How on earth could you delete the optical drive ? " People ask .
Apple is counting on the increasing use of wireless to move huge chunks of data around .
After all , wireless ' n ' is built into every Mac , and Apple has even teamed a big backup hard drive with a powerful wireless base station in the Time Capsule to back up entire hard drives over the atmosphere .
But how do you install CD and DVD borne software ?
Cleverly , a MacBook Air can use the optical drive in a wirelessly - connected Mac to install that software .
But there 's the rub - you still need a Mac with an optical drive in your network , so it 's not exactly redundant .
Yet .
What about playing DVD movies ?
Simple - download a rented or bought movie from the iTunes Store , no optical drive required .
But does that mean new iMacs may not have optical drives ?
Possibly .
Think about it - the latest and previous iMac was a radical design , an all - in - one upright white polycarbonate or aluminium tablet that housed everything - monitor , hard drive , CPU , video card , RAM , optical drive .
Take out the optical drive and you 've already saved yourself a lot of space , heat generation , moving mechanical parts - and you 've cut down the electrical power requirement .
Delete the hard drive as well , replacing it with solid state Flash - style tech , and what do you have ?
A lot more design freedom , that 's what .
All eyes on the Macworld conference , then .
San Francisco , January 5th .
This article originally appeared on the New Zealand Herald - http://blogs.nzherald.co.nz
While you are absorbing the fundamentals of passive solar design , you might also be itching to put some of you new found knowledge into action to realize lower energy bills , help a son / daughter with a school science project , or simply have a winter project to occupy you enough to keep you out of the Mayberry jail .
With that in mind , the first project we will look at is one that has applicability across a wide range of homes , whether owned or rented .
And if you move , you can take it with you .
You can even configure it as a solar dehydrator for your garden and fruit tree produce .
And once you gather the materials , you should be able to put it together in a couple of hours .
Before you jump on this fun project , though , make sure that your home 's significant infiltration points have been sealed .
On a windy day , pass a small candle ( or punk or even incense stick ) around all of the penetrations in the house shell , such as the windows , doors , foundation sill , wall joints , fireplace , even electrical outlets .
Whenever you see the flame / smoke shift , you 've found a leak .
Discovering leaks on the downwind side of the house requires more careful attention , but is still very important .
Warm humid house air that works through infiltration points in walls can lead to condensation in the cooler insulation , lowering the insulating value of the wall and leading to mold problems .
There are many ways to seal infiltration points , including tube caulk , string caulk , weatherstripping , expanding spray foam , and others .
We 'll cover this in more detail in a future article , but make sure you seal the major leaks first .
Once you 've done this , and have reasonable amounts of insulation , let 's jump into the project .
This project is about solar windowbox heaters , which you can insert into a equatorial - facing windows to collect solar energy in the form of heated air that is thermosiphoned into the interior .
I built one of these in the early 1980's ( live in a passive solar house now ) using primarily scrap materials ; one side of a sliding door set ( a 6 ' x 3 ' dual pane door ) , salvaged lumber , and cardboard for insulation .
It went together in an afternoon , and was pumping warm air into my parents house the next day .
Let 's look at one from Richard Komp 's Maine Solar Primer , found on BuildItSolar.com ( click to enlarge ) ;
Used windows can normally be easily found , just look for them ( window replacement companies , for example ) ; if you can get more than 1 , consider making more than one windowbox .
The interface between the windowbox and the window frame it is inserted into must be carefully sized and well - sealed ( weatherstripping , etc ) to prevent infiltration leaks .
Use good exterior caulk ( silicon ) or other infiltration seal between all exterior lumber joints
A short drape of modestly stiff material can be fashioned to the intake to draw the cooler air from floor level .
A heavy window like a sliding glass door must have ground support of some kind ( e.g. , staked supports or resting on the ground )
A good rule of thumb is to design for a tilt of latitude plus 15 degrees ( e.g. , at 39 ºN , the tilt should be 54 º ) , though make sure to take ground height into consideration .
Using a felt or similar weather stripping between the collector window and the window box frame makes it easier ( less messy ) to take the window out if needed .
If you do n't want to drill through the window frame to secure it to the window box frame , dimension the frame so that the window fits down inside it on a 1 " x1 " ( 2 cm x 2 cm ) lip for a gravity ' fit ' with a strap or similar restraining device .
Careful not to get a ' heat mirror ' window that has a low SHGC ; these reject most of the sun 's energy .
Plain glass would be better .
Strengthen the dogleg joint with a decking joint brace or similar .
While rigid insulation will work , I used layers of cardboard as an insulator on the insides of the lumber pieces , and between the cool plenum and hot plenum .
If you plan to use it for a solar dehydrator as well , design that aspect at the same time .
Some people build tilt - adjustable frame with wheels on the larger size dual - purpose window boxes .
Paint it to blend in with the color scheme of your house , in order to enhance its aesthetic appeal
If you are in a Homeowner 's Association , or other restrictive covenant , find out if you are allowed to do this first .
It 's often better to work with the system and get an amendment to the bylaws that allows " solar collectors and passive solar improvements " than to fight a hostile architectural committee that is miffed you did n't at least ask first .
Note that the thermosiphon effect stops when solar insolation drops in the evening .
The air left in the windowbox cools , but does not enter the house , as there is no reverse thermosiphon effect with this configuration .
We 'll be looking for comments from those who need more information , or those who put them together and can share their experiences .
There can be any number of variations and substitutions ; indeed , other plans exist at Mother Earth News and J.R. Whipple .
These are a few lessons I learned when building mine :
( CNN ) -- Climate - driven environmental changes could drastically affect the distribution of more than 1,000 species of commercial fish and shellfish around the world , scientists say .
Red areas on this map show regions that are expected to have the greatest increase in fish populations by 2050 .
For the first time , researchers using computer models have been able to predict the effect that warming oceans , fed by greenhouse - gas emissions , could have on marine biodiversity on a global scale .
A new study predicts that by 2050 , large numbers of marine species will migrate from tropical seas toward cooler waters -- specifically the Arctic and Southern Ocean -- at an average rate of 40 to 45 kilometers ( about 25 to 28 miles ) per decade .
These migrations could lead to " numerous extinctions " of marine species outside the Arctic and Antarctic , especially in tropical waters , according to the study 's projections .
" These are major impacts that we are going to see within our lifetime and our children 's lifetime , " said William Cheung , lead author of the study , set to be published this week in the journal Fish and Fisheries .
" Climate change provides us with a kick in the pants , " added Cheung , a marine biologist and lecturer at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom .
" We can't think about climate change and biodiversity without thinking about the impact it will have on people . "
Researchers from the University of East Anglia , Princeton University and the Sea Around Us Project at the University of British Columbia participated in the study .
Using a combination of data from fisheries and computer models that can project the potential effects of climate change on biodiversity , researchers were able to make predictions on the migration patterns of different fish species under varying climate - change scenarios .
The study predicts that within 41 years , the global distribution of marine species will shift 60 percent as more fish move toward cooler waters near the Earth 's poles .
" Even if we completely stop fishing , we will still see a big difference in 10 years , " said Emily Pidgeon , senior technical adviser with the Regional Marine Strategies Department at Conservation International .
The study suggests that conservationists will have to adapt their approach to a shifting marine environment .
Added Pidgeon , " The goal posts are changing , so we need to re-think and re-tool the way we look at fishery management . "
The migration patterns outlined in the study would further diminish the coastal population of the Atlantic cod , a once - plentiful fish that was a staple of American and European diets for centuries .
According to the study , the worldwide population of cod could be cut in half by 2050 .
" Cod disappearing from New England is not new , it has been a trend for the last 15 years , said Mark Kurlansky , author of the book " Cod : A Biography of the Fish that Changed the World . "
" It 's interesting to see that there is something else besides overfishing that is causing a decline . "
The migration of certain fish species out of their natural habitats could cause food shortages for millions of people , especially in developing countries near the equator , who depend on local seafood as a staple of their diet , scientists say .
" Catch will decline in countries along the tropics like Malaysia where the conditions are too hot , and high - latitude countries like Russian and Norway will win , " said Daniel Pauly , director of the Fisheries Centre at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , Canada .
The migrations could have economic and political implications if fish eventually drift across boundaries into waters controlled by neighboring countries , he said .
" If you have fruit trees in your garden , and all of a sudden they move to your neighbor 's garden , you can't do anything about it , " Pauly said .
The study 's authors wrote that they hope their findings " give policy makers , the scientific community and [ the ] public a picture of the potential scale of the problem . "
They cautioned , however , that because of the complexity and scale of the issue and the computer modeling used to study it , " the magnitude of our projections is uncertain . "
Cheung and other authors of the study were expected to discuss their findings this week at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago , Illinois .

The tantalising ideal of a world entirely free of nukes is hoving back into view .
It ’s a goal that disciplines minds , even if you never quite attain it
Rex Features
A WORLD without nuclear weapons is a vision as old as the nuclear age .
The makers of the bombs that exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 fretted a lot about the ultimate consequences for mankind of their devilish ingenuity .
Now anti-nuclear campaigners are hoping that “ Yes , we can ! ” will do more for their cause than older slogans like “ Ban the bomb ! ” ever did .
For on the stump , Barack Obama , America 's president - elect , promised to make the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide a “ central element ” of America 's nuclear policy .
He will not be the first American president to dream of nuclear disarmament ; that unlikely peacenik Ronald Reagan did so too in his day , to the consternation of allies at home and abroad .
The reality , in any event , is not one that America can will on its own .
Yet Mr Obama has tapped into a new seam of dissatisfaction with the world 's nuclear order .
Might getting to zero soon be a less forlorn prospect ?
The latest nuclear - free buzz around the globe takes in more than the usual anti-nuclear suspects .
The five officially recognised nuclear powers — America , Russia , Britain , France and China — are all feeling the pressure .
So they should .
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) that came into force in 1970 commits them to good - faith negotiations on “ effective measures ” to end the nuclear - arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament as part of a process of “ general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ” .
That was their part of a bargain that now has 184 other governments signed up not to build bombs of their own .
Nuclear numbers have tumbled since the end of the Soviet - American arms race , but they are far from zero .
The nuclear - weapons powers are being pressed to do more ahead of a five - yearly review of the NPT 's workings , in 2010 .
The last such gathering ended in a punch - up .
Another ill - tempered diplomatic brawl would further harm the treaty , which is taking a battering all round .
Iran and North Korea , as well as others , have bent or broken its anti-nuclear rules .
India , Pakistan and Israel built weapons outside the treaty and reject its constraints .
The fear is that , should others follow , the risk of miscalculation between growing numbers of different players will make the era of mutual assured destruction , or MAD — the threat of mutual annihilation that kept a scary peace between America and the Soviet Union during the cold war — look like a golden age of sanity .
Meanwhile , as more governments from Africa to Latin America look to nuclear power as the answer to meet growing energy demand , potentially dangerous nuclear materials will end up spreading ever more widely .
Without stricter controls and tougher inspections , the technologies for enriching uranium and extracting plutonium that can be used to help keep the lights on could also be abused for weapons - making .
Moreover , as the barriers to entry in the bomb - making business keep falling , there are fears that terrorists will find it easier to get their hands on a bomb , or other dangerous material .
Despite this , anger that the five still cling to their bombs has made some non-nuclear states dig in their heels against seemingly sensible new ideas , such as an international nuclear - fuel bank that could help stem new proliferation dangers .
They see restrictions on their nuclear freedom as another form of nuclear apartheid .
Enter four prominent American elder statesmen , George Shultz , William Perry , Henry Kissinger and Sam Nunn , dubbed the “ four horsemen of the apocalypse ” .
Last year ( and again this ) they argued in the Wall Street Journal for America to take the lead in pushing towards a nuclear - free world .
The steps they proposed were not new : further weapons cuts , making safer those that remain , ratifying the Comprehensive Test - Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) , halting production of fissile material for use in weapons and securing all nuclear materials around the globe .
Nor , if all were taken , would they get the world to zero .
But by holding up a nuclear - free vision , they gave political cover to a renewed debate about whether nuclear weapons , credited with keeping peace between the big powers after the 20th century 's two world wars , are now part of the problem .
Now everybody wants a plan
These days no self - respecting think - tank , it seems , can be without a report on nuclear disarmament .
Japan and Australia , sponsors of rival grand commissions when a potential nuclear - free window opened at the cold war 's end , have joined forces to set up a new one .
Yet the document likely to be most thumbed through for clues about the world 's nuclear future will be the American Defence Department 's next nuclear - posture review , due in early 2009 .
Already the tug - of - war is under way among Mr Obama 's would - be advisers over the principles that should shape it .
In a recent Foreign Affairs article , Ivo Daalder and Jan Lodal argued for four urgent steps : a declaration that America 's nuclear weapons have no other purpose than to deter the use of such weapons by others ; a unilateral American reduction to no more than 1,000 warheads ( including reserves ) , as a step towards zero ; work on an “ airtight ” verification system ; and a vigorous diplomatic effort to convince the world of the logic of nuclear zero .
Parts of this sound more like creed than policy .
Some people fear that if you push hard for abolition as an end in itself , the effect could be destabilising in a world that , despite vociferous disarmament demands from Brazil , Egypt , Indonesia , Ireland , South Africa and so on , still relies on America 's extended nuclear umbrella for much of its security .
Some suggest using the ultimate goal of total elimination just as a framework for a whole series of steps that could in time ensure greater security , with much reduced nuclear numbers .
There is wide agreement now that convincing others of the five 's commitment to their NPT promises requires movement on several fronts .
These include deeper weapons cuts ; more effort to bring into force a test ban and negotiate a long - awaited fissile - material cut - off treaty ; efforts not only to devalue nuclear weapons as a currency of power and but also to tackle the regional insecurities that drive nuclear competition ; and work on globally applicable verification techniques and enforcement mechanisms that would give both nuclear and non-nuclear states the assurance ( even long before zero is in sight ) that weapons , once dismantled , stay that way , and that cheats can be dealt with .
Of these , cutting weapons numbers is both easiest and symbolically most eye - catching .
American and Russian stockpiles are anyway set to drop further .
By 2012 they will be down to the 1,700 - 2,200 deployed warheads apiece agreed six years ago in the Moscow Treaty .
America has also been pruning the weapons held in reserve for spares : its nuclear arsenal will by 2012 be less than a quarter its size at the end of the cold war .
A cut to a round 1,000 would inconvenience neither side .
But how to go about it ?
George Bush was hammered for preferring unilateral cuts and so agreed to a treaty with Russia .
Setting 1,000 as a target , give or take weapons in reserve , while offering to negotiate along these lines would reassure all round ( as would the binding new verification rules Mr Obama is expected to seek before existing ones run out next year ) .
Cash - strapped Russia always worries that unilateral American cuts can easily be reversed .
But after the Georgia crisis , many of America 's friends would like to see Russia held to tight treaty limits too .
Expect anxieties from the Baltic states to Turkey , if Mr Obama acts early on to remove America 's last few tactical nuclear weapons from Europe ( where Russia has many more ) .
Yet the problem for zero - boosters is that the lower you go , the trickier things get , argues Henry Sokolski of the Washington - based Non-proliferation Policy Education Centre .
Crises may prove harder to manage when the nuclear gap between America and Russia and other potential contenders is not thousands , but hundreds .
One answer could be to widen arms - control talks to include China , Britain and France too .
But neither China nor France has ever signalled interest .
And what about India , Pakistan and Israel ?
As for more global treaty commitments , Mr Obama is expected to try to get Congress to ratify the test - ban ( it refused in 1999 ) .
That could prod others , like China , to do likewise .
He has also said he will not authorise the building of new nuclear weapons .
That is music to disarmers ' ears .
But there may eventually have to be a trade - off : ending testing in return for building some simpler , safer warheads ( based on a previously tested design ) .
The upside is that modernisation could enable America to make far deeper cuts than does tinkering with old warheads in today 's stockpile .
Anyway , Britain , France , Russia and China are modernising their weapons ( only China is enlarging its arsenal , albeit from a low base ) .
The downside is that others will cry foul .
The going for a fissile - material cut - off treaty at the log- jammed Conference on Disarmament could be harder still .
Long blocked by China , the last try was stymied by Pakistan and Iran .
Clever diplomats are paid to find ways round such obstacles — but it will take ingenuity of an untried sort to navigate the minefield between today 's world and one of very low nuclear numbers or none .
One roadblock after another
A recent Adelphi Paper from the London - based International Institute for Strategic Studies explores just some of the technical and political obstacles .
What would be acceptable standards of verification when controls can never in fact be “ airtight ” and weapons - making knowledge still has to be protected ?
What are the trade - offs between imperfect verification and enforcement , since the UN Security Council seems unable to agree on enforcing its resolutions on Iran or North Korea ?
What might a residual deterrence capability against cheats look like ?
How might conventional military imbalances be managed in a nuclear - free world , without cascading back towards the carnage that blighted the first half of the 20th century ?
The British government has taken a lead , co-operating with the Norwegians to explore techniques for verifying warhead dismantlement without giving nuclear secrets away .
But this is the merest tip of the technical work needed to track and secure the world 's dangerous nuclear materials .
A British suggestion that the nuclear laboratories of the five might co-operate to find solutions has been handled by the others as gingerly as they might a bomb .
Nuclear weapons will be around for a long time .
But thinking zero at least forces governments to see them in a new way .
Maybe that is it ?

Sean and the big Shaq - tus .
To all twitterers , if u c me n public come say hi , we r not the same we r from twitteronia , we connect
Diesel , 5 n diner has great chili and milkshakes but i know you 're on a diet so you had a salad !!
Twitter accounts for :
Sean
and
Jesse .
Feel free to follow us .
Sean informed me a few days ago that he had been following " The Real Shaq " on twitter .
"
You realize that ' The Real Shaq ' is probably a 5 ' 4
White , 14 year old emo kid who 's getting his jolly 's from the attention , right ? "
I asked him .
" I do n't know .
I think it 's really him " Today Sean and I were discussing rumored trade situations over IM , and the possibility of Shaq being traded to Cleveland .
" Well , I just got a twitter from The Real Shaq , and he's at 5 & Diner right now , " Sean informed me .
" Let 's go then " I said , assuming that I 'd finally put this " Real Shaq " crap to rest .
Twenty minutes later we were pulling up to the restaurant and looking for the big black truck that he 's rumored to drive around town .
" Maybe that 's it " Sean said , pointing at an older , but nice Van and laughing .
As we pulled up I saw the Superman symbol on the grill .
We went in , and to my surprise the MDE ( Most Dominant Ever ) was sitting in the corner booth by himself .
We gave the man a nod and " Hey " as we walked to our table and were soon whispering back and forth like 12 year old girls at the 7th grade dance .
" You go talk to him " I said , while tugging nervously on my dress .
" No , you go talk to him " Sean replied while flipping his hair .
We placed our order , and spent 10 minutes trying to work up the sack to go say something .
" Should I tell him I 'm glad he 's sticking around ? "
" Go tell him you 're his twitter buddy " " Should I ask for a picture ?
" Given another 2 - 3 years , I 'm sure we would have worked up the nerve to go talk to him , but before that could happen Sean 's iPhone buzzed with a " tweet " from Shaq .
" Hey " Sean said , with a slight bit of confidence .
Returning to our hushed whispers I asked Sean , " Should we go talk to him now ? "
" I do n't know , should we ? " " Yes , you should " a very deep voice entered our conversation from 2 booths over .
We quickly hopped up and rushed over like like two eight year olds who had just heard the ice cream truck pass by .
" I know it 's dorky man , but can I get a pic with you ? "
I asked , slightly intimidated .
" Of course " he said , " Pull up a seat "
The behemoth slid over and patted the booth next to him .
As I pulled out my phone to take a picture he snatched it out of my hand and inspected it .
" What 's this got ?
Windows Mobile ? " " Um ... yeah
" He gave it the once over before handing it back and showing off his Google Phone .
We talked for a bit , and snapped a photo for both Sean and me before shaking hands and returning to our table .
I almost got the feeling he wanted us to hang out , but we did n't really want to push our luck .
" Make sure you put that on your web page " he said as we walked away .
After he'd left , our young waiter came over .
We asked if Shaq had actually eaten anything since his table was empty when we 'd gone over .
" He ordered like 20 dollars worth of food " the kid stammered out , obviously thrilled to be talking about it , " And he left me a 160 dollar tip .
Then he asked for a Sprite and gave me forty bucks for it .
" We got back to the office , and saw that Shaq 's last twitter was basically calling us a bunch of panzies :
Not to be outdone " The Real Nash " wrote :
This time nothing was left to chance .
As he walked between the stands of farming produce yesterday , admired the prize bulls , stroked the noses of calves , nibbled a stick of cheese , Nicolas Sarkozy was followed not just by his minister of agriculture and security detail but by a group of well co-ordinated fans bellowing support .
" Nicolas , Nicolas , " they shouted as the diminutive president forged ahead through a chaos of outstretched hands , moustaches and oversized animals .
The care taken by the presidential staff to ensure an incident - free visit to the annual Farm Fair in southern Paris was due to more than a well - known preference for bling over bovines .
Last year the fair saw one of Sarkozy 's worst gaffes when he was filmed by an amateur telling a heckler : " Casse - toi , pauvre con " ( roughly " get lost , loser " ) .
Farmers are as anxious and angry as everyone else in the country and such a confrontation , eminently likely , could not be risked again .
Already the hyperactive French president 's poll ratings , 36 % , are at their lowest since he was elected nearly two years ago .
" Sarkozy is playing with fire ... Can he prevent the explosion ? "
L'Express magazine is asking on its front cover this weekend .
Last week that explosion almost came .
The country 's worst violence since the riots of 2005 saw youths burning cars and charging police night after night .
This time the riots were not in the rundown estates that surround many French cities but in the poverty - stricken alleys of Pointe - à - Pitre , on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe , where per capita income is half that of mainland France and the unemployment rate three times higher .
The violence resonated with a tense and angry public in France itself .
The 430,000 people of Guadeloupe are theoretically citizens of the republic like those of Lille , Lyon or Paris and , though many of the roots of the protests lie deep in the colonial past , the slogans and demands of the rioters were very contemporary , focusing on pouvoir d'achat , the famous lack of buying power in the face of high prices and stagnant wages that is the main grievance of all the French .
" Looking at Guadeloupe is like looking at France through a distorting magnifying glass , " said Frédéric Dabi , public opinion specialist at pollsters Ifop .
" There are things that are specific to Guadeloupe , and there is a sea between over there and France , but there are all the ingredients everywhere for a wave of social panic . "
In an Ifop poll for regional newspaper Sud-Ouest last week , 63 % of respondents thought similar violence could soon take place on the mainland - a view shared by their leaders .
All eyes are now on the general strike planned for next month .
An earlier strike and mass demonstration in January was widely supported and seen as a major shot across the bows of the rightwing Sarkozy .
Though trouble in the universities remains limited - French police on Friday removed students who briefly occupied the Sorbonne as part of a long - running dispute over the president 's reform plans and perceived contempt for academics - it is nonetheless seen as " warning signs before the storm " , according to one French parliamentarian .
In the face of recent protests in schools , ministers backed down from major reforms .
" There 's the feeling that Sarkozy has a bit too much on his plate , " said Jean - Baptiste Prévost , president of France 's biggest student union .
For Denis Muzet , a media and public opinion analyst in Paris , all Sarkozy 's talk of " reform " , the very slogans that got him elected , now scares people .
" Even in September , when he spoke of accelerating reforms , it was only the left who worried .
When he says it now , everyone is worried , " said Muzet .
An indication of the tense atmosphere came when Sarkozy 's closest friend said that anyone who did n't own a Rolex watch by the age of 50 was " a failure " .
The remark , by millionaire advertising tycoon Jacques Séguéla , caused outrage .
One French news website called it " obscene " , adding it they would like to shove Séguéla 's Rolex down his throat .
The daily France - Soir said that " in a global financial crisis [ where ] people are struggling to make ends meet ... most workers will find this highly offensive " .
This weekend a fragile calm had been restored to Guadeloupe , the Caribbean island system that was annexed to the kingdom of France in 1674 .
Last week saw the fatal shooting of a union official in rioting and street battles so bad that 260 specialist police had to be flown in from France to flood the island with forces of order , in the words of the French minister of the interior .
Tourists at the many luxury hotels that support the otherwise moribund economy in Guadeloupe fled and flights were cancelled when the airport was temporarily shut .
Despite Sarkozy 's offer last week of measures worth € 580 m ( £ 510 m ) to help France 's overseas regions , including aid to poor families , relief from social security contributions and price controls , there was still discontent among the protesters , who have organised a general strike that has now lasted for nearly a month .
" There is nothing new in Nicolas Sarkozy 's announcement .
It 's still far from what we are demanding , which is a € 200 salary increase , " said Elie Domota , the leader of Guadeloupe 's mass protest movement , Liyannaj Kont Pwofitasyon ( Stand Up Against Exploitation ) .
Negotiations between employers and the LKP , a coalition of unions and leftwing groups , were restarted on Friday but have been put on hold over the weekend .
The sticking point is salaries , with bosses speaking of possible increases of between €35 and € 120 , depending on the sector .
The unrest has highlighted tensions reaching back to the colonial past of Guadeloupe , one of four overseas regions that are , as part of France , part also of the European Union .
" The economy has kept the hierarchy of the 19th century , with all its flaws and injustices , " said Nelly Schmidt , author and historian at the National Centre of Scientific Research .
" There is a profound lack of understanding in France of its former Caribbean colonies .
We know about the beaches , the palm trees and the rum and that 's about it . "
There is deep resentment of the economically powerful minority of béké , or white , families , often descendants of the slave - era colonists .
After being abolished by revolutionary forces , slavery was bloodily reinstituted by Napoleon and only finally abolished in 1848 .
" Guadeloupe has had a particularly bitter history of relations with the mainland , " said Marc Semo , foreign editor of Libération newspaper .
" That history has bred a tough and uncompromising claims culture . "
Now the strike has spread to neighbouring Martinique and protests have broken out in French Guyana and the Indian Ocean island of Réunion .
But it is the concern that the disruption on Guadeloupe might spread to the mainland that forced Sarkozy to act last week , meeting MPs from the dependencies and broadcasting a television address .
The latter was carefully timed to go out - on specialist channels for the overseas territories - after the main evening news bulletins on domestic TV had been broadcast .
For the French government fears pressure to extend any pay increase deal in Guadeloupe to mainland France .
Last week , as Sarkozy met senior national union leaders in a social mini-summit , senior figures from the French hard left , such as the self - styled peasant leader José Bové , and the postman head of a popular new French Communist party , Olivier Besancenot , travelled to Guadeloupe .
" Their fight is our fight - against capitalism , exploitation , the big supermarkets who make so much profit from us , " said Anne Bronnec , 32 , a shopworker handing out leaflets in the Bastille district of Paris .
Many analysts speak of a loss of direction at the highest levels of the French state .
For Dabi , the pollster , Sarkozy is suffering the same fate as other European leaders who are trying to convince disoriented populations that they have an answer to the financial crisis .
" There is a sense of incoherence and a sense that Sarkozy does not really know where he is taking France .
But that 's largely because there is an incoherence and Sarkozy does n't know where he is taking France , " Dabi said .
Last week Sarkozy unveiled proposals for tax breaks and social benefits he said were worth up to € 2.65 bn ( £ 2.3 bn ) but ruled out raising the minimum wage or reversing key reforms such as plans to cut thousands of public sector posts .
" We will beat the crisis through modernising France , " the president said in a 10 - minute televised speech .
However , massive aid for ailing car manufacturers has already been agreed .
The nightmare scenario is that of 1995 , when massive industrial action blocked the country for three weeks .
The strikes at that time were led by the public sector , while this time it is the private sector that is most at risk from the looming recession .
" The public sector can shut down the country , but the private sector can't , " said Philippe Waechter , an economist with Nataxis Asset Management .
Equally , according to Dabi , Sarkozy has little to worry about from the left .
" There are very few alternatives to Sarkozy right now .
Besancenot is doing well with a message that attacks capitalism , neo-liberal economics , the rich and so on , but that 's not going to cause too many problems for the president .
His core support among traditional rightwing voters remains high . "
For media analyst Muzet , there are two sides to the crisis : the pessimism and the worry , but also " the feeling that something is being born " , a new solidarity and consciousness of the suffering of others , " in Guadeloupe today , elsewhere tomorrow " .
France - whether Pointe - à - Pitre or Paris - is more divided than ever .
France in crisis
• France 's economy shrank by 1.2 % in the fourth quarter of last year , its sharpest decline since at least the 1970s .
• Unemployment , at 7.7 % in the third quarter , is expected to soar to 9.8 % this year .
• Widespread disruption is predicted .
In a poll published yesterday in Le Figaro , 61 % of those asked said that they expected massive strikes and social problems in the coming months , and 36 % said they would welcome strikes " on a huge scale " .
• " The French have huge expectations of their politicians but are not convinced [ they are taking ] measures which will alter the situation in any way at all , " said Bruno Jeanbart , of pollsters OpinionWay .
• France 's debt - to - GDP level is already set to leap to 70 % this year , against a target of 66 % .
• The European commission has started procedures against six European Union members , including France , for exceeding the EU 's deficit - to - GDP limit of 3 % .
• President Sarkozy 's statement that French car - makers receiving state aid should keep production in France has alarmed other European leaders , who see it as a move towards protectionism .
• French companies ' business confidence index hit a record low point in February , according to a survey from national statistics office Insee .
• Sarkozy 's approval rating has plummeted to 36 % , the lowest level of his presidency so far .
The ' He 's Just Not That into You ' actress , Scarlet Johansson , says shes completely baffled by the fact that men have nipples .
She quoted in Chicago Sun Times ,
The one thing I do n't understand about men is nipples .
I do n't know if there is one aspect of men that I do n't understand other than why they have nipples .
Honestly , why ?
I guess it has something to do with the X chromosome .
What is the function of the male nipple ?
Maybe we all start as androgynous creatures and then they become men ?
Scarlett , 24 , still reveals she is crazy for her husband Ryan Reynolds , who she married in a secret ceremony last September , despite admitting confusing aspect of the male anatomy , saying I am really in love with love .
I 'm a lover not a fighter .
I 'm a real lover .
The last year has been a year for the record books .
With the US credit crisis dominating headlines for nearly 24 months straight , a global slowdown has caused a whole slew of smaller disasters from crumbling currencies to governmental bailouts .
As we end the year chock full of pessimistic memories , investors can only hope that 2009 will be a deserved rest from a tumultuous 2008 .
1. Iceland Economic Failure
A model example for historians and economists for years to come , the economy of Iceland fell into economic depression as a result of financial sector failure .
As a result , the local currency , the krona , collapsed by almost 40 percent as traders sold the currency against the euro over the span of a few days .
The instability led UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown in threatening legal action against the country ’s banks as their actions were deemed “ totally unacceptable and illegal ” .
Economic failure of Iceland left the world stunned .
How did Iceland fail ?:
BusinessWeek starts by blaming the banks and mounting international debt
One economist blames poor economic policies and bad inflation targets was a start
Wall Street Journal sees Iceland as having taken too much risk for such a small nation
NY Times tries to figure out how a country like Iceland can go bankrupt
2. Citigroup Shares Pummeled
In 2008 , financial shares were completely beaten down by the market as risk remained too high to hold these stocks .
One unlucky firm was Citigroup , the bank lost almost 80 percent of its price in a matter of weeks .
With no short term recovery in site , the government had no choice but to step in and save the failing bank to the tune of a $ 306 billion guarantee .
What do people think of the Citi bailout ?
New Yorkers are furious about the bailout and find it to be wasteful
President Bush says that there will be as many bailouts as it takes
Christian Science Monitor says the Citigroup bailout is n’t enough
3. Crumbling Ruble
A flight to safety helped the US dollar gain against the Russian ruble , bringing the currency down to approximately 11 percent from its summer high .
With all the hoopla surrounding risky assets , investors sought safe haven greenbacks as the revisit of the 1998 devaluation loomed heavy .
Follow the fallout :
November : Russia ’s inability to stop a freefall is becoming more apparant
December : Ruble is at a record low against the Euro
January : Russia ’s neighbors are under pressure from the devaluation of the ruble
4. Global Interest Rate Cut
On October 8th , in a move to stem the global contagion of the US credit crisis , central banks in multiple G - 10 countries coordinated efforts to lower interest rates .
Among them were notable economies including the US , Europe , UK , Canada and Switzerland .
Unfortunately , the FX markets only found temporary support before moving lower again .
International rate cuts :
5. Sinking South Korean Won
The South Korean
Won became one of the worst performing currencies for the year as traders sided with the safe haven character of the US greenback .
However , making things worse were local exporters .
Businesses worried about higher costs of a lower currency hoarded the US dollar while simultaneously kicking the won to the curb .
Timeline of the South Korean Won Performance :
May : South Korean
Won falls to a two year low in its worst performing day in nearly ten years
October : South Korean
Won at the lowest level in a decade
November : Investors continue to dump South Korean Won
January : South Korean Won down 3 %
6. January Surprise – Fed Cuts Rates On Jan 21st .
On January 21st , the Fed surprised markets by cutting interest rates by 75 basis points in order to stem further volatility and loss .
The decision followed a tumultuous session in the global markets as major indices around the world experienced an average decline of 7.2 percent .
Speculation on what January 21 , 2008 interest rate cut means for the US economy :
Fortune magazine wonders if the cure is worse than the disease .
They may have been right
Business reporters consider how this is going to effect the economy long term .
7. Global Market Downturn
When it was all said and done , global stock market losses were in double digits as traders unloaded risky assets en masse .
Major stock indices continued to flash red as the Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500 , Xetra Dax , FTSE 100 and Nikkei were now an average 41 percent lower than the beginning of the year .
The same could be said of the carry trade crosses .
Once a highly touted investment , the GBPJPY currency pair was now sitting below 135.00 compared to aspirations of 250.00 just months ago .
How did global stock markets fair in 2008 ?
Nikkei ended 2008 down 42 % for the worst year on record
FTSE 100 has worst year since inception in 1984
Globally , there are record stock market falls with Dow Jones losing 34 % of its value
8. Lehman Failure
The biggest failure of an investment bank since the days of Drexel Burnham Lambert , the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers spelled disaster for the US financial sector as it showed no bank or firm was resilient to market and financial forces .
The ultimate result showed one of the world ’s most revered financial institutions being split apart as the stock price plunged to mere cents on the dollar .
How could Lehman go bankrupt ?:
Lehman Brothers becomes the largest causality of the credit crisis
BBC tries to make sense of the Lehman bankruptcy and partially blames the panic of worried investors
Wall Street Journal blames Paulson for letting Lehman Brothers fall
9. Bear Stearns Bailout
One of the first big headlines to hit the ticker in the beginning of the year , Bear Stearns was being bailed out by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and competitor JP Morgan Chase .
The resolution came after the investment bank reported two of its hedge funds sustained heavy losses in mortgage investments .
The event helped to spark fears of further potential bank failures and stock market losses .
Recounting what now seems like the beginning of the end :
Bear Stearns is bailed out by the NY Federal Reserve after a stock free fall
Understanding what the bailout means for tax payers
NPR wonders if the Bear Stearns bailout sets a bad precedent .
$ 8.2 trillion dollars later , I think we all know the answer to that question
10 . Borrowing Costs Soar
With credit or default risk fears running rampant , bankers upped the ante on making loans to the general public .
This helped to push the benchmark overnight Libor rate to a record 6.88 percent back in October as 3 - month dollar Libor increased to above 5 percent .
The increase in Libor increased both mortgage and personal loans , making money relatively inaccessible and expensive .
Interest Rates are low , but borrowing costs are extremely high :
11 . China ’s Surprise Fixing
Experiencing one of the most significant slowdowns in almost a decade , the Chinese economy showed for the first time a break in its rapid and solid pace of growth .
As a result , government officials decided to take the currency back a notch , setting the fixing higher than most anticipated .
Averaging approximately 6.43 per dollar , the rate was fixed higher at 6.87 in December .
The move was seen as opposing previous free floating promises and prompted a visit from the US Treasury Secretary .
Is fixing the exchange rate the answer ?

US Treasury Secretary nominee , Geithner , accuses China of manipulating exchange rates and vows to take a stronger stance
12 . Fed Cuts Rates to 0.25 Range
Although anticipated , the Federal Reserve rate cut on December 16th was historic in the sense that central bankers decided to return the benchmark rate to levels not seen since the 1940s .
Now , the question remains on whether further reductions will be needed in supporting the economy with borrowing costs nearing zero percent .

13 . International Swap Lines
In order to help smaller foreign countries , trader partners and the global economy , major industrial countries began extending lifelines .
Specifically , the US opened up currency swap lines to help in the supply for the highly demanded dollar to countries in South America and Asia .
Several countries agree on global redistribution of US Dollars
14 . Commodity Market Fallout
Falling from grace , commodity markets were additionally sold off as traders and investors converted positions to cash .
Particularly , crude oil contracts plunged from their heavenly perch atop the $ 147 a barrel price to just below a four year low .
The ripples could be felt in correlated currencies such as the Canadian and Australian dollars , both noted for their commodity links .

15 . US Treasury Yields Turn Negative
For the first time in a long time , investors hoarded US Treasuries as the return on equity investments were no match for the risk involved .
As a result , sellers became buyers in the bond market , forcing short term bills to actually turn a negative yield .
This did n’t deter the smallest investor as the safety of the investment became the biggest concern .

16 . Volatility Reaches Record Levels
With plenty of action in the markets , volatility picked up during the year as frantic bottom fishers battled with cherry pickers .
As a result , the Volatility Index , or VIX , reached levels not seen in some time and reflected plenty of energy and panic in the herd .
This made for an interesting trading environment as currency traders now had to deal with wider daily ranges in usually tame pairs like the EUR / USD and the USD / JPY .

17 . Bernard Madoff : Tip Of The Iceberg
One of the biggest stories to hit 2008 , former fund manager and financial market icon Bernard Madoff was arrested on orchestrating the largest Ponzi scheme ever , potentially scoring $ 50 billion .
The incident not only crippled Wall Street ’s credibility but also showed potential leaks and inefficiencies in US regulation .
Even more disturbing has been continued news of more hedge fund managers being arrested under the same claims as Madoff as clients continue to clamor for their money back .

Holocaust Denied :
The lying silence of those who know " When the truth is replaced by silence , " the Soviet dissident Yevgeny Yevtushenko said , " the silence is a lie . "
It may appear the silence is broken on Gaza .
The cocoons of murdered children , wrapped in green , together with boxes containing their dismembered parents and the cries of grief and rage of everyone in that death camp by the sea , can be viewed on al - Jazeera and YouTube , even glimpsed on the BBC .
But Russia 's incorrigible poet was not referring to the ephemeral we call news ; he was asking why those who knew the why never spoke it and so denied it .
Among the Anglo - American intelligentsia , this is especially striking .
It is they who hold the keys to the great storehouses of knowledge : the historiographies and archives that lead us to the why .
Every subsequent " war " Israel has waged has had the same objective : the expulsion of the native people and the theft of more and more land .
The lie of David and Goliath , of perennial victim , reached its apogee in 1967 when the propaganda became a righteous fury that claimed the Arab states had struck first .
Since then , mostly Jewish truth - tellers such as Avi Schlaim , Noam Chomsky , the late Tanya Reinhart , Neve Gordon , Tom Segev , Yuri Avnery , Ilan Pappe and Norman Finklestein have dispatched this and other myths and revealed a state shorn of the humane traditions of Judaism , whose unrelenting militarism is the sum of an expansionist , lawless and racist ideology called zionism .
" It seems , " wrote the Israeli historian Ilan Pappe on 2 January , " that even the most horrendous crimes , such as the genocide in Gaza , are treated as desperate events , unconnected to anything that happened in the past and not associated with any ideology or system …
Very much as the apartheid ideology explained the oppressive policies of the South African government , this ideology – in its most consensual and simplistic variety – has allowed all the Israeli governments in the past and the present to dehumanize the Palestinians wherever they are and strive to destroy them .
The means altered from period to period , from location to location , as did the narrative covering up these atrocities .
But there is a clear pattern [ of genocide ] . "
In Gaza , the enforced starvation and denial of humanitarian aid , the piracy of life - giving resources such as fuel and water , the denial of medicines and treatment , the systematic destruction of infrastructure and the killing and maiming of the civilian population , 50 per cent of whom are children , meet the international standard of the Genocide Convention .
" Is it an irresponsible overstatement , " asked Richard Falk , the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and international law authority at Princeton University , " to associate the treatment of Palestinians with this criminalized Nazi record of collective atrocity ?
I think not . "
In describing a " holocaust - in - the making , " Falk was alluding to the Nazis ' establishment of Jewish ghettos in Poland .
For one month in 1943 , the captive Polish Jews led by Mordechaj Anielewiz fought off the German army and the SS , but their resistance was finally crushed and the Nazis exacted their final revenge .
Falk is also a Jew .
Today 's holocaust - in - the - making , which began with Ben- Gurion 's Plan D , is in its final stages .
The difference today is that it is a joint US - Israeli project .
The F - 16 jet fighters , the 250 - pound " smart " GBU - 39 bombs supplied on the eve of the attack on Gaza , having been approved by a Congress dominated by the Democratic Party , plus the annual $ 2.4 billion in war - making " aid , " give Washington de facto control .
It beggars belief that President - elect Obama was not informed .
Outspoken on Russia 's war in Georgia and the terrorism in Mumbai , Obama 's silence on Palestine marks his approval , which is to be expected , given his obsequiousness to the Tel Aviv regime and its lobbyists during the presidential campaign and his appointment of Zionists as his secretary of state , chief of staff and principal Middle East advisers .
When Aretha Franklin sings " Think , " her wonderful 1960s anthem to freedom , at Obama 's inauguration on 21 January , I trust someone with the brave heart of Muntadar al - Zaidi , the shoe - thrower , will shout : " Gaza ! "
The asymmetry of conquest and terror is clear .
Plan D is now " Operation Cast Lead , " which is the unfinished " Operation Justified Vengeance . "
The latter was launched by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2001 when , with Bush 's approval , he used F - 16s against Palestinian towns and villages for the first time .
In the same year , the authoritative Jane 's Foreign Report disclosed that the Blair government had given Israel the " green light " to attack the West Bank after it was shown Israel 's secret designs for a bloodbath .
It was typical of New Labor Party 's enduring , cringing complicity in Palestine 's agony .
However , the 2001 Israeli plan , reported Jane 's , needed the " trigger " of a suicide bombing which would cause " numerous deaths and injuries [ because ] the ' revenge ' factor is crucial . "
This would " motivate Israeli soldiers to demolish the Palestinians . "
What alarmed Sharon and the author of the plan , General Shaul Mofaz , the Israeli Chief of Staff , was a secret agreement between Yasser Arafat and Hamas to ban suicide attacks .
On 23 November , 2001 , Israeli agents assassinated the Hamas leader , Mahmud Abu Hunud , and got their " trigger " ; the suicide attacks resumed in response to his killing .
Something uncannily similar happened on 5 November last , when Israeli special forces attacked Gaza , killing six people .
Once again , they got their propaganda " trigger . "
A ceasefire initiated and sustained by the Hamas government – which had imprisoned its violators – was shattered by the Israeli attack and homemade rockets were fired into what used to be Palestine before its Arab occupants were " cleansed . "
The On 23 December , Hamas offered to renew the ceasefire , but Israel 's charade was such that its all - out assault on Gaza had been planned six months earlier , according to the Israeli daily Ha'aretz .
Behind this sordid game is the " Dagan Plan , " named after General Meir Dagan , who served with Sharon in his bloody invasion of Lebanon in 1982 .
Now head of Mossad , the Israeli intelligence organization , Dagan is the author of a " solution " that has seen the imprisonment of Palestinians behind a ghetto wall snaking across the West Bank and in Gaza , effectively a concentration camp .
The establishment of a quisling government in Ramallah under Mohammed Abbas is Dagan 's achievement , together with a hasbara ( propaganda ) campaign relayed through a mostly supine , if intimidated western media , notably in America , that says Hamas is a terrorist organization devoted to Israel 's destruction and to " blame " for the massacres and siege of its own people over two generations , long before its creation .
" We have never had it so good , " said the Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Gideon Meir in 2006 .
" The hasbara effort is a well - oiled machine . "
In fact , Hamas 's real threat is its example as the Arab world 's only democratically elected government , drawing its popularity from its resistance to the Palestinians ' oppressor and tormentor .
This was demonstrated when Hamas foiled a CIA coup in 2007 , an event ordained in the western media as " Hamas 's seizure of power . "
Likewise , Hamas is never described as a government , let alone democratic .
Neither is its proposal of a ten - year truce as a historic recognition of the " reality " of Israel and support for a two - state solution with just one condition : that the Israelis obey international law and end their illegal occupation beyond the 1967 borders .
As every annual vote in the UN General Assembly demonstrates , 99 per cent of humanity concurs .
On 4 January , the president of the General Assembly , Miguel d'Escoto , described the Israeli attack on Gaza as a " monstrosity . "
When the monstrosity is done and the people of Gaza are even more stricken , the Dagan Plan foresees what Sharon called a " 1948 - style solution " – the destruction of all Palestinian leadership and authority followed by mass expulsions into smaller and smaller " cantonments " and perhaps finally into Jordan .
This demolition of institutional and educational life in Gaza is designed to produce , wrote Karma Nabulsi , a Palestinian exile in Britain , " a Hobbesian vision of an anarchic society : truncated , violent , powerless , destroyed , cowed … Look to the Iraq of today : that is what [ Sharon ] had in store for us , and he has nearly achieved it . "

" Holocaust denial is anti-Semitic , " she wrote on 31 December .
" But I 'm not talking about World War Two , Mahmoud Ahmedinijad ( the president of Iran ) or Ashkenazi Jews .
What I 'm referring to is the holocaust we are all witnessing and responsible for in Gaza today and in Palestine over the past 60 years … Since Arabs are Semites , US - Israeli policy does n't get more anti-Semitic than this . "
She quoted Rachel Corrie , the young American who went to Palestine to defend Palestinians and was crushed by an Israeli bulldozer .
" I am in the midst of a genocide , " wrote Corrie , " which I am also indirectly supporting and for which my government is largely responsible . "
Reading the words of both , I am struck by the use of " responsibility . "
Breaking the lie of silence is not an esoteric abstraction but an urgent responsibility that falls to those with the privilege of a platform .
With the BBC cowed , so too is much of journalism , merely allowing vigorous debate within unmovable invisible boundaries , ever fearful of the smear of anti-Semitism .
The unreported news , meanwhile , is that the death toll in Gaza is the equivalent of 18,000 dead in Britain .
Imagine , if you can .
Then there are the academics , the deans and teachers and researchers .
Why are they silent as they watch a university bombed and hear the Association of University Teachers in Gaza plea for help ?
Are British universities now , as Terry Eagleton believes , no more than " intellectual Tescos , churning out a commodity known as graduates rather than greengroceries " ?
Then there are the writers .
In the dark year of 1939 , the Third Writers ' Congress was held at Carnegie Hall in New York and the likes of Thomas Mann and Albert Einstein sent messages and spoke up to ensure the lie of silence was broken .
By one account , 3,500 jammed the auditorium and a thousand were turned away .
Today , this mighty voice of realism and morality is said to be obsolete ; the literary review pages affect an ironic hauteur of irrelevance ; false symbolism is all .
As for the readers , their moral and political imagination is to be pacified , not primed .
The anti-Muslim Martin Amis expressed this well in Visiting Mrs. Nabokov : " The dominance of the self is not a flaw , it is an evolutionary characteristic ; it is just how things are . "
If that is how things are , we are diminished as a civilized society .
For what happens in Gaza is the defining moment of our time , which either grants the impunity of war criminals the immunity of our silence , while we contort our own intellect and morality , or gives us the power to speak out .
For the moment I prefer my own memory of Gaza : of the people 's courage and resistance and their " luminous humanity , " as Karma Nabulsi put it .
On my last trip there , I was rewarded with a spectacle of Palestinian flags fluttering in unlikely places .
It was dusk and children had done this .
No one told them to do it .
They made flagpoles out of sticks tied together , and a few of them climbed on to a wall and held the flag between them , some silently , others crying out .
They do this every day when they know foreigners are leaving , believing the world will not forget them .
They know that the horror now raining on Gaza has little to do with Hamas or , absurdly , " Israel 's right to exist . "
They know the opposite to be true : that Palestine 's right to exist was canceled 61 years ago and the expulsion and , if necessary , extinction of the indigenous people was planned and executed by the founders of Israel .
They know , for example , that the infamous " Plan D " resulted in the murderous depopulation of 369 Palestinian towns and villages by the Haganah ( Jewish army ) and that massacre upon massacre of Palestinian civilians in such places as Deir Yassin , al - Dawayima , Eilaboun , Jish , Ramle and Lydda are referred to in official records as " ethnic cleansing . "
Arriving at a scene of this carnage , David Ben-Gurion , Israel 's first prime minister , was asked by a general , Yigal Allon , " What shall we do with the Arabs ? "
Ben-Gurion , reported the Israeli historian Benny Morris , " made a dismissive , energetic gesture with his hand and said , ‘ Expel them ' .
The order to expel an entire population " without attention to age " was signed by Yitzhak Rabin , a future prime minister promoted by the world 's most efficient propaganda as a peacemaker .
The terrible irony of this was addressed only in passing , such as when the Mapan Party co-leader Meir Ya'ari noted " how easily " Israel 's leaders spoke of how it was " possible and permissible to take women , children and old men and to fill the roads with them because such is the imperative of strategy … who remembers who used this means against our people during the [ Second World ] war … we are appalled .
" Every subsequent " war " Israel has waged has had the same objective : the expulsion of the native people and the theft of more and more land .
The lie of David and Goliath , of perennial victim , reached its apogee in 1967 when the propaganda became a righteous fury that claimed the Arab states had struck first .
Since then , mostly Jewish truth - tellers such as Avi Schlaim , Noam Chomsky , the late Tanya Reinhart , Neve Gordon , Tom Segev , Yuri Avnery , Ilan Pappe and Norman Finklestein have dispatched this and other myths and revealed a state shorn of the humane traditions of Judaism , whose unrelenting militarism is the sum of an expansionist , lawless and racist ideology called zionism .
" It seems , " wrote the Israeli historian Ilan Pappe on 2 January , " that even the most horrendous crimes , such as the genocide in Gaza , are treated as desperate events , unconnected to anything that happened in the past and not associated with any ideology or system …
Very much as the apartheid ideology explained the oppressive policies of the South African government , this ideology – in its most consensual and simplistic variety – has allowed all the Israeli governments in the past and the present to dehumanize the Palestinians wherever they are and strive to destroy them .
The means altered from period to period , from location to location , as did the narrative covering up these atrocities .
But there is a clear pattern [ of genocide ] .
" In Gaza , the enforced starvation and denial of humanitarian aid , the piracy of life - giving resources such as fuel and water , the denial of medicines and treatment , the systematic destruction of infrastructure and the killing and maiming of the civilian population , 50 per cent of whom are children , meet the international standard of the Genocide Convention .
" Is it an irresponsible overstatement , " asked Richard Falk , the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and international law authority at Princeton University , " to associate the treatment of Palestinians with this criminalized Nazi record of collective atrocity ?
I think not .
" In describing a " holocaust - in - the making , " Falk was alluding to the Nazis ' establishment of Jewish ghettos in Poland .
For one month in 1943 , the captive Polish Jews led by Mordechaj Anielewiz fought off the German army and the SS , but their resistance was finally crushed and the Nazis exacted their final revenge .
Falk is also a Jew .
Today 's holocaust - in - the - making , which began with Ben- Gurion 's Plan D , is in its final stages .
The difference today is that it is a joint US - Israeli project .
The F - 16 jet fighters , the 250 - pound " smart " GBU - 39 bombs supplied on the eve of the attack on Gaza , having been approved by a Congress dominated by the Democratic Party , plus the annual $ 2.4 billion in war - making " aid , " give Washington de facto control .
It beggars belief that President - elect Obama was not informed .
Outspoken on Russia 's war in Georgia and the terrorism in Mumbai , Obama 's silence on Palestine marks his approval , which is to be expected , given his obsequiousness to the Tel Aviv regime and its lobbyists during the presidential campaign and his appointment of Zionists as his secretary of state , chief of staff and principal Middle East advisers .
When Aretha Franklin sings " Think , " her wonderful 1960s anthem to freedom , at Obama 's inauguration on 21 January , I trust someone with the brave heart of Muntadar al - Zaidi , the shoe - thrower , will shout : " Gaza !
" The asymmetry of conquest and terror is clear .
Plan D is now " Operation Cast Lead , " which is the unfinished " Operation Justified Vengeance . "
The latter was launched by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2001 when , with Bush 's approval , he used F - 16s against Palestinian towns and villages for the first time .
In the same year , the authoritative Jane 's Foreign Report disclosed that the Blair government had given Israel the " green light " to attack the West Bank after it was shown Israel 's secret designs for a bloodbath .
It was typical of New Labor Party 's enduring , cringing complicity in Palestine 's agony .
However , the 2001 Israeli plan , reported Jane 's , needed the " trigger " of a suicide bombing which would cause " numerous deaths and injuries [ because ] the ' revenge ' factor is crucial . "
This would " motivate Israeli soldiers to demolish the Palestinians . "
What alarmed Sharon and the author of the plan , General Shaul Mofaz , the Israeli Chief of Staff , was a secret agreement between Yasser Arafat and Hamas to ban suicide attacks .
On 23 November , 2001 , Israeli agents assassinated the Hamas leader , Mahmud Abu Hunud , and got their " trigger " ; the suicide attacks resumed in response to his killing .
Something uncannily similar happened on 5 November last , when Israeli special forces attacked Gaza , killing six people .
Once again , they got their propaganda " trigger . "
A ceasefire initiated and sustained by the Hamas government – which had imprisoned its violators – was shattered by the Israeli attack and homemade rockets were fired into what used to be Palestine before its Arab occupants were " cleansed . "
The On 23 December , Hamas offered to renew the ceasefire , but Israel 's charade was such that its all - out assault on Gaza had been planned six months earlier , according to the Israeli daily Ha'aretz .
Behind this sordid game is the " Dagan Plan , " named after General Meir Dagan , who served with Sharon in his bloody invasion of Lebanon in 1982 .
Now head of Mossad , the Israeli intelligence organization , Dagan is the author of a " solution " that has seen the imprisonment of Palestinians behind a ghetto wall snaking across the West Bank and in Gaza , effectively a concentration camp .
The establishment of a quisling government in Ramallah under Mohammed Abbas is Dagan 's achievement , together with a hasbara ( propaganda ) campaign relayed through a mostly supine , if intimidated western media , notably in America , that says Hamas is a terrorist organization devoted to Israel 's destruction and to " blame " for the massacres and siege of its own people over two generations , long before its creation .
" We have never had it so good , " said the Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Gideon Meir in 2006 .
" The hasbara effort is a well - oiled machine . "
In fact , Hamas 's real threat is its example as the Arab world 's only democratically elected government , drawing its popularity from its resistance to the Palestinians ' oppressor and tormentor .
This was demonstrated when Hamas foiled a CIA coup in 2007 , an event ordained in the western media as " Hamas 's seizure of power . "
Likewise , Hamas is never described as a government , let alone democratic .
Neither is its proposal of a ten - year truce as a historic recognition of the " reality " of Israel and support for a two - state solution with just one condition : that the Israelis obey international law and end their illegal occupation beyond the 1967 borders .
As every annual vote in the UN General Assembly demonstrates , 99 per cent of humanity concurs .
On 4 January , the president of the General Assembly , Miguel d'Escoto , described the Israeli attack on Gaza as a " monstrosity .
"
When the monstrosity is done and the people of Gaza are even more stricken , the Dagan Plan foresees what Sharon called a " 1948 - style solution " – the destruction of all Palestinian leadership and authority followed by mass expulsions into smaller and smaller " cantonments " and perhaps finally into Jordan .

Exclusive to STR
February 25 , 2009
Well it 's official : President Barack H. Obama , with a stroke of his magisterial pen , has made the $ 787 billion stimulus package the law of the land .
Americans can now breathe a sigh of relief knowing that their current state of high financial anxiety will be shared by generations to come .
So what 's so stimulating about the stimulus anyway ?
Other than its ability to spread monetary misery , no one knows for sure ; not even the president or his top advisers .
They do n't seem very hopeful or upbeat , yet the American people were told that if the stimulus did n't pass and quick , financial Armageddon was imminent .
Speaking on one of the too many shows that pass for nightly news , Congressman Peter Defazio explained why he voted against the stimulus : ' It included too many tax cuts and not enough spending on transportation projects . '
A few seconds later he said that the stimulus would devalue the dollar and cause runaway inflation .
Keep in mind he voted for the $ 800 billion plus stimulus bill .
So using the congressman 's logic , it would be OK for folks to work at a fast food restaurant for $ 8 an hour to have Uncle Sam ' withhold ' $ 5 of it while charging $ 15 for an overcooked burger , burnt fries , and a watered down soda as long as they can ride the train to work ?
President Obama himself addressing those that were critical of his bailout plan said , ' In recent days , there have been misguided criticisms of this plan that echo the failed theories that helped lead us into this crisis . . . .'
Is he talking about Bush 's gargantuan expansion of Medicare , raising steel tariffs , TARP , the Patriot Act , the Faith Based Initiative , or No Child Left Behind ?
Obama doubts ' the notion that tax cuts alone will solve all our problems ; ' of course not , silly : they have to be accompanied by spending cuts .
Writing in The Washington Post , Harold Meyerson unequivocally states , ' The essence of the crisis , and what distinguishes both the Depression and the current meltdown from every recession between the '30s and today , is that , left to their own devices , private lending and investment will not and cannot bounce back . '
He conveniently skipped over the recessions of 1907 , 1893 , and 1873 , which was at one time referred to as the Great Depression .
The United States ' economy bounced back relatively quickly from all those with little or no intervention from the government and without the existence of a Federal Reserve System .
Of course some private lending and investment companies will fail ; that 's what 's supposed to happen to companies and individuals who make the wrong decisions in a free market economy .
However , many will survive and new ones will enter the markets by snatching up assets at bargain prices , but I doubt this is the economic model Mr. Meyerson has in mind .
His is probably more in tune with Fidel Castro's , which has done wonders for the Cuban economy , especially in the prostitution and vintage car markets .
Daniel Gross , Slate.com 's Money
Box columnist , argues that government can create jobs : '. . . in the history of mankind , the government has in fact created many , many jobs .
Today , government accounts for 22.5 million of the nation 's 135.5 million payroll jobs , or 16.6 percent .
Those numbers include people who work for the federal , state , and local governments ' doctors and nurses in public hospitals and teachers at elementary schools and public universities . '
What Mr. Gross 's financial myopia prevents him from seeing is that it's not just jobs but productive and cost efficient jobs that help an economy bounce back and grow .
By the best estimates ( those of Obama and his advisers ) , each job ' created ' or ' saved ' by Obama 's stimulus plan will cost $ 225,000 .
Other , less biased estimates put that number at close to $ 1 million .
All that money is in some way being sucked out of the private economy causing productive job losses or preventing them from being created .
Using both Obama 's and Mr. Gross 's logic , one would have to rate Mao and Stalin as the greatest job creators in history .
Our nation 's 22nd labor secretary , Robert Reich , writing in his blog , wholeheartedly defends Obama 's mortgage plan , including the part that gives bankruptcy judges the power to rewrite mortgage agreements .
If you think getting a loan is tough now , just wait ' til something resembling Obama 's proposal passes :
Not even Bill Gates will get approved for a $ 50,000 mortgage loan .
Former Secretary Reich is also giddy about the ' massive expansion of the government 's commitment to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , ' even though by all economically sound and sane accounts that is exactly what caused the current mess in the housing market in the first place ( the correct assumption by many that the federal government would step in and not let either Fannie or Freddie fail ) .
In his statement after signing the stimulus plan , President Obama , referring to the ideas of lowering taxes and eliminating regulations to stimulate the economy , said they 'have been tested , and they have failed . '
Tested by whom ?
Where ?
If President Obama was speaking about the United States , he is delusional ( a condition shared by many in positions of power ) .
Banking regulations alone have reached a point where the biggest and most expensive department in every bank in America is the government ' compliance ' department , which generates zero revenues .
Yes , once in a while the American people are treated to an illusory tax cut , but it is never accompanied by spending cuts , which causes higher deficits , inflation , and future tax increases .
Much has been made about Obama 's likeness in thought and persona to FDR , and many lauded the 32nd president on President 's Day as one of this country 's greatest .
It is sad testimony to what the United States has come to when on such a day little or no mention was made of Calvin Coolidge ( AKA Silent Cal ) .
Obama and his predecessors ( including the venerated FDR ) would have done well to have taken some of Silent Cal 's thoughts into consideration like , ' Perhaps one of the most important accomplishments of my administration has been minding my own business . '
When considering how to deal with the ' Big Three ' and failing banks , we all would be better off if Presidents Bush and Obama had heeded these words : ' Success is not final , failure is not fatal : it is the courage to continue that counts . '
Many in Congress should have pondered the following before voting on the Patriot Act : ' Liberty is not collective , it is personal .
All liberty is individual liberty . '
Further , all politicians would do right by their constituents if they paid attention to this obvious observation :
' No matter what anyone may say about making the rich and the corporations pay taxes , in the end they come out of the people who toil . '
How much money would have been saved if Theodore Roosevelt , Woodrow Wilson and every president since FDR would have paid attention to this : " No nation ever had an army large enough to guarantee it against attack in time of peace , or ensure it of victory in time of war , " and for the rest of us " When people are bewildered they tend to become credulous " ?
Those who wish to preserve their sanity and dignity through the current crisis and beyond , would do well to remember the words of Harry Daugherty ( Warren Harding 's campaign manager ) : ' Greatness in the presidential chair is largely an illusion of the people . '
No one knows for sure that the second coming of Calvin Coolidge would get the economy out of its current malaise , but any rational and nonpartisan person , which are fewer by the day , knows without a doubt that the second coming of FDR will only serve to make things much more difficult .

Stimulidity
This state money would be used to fund takeovers or mergers with resource companies abroad .
Which foreign firms , if any , have been identified for takeover has not been disclosed .
But the dramatic fall in oil prices since last summer , and the strains caused by recession , have driven down the share prices of many energy companies , making them more affordable targets for predatory competitors .
What , then , will actually end the slump ?
Well , the Great Depression did eventually come to an end , but that was thanks to an enormous war , something we ’d rather not emulate .
The slump that followed Japan ’s “ bubble economy ” also eventually ended , but only after a lost decade .
And when Japan finally did start to experience some solid growth , it was thanks to an export boom , which was in turn made possible by vigorous growth in the rest of the world  not an experience anyone can repeat when the whole world is in a slump .
So will our slump go on forever ?
No .
In fact , the seeds of eventual recovery are already being planted .
Consider housing starts , which have fallen to their lowest level in 50 years .
That ’s bad news for the near term .
It means that spending on construction will fall even more .
But it also means that the supply of houses is lagging behind population growth , which will eventually prompt a housing revival .
Or consider the plunge in auto sales .
Again , that ’s bad news for the near term .
But at current sales rates , as the finance blog Calculated Risk points out , it would take about 27 years to replace the existing stock of vehicles .
Most cars will be junked long before that , either because they ’ve worn out or because they ’ve become obsolete , so we ’re building up a pent - up demand for cars .
The same story can be told for durable goods and assets throughout the economy : given time , the current slump will end itself , the way slumps did in the 19th century .
As I said , this may be your great - great - grandfather ’s recession .
But recovery may be a long time coming .
The closest 19th - century parallel I can find to the current slump is the recession that followed the Panic of 1873 .
That recession did eventually end without any government intervention , but it lasted more than five years , and another prolonged recession followed just three years later .
You can see , then , why some Fed officials are so pessimistic .
Let ’s be clear : the Obama administration ’s policy initiatives will help in this difficult period  especially if the administration bites the bullet and takes over weak banks .
But still I wonder :
Who ’ll stop the pain ?
Mozilla Labs recently unveiled Bespin ( which appears to be pronounced “ Beh - spin ” rather than “ Bee- spin ” ) .
Bespin will provide a fully - functioning code editor that ’s integrated directly into your web browser .
Mozilla ’s goal is to create a fast , easy - to - use editor that ’s not intimidating , and is accessible from anywhere .
The system will offer an extensible API to encourage third - party extensions and Ubiqity - like natural language commands for full control over the editor and its interface .
However , Bespin ’s most interesting feature is likely to be real - time collaboration .
You and your coding colleagues will be able to work on the same files at the same time and see each other ’s changes as they happen .
That will certainly appeal to all keyboard - sharing programmers using agile development methods .
If you ’re using Firefox 3 , version 0.1 of Bespin is live and can be tested at bespin.mozilla.com .
It ’s very much a proof of concept and lacks features found in some of the most basic editors .
HTML , CSS and JavaScript files are supported , although I would n’t recommend doing any real work just yet .
Online code editors are not a new idea .
However , most projects are quite basic and usually implement an enhanced version of an HTML < textarea > with line numbering and colour - coding .
Even at this stage , Bespin implements functionality that is more advanced than any of its competitors .
The most interesting aspect about Bespin is the technology behind the editor itself .
Mozilla have used a single HTML5 canvas element to implement the text editing , colour - coding , line numbering , highlighting , scrollbars , and the whole interface .
Amazingly , it has been achieved with just 62Kb of compressed JavaScript .
Using canvas in this way is a novel idea , and I suspect it will influence many other projects .
Bespin is possibly a little ahead of its time .
It will be handy for quick web site updates or perhaps live online presentations , but it has a long way to go before developers abandon their favourite desktop - based editor .
Would you trust your code with online code editors such as Bespin ?
Could it ever offer the speed , features , security , and flexibility of your current IDE ?
Real - time collaboration is useful , but would you need it every day ?
Her gaze drifted over to our patient .
“ What can I do ? ” she asked .
Moral distress  knowing what is ethically appropriate but being unable to act on it because of obstacles inherent in a situation  was first described in 1984 in a book on nursing ethics .
Subsequent researchers focused primarily on the experiences of nurses and found that those who suffered from moral distress often became reluctant to interact with patients and other providers .
In one recent study , 15 percent of nurses left their jobs because of moral distress .
It now appears that doctors  caught between obligations to patients and the demands of insurance companies , administrators and even , occasionally , patients ’ families  are feeling increasingly “ trapped ” and unable to do what they believe is ethically right .
Researchers from the University of Virginia recently studied I.C.U. physicians and nurses and found that while doctors on average are less frustrated than nurses , they can also suffer from intense moral distress .
This finding does n’t surprise me .
It is profoundly disheartening to haggle with disembodied voices over the phone over insurance approval for operations to remove cancers , to struggle to do everything that should be done for the rising numbers of patients a single doctor must see , and to follow the wishes of estranged relatives who swoop into the hospital during the last days of life and demand aggressive treatment .
What can we do ?
I spoke with Ann B. Hamric , a registered nurse and the lead author of the study on I.C.U. physicians and nurses .
“ There are many different reasons why a clinician may feel that he or she is not able to do the ethically appropriate thing , ” Dr. Hamric said over the phone .
“ A lot of the reasons for moral distress come from the environments where we work .
Are we working as respectful partners or are we afraid ?
Doctors feel that the risk managers or the lawyers are telling them what they can and cannot do for patients , and that affects physicians . ”
We discussed the implications of moral distress for the current nursing shortage and the impending primary care shortage .
I asked her if there might be some way to change the work environment .
“ Part of what we have to do , ” Dr. Hamric answered , “ is to start recognizing moral distress and deliberately talking about it in health care settings .
Otherwise , we will fail to recognize the damage to the integrity of the provider .
We ca n’t expect people to work in this kind of highly intense , emotional , intimate space and then expect them to tolerate threats to their professional integrity . ”
She added , “ No one ’s going to stay otherwise .
It ’s just too heartbreaking . ”

On Tuesday , 43 people were killed at a UN - run school in the northern town of Jabaliya after Israeli forces fired tank shells at the building where families fleing the fighting had sought shelter .
Two other schools were hit , killing a further five people .
" Staff members have been killed , our installations have been hit , our refugees have been killed .
All this in spite of the fact we have coordinated in detail the GPS coordinates of our installations and movement of vehicles and personnel with Israel , " Gunness told AFP .
He has also told reporters that a three - hour pause in fighting by Israeli forces is insufficient , adding that the " humanitarian crisis is deepening with each hour . "
Israel insists it is doing its utmost to protect civilians and aid workers in its operations against Hamas , Gaza 's Islamist rulers who have been firing daily volleys of rockets at the Jewish state .
But aid agencies complain relief workers and medics are at high risk and that civilians have nowhere to flee .
" The parties must respect the norms of international humanitarian law , in particular the principles of distinction and proportionality , " said UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories , Maxwell Gaylard .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) on Thursday accused Israel of failing to help wounded people in an area of Gaza where its rescuers found four small children huddling next to their dead mothers , too weak to stand up .
It said Israeli soldiers tried to force the rescuers to leave when they finally reached the grisly scene in Gaza City 's shell - battered Zeitun neighbourhood on Wednesday , four days after safe - passage had been requested .
The delay in allowing access to rescuers was " unacceptable , " the ICRC said .
" This is a shocking incident , " said Pierre Wettach , who heads the ICRC 's delegation for Israel and the Palestinian territories .
" The Israeli military must have been aware of the situation but did not assist the wounded . "
The rescuers evacuated 18 wounded and 12 others " who were extremely exhausted , " the ICRC said , adding that more wounded people are sheltering in destroyed houses .
In a statement issued in Geneva ICRC president Jakob Kellenberger said : " It must be possible to evacuate wounded at all times , not just during three hours . "
The Israeli military said it would investigate the claims if a complaint is received but insisted it works " in close cooperation with international aid organisations during the fighting so that civilians can be provided with assistance . "
It also stressed Israeli troops were involved in fighting " the Hamas terrorist organization who have deliberately used Palestinian civilians as human shields . "
Amnesty International has accused both Israeli soldiers and Palestinian fighters of using civilians as " human shields . "
It claimed Israeli soldiers took up up positions in Palestinian homes , " forcing families to stay in a ground floor room while they use the rest of their house as a military base and sniper position . "
Asked about the claim , an Israeli military spokesman said " the IDF does not comment on ongoing operations . "
A total of 763 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched Operation Cast Lead on December 27 .

Remember how Justice Gray started that little fad about becoming a better developer in 6 months ?
Well , that was a while ago and most of you failed .
Badly .
So here 's a simpler challenge , some ways to be a better programmer in 6 minutes .
You 've got 6 minutes , right ?
Go for it !
Use a bigger font size .
This is ridiculously easy -- but it works .
Go to your favourite IDE , and crank the font - size up .
I switched from 10pt to 14 pt .
The difference is that a lot less code fits on the screen at once .
The effect is : you 're forced to write shorter methods .
And that 's a Good Thing .
( Scott Hanselman recommends that one )
Make hard - coded strings look ugly .
I learnt this from Joe Cooney .
Go to your favourite IDE , and set it so that literal strings stand right out -- for example a yellow background with a red font .
Make 'em ugly .
Damn ugly .
This will encourage you to perform less hard coding , and to notice when you are embedding strings in your text .
Pick an ' obscure ' keyword and master it Do you fail to yield ? .
Is there a keyword you never use ?
Every keyword has a purpose .
Learn to master those mystery keywords and your powers will become extraordinary .
Here are lists for a few .
net languages : C# , VB.net , F# .
Increase code - coverage by 1 % Do n't kill yourself striving for 100 % coverage of code with automated unit tests .
But take a few minutes to increase your coverage by 1 % .
Most likely , that means going from 0 % to 1 % .
And that 's the biggest improvement of all .
Find a particularly ghoulish regular expression .
Or a critical piece of business logic .
These things can't be trusted without tests .
Read the code from an open source project Sometimes , when I 'm looking at the code of a complete stranger , I get that same , weird feeling I get when I 'm creeping through my neighbour 's house .
Picking up their stuff , looking through their fridge .
Learn to overcome the creepy sensation , and bring on the learn .
Maybe start with Hanselman 's Weekly Source Code series .
Run a static analysis tool against your code Use fxcop , or StyleCop , clone detective , ndepend , the code metrics feature of VS 2008 , or any other static analysis tool of your choice .
Uncover your greatest weakness .
Even a cursory glance at the output will leave you distraught at just how much room you 've got for improvement .
Pick an ugly method to refactor
You know the method .
That method you 're particularly ashamed of .
That one that 's long and ugly and horrible .
And it 's crucial to the whole application .
You do n't have to polish it from a turd to a diamond , but just neaten it up a little .
Rename a variable .
Hoist part of it out into a separate method .
Start simple .
The momentum will increase .
Watch out .
Most Designers share their Creative design stuffs to others for free .
so that others can learn from their works ,
At sometimes these collection will become marvelous time saver .

Although my recent column urging that immunity for police , prosecutors , and judges be eliminated received a lot of positive response , nonetheless some lawyers and others wrote to complain that if this actually were done , then those same officers of the court would face endless litigation from unscrupulous criminals .
I understand that point well and even am sympathetic to it , but in the end believe that if the rest of us are subject to endless lawsuits from unscrupulous people , then everyone should be put in the same situation , if there is to be equal justice for all .
The problem is that many of the unscrupulous people are the officers of the court .
Furthermore , there really are few remedies available for people to take when it turns out that the prosecutors , police , and judges have been reckless with the truth and gained a wrongful conviction .
Instead , we are told that it is something with which we have to live .
With those points in mind , I would like to present the case of Timothy Cole , wrongfully convicted in 1986 for a rape he never committed .
Even after another person confessed to the rape , and even after DNA testing had confirmed that Cole did not rape Texas Tech sophomore Michelle Mallin in 1985 , it did no good .
Timothy Cole died in prison in 1999 from complications from asthma .
Cole went to prison because Mallin identified him in court as the rapist .
Forget that so - called eyewitness identification is notoriously inaccurate , and forget that Cole ’s defense already had alerted police and prosecutor Jim Bob Darnell had been given ample evidence of Cole ’s innocence .
None of that mattered to any of the government employees seeking a conviction , and a compliant jury rendered its verdict after about six hours of discussion .
Today , Darnell is the " Honorable Jim Bob Darnell , " a state judge in Texas .
Yet , his actions in the Cole case were anything but honorable , for an honorable man seeks for truth , not scalps , and there were lots of holes in Darnell ’s case in 1986 .
First , Mallin noted that the man smoked heavily throughout the ordeal .
Cole , who suffered from asthma , did not smoke and , indeed , would have had a severe reaction from smoking .
Second ,
Cole ’s fingerprints were not found anywhere on or in Mallin ’s car , despite the fact that Mallin testified that the man was not wearing gloves .
Third , Cole had an alibi , as friends testified in court that he was with them when the alleged rape occurred .
Darnell would have none of that .
Even though it was clear that there was a serial rapist on the loose , and that Mallin ’s rapist had engaged in similar patterns in other attacks , all of that information was suppressed , thanks to Darnell ’s insistence and the judge ’s compliance :
By then police had backed away from Tim as a suspect in multiple rapes .
No physical evidence connected Tim to the crimes , and victims had not recognized him in the lineups .
But Darnell blocked near any mention of that in front of jurors .
Police on the stand who more than a year earlier had hunted for a serial rapist made little comment on any connection to other rapes .
Again and again , Darnell hammered on how the witness had picked Tim out of the lineup … .
And when Reggie and friends testified to Tim ’s focus on school , to his presence at a party at his duplex the night of the attack , Darnell shredded the alibi apart by casting doubt on the memories and motives of the witnesses .
Tim ’s defense attorney , Mike Brown , pushed back .
Did n’t a victim confuse Tim for Terry Lee Clark ?
he asked the detectives .
Did n’t police fail to find any physical evidence that this victim recognized ?
Did n’t the rapes in vacant fields by knifepoint continue after Tim ’s arrest , like the ones committed by a violent offender , Jerry Wayne Johnson ?
Darnell : “ Are we going to try every rape that occurs in Lubbock County over a six month or one year period of time involving black males ? ”
There was still more reason to doubt , Brown said .
Did n’t this victim fail to describe some of Tim ’s more obvious features ?
Tim removed his shirt for the jury , showing his mottled back and arm , birthmarks that covered his upper body .
Darnell : “ Is that person going to be embracing that individual and remembering everything about that person ’s back when they are being sexually assaulted and their soul is being taken from them ? ” he asked days later in closing as the victim burst into tears .
In fact , one of the reasons that Mallin was so sure of her identification was that police investigators insisted that Cole was the man and , in effect , confirmed for her the identification she had made .
Yet , today , we know that the defense was right ; it was Terry Wayne Johnson who committed that and other rapes around Lubbock .
Terry Wayne Johnson , a heavy smoker .
Terry Wayne Johnson , whose DNA would be a match when checked many years later .
Let me put this case another way ; Mike Brown , Cole ’s attorney , did a better job of investigating the case than did the Lubbock Police and Jim Bob Darnell .
In fact , the official investigators failed in their efforts , and ultimately depended upon lies , bullying , and intimidation .
The last thing they wanted was the truth getting in the way of a conviction , and that was what they got .
I am not interested in hearing how police simply " made a mistake . "
If Mike Brown could figure out the case , why were the police and prosecution so reluctant to do the same ?
There was another clue that perhaps they were mistaken , Cole ’s response to a plea offer .
Darnell and the police had promised Cole that if he would plead to a lesser charge , he only would receive probation .
Cole refused , saying he would not plead to something he did not do .
When in prison , he was offered the chance to get out on parole if only he would admit to having committed the crime for which he was imprisoned .
He refused .
In other words , Timothy Cole was a man of principle .
Jim Bob Darnell , the man called " Your Honor " every day of his working life , is not a man of principle .
He decided in 1986 that Cole was guilty , and that he would not let facts or the truth get in the way of securing a conviction .
As I have said before , the facts of the case did not point to Timothy Cole .
They pointed , instead , to Terry Wayne Johnson , but neither the police nor Darnell were interested in what might have happened .
They had their story , and they were going to stick to it .
But the sorry tale still was not over .
In 1995 , after the statute of limitations had run out , Johnson confessed to Mallin ’s rape .
The people running the " justice " show in Texas were not interested .
Cole ’s family did not give up trying to clear Timothy of this rape , and they tried and tried , even after Timothy was dead .
Finally , and reluctantly , in 2008 the authorities finally got around to testing the DNA , and found a match with Johnson .
As one might suspect , there was none with Timothy Cole , but it did not matter , for Cole had been dead for nearly a decade .
So , Jim Bob Darnell , now the Honorable Jim Bob Darnell essentially murdered Timothy Cole .
He had the opportunity in 1986 to get at the truth , but took the easy way out , bullying his way to a conviction .
If he truly were " honorable , " he immediately would resign his judgeship and turn in his law license and offer to clean toilets in the Cole household for the rest of his life .
Instead , Darnell will continue in his career as a judge , passing sentence perhaps on other people wrongfully convicted , agreeing with prosecutors on plea bargains in cases where the truth never will be permitted to be known .
He will be able to continue his comfortable and " respectable " life as though he never had killed Timothy Cole .
That is why I believe that we must get rid of judicial and prosecutorial immunity .
Not only does immunity protect the Mike Nifongs of this world — people who openly lie in court and are protected in ways that one cannot imagine for others — but it also permits those people who have taken the lives of others to continue as though nothing had happened .
In the real world , people are supposed to take responsibility for what they do .
If someone sells me a faulty product , I can take legal action against that person .
If someone in his or her dealings with me in the world of private enterprise lies or shades the truth , I have some recourse .
However , if a prosecutor lies or a judge permits a travesty of justice to occur in his courtroom , it is business as usual .
There might be discipline for that person , but generally speaking , the prosecutor gives an excuse , the judge hides behind immunity , and everyone else whose life was shattered is expected to " pick up the pieces and move on . "
If I or Lew Rockwell or most people reading this article were responsible for the death of another human being , there would be a price to pay .
Our futures possibly would hold prison or perhaps execution .
At the very least , we would be expected to compensate the wronged party with our own resources .
Jim Bob Darnell does not have to worry about that .
He had immunity , he has immunity , and he can do what he damn well pleases .
Not only will he never have to face justice for killing another human being , but he wo n’t even be inconvenienced .
No , he did not have to make the trip to Austin when the courts finally exonerated Cole , and did not show his face in the courtroom ; he was and is immune .
No system of justice can be perfect in a world of imperfect people .
It is true that most people brought into the criminal justice system are guilty as charged , or have been involved in criminal activity .
Furthermore , I also realize that plenty of " jailhouse lawyers " would use their time to file " frivolous " lawsuits against prosecutors , police and judges if given the chance .
Yet , I believe there could be a mechanism developed to deal with that problem .
Certainly , the courts do not see a problem with , say , Microsoft facing a bevy of lawsuits because Bill Gates believes that the company should have lots of cash on hand .
Judges certainly do n’t worry about the plaintiffs ’ bar destroying the ability of companies to function just because there is money to be made .

In January , an editorial in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute noted that most trials had shown no cancer benefits from vitamins  with a few exceptions , like a finding that calcium appeared to lower the recurrence of precancerous colon polyps by 15 percent .
Image
But some vitamin studies have also shown unexpected harm , like higher lung cancer rates in two studies of beta carotene use .
Another study suggested a higher risk of precancerous polyps among users of folic acid compared with those in a placebo group .
In 2007 , The Journal of the American Medical Association reviewed mortality rates in randomized trials of antioxidant supplements .
In 47 trials of 181,000 participants , the rate was 5 percent higher among the antioxidant users .
The main culprits were vitamin A , beta carotene and vitamin E ; vitamin C and selenium seemed to have no meaningful effect .
“ We call them essential nutrients because they are , ” said Marian L. Neuhouser , an associate member in cancer prevention at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle .
“ But there has been a leap into thinking that vitamins and minerals can prevent anything from fatigue to cancer to Alzheimer ’s .
That ’s where the science did n’t pan out . ”
Everyone is struggling to make sense of the conflicting data , said Andrew Shao , vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition , a vitamin industry trade group .
Consumers and researchers need to “ redefine our expectations for these nutrients , ” he said .
“ They are n’t magic bullets . ”
Part of the problem , he said , may stem from an inherent flaw in the way vitamins are studied .
With drugs , the gold standard for research is a randomized clinical trial in which some patients take a drug and others a placebo .
But vitamins are essential nutrients that people ingest in their daily diets ; there is no way to withhold them altogether from research subjects .
Avoid These SHTF Mistakes
An average person will end up making lots of mistakes amidst a SHTF disaster scenario .
In fact , even the leading disaster and survival prepping experts of the world will commit mistakes .
What does it mean ?
It means that you , too , will make the same mistakes during disaster situations .
But , although you cannot avoid making mistakes , it does n’t mean that you can not put a limit on the number of mistakes you will make .
Having said this , below are the top SHTF mistakes you should try to avoid at all cost : see What is Prepping
Mistake # 1 : Not Preparing Your Own Bug Out Bag
A bug out bag is no doubt a crucial piece you should prepare well in advance .
This is arguably the single most critical SHTF disaster preparation that anyone can ever make .
It is because if you ever find yourself forced into bugging out from your own home , your bug out bag ’s contents will and can help you survive for days or even weeks afterward .
Simply put , the bug out bag and all its contents are the most important items that you should have with you to survive .
Mistake # 2 : Not Identifying a Good Bug Out Location
Next , to your bug out bag , it is also a must to have a bug out location .
A lot of people end up neglecting the thought of bugging out since bugging in is much safer .
You are familiar with the place , you have your stockpile with you , and you are not at risk in the open road .
But , bugging in is never going to be a safer option or might not even be possible when two scenarios occur .
First , if the authorities order you to leave , and second is if death is certain when you choose to stay .
This means that you need to have a definite location in mind that is within reasonable driving distance from town .
Remember that this location does n’t need to be a cozy cabin in the woods .
This can be the home of your relative or close friend .
Also , if you have been forced to or you choose to bug out , do so hours or days in advance to avoid getting stuck in the traffic .
Mistake # 3 : Not Staying Updated Beforehand
Most people are completely caught off guard by SHTF disaster but there is no need for you to be like them .
Keep yourself always update with the happenings around you .
For instance , if you live close to the coast , you have to monitor the weather tracker and watch the news for updates on tornadoes or hurricanes that may come your way .
Mistake # 4 : Not Improving the Defenses of Your House
An average house is very easy and simple to break into .
As early as now , you have to take action to improve the defenses of your home .
It can include actions like using acrylic glass to replace the usual glass windows and installing heavy duty locks and hinges on doors .
You might also want to invest in barbed wire , sandbags , nail boards , and stakes .
You can store these in the shed or garage to easily take them up to improve the defenses of your home when SHTF strikes .
You can make it through SHTF scenarios if you avoid these mistakes .
There ’s no way to know how badly things would have gone at the Berwyn Heights , Maryland home of Cheye and Trinity Calvo if Amir Johnson had n’t shown up when he did .
Johnson , a private on the local police force , was making his accustomed rounds in the neighborhood when he saw a swarm of heavily armed men laying siege to the Calvo home .
Inside , Cheye and his mother - in - law , Georgia Porter , were being held face - down at gunpoint with their hands tied behind their backs .
The Calvo family ’s two black Labradors , Chase and Payton , were dead from gunshot wounds .
The assailants who killed the dogs were leaving bloody bootprints throughout the home .
This home invasion was , of course , a law enforcement operation , typical of “ no - knock ” drug raids conducted practically every day across the country .
The most significant difference was n’t that Cheye Calvo was completely innocent of involvement with narcotics ; innocent people are terrorized and killed by drug raiders all the time .
The key distinction here is that Mr. Calvo is Mayor of Berywn Heights .
That ’s one reason why Officer Johnson intervened to help .
“ That guy in there is crazy , ” one of the stormtroopers complained to Johnson as he emerged from the crime scene ( that is , the scene of a crime committed under color of state “ authority ” ) .
“ He says he ’s the Mayor of Berwyn Heights . ”
“ That is the Mayor of Berwyn Heights , ” Johnson told the assailant , a member of the Prince George ’s County police department ( which has overlapping jurisdiction with the town police ) .
Johnson quickly contacted Berwyn Heights Police Chief Patrick Murphy to tell him that a SWAT team had just laid waste to the Mayor ’s home and killed the family ’s dogs .
Glancing around , he could n’t see any evidence of a search warrant .
Inquiries about this omission were greeted with the assurance that the document was “ en route . ”
Then , rather than continuing on his daily rounds , Officer Johnson stayed put , in order to make sure that Mayor Calvo and his mother - in - law were n’t mysteriously hurt or killed .
“ Not that I do n’t trust the police , ” Johnson later commented to the Washington Post .
“ But I wanted to personally witness what [ was ] going to happen to my mayor , so if they [ the SWAT team ] say this guy went for a gun — and he did n’t — it ’s not going to happen on my watch . ”
Roll that comment around in your mind for just a second .
Officer Johnson stayed behind to make sure his mayor was n’t murdered by his fellow police officers .
A few days later , long after the raiders failed to find so much as a molecule of evidence to justify their criminal assault on the Calvo home , Chief Murphy publicly expressed exactly the same sentiments .
Addressing a rally on behalf of the victims , Murphy pointed out that the SWAT team declined to notify him about the impending raid , which would have permitted the Chief to help them arrange a peaceful , orderly search of the property .
“ I never imagined , when I set out to protect people from the crooks and criminals , that I would have to protect them from fellow police officers , ” Murphy regretfully declared .
Granted , it ’s entirely unfair to consolidate cops and crooks into one undifferentiated group .
Police are far more dangerous to innocent people .

Australian artists face new censorship measures
By Gabriela Zabala - Notaras
9 February 2009
The Australia Council for the Arts , the federal government 's principal arts funding body and provider of over 1,700 grants to local artists and arts organisations each year , last month released a code of behaviour for artists , exhibitors and publishers depicting children in their work .
The measures constitute an attack on freedom of expression and set a precedent for arts funding across the board .
Those who do not adhere to the new rules will not get government funding .
The code , formally known as Protocols for Working with Children , was developed after last year 's hysterical campaign against internationally renowned local photographer Bill Henson .
In May 2008 , New South Wales police shut down a Henson exhibition in Sydney , seizing photographs and threatening the photographer and gallery owners with child pornography charges .
Several state - funded galleries were then directed to remove Henson photographs from public view .
This was followed by denunciations from sections of the media against the magazine Art Monthly for publishing an entirely innocent front - page photograph of a naked five - year - old girl .
The publishers and the parents , who took the picture , artist / photographer Polixeni Papapetrou and Robert Nelson , an art critic for the Age newspaper , were accused of promoting child pornography .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd publicly vilified Henson 's work as " revolting " and told national television , referring to the Art Monthly cover , that he " could n't stand this stuff " .
Similar comments were made by several state Labor leaders .
Despite the moral hysteria , the police charges of child pornography against Henson were abandoned and Australia 's censorship body rejected any ban on his work or on the Art Monthly magazine .
The Classification Board , in fact , ruled that Henson 's exhibition was " not sexualised to any degree " and later gave the Art Monthly an unrestricted rating , making it available to anyone over 15 years .
Right - wing commentators and so - called child protection advocate , Hetty Johnson , responded with calls for law changes regarding the portrayal of children .
While Labor introduced no new legislation — state and federal laws already protect children from all forms of exploitation —
Peter Garrett , the federal government 's arts minister , directed the Australia Council and Screen Australia to formulate a code of behaviour for artists working with children .
The new protocols are the end result .
Under the guidelines , which came into effect on January 1 , Australian artists will have to provide a declaration accompanying their work stating their compliance with existing state and federal laws when images of children under 18 are used in performances or exhibitions .
Without such a declaration , artists will be required to have their images reviewed by Australia 's censorship authority prior to any exhibition or distribution of their work .
Artists are also required to ensure that the context of the work is explained to the child and that the parents or guardians and the child understand the " nature and intended outcome of the work " .
The Australia Council does not specify how it would be possible for any artist to guarantee that others understand the intended outcome of his or her artwork .
Artists ' protests ignored
Prior to releasing the protocols , the Australia Council sought submissions as part of its " consultation process " .
Numbers of Australian artists and writers spoke out in the media and presented documents to the arts funding body opposing the planned protocols .
On October 8 , Australian writer Frank Moorhouse told the Age newspaper that the planned protocols were " the most dangerous movement in the arts in my life time " .
" Creating protocols is itself an infringement of freedom of the arts especially when they form part of the guidelines of the central , publicly funded , arts funding body .
If the Australia Council wanted to protect and promote art , it would oppose this directive from government . "
No artist , he added , especially in the digital age , could guarantee that images would not be used inappropriately or out of the original intended context .
( See : " Writer protests new censorship measures — Frank Moorhouse speaks with WSWS " )
Polixeni Papapetrou commented in the Australian : " The Australia Council has a new brief , to be a watchdog , in fact a quasi - legislator on behalf of children .
It has been forced into the role by the commonwealth , which is historically unprecedented .
I would have thought that it is the role of parents to do this " .
Legal experts and gallery curators made submissions not only describing the protocols as undemocratic but pointing out that they were " administratively unworkable for both artists and institutions " , " impractical " , " impossible " and " prohibitive " .
These presentations were largely ignored and only minor changes made to the initial draft .
Some of these included modifying parental consent obligations , reducing paperwork , and exempting cartoons , drawings or digital creations " made entirely from imagination " from the protocols .
Only images of " real " children — i.e. , those not imagined — are subject to the protocols .
The most repressive aspect of the guidelines is that they require retrospective documentation of compliance for images of nude or partly nude children taken over the last 18 years .
This documentation will need to be reviewed by the Classification Board before such images can be exhibited .
In other words , works such as Henson's , which until now been have exhibited nationally and internationally and have not broken any state or federal laws , will be required to undergo review by Australia 's censorship body .
Aside from their anti-democratic character , the protocols present a multitude of almost impossible bureaucratic hoops through which artists and galleries will have to jump .
For example , prior to any future exhibition containing work produced by Henson in the last 18 years and featuring children , the photographer would be forced to track down the people involved , most of whom would be adults , and procure written confirmation of their own or their guardians ' consent for work produced at the time .
What happens if any of those portrayed are untraceable or have died ?
Does that mean that the artist 's work cannot be exhibited or distributed ?
Another contentious issue is that only depictions of real children will come under scrutiny , but not those images derived from " fantasy " or imagined .
How is a viewer , editor , curator or censor to determine whether a painting or image is of a " real " child or an image conjured up by the artist , or an amalgam of several sources ?
Another requirement that impinges on artistic spontaneity , a crucial element in the creative process , is the requirement for parental consent before a child is featured .
Should an artist photograph their own child naked and then decide at a later point that the photograph has artistic merit , its exhibition or distribution could be prevented on the grounds that the artist had not sought a police check or signed a declaration of adherence to the protocols prior to taking the photo .
Robert Nelson commented on this conundrum in the Age on January 7 in an article entitled " We 're being treated like suspected criminals " .
" Every judge would be sympathetic to a spontaneous work done in good faith , and there was a sense that the law was on the artists ' side .
But now , artists ignoring the protocols will be stymied , " Nelson wrote .
" No gallery or magazine funded by the Australia Council will show the work unless full compliance can be guaranteed .
Frozen out by the higher zones of the system , any work lacking full compliance is unlikely to appeal to commercial galleries either .
Any spontaneous photograph is condemned to artistic exile if a child in it accepts direction from the photographer . "
Kathy Keele , Australia Council 's chief executive officer , writing in the December issue of the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies claimed that the protocols would have " no impact on our assessment of artistic excellence measures " and were " voluntary " .
While there is no law to enforce the Australia Council 's guidelines , Keele 's claims are an attempt to downplay the anti-democratic character of the new measures .
Notwithstanding her effort to portray the measures as " voluntary " they establish a new government funding benchmark that can and will be used to intimidate and silence artists and suppress their work .
As from January 1 , all applicants for grants from the Australia Council , which has an annual budget of over $ 160 million , will have to certify that they are aware of and comply with the protocols .
Applicants who refuse will be denied government funding .
These measures constitute a further serious erosion of the rights of artists , and they form part of an ongoing government assault on the democratic rights of the working class as a whole .
Having failed to succeed in censoring Henson and others through the existing channels , the Rudd government , through the Arts Council , which it fully funds , is seeking to introduce supra-legal measures through the back door .

Yet another product has been added to the list of new and innovative things we can make from corn .
Recently , Dupont Tate & Lyle Bio Products announced that , working in conjunction with Kilfrost , a major producer of de - and anti-icing fluids for aircraft , they have come up with a new de-icer derived from non-petroleum sources — namely , corn and sugar .
Dupont is making this new de-icer from a proprietary concoction called Susterra propanediol , a specialty glycol that they proudly state they make from entirely sustainable sources .
DFSustain , the new de-icing agent , is the first in what both companies hope will be a series of sustainable , eco-friendly aviation products used as de-icers and coolants .
Kilfrost claims their new fluid functions in temperatures as low as - 40 °C and that it requires 40 % less energy to manufacture while out - performing all other comparable products on the market .
Their claims are currently being put to the test .
Flybe , the largest regional airline in Europe , is using the new green fluid in their fleet this winter .
If DFSustain can live up to Kilfrost ’s estimates , it will reduce the airline ’s carbon footprint by 140 tons this season alone .

I 'm sorry .
I 'm very sorry , but I do n't accept those bankers ' apologies .
I found them offensive .
A preening pack of middle - aged white men in suits , parroting the instructions of their PR advisers .
Utterly insincere .
An apology was not enough .
A heart attack would have been better .
One each .
Or a stroke , just like the new NHS advertisements : face droops , arms fall limply by the side , meaningless drivel issues from the mouth , and their head catches fire .
I 'm sorry if that offends any middle - aged white men .
I apologise if my remarks have been misconstrued to cause offence to people in suits , or to the suit - making industry , which is struggling in these difficult times , and about time , too ; frankly I would n't care if they all went belly - up and the bankers had to walk around naked with their shrivelled privates dangling beneath their smug little white paunches .
I apologise for saying I would n't care if they all went belly - up .
I also apologise for any offence I may have given to people with shrivelled privates .
I am sorry if my remarks have offended heart - attack or stroke victims .
I apologise to anyone whose head has caught fire , and I am sorry I said " victims " when the correct phrase is " persons of heart attack " or " cerebrally vascular - accidented individuals " .
I also apologise to anyone who may have found my finding the bankers ' apologies offensive , offensive .
On the other hand , I do wonder what the hell is going on and why everyone has become such milquetoasts , so sensitive and quick to be affronted and just so generally bloody wet .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
I apologise to everyone for calling them affronted , sensitive , wet bloody milquetoasts .
I find this constant clamour for apology offensive .
I demand a full apology .
I am a man of the Zeitgeist .
The cringe has become the posture du jour .
( I apologise for the use of the phrase " du jour " which may cause offence as being élitist and hurtful to non-francophones . )
( I apologise for putting the accent on " elitist " . )
But it has gone on long enough .
We are tired of it , and if you do n't agree , be quiet .
Your opinion is worthless and all your friends make hand gestures behind your back when you go to the loo .
Some even follow you in and make hand gestures outside the cubicle .
You did n't know that , did you ?
You thought it was cruising homosexuals , overcome by desire but they could n't pick the cubicle lock because security staff had taken away their Leatherman tools .
I apologise for the implication that homosexuals " cruise " in " loos " .
I apologise for the possibly offensively homophobic use of the word " Leatherman " when I could have said " Gerber " or " Victorinox " , but I just could n't resist a cheap gag .
Fortunately , I have been able to resist the cheap gag about the phrase " cheap gag " or I would have to top myself .
I apologise to friends and families of suicide victims for saying " top myself " .
I apologise , though I am not sure to whom , for wondering whether there might not be something logically iffy about the phrase " suicide victims " .
Let 's not go there .
I apologise if that last remark offends anyone who has gone there , particularly against their will .
Slaves .
Descendants of slaves .
Soldiers .
GI brides .
Travelling salesmen .
People who thought the satnav knew what the hell it was talking about .
Everyone .
We 've all been there .
Sorry .
OK ?
Sorry .
Enough of this offended lark and apology twazzocks .
We 've flogged it to death , and I am damned if I will apologise for my use of " flogged " which may offend victims of flogging .
( I apologise for my use of the word " damned " as I now realise it may cause of offence to the differently afterlifed . )
Twenty years since Salman Rushdie got into trouble for saying – and I will not be gagged here – " Mmmph mm mmph mmmphmm mmph " and still on it goes .
Rushdie offended an entire religion of several , disparate oral theologies , most of whom thought , " Bit tasteless , " and a small minority of whom thought " Let 's whack the bugger . "
The ensuing brouhaha and consequent expense proved conclusively that the sword is actually much mightier than the pen .
But Rushdie is a man of letters , and a subtle one .
I remember going round to supper at Terry Jones 's house .
The former Python 's wife rang me that lunchtime to check I was coming , which was unusual .
I arrived with a large , clanking bag full of none of your business .
" What 's that ? " she said .
" The usual , " I said , " bombs , daggers , grenades , ninja throwing - stars . "
The following conversation then took place :

Her : Ha ha ha !
Me : Ha ha ha !
Armed policeman , appearing from front room :
Er , have you got any vinegar , Mrs Jones , just that my wife 's given me beetroot sandwiches and they need a bit more vinegar .
Her : Right ho .
Armed policeman disappears back into front room .
Me : Who was that ?
Her : One of Salman 's bodyguards .
Me : Oh .
Her : Salman 's come to supper .
Me :
But what about all that stuff I said ?
About bombs and daggers ?
Her :
They probably thought you were joking .
But Salman had clearly refined his insulting methodologies since The Satanic Verses .
Over supper it came out that I was off to Australia the following day to do some research for a book .
" Going to Alice Springs ? " said Salman .
" Should think so , " I said .
" Read Bruce 's book about the songlines ? " he said .
" It 's called The Songlines . "
" Yes , " I said .
" There 's a chap in Alice Springs .
An Aboriginal bloke , " said Salman .
He explained how I could locate this man .
" Ask him about Bruce , " he said .
" Just say to him , ' What did you make of Bruce Chatwin ? ' "
" Why ? " I said .
" What about Chatwin ? "
" No no no , " said Salman , wagging an admonitory finger .
" No ; I do n't want to poison your mind against Bruce . "
It was masterly , way beyond calling Gordon Brown a one - eyed Scottish idiot .
The effect was permanent , and even a professional affrontee , a bought - and - paid - for mollycoddler , a single - issue , moist - eyed taker - of - offence with all the intellectual and moral qualities of a toothless hag crying stinking fish on the Piraeus dockside ... even such a one as that could not have found anything to rail against or to demand an apology for .
Sir Salman eventually did apologise for the " offence " he gave to Muslims , which must have been a bit offensive to those Muslims who did n't think their God or their Prophet needed defending against something a fictional character said in a novel which had been made up ( by a chap who went to Oundle ) ; equally offensive to those Muslims who are just Muslims in the way so many Englishmen are C of E : because of an accident of birth and an affable inclination to go with the flow .
And where does that leave all those other religions that believe Islam is mistaken and that Mohammed ( peace be upon him , no more nor less than any other man ) ( or , of course , woman ) may have been a very interesting chap but was not a prophet , including the subset that believes that God / Allah is altogether nonsensical and that the Creator of the Universe lives in a hole in a tree , look , that tree , no , the one next to it , see ?
Would they not find Sir Salman 's apology offensive ?
Would it not have been logical to demand he therefore apologise for the apology ?
Did n't think of that , did they ?
They would now .
The apology has become the defining gesture of the age .
Russell Brand had to apologise for making off - colour remarks .
Jeremy Clarkson – a man who would eat his own testicles rather than petition for an apology , even though he'd have to remove them from his own personal brain where they 've been living for all these years – had to apologise for making a startlingly fine joke about lorry drivers , and , subsequently for calling Gordon Brown a " one-eyed Scottish idiot " at a press conference in Australia .
His calling Gordon Brown a " one-eyed Scottish idiot " would probably have escaped much attention had it not been for the BBC – powerfully complicit in driving the Apology Culture – publishing on its website a video of Clarkson calling Gordon Brown a " one-eyed Scottish idiot " accompanied by a story saying that Clarkson 's calling Gordon Brown a " one-eyed Scottish idiot " had " provoked anger in Scotland " .
We might find some comfort across the Atlantic , where the Apology Culture has become even tackier and more insane than here .
President Obama apologised for the sins of his cabinet appointees , on five different TV networks in seven different ways .
This was n't for something he had done .
It was n't for something other people had done who had falsely got into positions of power .
Obama was apologising for something two other people had done who had n't got into positions of power because what they 'd done had been found out .
So what ( we might ask ) was President Obama actually apologising for ?
Modern life has become a blizzard of breast - beating and self - excoriation .
Carol
Thatcher will have to apologise for not apologising unreservedly for saying in a private conversation that a tennis player reminded her of a golliwog .
Whether her apology for not apologising unreservedly will have to be an unreserved apology , or just an ordinary one , remains to be seen .
Certainly , the " private occasion " defence no longer works : in the surveillance age , no communication or action is private once it has been made public .
We have had apologies for drug use ( Alex Rodriguez , a baseball player ) , for drug abuse ( Michael Phelps , a man who won more medals than most countries , but who took a hit at a bong ) , for holocaust denial ( Bishop Richard Williamson ) , for not knowing about Bishop Williamson 's holocaust denial ( the Pope ) , for hugging a classmate ( a five - year - old girl in Massachusetts ) , for 700 years of persecution ( the Pope , to the Knights Templar : petition made but not yet granted ) and for misinterpreting the phrase " be careful " ( the TV programme American Idol , which one of the show 's judges thought was a threat but which was in fact a well - known version of " goodbye " in the South ) .
A Selby councillor had to apologise to her colleagues for forwarding an email allegedly drawing attention to abuses of human rights under Sharia law but which was really drawing attention to the fact that it was a hoax .
And in all this , we 're left wondering what the offence was , and what the apology was intended to deliver .
Take the Clarkson insult , which " provoked anger in Scotland " .
Never mind the anger ; that 's the default " ON " position in the red - top universe .
We go straight from a supine apathy to anger .
Nothing in between ; and since supine apathy never sold papers , the base - line posture is inarticulate rage .
This kind of rage is what you might call a " hubry " , a word I just made up and which derives from the Greek , hubris .
A hubry is a symbol or a behaviour supposed to indicate the empowered status of the individual concerned , but in fact indicates the exact opposite .
Driving aggressively in your company Mondeo is a hubry : it 's supposed to say you 're potent and like mega - alpha , right ?
But actually it says your a twat .
BlackBerrying on holiday : another hubry , saying not that you 're a hot shot , but a minion , not allowed to be out of touch ever .
And anger , affrontedness and the taking of offence are military - grade hubries , revealing , not superhuman sensitivity but a petty , snivelling , clerkish powerlessness .
If sentimentality is addressing the unaddressable , anger is sentimentality with an ape - scowl , and the apology is its obverse .
So much for anger , but what of the anger Clarkson supposedly " provoked " ?
First of all , he did n't provoke it .
He did n't sit there thinking : " I know : I 'll make Scottish people angry . "
He sat there thinking : " Gordon Brown 's a clod .
What a bozo .
The fellow's a complete dork .
And I 'm so going to say so . "
It was the people of Scotland ( and how many people do you need to be angry before you can talk about " anger in Scotland " ? ) who made themselves angry because the media told them they should be .
But why ?
Clarkson did n't say that all Scottish people are one - eyed .
He did n't say that all one - eyed people are idiots .
He did n't say that Scottish people are idiots .
What he said was :
1 ) Gordon Brown is one - eyed .
2 ) Gordon Brown is Scottish .
3 ) Gordon Brown is an idiot .
So ( we might ask ) what the hell is it that those angry Scottish people were angry about ?
They can't be angry at the notion that a Scotchman can be an idiot , since the idiot is a staple of Scottish mythology ; no other nation would take the majestically drunken Glasgow numpty to its heart with such joy .
They can't be angry that Gordon Brown has one eye , since having one eye is ( a ) a mild misfortune and ( b ) considered raffish , piratical and sexy war - wound .
So the only thing left is that they are angry because Gordon Brown is Scottish .
Which is not something Clarkson can apologise for .
But in the end it was the roll - over - and - whimper BBC that demanded the apology , bowing from pressure to the RNIB , which with startling illogicality announced that " any suggestion that equates disability with incompetence is totally unacceptable " , despite the fact that Clarkson 's comment was not an equation .
An equation is something like 1 + 2 = 3 ; Clarkson 's comment simply said " 1 , 2 , 3 " which is a different thing : a playground jibe battening on idiosyncracies , just as I was called " four - eyes " and a chap who wore a leg - brace was called " Twizzle " , and another boy who had an odd tic he did with his jaw was called " Crick " .
We are designed to spot differences and I was no more excluded or disliked for being Four - Eyes than Crick was for clicking his jawbone in Geog ( Mr Clarke ) or Twizzle was for creaking .
I 've dwelt on Clarkson 's insult , not because it was egregious ( though it was splendid , and will remain with Brown for ever ) but because it 's easy to analyse .
And analysis – clear thinking – is something that 's been overwhelmed by the knee - jerk , sound - bite hubriasts of the politically correct .
People like an apology .
Something our mothers used to say went like this :
Mother : Apologise .
Us , mumbling : Sorry .
Mother : Say it as if you mean it .
The truth behind this is the words " as if " .
No mother wants us to mean it because they know we do n't .
What they want is for us to fake it against our will .
As William Miller points out in his book Faking It .
" The fake apology , " Miller observes , " is often better than the genuine , ' meant ' one , because the obvious fake , issued through gritted teeth , has equally obviously cost the apologiser more effort to make , and thus includes penance as well as self - abasement . "
That 's partly why we felt dissatisfied with the Four Bankers on Tuesday .
Coached by their PRs , they were too smooth , too comfortable with their dissimulation .
We wanted to see them sweat , stare at the ground and finally apologise with absolute insincerity , through gritted teeth .
( The other reason we were dissatisfied was because they may have gone through the motions of apology but we want them to lose all their money , just like they 've lost all ours .
Simply foregoing this year 's bonus is not enough .
We want to see them in council houses , on benefits , eating own - brand beans . )
We might wonder why there 's so much emphasis on words .
These are n't " performative " words like a judge declaring you bankrupt .
These are n't words which change anything , neither , often , are they the original words or the words of apology .
Perhaps we get so heated up about words because , whatever those who play at Security Theatre may want us to think ( and they mostly want us to feel frightened ) , the modern world is a very safe place .
Most of the time , the only thing we have to worry about is words , and it 's notable that it is the affluent middle class who are insisting on the absolute blandness of public discourse , perhaps from a sort of valorising of feelings .
When your survival is guaranteed , when you 're warm and well - fed and sheltered and clean and free of disease , what else is there to worry about , to pick over and fiddle with and endlessly obsess over , than your feelings ?
And , by extension , everyone else 's feelings , too .
Despite its best beliefs and its self - image as edgy , incisive , au courant , the BBC remains the great moral cathedral of the affluent middle class .
It 's no surprise that it has appointed itself the guardian of the Apology Culture ; nor that its own website 's Have Your Say section is populated by the most savage knuckleheaded bigotry and Little Englander protectionism anywhere in the British media .
Readiness to be affronted and insistence on apology is not about equality or fairness , but about intolerance , of error and of mockery .
It is a ludicrous hubry .
Do we really want to be like that ?
And does anyone remember asking the BBC to appoint itself Enforcer - General ?
What offends you ?
Carol Thatcher 's attitude to multicultural Britain , Russell Brand 's telephone manner ?
Or are you more offended by those who try to tell us what we can and cannot say ?

LAS VEGAS , Nevada ( CNN ) --
Now you see it , now you do n't .
David and Janelle Shimshi 's lack of income has left them struggling to pay for daughter Shalom 's preschool .
Las Vegas magician David Shimshi used to work as house magician at the famous Mirage hotel and performed with the World 's Greatest Magicians show at the Greek Isles Casino .
Now Shimshi , as he 's known to everyone , including his wife Janelle , has seen his gigs disappear , a victim of the struggling economy .
" We 're in a challenging time right now , " says Terry Jicinsky , senior vice president of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority .
Shimshi's job these days is Mr. Mom , taking care of his 3 - year - old daughter Shalom , while his wife Janelle works for a local caterer .
Janelle Shimshi has her own loss to deal with .
Her life - long dream of owning a small business went bust .
The Shimshis took their life savings and invested in a Smoothie King franchise .
" It looked so promising and it just grew every month , " says Janelle Shimshi .
But nine months after they opened , the customers stopped coming in .
" You think about it ...
Do I want to spend $ 4.50 on a smoothie or do I want to go put gas in my car ? " she says .
The Shimshis are n't the only ones to lose .
They once pulled in more than $ 10,000 each month , much of which they put right back into the Las Vegas economy .
They cancelled their home phone service , pool service , and a monthly pest control service that kept a scorpion problem in check .
Restaurants are out along with the tanning spa for Janelle .
When their large - screen TV died recently , there was no money to replace it , said the Shimshis .
Watch the magician 's struggle »
The couple 's daughter Shalom attended a preschool five days a week .
With neither parent working , they could n't afford the $ 875 monthly tuition .
But the school stepped in to help .
Ner Tamid preschool director Lonnie Kritzler says she has been hearing from a family each week that a job is lost and tuition will be hard to make .
" The Rabbi is helping out , " says Kritzler .
The school is providing " scholarship money to help in that situation .
There 's no way we could close the doors to any of the children or their parents . "
Shimshi is no vanishing act .
He 's working on a business plan to perform at trade - show display booths for major companies .
He 's willing to work just to prove he can bring in the crowds .
He even says he 's willing to take his pay later , when the company 's business improves .
CNN 's Dan Simon and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report .

A police officer who was videotaped knocking a man off his bicycle and onto the ground during a cycling event in Manhattan last summer has resigned , the Police Department said .
Paul J. Browne , the Police Department ’s chief spokesman , said the officer , Patrick Pogan , 23 , resigned about 10 days ago .
Mr. Pogan was accused last year of assault and of filing false paperwork related to the arrest of the cyclist and was suspended from the department .
The Manhattan district attorney ’s office dropped the charges  attempted assault , resisting arrest and disorderly conduct  against the cyclist , Christopher Long .
Mr. Browne said on Thursday that the firing stemmed directly from the events involving Mr. Long , which took place on July 25 during a monthly event known as Critical Mass , in which hundreds of cyclists ride through the city to advocate nonpolluting forms of transportation .
R. Allen Stanford , the Texas billionaire charged Tuesday with perpetrating an $ 8 - billion investment fraud , cast himself as offshore investment guru to the transatlantic jet set and benefactor to the Caribbean islands ’ poor through multimillion - dollar promotions of their beloved sport of cricket .
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Stanford and two other principals of his investment and banking empire in a complaint alleging massive fraud just two months after the investment operation of former Nasdaq Chairman Bernard Madoff collapsed .
A federal judge froze the assets of Stanford and three of his financial services companies and appointed a receiver to marshal what funds could be located .
“ Stanford and the close circle of family and friends with whom he runs his businesses perpetrated a massive fraud based on false promises and fabricated historical return data to prey on investors , ” said Linda Chatman Thomsen , director of the SEC ’s enforcement division .
“ We are moving quickly and decisively in this enforcement action to stop this fraudulent conduct and preserve assets for investors . ”

The SEC called Stanford ’s promises of high - interest returns on his bank ’s certificates “ improbable and unsubstantiated . ”
The 25 - page complaint filed in federal court in Dallas cast doubt on Stanford ’s claims of a “ unique investment strategy ” that allowed the bank to achieve double - digit returns on its investments over the last 15 years .
Also charged were James Davis , Stanford International Bank Ltd.'s chief financial officer , and Laura Pendergest - Holt , Stanford Financial Group ’s chief investment officer .
The SEC said the trio had engaged in “ a fraud of shocking magnitude that has spread its tentacles throughout the world . ”
Stanford and Davis , former Baylor University roommates , refused to cooperate with investigators , the SEC complaint said .
It was n’t immediately clear how much of the Stanford empire would be subject to the SEC action .
Federal investigators raided his Houston offices and shut them down , but much of the financial services group is based abroad , primarily on the tiny Caribbean island of Antigua , part of the two - island country of Antigua & Barbuda .

Stanford Group is regulated and audited by the Financial Services Regulatory Commission of Antigua & Barbuda .
Commission Chairman Leroy King told Reuters news service Tuesday that he had n’t initiated any special probe of Stanford ’s operations because the commission had n’t received any complaints from island citizens .
“ We have no credible information coming to us to say that they are not sound , ” King said .
However , news agencies later reported a run on the Bank of Antigua , a Stanford entity that was not named in the SEC complaint .
Stanford ’s whereabouts were unknown .
He has homes in Texas , Antigua & Barbuda and the U.S. Virgin Islands .
A duty officer for the U.S. Marshals Service declined to say whether a warrant had been issued for Stanford ’s arrest or whether the billionaire had been taken into custody .

Stanford Financial Group has offices in 14 U.S. cities in addition to its operations in the Caribbean .
Neither Brian Bertsch , a spokesman for Stanford Group , nor Rose Romero , the SEC ’s Fort Worth regional director , responded to The Times ’ inquiries about what authority the U.S. financial watchdog might wield over Stanford ’s foreign - based assets .
As with other offshore investment havens such as the Cayman Islands and Bermuda , U.S. regulation is probably limited to the taxable revenues of U.S. citizens or corporations .
Lawyers familiar with international investment law pointed out that U.S. regulators lack the authority to seize assets abroad without the foreign country ’s assistance .

“ The ability of the United States to go after someone in a foreign country , or to go after someone ’s assets in a foreign country -- it varies but it ’s generally difficult , ” said Bob Klueger , a wealth management attorney in Los Angeles .
He added that the reason investors often go to foreign countries is the absence of formal treaties obliging local governments to cooperate in putting crooked offshore entities out of business .
Stanford , 58 , acquired Antigua & Barbuda citizenship a decade ago and was bestowed the title of knight commander by the British Commonwealth nation in 2006 , allowing him to become known of late as “ Sir Allen . ”
In December , Stanford Group initiated a monthly newsletter to investors to calm their concerns over world markets and the failure of Madoff ’s alleged $ 50 - billion Ponzi scheme .
“ We want our depositors to know that SIBL had no direct or indirect exposure to any of Madoff ’s investments , ” Stanford ’s 30,000 clients were told .
“ Just as the bank had no direct or indirect exposure to the securitized debt or subprime meltdown . ”

The SEC also alleged that Stanford Group used false performance data to generate $ 1.2 billion in sales through its Stanford Allocation Strategy .
The program grew from less than $ 10 million in 2004 to more than $ 1 billion , producing returns for Stanford of $ 25 million in each of the last two years .
An employee at Stanford ’s Miami offices , which occupy three floors of a downtown building , said the staff had n’t been given any direction in how it should deal with its Caribbean operations in the wake of the SEC action .
“ Everything is normal in our office , ” said executive assistant Hycha Moreno .
Stanford is the 205th - wealthiest person in the United States , with a net worth of $ 2.2 billion , according to the 2008 Forbes Rich List .

His anticipated fall from local hero status could worsen what is already a strained U.S. relationship with Antigua & Barbuda .
U.S. politicians and social conservatives targeted the islands ’ online gambling industries on grounds that Internet betting lured vulnerable students into vice and debt .
About 10 % of the islands ’ workers were employed in online gaming in the late 1990s , and all but a handful have lost their jobs as national income from the once - thriving sector has fallen to less than $ 20 million a year now from a high of $ 90 million a year .
Stanford was best known in the Caribbean playground for his transformation of cricket from a sport of the elite to a shortened version more amenable to tournament play and the work schedules of its avid island fans .
The sport , wildly popular throughout the former British Empire , involves bats , balls , runs and innings but bears little other resemblance to baseball .
Stanford inaugurated the 20/20 Tournament in the summer of 2006 , awarding $ 1 - million prizes to winners of the competition and $ 6 million to support the establishment of 20 regional teams .
He also built the Stanford Cricket Grounds , the West Indies Cricket Hall of Fame and the Sticky Wicket Restaurant near Antigua ’s VC Bird International Airport outside the capital of St. John’s .
The stadium stands at the base of a street lined with four - story , teal buildings housing Stanford Group , Stanford International Bank Ltd. , Stanford Development Co. and Stanford Trust Co. Ltd .

In June , Stanford and the English Cricket Board signed a deal to stage five England - West Indies 20 /20 matches with a $ 20 - million prize fund , an agreement that was scuttled by the English side after word of the SEC action disquieted potential sponsors .

Protesters picketed the paper 's New York City offices
The New York Post newspaper has apologised to readers offended by a cartoon some people say was a racist depiction of President Barack Obama .
Cartoonist Sean Delonas drew police having shot dead a chimp , saying " they 'll have to find someone else to write the stimulus bill " .
The paper said it had been meant to " mock an ineptly written " bill .
Commentators had denounced the cartoon , and protesters picketed the newspaper 's headquarters .
" To those who were offended by the image , we apologise , " the paper said in an editorial .
However , the paper went on to accuse " some in the media and in public life who have had differences with the Post in the past " of using the row over the cartoon " as an opportunity for payback " .
How commentators first reacted to the cartoon " To them , no apology is due , " the paper said .
" Sometimes a cartoon is just a cartoon - even as the opportunists seek to make it something else , " it concluded .
On Tuesday President Obama signed into law a $ 787bn ( £ 548 bn ) economic stimulus package .
The plan only passed through Congress after weeks of political wrangling .
' Racist drivel '
The New York Post said earlier that the cartoon was " a clear parody of a current news event , to wit the shooting of a violent chimp in Connecticut .
It broadly mocks Washington 's efforts to revive the economy , " said editor - in - chief Col Allen .
It was widely reported in the US that a pet chimp was shot in Stamford , Connecticut , on Monday after a serious and disfiguring attack on a friend of its owner .
Mr Allen 's explanation was rejected by Andrew Rojecki , co-author of the book The Black Image in the White Mind .
To compare the nation 's first African - American commander - in - chief to a dead chimpanzee is nothing short of racist drivel
Barbara Ciara
National Association of Black Journalists
" The cops are saying , ' Someone 's going to have to write the next stimulus bill . '
Well , who wrote the last stimulus bill ?
It 's Obama and the Democratic Party , but really it 's associated with one person - and that 's Obama , " Mr Rojecki told the Chicago Tribune .
" How could The Post let this cartoon pass as satire ? " asked Barbara Ciara , president of the National Association of Black Journalists , in a statement .
" To compare the nation 's first African - American commander - in - chief to a dead chimpanzee is nothing short of racist drivel . "
Blog posts on the topic attracted hundreds of angry comments , while complainants reportedly jammed the newspaper switchboard and protested outside its headquarters .
The civil rights campaigner Al Sharpton said he associated the cartoon with " historic racist attacks " which depicted African - Americans as " synonymous with monkeys " .
Cartoonist Sean Delonas has stirred controversy before , with cartoons which have made fun of Heather Mills 's amputated leg and depicted Muslims as terrorists .
WHAT WAS SAID ABOUT THE CARTOON Editorial writers and cartoonists certainly have a right to criticize the bill and its supporters .
But this attempt at humor or satire or whatever else it was intended to be fell far short of the mark .
Gabe Pressman , MSNBC
The drawing , from famed cartoonist Sean Delonas , is rife with violent imagery and racial undertones .
The Huffington Post , which received thousands of comments .
What could be seen as silly humor if President George W Bush were in the White House has to be seen through the lens of America 's racist past .
Roland S Martin , CNN
As an African American , I must admit the cartoon made my bile rise somewhat when I contemplated it .
But political cartoonists generally aim for the topically provocative , not the politically correct .
On that level , Delonas succeeded .
Frank James , The Swamp
It is worth noting that congressional Democrats wrote the bill , not Obama or anyone in the White House .
If the conservative New York Post is calling Harry Reid , Max Baucus and Nancy Pelosi a bunch of monkeys , is that worth Sharpton getting worked up about ?
The Guardian 's Deadline USA Blog I 'm not one to shy away from calling people or things out for being racist .
I just think that some small amount of thought has to go into something for it to actually be racist .
Dennis DiClaudio in Comedy Central 's Indecision blog Return to the story A clear parody of a current news story or a crude joke ?

Home > News > Body Scanners That Reveal Your Naked Body Going Into U.S. Airports
Imagine a futuristic world where security is so tight that just to take a flight you have to be scanned by a machine that can look under your clothes and give security officers a perfect look at the precise form of your naked body - including your private parts .
Well , the future is now .
You might not be so eager to take that next flight after you read this .
" Body scanners " that give operators a very clear image of what is underneath your clothing have replaced metal detectors at Tulsa 's airport .
We wanted to put up a picture of what these " body scans " look like , but we were hesitant because they actually do border on pornography .
These body scans are the closest thing to viewing a person 's naked body without actually seeing their skin .
Officials in Australia where they have installed similar machines confess that these machines DO show people 's private parts .
Cheryl Johnson , the general manager of the Office of Transport Security in Australia , admitted the following about these machines : " It will show the private parts of people , but what we 've decided is that we 're not going to blur those out , because it severely limits the detection capabilities . "
She also added this comment : " It is possible to see genitals and breasts while they 're going through the machine , though . "
But all in the name of " security " , eh ?
Now to board a plane you have to subject yourself to having one or more " security " guards view the naked form of your body .
Tulsa International Airport is just the first airport where these body scanners will be tested in the United States .
San Francisco , Las Vegas , Miami , Albuquerque and Salt Lake City will join the body scanning test in the next two months .
According to ABC
News , the TSA plans to install 600 of these machines in airports across the nation this year .
Are you as disturbed by all of this as we are ?
If so , please feel free to leave a comment .....
If the Chinese give their approval to the deal , Rio Tinto hopes to announce the capital - raising with its results on February 12th .
Rio is also planning to sell part of its stake in Escondida , the world 's biggest copper mine , in Chile .
Experts said Rio Tinto's stake in the mine could be worth as much as $ 6bn ( £ 4.1 bn ) .
Rio Tinto has been in talks to sell its packaging arm , which is estimated by analysts to be worth more than $ 3bn ( £ 2.1 bn ) , for several months .
Amcor , the American packaging giant , is understood to have engaged UBS , the investment bank , to advise it on a bid .
Ms. Kennedy made headlines around the world last week after alerting the governor that she wanted the job .
She then began a public tour , meeting with political leaders around the state , and quickly cemented herself as the dominant contender for the seat .

“ Precisely because there is no campaign or election , she should be more willing to disclose and subject herself to a greater level of public scrutiny than is required , ” said Dick Dadey , executive director of Citizens Union , a nonpartisan watchdog group .
He noted that other major contenders for the Senate seat  officeholders like the attorney general , Andrew M. Cuomo , and Representative Kirsten Gillibrand  have mounted runs for office and filed public disclosures before .
Others wonder if Ms. Kennedy ’s unwillingness to disclose personal information suggests she lacks the stomach for the kind of intrusive questions that could come her way as a candidate in 2010 .
“ If this were an open primary , and all the people seeking that position had to run , she ’d have to make all those disclosures , so why not in the appointment process ? ” said Bob Edgar , president of Common Cause , a watchdog group that lobbies for tighter ethics rules .
“ She ca n’t simply ride in on her name recognition or place in history .
The voters and people of New York deserve that full disclosure . ”
Fred Wertheimer , president of Democracy 21 , another watchdog group , warned that requiring financial disclosure by “ anyone who is speculated about ” for such a vacancy could be untenable .
“ I would think it would be up to her , ” he said .
But he called Ms. Kennedy ’s campaign for the appointment “ kind of unique . ”
So far , on her tour , Ms. Kennedy has taken just 11 questions from reporters , has granted no interviews , and responded only in writing to inquiries about her positions on significant issues .
“ She needs to deepen the public ’s idea of who she is , ” said Paul Light , a professor at New York University ’s Wagner School of Public Service .
“ To the extent she can be more transparent , she dispels the notion that it ’s all about her name .
We obviously know that she ’s quite wealthy , but beyond that , we do n’t know much about where she gets her income , how she ’s invested , whether she has followed her own principles in her investing activities , and so forth .
That would be very useful to know . ”
President Obama and his congressional allies took a modest step toward reshaping the nation ’s healthcare system Thursday as the Senate passed legislation to expand health insurance for children .
But rather than building momentum for the sweeping healthcare reform Obama has promised , the victory on Capitol Hill -- a largely party - line vote , 66 to 32 -- marked a rocky start for what many hope will be the biggest reform campaign in a generation .
“ To start out the year on this note does not bode well for future healthcare discussions , including health reform , ” Sen. Orrin G. Hatch ( R - Utah ) warned his colleagues as the Senate debated the children ’s health insurance bill , which would enlarge the current program for helping children of the so - called working poor .
Like Wednesday ’s battle over the economic stimulus package , expansion of the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program became engulfed in a partisan struggle .

The stimulus debate also showcased several skirmishes among interest groups , despite the consensus that seemed to be developing among many last year around health reform .
Business and consumer groups scuffled over federally subsidized health insurance for jobless Americans in the stimulus package .
Insurers faced off with privacy advocates over access to patients ’ electronic health records , which the stimulus bill would promote .
And foreshadowing what will probably be a much larger debate , Republicans rebelled at Democratic moves to expand the federal government ’s role in providing health insurance .
Nine GOP senators backed the children ’s health bill Thursday ; in 2007 , 18 backed similar legislation .
Advertisement
The current bill -- which parallels one approved in the House two weeks ago -- would cover an additional 4 million children at an estimated cost of nearly $ 33 billion over the next 4 1/2 years .
SCHIP , as the program is called , helps states provide health insurance for families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid , the federal medical insurance program for the poor , but not enough to buy private insurance .
In the past , the program has enjoyed extensive bipartisan support , though Democrats and Republicans have differed over how much families could earn before their children became ineligible .
State rules vary , but some cover children in families with incomes more than twice the federal poverty line , which is currently $ 21,200 for a family of four .

Advocates of overhauling the whole healthcare system had hoped broad support for SCHIP would pave the way for similar consideration of the larger healthcare issues .
But the largely party - line votes on SCHIP and the stimulus raised the prospect that the healthcare overhaul promised by Obama this year may soon become a one - party exercise .
Several senior Democrats seemed unconcerned by that possibility .
“ You try to get bipartisan support , ” said Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Beverly Hills ) , chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee .
“ But if they do n’t want to be for it , that ’s their choice .
They ’ll have to answer to their voters . ”
Advertisement
Other Democrats noted that bipartisan discussions about broader health legislation are continuing .
“ This is going to work out well , ” said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , one of the leading architects of planned health reform legislation .
Baucus and other Democrats have been meeting with Senate Republicans about health reform for months , as have a host of interest groups , including insurers , doctors , hospitals , business leaders and consumer advocates .
“ Healthcare reform will be on a different track , ” said Ron Pollack , head of Families USA , an influential consumer group that has led efforts to build consensus around the current campaign .
Advertisement
With control of the White House and commanding majorities in the House and Senate , Democrats need only a handful of GOP votes in the Senate to pass their agenda .
But many advocates believe that major healthcare reform will need substantial GOP support to endure , much as Medicare did since it passed more than four decades ago .
In contrast , the Medicare drug benefit , which Republicans pushed through in 2003 on a largely party - line vote , has been fiercely debated since and remains a top target for some Democrats .
“ Nobody wants . . . to see reform get repealed , ” said Karen Ignagni , president of America ’s Health Insurance Plans , an insurance industry lobbying group that has been intensely involved in the current health reform talks .

In 2007 , SCHIP legislation developed by senior Republican and Democratic lawmakers -- and ultimately vetoed by President Bush -- garnered as many as 45 GOP votes in the House and 18 in the Senate .
Going into this year , lawmakers from both parties also backed more federal spending on health information technology , a major part of the economic stimulus package .
But the consensus on these modest first steps collapsed quickly after the new Congress convened this month .
Democrats infuriated Republicans by inserting a provision in the SCHIP bill to expand health insurance for children of legal immigrants .
Advertisement
An earlier bipartisan compromise had limited that aid to children who had been in the country for more than five years .
Democrats also rebuffed Republican efforts to place limits on how far states could go in providing insurance to children from families with incomes above the federal poverty line .
Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee who had worked with Democrats to craft the SCHIP legislation two years ago , was particularly angry .
“ For a guy like me that shed so much blood and took such a hammering from my own party , it ’s a real disappointment . . . that my side of the aisle is being so ignored , ” the veteran lawmaker told reporters .
Advertisement
But the GOP resistance is unlikely to derail health reform efforts , given the determination of the Obama administration and its Democratic allies on Capitol Hill , said Chip Kahn , a former Republican staffer who heads the Federation of American Hospitals .
“ At the end of the day , ” he said , “ it may be that healthcare reform will be passed with only a small number of Republicans . ”

Colbert : Republicans get ' contact high ' from embracing Rush David Edwards and Ron Brynaert
Published : Wednesday February 4 , 2009
Print This Email This " Thankfully , thankfully , thankfully , " faux Comedy Central pundit Stephen Colbert declared that " things are looking better " for the Republican Party , since they have found a " bold new leader . "
But Colbert was n't talking about new Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele .
No , " Rush Limbaugh is the future of the Republican Party , " Colbert intoned , as a graphic behind him popped up asking " This is 1993 , right ? "
After Colbert recounted how Limbaugh had recently said that he hoped President Obama would fail yet Republicans rushed to embrace the conservative radio host " as their leader , " another graphic added " and got a contact high . "
" So the battle lines were drawn and the GOP went to battle for Lord Humongous , " Colbert said .
Colbert added , " I cherish Rush 's voice , too .
That 's why he's my ring tone . "
Colbert 's phone played a famous Limbaugh sound bite : " Feminism was established so as to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream of society . "
" So true , " Colbert said , " it 's kind of like what talk radio does for unattractive men . "
Stephen Colbert examines new leadership in the Republican Party .

Duke University and United States Army scientists have found that a cheap and nontoxic sunburn and diaper rash preventative can be made to produce brilliant light best suited to the human eye .
Duke adjunct physics professor Henry Everitt , chemistry professor Jie Liu and their graduate student John Foreman have discovered that adding sulfur to ultra - fine powders of commonplace zinc oxide at about 1,000 degrees centigrade allows the preparation to convert invisible ultraviolet light into a remarkably bright and natural form of white light .
They are now probing the solid state chemistry and physics of various combinations of those ingredients to deduce an optimal design for a new kind of illumination .
Everitt and Liu have applied for a patent on using the preparations as a light source .
" Our target would be to help make solid state lighting with better characteristics than current fluorescent ones , " said Everitt , who also works with Foreman at the Army 's Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville , Ala .
The researchers said they are producing white light centered in the green part of the spectrum by forming the sulfur - doped preparation into a material called a phosphor .
The phosphor converts the excited frequencies from an ultraviolet light emitting diode ( LED ) into glowing white light .
Nanometer - diameter zinc oxide powders are being prepared by Liu's research group , which focuses on the chemistry of nanomaterials .
He is Duke 's Jerry G. and Patricia Crawford Hubbard Professor of Chemistry .
They are then being tested at the Aviation and Missile Research , Development and Engineering Center at Redstone Arsenal by Everitt , an Army senior research scientist , and Foreman , an Army research physicist .
The researchers are also exploring using electricity alone to trigger the visible emissions without need for an ultraviolet light trigger .

The Army has selected the project for priority funding through a competitive In - house Laboratory Independent Research program because of its potential advantages as an energy efficient and safe illumination source .
" One of the objectives is to give soldiers efficient lighting that does n't run their batteries down , " Everitt said .
" They need efficiency , brightness , longevity and ruggedness , and this helps with all of those things . "
Existing commercial LEDs are already rugged enough to be used in bumper - mounted brake lights , Everitt said .
" They are good enough for decoration and for use in traffic lights , but they do n't make good reading lights because they are not of a white color that our eyes use best , " Liu said .
White LEDs on the market now are costly , short - lived and not truly white , the researchers added .
A compound that can be used on faces or babies ' bottoms also has major safety advantages over fluorescent bulbs , which happen to contain toxic mercury .
" If a fluorescent bulb gets broken in the course of battle , it exposes soldiers to that mercury in addition to its shattered glass , " Everitt said .

" I think the biggest payoff for the general public will ultimately be in future energy crises we 're certainly going to face , " Everitt added .
" If we can have more efficient lighting it will reduce our energy requirements . "
Scientists have long known that zinc oxide can itself serve as a solid state ultraviolet light source .
They have also known that adding sulfur allows it to emit some white light .
But Liu , Everitt and Foreman are investigating how nanostructuring and doping improves its performance .
The introduced sulfur is thought to boost wavelength conversions from ultraviolet to visible wavelengths by serving as an " impurity " that changes the chemistry and physics of the zinc oxide in ways the Duke researchers are still probing .
Most scientists consider such impurities " defects " that interfere with zinc oxide 's ability to produce a stronger ultraviolet light , they said .
But " we love the defects that other people hate , " Everitt said .
" That 's been the gift of nanostructured doped zinc oxide , emitting what your eye expects white light to look like . "
In a report published May 10 , 2006 , in the research journal Nano Letters , Foreman , Everitt , Liu and co-researchers first disclosed they could induce a formulation of zinc oxide shaped into nanowires to absorb light from an ultraviolet laser and re-emit it as a " broadband visible emission of unprecedented brightness . "
The white light component was more than 1,000 times brighter than the ultraviolet component , they reported .
In a followup report , published July 2 , 2007 , in the journal Applied Physics Letters , the Duke researchers initiated what they expect to be a series of published papers exploring how various alterations affect the white light emissions .
" We 've learned something about what makes the white light conversion happen , and what makes it happen so efficiently , " Everitt said .
The Duke team has already achieved efficiencies as high as 80 percent .
But there are still technical issues to resolve tied to the operating temperatures of the phosphors and the power from the underlying ultraviolet LED .
" Our challenge has been getting a foundational understanding so we can understand what is physically possible and how close we are to achieving it , " Everitt said .
Zinc oxide would be both a less - toxic and cheaper light source than the combinations used in today 's commercial LEDs -- gallium nitride and cerium - doped yttrium oxide , they said .
Cerium - doped yttrium oxide is also used in today 's mercury - containing fluorescent bulbs , Everitt added .
Liu 's lab originally stumbled on to the light emitting potential of sulfur - doped zinc oxide while studying its electronic conductivity .
" We just lit it up with an ultraviolet laser and -- whammo -- there was a lot of white light coming out , " Everitt said .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- U.S. consumer prices plunged by the steepest amount since records were tabulated in 1947 , the Labor Department reported Wednesday .
Prices fell 1 % in October on a seasonally adjusted basis , with energy prices plunging 8.6 % .
Read MarketWatch First Take commentary .
Both the overall and energy decreases were the biggest since the government began keeping such records .
Data on the overall CPI date back to 1947 , and the energy data go back to 1957 .
Meanwhile , food prices in October rose 0.3 % , the smallest gain since May .
Gasoline prices fell a record 14.2 % last month .
The data on gasoline date back to 1967 .
The core consumer price index , which excludes food - and energy - price inputs , eased 0.1 % , the first time there 's been a decline in the core rate since 1982 .
Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had expected the overall October CPI to fall 0.9 % , with the core pegged to rise 0.1 % .
Following the government 's Tuesday report on producer prices , the CPI data deliver further evidence for the Federal Reserve that inflation need not be a top concern for the U.S. central bankers .
Tame inflation could open the door for interest - rate cuts if policy makers deem them necessary to help revive the economy .
The drop in core prices might even " stir thoughts of deflation , " wrote Daiwa analysts .
" But we would view such a development as having a low probability , " according to Daiwa .
" Inflation is a monetary phenomenon , and the Fed has demonstrated its willingness to pursue accommodative " policy , they wrote .
Ian Shepherdson , chief U.S. economist with High Frequency Economics , wrote that he expected an even larger drop in gasoline prices .
" So there 'll be an even bigger drop in November , " Shepherdson wrote .
" This report clearly reflects the crunch in discretionary consumers ' spending , which is likely to persist for the foreseeable future , " Shepherdson wrote .
CPI details
The overall CPI has risen 3.7 % in the past year , while the core rate for retail - level inflation has grown 2.2 % .
Average real weekly earnings are up 2.9 % in the past year .
The index for owners ' equivalent rent rose 0.1 % in October .
Fuel oil prices dropped 11.8 % .
Natural gas prices fell 4.4 % , as electricity gained 1.7 % .
The transportation index fell a record 5.4 % .
This data has been kept since 1947 .
Prices for airlines fares fell 4.8 % , and dipped 0.5 % for new vehicles .
Medical care rose 0.2 % , while recreation gained 0.1 % .
The price index for meats , poultry , fish and eggs rose 0.6 % , while the index for fruits and vegetables fell 2.2 % .
Also Wednesday , the Commerce Department reported that U.S. home builders reduced their starts of new homes by 4.5 % in October , driving new construction to the lowest level since just after World War II .
Housing starts have now fallen 38 % in the past year and are down about 70 % from the peak in early 2006 .

Once you finish adding content to your presentation in Impress , your efforts are n't over yet .
You still need to prepare how you will deliver it .
These preparations are partly a matter of choosing various options for slide transitions and delivering the show , but they also include some practical choices and -- worst of all -- the practical considerations such as making sure that you have all the graphics , fonts , and audio files you need , and are ready to work with dual monitors in a world in which GNU / Linux is still a rarity .
Choosing slide transitions
Slide transitions are the bits of built - in animation that play when you switch slides during a presentation .
You can set transitions any time you want , but leaving them until you 've finished adding slides helps you to focus on content instead of diverting your attention to format .
Whenever you set transitions , you 'll find them in the tasks pane on the right side of the editing window .
Impress gives you a choice of 56 transitions , although many are just variations of each other -- for instance , Wipe Up or Wipe Down -- and , irritatingly enough , the tasks pane does n't list them in alphabetical order for easy reference .
Like many formatting features , transitions are easy to overdo .
Just as you should usually limit your fonts to two -- one for headers and one for body text -- so you should usually limit your transitions to two -- one to announce a new section of your presentation , and one for ordinary transitions .
And even those two might be more effective if you chose variations of the same transition .
Geeking out and using more transitions is only going to make your presentation look cluttered and disorganized .
The same is true for the sounds accompanying transitions , except even more so .
Nor do you want to loop the transition sound until the next one -- unless , of course , you 're consciously setting out to annoy your audience .
Which transitions you use are largely a matter of personal preference .
At times , a topic may suggest a particular transition ; for example , if you are talking about time management , you might consider Wheel Clockwise , One Spoke a close analogy of an analog clock .
Personally , though , I doubt that most members of an audience will catch such subtleties unless they are bored and looking for distractions as you talk .
You really need no more than a simple Wipe , and might even consider no transition at all -- transitions being one of the more over - rated design features of a presentation .
Other than the type of transition , the most important setting is the speed of the transition .
No matter how recent your machine , that speed should probably be Fast .
The medium and slow settings are glacial on any machine , and only over - emphasize the transition at the expense of your content .
The slower settings are useful mainly to emphasize a change to a new section .
Mostly , you 'll want to set the transition to happen when you click your mouse .
But , if your presentation is going to run unattended , or you need to keep to a tight schedule , you might set the transition to occur automatically after the number of seconds you specify .
The easiest way to set transitions is to configure the standard one first , then click the Apply to All Slides button at the bottom of the panel .
Transitions automatically preview when you select them , but you can click the Play button to repeat one before you select it .
Then , go to the last side in each section of your presentation and set its transition individually .
Configuring presentations
You can fine - tune your presentation using items in the Slide Show menu .
If you are planning to show the same presentation to different audiences -- for instance , two different categories of buyers for your product -- you might want to be economical with your time and disk space and make a single slide show for both audiences , and create two Custom Slide Shows .
Once you have created any Custom Slide shows , go to Slide Show -> Slide Show Settings .
Some of these settings , like Range , Type or Multiple Monitors , you will want to adjust just before you deliver a show , but the miscellaneous Options on the lower right of the Slide Show Settings windows can be set beforehand to suit your needs and personal preferences .
For instance , having the mouse point visible or usable as a pointer can be useful if you plan on referring to details of a diagram on a slide because , by constantly moving the point , you can easily draw the audience 's attention to what you refer to .
Similarly , having the Navigator visible can help you jump between slides -- although you might prefer to hide the navigation aid and install the Sun Presenter Console extension instead .
And if you choose the Window Type of presentation , selecting the option Presentation Always on Top seems only sensible .
By contrast , you probably do n't want to de-select the default Animations allowed option unless you having serious speed problems , while The Change slides by clicking on background option is probably useful in any circumstance .
With the basic options chosen , you might also want to rehearse your presentation using Slide Show -> Rehearse Timings .
This view shows the current slide with a digital stop watch in the lower left , so you can see how long you need to display each slide .
A practical rule is to plan on speaking for two - thirds of your allotted time , so that you have room for questions , your sudden inspirations , and unexpected circumstances .
Very few audiences , in my experience , will complain about a presentation that runs short -- but they are less forgiving about ones that run long .
Preparing to deliver the slide show
Presentations are almost always easiest when you are running your own computer .
However , if you are using another computer , you might consider running the show from a flash drive that includes OpenOffice.org .
In fact , with flash drives being so cheap these days , why not include an entire operating system so you can work with familiar tools ?
Performance will be slightly slower than running the show from a hard drive , but in many cases that will be a small price to pay for guaranteeing that you have everything you need .
The last thing you need is a setback just before you deliver your presentation .
If you must use another computer , make sure that you put graphics , sound clips , and other elements of your slide show in a single folder as you work , so that you can easily copy them over to the computer you are using .
Just as with a web site , that is usually best practice anyway .
Your main problem will be ensuring that the other computer has the same fonts , as well as a copy of OpenOffice.org , so carry both along with you , just in case you need to install them .
Alternatively , you can use generic fonts like Times Roman that any computer is likely to have .
Another major problem will be setting up the dual monitors you will probably be using -- namely , the screen for your computer , and the projector screen .
Exactly how you prepare to use dual monitors can vary with your video driver and card , so make sure you research the subject before you arrive to present .
The last version of GNOME makes setting up dual - monitors easier than before , but , even so , it can be difficult to get right , so do n't leave the configuration for the last moment .
However , when you have successfully configured dual monitors , you can set the projector screen under Slide Show -> Slide Show Settings -> Multiple Monitors .
While you are in Slide Show Settings , you should also take the time to choose the Range of slide you plan to show .
The default is All , but you can also select a starting slide if you want to shorten the presentation , or else a Custom slide show that you have already created .
Now is also the time to set the type , if necessary .
The default assumes a separate presentation screen , but , if you are running the presentation from your computer , you might want to set the Type to Window .
You can also set the presentation to Auto , selecting a set time between slides .
If you really want to , you can also display the OpenOffice.org logo before an Auto slide show begins again , although the only reason I can think for doing so is to promote free software .
And , unfortunately , you cannot change the logo that displays .
Conclusion
If you do n't deliver presentations regularly , the process can be intimidating .
For that matter , even the most accomplished speakers often feel nervous before going on stage .
You can't control the need to wait , so the next thing is to have everything ready to run smoothly .
You can control preparation , and doing so will not only help to calm your nerves , but also prevent the stress of unexpected disasters , such as not knowing how to set up dual monitors .
For these reasons , go easy on yourself and understand and use the tools Impress includes for preparing and delivering your presentations .
Watching the news these days , there appears to be no more important story that the woman who gave birth to eight children .
Really , no wars , economic crisis , political divisions , millions losing their homes ; alright , then let 's talk about Nadya Suleman , the Octo-mom .
Yes , she probably should not have had eight more children when she already has six and apparently no means to support them .
Yeah , I said it , she probably should not have done it .
But who are we to judge her ?
As someone who is pro choice , I believe it has got to work both ways .
I do n't believe society should be telling a woman what they can and cannot do with their bodies .
It would have to apply here as well .
Yet , the argument now seems to be more about the burden to the taxpayers the Octo - Mom will cause .
Please .
With eight little babies I am sure there are good religious groups out there ready to assist her in her time of need .
I am sure Oprah is ready to do a special on this and give her a house , food , clothing like she did for the last family of eight .
I hope their show is n't on at the same time as Jon & Kate plus 8 .
That might cause me internal conflict .
Oh , Oprah has nothing scheduled .
There is no lifetime deal in the works ?
And the religious right is n't supporting her ?
They are threateining to kill her , her babies and her PR firm ?
Really .
That 's strange .
I would think the religious right would be celebrating this moment .
Here is a woman who got medical help to conceive and birth a child , got the world 's worst doctor and ended with eight children at once and decided not to abort the children but bring them into the world to be loved .
Where are you Rush ?
Sean Hannitty ?
How come this is n't a celebration of life ?
Why do these babies deserve to die ?
I do n't get it .
Yes , she probably should not have done it .
But she did .
There are eight babies in the world who are now hiding in an undisclosed location because the religious right does n't like their mother .
Instead of providing food , clothes and shelter , they are providing fear and judgment .
Does n't seem all that Christian to me .
Can we all at least agree that these babies deserve their chance at the American Dream regardless of what Sean Hannitty thinks of their mother ?
Dear Sir or Madame ,
Hello , my name is Jeff .
More likely than not , you do not know me .
I work at one of the businesses housed in your building .
Before you confront coworkers or random people standing at the fridge , know that it was I that used your ranch dressing yesterday .
I had brought a delicious set of leftovers from home .
They were buffalo chicken fajitas , quite spicy , and as you may or may not know , nothing goes better with the buffalo chicken / hot sauce flavor than a rich , palatable complement of ranch dressing .
Please try to understand .
I saw it in the fridge of the building ’s break room .
I did not intend to use too much , and yet there was not much in the bottle to begin with .
After yesterday ’s fajitas , I could n’t bear to leave so little left and so , today for lunch , used the rest of the ranch in the bottle to dress a very naked plate of lettuce , tomatoes and cucumbers .
After that , it did not seem proper to return an empty bottle of ranch to the fridge , so I took the liberty of disposing it for you .
I hope you do n’t mind .
As for compensating you for the loss … well , I fear that that is impractical .
If I replace the ranch there is a great chance some other desperate soul will take it before you have an opportunity to use it yourself , and thus the cycle will continue .
I ’m sure you see reason in this .
If not , my apologies .
It was a crime of necessity .
Have you seen Victor Hugo ’s Les Miserables ?
Think of me as Jean Valjean .
Really .
The fajitas , while pleasant , are unworthy without ranch .
Farewell , and may you write your name on the ranch dressing next time , so that I may know to whom I should address a note such as this in the future .
Sincerely ,
Jeff
He said that the US had ratified the UN convention on torture which requires " all means , particularly penal law " to be used to bring proceedings against those violating it .
It seems an age ago that Dennis Skinner unleashed one of the most lethal of all Parliamentary put - downs .
Reginald Maudling , the urbane and corpulent former Tory Chancellor , was inveighing against the uncompetitiveness of the British workforce , declaring : " It takes a German one and a half days to build a car , whereas it takes his British equivalent more than three days " .
At this point , Skinner heckled : " An ' 'ow long would it tek you , fats ? "
Collapse , as they say , of stout party .
Maudling died 30 years ago this month , but Dennis Skinner still sits on the Labour benches , his sharp wit scarcely blunted by the passing of the years .
It was hearing Lord Mandelson on the Today programme criticise the strikers demonstrating against allegedly " unfair " foreign labour at the Lindsey oil refinery that made me think back to that choice example of Parliamentary abuse .
The thing is that while Mandelson is a wonderfully smooth advocate of the policies of globalisation , one has the sense that he is not the sort of figure who would ever convince a single member of the industrial working class of anything .
Yet , sitting as he is in the well - mannered House of Lords , the Business Secretary is shielded from any demotic heckling from the studiously proletarian Dennis Skinner – or indeed the genial brutality of his Tory shadow , Kenneth Clarke .

Instead , the nation has had to make do with the extra-Parliamentary equivalent of Dennis Skinner , the BBC's John Humphrys , putting the case of the wildcat strikers against imported foreign labour .
Mandelson was up to the task , accusing Humphrys , inter alia , of fomenting " xenophobia " .
Outraged as the Today presenter was – or pretended to be – by this , Lord Mandelson was right not to shrink from using that term .
One of the Italian workers brought in to the refinery by the contracting firm IREM , told a newspaper : " Every time we want to go out into the town we have to run a real gauntlet of hate and there have been real problems in the towns with the locals . "
It 's hard to know for sure , but it would seem unlikely that this sort of behaviour would have taken place if the " incomers " were workers from another part of Britain , rather than overseas .
The BNP have seized on this dispute with particular relish , circulating posters declaring : " British Jobs for British Workers .
It 's time to strike back .
When we say it , we mean it ! "
This is a reference , obviously , to the Prime Minister 's address to the 2007 Labour Party conference , in which he spoke of " drawing on the talents of all to create British jobs for British workers . "
The difference between Gordon Brown and us , say the BNP , is that he does n't mean it : we do .
This was , indeed , a BNP catchphrase long before Gordon Brown uttered those words , and the Prime Minister was criticised at the time by David Cameron for borrowing the campaigning slogan of the ultra-nationalist party .
Although it was foolish – at best – of Mr Brown , to use that phrase , I do n't share the widespread view that he was attempting to steal the clothes of the BNP , which is seen as a growing threat by Labour candidates in some urban seats .
It stems instead from a much more personal concern of Mr Brown – that he appears as a Scottish outsider in what is still , fundamentally , an English nation .
The rise in the fortunes of the Scottish National Party , leading to a future vote on secession , had only added to Mr Brown 's sense of insecurity , as the prospect seemed to increase of his being entirely disenfranchised from Westminster .
To counter this , Mr Brown obsessively cloaked his every utterance with the Union Flag , and issued edicts that there should be a Bank Holiday – and even an entire museum – to celebrate " Britishness " .
Indeed , that first speech of his to the Labour party conference as leader contained over 50 mentions of the words " British " or " Britishness " .
It was not racist , but it was desperately embarrassing to witness .
The Prime Minister can legitimately point out to the demonstrators at the refineries that the foreign workforces are not being paid at rates which undercut those hitherto paid to British workers on similar contracts ; it is also the case that the Italian labourers shipped in by IREM are part of that company 's permanent workforce , rather than unemployed casuals swept up off the streets of Naples .
Mr Brown is also being reasonable in pointing out that the freedom of movement for labour within the European Union has been a great boon for anyone in this country who has any skill which can be exported .
Unfortunately for the Prime Minister , these pleas for reason are drowned out by the deafening chorus that he is a hypocrite , promising " British jobs for British workers " which he knows cannot be guaranteed without seceding from the European Union .
He is fortunate in one respect only , which is that the official trade union movement in this country has been wedded to the European Single Market ever since Jacques Delors addressed the TUC conference during the reign of Margaret Thatcher and told the brothers that they should n't worry about what the Conservative Government might do to labour law : the EU would guarantee them the rights they sought , backed by a European Court which would take precedence over merely British law .
He was as good as his word .
There is , in any case , a strongly internationalist streak within the Left , which stems directly from the writings of Karl Marx .
Thus this week 's statement from Socialist Resistance , the newspaper produced by British supporters of the Fourth International , roundly criticises the British demonstrators calling for the Italian labourers to " Go back to Italy " .
" The demands of the strikers themselves imply that Italian workers at IREM should be sacked and replaced by British workers and that jobs in Britain should be ring - fenced against workers from outside .
This is seriously wrong – where would it leave British workers working under similar conditions in other European countries ? "
This plea for solidarity with foreign labour – are we not all brothers ?
– has always been a difficult sell to a purely domestic audience .
Benito Mussolini 's great insight was to realise this : he created fascism by merging the unsuccessful socialism of his early career with the virulent nationalism which had been anathema to his former colleagues .
This is why fascism has long been seen as a heresy of socialism ; it was hardly coincidental that Adolf Hitler 's movement was called the National Socialist German Workers ' Party – Nazi for short .
It would be over - dramatic to see the BNP 's attempts to become the political leaders of the anti-foreign wildcat strikers as the spark that will ignite a revival of fascism ; but there is equally no doubt that a worldwide recession – which could only be magnified by a descent into protectionism – is fertile ground for the mutant socialists sometimes described as the " far right " .
Lord Mandelson would understand this threat very well : hard is it might now be to imagine , he was once a member of the Young Communist League .

As the worst bushfires in Australia 's history raged across Victoria , Twitter , Flickr and Facebook lit up with condolences and horrific first - hand accounts , while many used innovative online mapping tools to assess the risk of the fires reaching their own homes .
Mainstream news outlets , battling to provide comprehensive coverage of the tragedy , have incorporated accounts published on the social networking sites extensively in their reports .
Using online social media to spread vital information and personal stories is becoming increasingly commonplace in times of crisis , but this may be the first time the social networking sites have been used extensively during an Australian disaster .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A former CIA station chief in Algeria is under investigation by the State and Justice departments after being accused of raping at least two women while he held the post , a source confirmed to CNN on Wednesday .
Two Algerian women allege that the CIA 's former Algeria station chief raped them at his home , a source says .
The women told investigators that they think date - rape drugs were used in the assaults , which are said to have occurred at the officer 's official residence , according to the source .
The story was first reported by ABC News .
The allegations were made in the fall , when the unidentified officer was still serving as station chief .
In October , soon after the allegations were made , the man returned to the United States for a previously scheduled trip and was ordered not to return to his post , the source said .
A senior U.S. official confirmed that the case is under investigation but refused to comment on the details .
State Department spokesman Robert Wood issued a brief statement in response to a CNN inquiry , saying that " the individual in question has returned to Washington and the U.S. government is looking into the matter , " and referring reporters to the Justice Department .
The women , who are Algerian citizens , brought their allegations to a U.S. government official , and federal authorities then launched an investigation .
A search of the station chief 's residence in Algeria was approved by a U.S. District Court judge after a request from the Justice Department .
The search found pills believed to be of a type commonly used in date rape , the source said .
In that search , authorities also found about a dozen tapes that are thought to show the officer engaged in sexual acts , the source said , including some in which women are believed to be in a semiconscious state .
CNN 's source had not seen the tapes but had been briefed on their content .
Some of the tapes include date stamps indicating that the recordings happened when he would have been serving in Cairo , Egypt , before his tenure in Algeria .
The investigation includes his time in both posts as well as other locations where he traveled .
The identity of the officer could not be learned , and CNN was unable to reach a representative of the officer .
It is against the law to reveal identities of covert officers .
When the allegations surfaced in the fall , they were viewed as " tremendously explosive , no doubt about that , " the source said , especially because Algeria is a Muslim country .
The Justice Department and the CIA would not comment on the allegations or any investigation .
" I can assure you that the agency would take seriously and follow up any allegations of impropriety , " CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said .
The officer has not been charged , the source said .
The source would not speak for attribution because the investigation is ongoing and the source was not authorized to speak publicly .
One federal law enforcement source said that no developments or activities relating to the case are " imminent . "
A station chief heads the CIA 's office in a foreign country , establishing a relationship with its host intelligence service and overseeing agency activities in the country .
CNN producers Jim Barnett , Pam Benson , Carol Cratty and Elise Labott contributed to this story .

Another IAEA DG Report on Iran .
Cue the panic .
Iran Has More Enriched Uranium Than Thought !
Iran understates uranium stocks to IAEA !
Iran holds enough uranium for bomb !
Only the exclamation points are mine .
These stories are scandalous .
Daniel Dombey ’s father is a physicist for god ’s sake !
( Joby Warrick , on the other hand , took the relatively balanced view , with Iran Easing Aspects Of Nuclear Program in the Washington Post , February 20 , 2009 , A14 .
I wonder whether his editors will give him a hard time for not writing the same thing everyone else has written . )
Obviously , Iran would have to further enrich its stockpile of low - enriched uranium to make a bomb , which would be detected ( at least at Natanz ) .
We ’ve been over this before .
The bigger misconception is that Iran has somehow misled the IAEA about its stockpile of low enriched uranium .
The IAEA report does not suggest that Iran failed to declare material .
Here is the actual paragraph from the report :
3 . The Agency has finalized its assessment of the results of the physical inventory verification ( PIV ) carried out at FEP on 24 –26 November 2008 , and has concluded that the physical inventory as declared by Iran was consistent with the results of the PIV , within the measurement uncertainties normally associated with enrichment plants of a similar throughput .
The Agency has verified that , as of 17 November 2008 , 9956 kg of UF6 had been fed into the cascades since February 2007 , and a total of 839 kg of low enriched UF6 had been produced .
The results also showed that the enrichment level of this low enriched UF6 product verified by the Agency was 3.49 % U -235 .
Iran has estimated that , between 18 November 2008 and 31 January 2009 , it produced an additional 171 kg of low enriched UF6 .
The nuclear material at FEP ( including the feed , product and tails ) , as well as all installed cascades , remain under Agency containment and surveillance .
[ Emphasis mine . ]
Important phrases :
… within the measurement uncertainties normally associated with enrichment plants of a similar throughput .
… remain under Agency containment and surveillance .
Nothing is f*cked here , Dude .
Within the Measurement Uncertainties
In order to know that the IAEA discovered more LEU than Iran “ declared , ” one needs to look at the previous IAEA DG Report .
The DG stated “ As of 7 November 2008 , the total amount of UF6 fed into the cascades since the beginning of operations in February 2007 was 9750 kg , and based on the operator ’s daily accounting records , Iran had produced approximately 630 kg of low enriched UF6 . ”
That ’s the discrepancy : 839 kg minus 630 kg .
Fascinating .
Anybody think that all these reporters carefully compared the two reports ?
Obviously , not .
This is spin — though not for a bad cause .
More on that in a moment .
Someone decided to explain they found a bunch more LEU in order to put a little pressure on the Iranians .
[ Correction : My cynicism got the better of me here .
I hope to write a fuller correction soon . ]
Now observe the phrase : “ based on the operator ’s daily accounting records . ”
A colleague and I have been talking about this since the last report — how accurate are the operating records ?
We noticed , for example , that the Iranian operating records claimed that Iran was enriching to 4.9 percent , while environmental samples indicated the level was only up to 4.0 percent .
Now , based on the PIV , the number turns out to be more like 3.49 percent .
I guess we are the only people who have been reading the footnotes in the damned IAEA reports .
( By the way , it is worth noting that there is almost exactly the same amount of U235 in 839 kg of 3.49 percent LEU and 630 4.9 percent LEU . )
The IAEA makes clear that the discrepancy between the stockpile estimated from daily accounting records and the physical inventory is “ within the measurement uncertainties normally associated with enrichment plants of a similar throughput . ”
As a diplomat tells Heinrich , “ faulty estimates that can arise from complexities in the phased enrichment process , not to any maneuver to divert LEU out of sight . ”
This is going to kind of frighten you , but large scale industrial processes are not measured in bomb units , even though that would be awesome .
This same reality , in a slightly different context , gives rise to the wonderfully titled Material Unaccounted For ( MUF ) .
Think about this way : A 164 - centrifuge cascade consumes about 70 grams an hour .
If you have 18 cascades , you are consuming 30 kilograms of UF6 a day .
( .07 kg x 24 × 18 = 30 ) Let ’s say that you are wrong , by one percent a day , regarding how much of the 30 kg ends up in the product as opposed to the tails .
You are underestimating your production by 300 grams day — within two years , you will underestimate your production by more than 200 kg .
( This is merely expository .
Note that the Natanz PIV covered February 2007 - November 2008 , during which the number of operating centrifuges grew from 0 to 24 with uneven operating patterns . )
Remain Under Agency Containment and Surveillance
This is n’t nearly as terrifying as it sounds because accountancy is just one safeguards tool .
Containment and surveillance is another .
Again , as the IAEA points out , “ The nuclear material at FEP ( including the feed , product and tails ) , as well as all installed cascades , remain under Agency containment and surveillance . ”
In other words , even if you are n’t sure how much he weighs , Elvis is still in the building .
So , why the fuss ?
Because the IAEA only does a PIV every year or so at Natanz .
Containment and surveillance are wonderful , but it is nice to occasionally check the material itself .
As a “ diplomat ” tells Mark Heinrich :
But the diplomats said the verified LEU figure was based on an inventory check that inspectors perform only once a year .
In theory , this means there is a risk that any smuggling of enriched uranium out of Natanz for use at a secret site might not be noticed for some time .
U.N. inspectors are discussing with Iran how to improve its operating records to prevent any repeat of such large differences in accounting in future , the diplomats said .
I actually agree that we need to improve our monitoring of Iran ’s activities .
So , I think it is helpful to point out how inadequate current arrangements are even if the Iranians are complying with their obligations .
But no need to stir up panic .

DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
Bureau of Industry and Security [ Docket No. 0812221638-81639-01 ]
Request for Public Comments on the Effects of Export Controls on Decisions To Use or Not Use U.S. - Origin Parts and Components in Commercial Products and the Effects of Such Decisions AGENCY : Bureau of Industry and Security , Commerce .
ACTION : Notice of inquiry .
----------------------------------------------------------------------- [ [ Page 264 ] ]
SUMMARY : The Bureau of Industry and Security ( BIS ) is seeking public comment on whether U.S. export controls influence manufacturers ' decisions to use or not use U.S. - origin parts and components in commercial products and the effects of such decisions .
BIS is interested in obtaining specific information about whether such a practice occurs , and if so , its economic effects in order to assess the effectiveness of export controls as well as the impact of export controls on the U.S. economy .
DATES : Comments must be received no later than February 19 , 2009 .
ADDRESSES : Comments may be submitted via e-mail to publiccomments@bis.doc.gov .
Please Refer to ``Parts and Components Inquiry '' in the subject line .
Comments may also be sent to Parts and Components Study , Office of Technology Evaluation , Room 2705 , U.S. Department of Commerce , 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue , NW. , Washington , DC 20230 .
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Jennifer Watts , Office of Technology Evaluation , Bureau of Industry and Security , telephone : 202-482-8343 ; fax : 202-482-5361 ; e-mail jwatts@bis.doc.gov .
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : Background Export controls imposed by various agencies of the United States government , including , but not limited to , those imposed by BIS necessarily have an impact outside the United States .
Certain U.S. export control regulations impose license requirements or other restrictions on commercial items manufactured outside the United States if those foreign - manufactured items contain U.S. - origin parts and components .
BIS is seeking information to help it assess the impact of U.S. export controls on decisions by manufacturers whether to use U.S. - origin parts and components in their commercial products and the impact of such decisions on the effectiveness of export controls , the strength of the defense industrial base , employment in the United States , the financial strength of U.S. industry , and the ability of U.S. industry to compete in the market .
Specific and quantitative data , from U.S. persons , as well as foreign entities and governments , will be particularly helpful to BIS 's assessment , but other types of information , including anecdotal information , will be useful as well .
Quantitative data that is aggregated to reflect the combined experience of a group of companies or an industry segment also will be useful , particularly if individual companies are reluctant to provide company - specific quantitative data .
Regardless of whether it is qualitative or quantitative , if a comment asserts that manufacturers have elected not to include U.S. - origin parts and components in a foreign - manufactured commercial product because such inclusion could subject the products to U.S. export controls , the following kinds of data would be useful to BIS 's assessment :
Any evidence or information about the existence of advertising or marketing efforts that use the absence of U.S. origin components or exemption from U.S. export controls as a selling point .
Any information about possible customer preferences for products that do not contain U.S. - origin components , and whether such preference may be related to relevant U.S. export controls .
Any information describing parts and components that manufacturers may elect not to use because of their U.S. origin and any information regarding the products into which such parts and components are incorporated .
Any information about sales lost by U.S. suppliers to non- U.S. competitors .
Any information about specific commercial products that were designed or modified to explicitly exclude U.S. parts and components due to U.S. export controls .
Any information about decisions to locate or relocate production facilities outside the United States , including a description of which items ( including relevant commodity classification information , such as Export Control Classification Number ) would be produced abroad .
Any information about the possible economic impact ( e.g. , employment , outsourcing of specific expenditures such as research and development ) to companies , industry segments or communities of any decision not to use U.S. - origin parts and components because of U.S. export controls , including any possible impact on the ability to support specific defense industrial base activities .
How To Comment
All comments must be in writing and submitted to one of the addresses indicated above .
Comments must be received by BIS no later than February 19 , 2009 .
BIS may consider comments received after that date if feasible to do so , but such consideration can not be assured .
All comments submitted in response to this notice will be made a matter of public record , and will be available for public inspection and copying .
Anyone submitting business confidential information should clearly identify the business confidential portion of the submission and also provide a non-confidential submission that can be placed in the public record .
BIS will seek to protect business confidential information from public disclosure to the extent permitted by law .

BILLING CODE 3501-33 - P
As the calendar winds down on 2008 , we can look back at the year in sports and evaluate the transactions teams made .
In some instances teams had hits , and in other cases we can see where teams missed .
And there were certainly a number of misses this year .
Some were made by the usual suspects , such as the Oakland Raider and Detroit Lions .
Some were made by unusual ones as well .
Looking across all sports , here ’s what we at Gunaxin deem the worst sports transactions of the year .
The only rule to qualify is that the transaction ( be it a trade , draft pick , or free agent signing ) had to be executed sometime in 2008 .
The rankings were evaluated by the magnitude of damage to the respective team .
Certainly some moves did n’t exactly pan out as hoped , Pac - Man Jones comes to mind , but they did n’t cost much either so little damage done .
The deals on this list will haunt teams for years , either by wasting money , taking up salary cap space , and / or simply by the loss of talent involved ( or lack of talent received ) .
And no Brett Favre on this list .
For as much as the Packers have fallen off , Aaron Rodgers actually has had a good year and currently has better numbers than Favre ( who leads the league in interceptions ) .
There ’s a lot more wrong with the Packers than quarterback play .
I ’ll grant you that Rodgers may not be better than Favre , and maybe the Packers would have won more games with Favre , but it ’s not a huge difference .
Besides , the Packers got good value from the Jets , so it was n’t a horrible trade .
Here are ten transactions that were horrible , however .
In the words of Arrested Development , “ I think I ’ve made a huge mistake ! ” :
10 . Cleveland chooses poorly with Derek Anderson ( February 2008 )
I ’ll grant you that the entire Cleveland Browns team imploded this season , but Anderson has the 2nd worst QB in the NFL by rating , narrowly edging out the beaten down Matt Hasselbeck .
To illustrate how bad that is , he ranks below a couple of rookies , and whatever bodies are quarterbacking the Chiefs , Raiders , Rams , and Bengals these days .
Ouch .
So why does Anderson ’s crappiness suck so much ?
The Browns rewarded him in the off - season to the tune of three - years and $ 24 million dollars .
Obviously that ’s a bad contract , made worse by the reported $ 7 million signing bonus .
And yet the problems go deeper .
Last offseason the Browns had a decision to make , pay Anderson or trade him and go with second year quarterback Brady Quinn .
They decided to pay Anderson , which meant they had to play him .
That directly hurt the development of Quinn , who rode the bench for most of the season .
It also meant the team passed up landing multiple draft picks for dealing Anderson .
And given his poor play and large contract , most likely the Browns will part ways with Anderson in the offseason without getting any compensation .
That ’s a tough pill to swallow .
Most disappointing is that what happened with Anderson is n’t exactly surprising .
Young non-rookie quarterbacks who finally get their first sustained playing time can initially do very well .
Not all of them , of course , but many of them do .
And then , a few weeks into their stint as a starter , their numbers take a nosedive .
Why ?
It happens when other teams get a few games of them on film , spot tendencies , and start to take away the things that a particular quarterback likes .
I think Scott Mitchell pioneered this principle more than a decade ago .
Any team should have been very hesitant to give a lot of money to Anderson based on his 2007 .
And there ’s still more red flags .
Anderson has a strong arm , but has never shown great accuracy at any level .
Not in college , not in 2007 , never .
That ’s basically Kyle Boller , and that ’s not a recipe for NFL success .
Anderson simply is n’t consistent enough from game to game , or even throw to throw .
Sure , the fact Braylon Edwards has hands of stone wo n’t help anyone ’s completion percentage , but it does n’t explain all the problems Anderson has .
Cleveland should have taken the draft picks and gone with Quinn .
It would n’t have solved all their problems , but at least they ’d be loaded with picks .
9 . The Clippers steal Marcus Camby ( July 2008 )
This past summer the Denver Nuggets traded Camby to the Los Angeles Clippers for the option to swap second round draft picks in the 2010 NBA Draft .
Now you have to understand that second round picks are fairly worthless by NBA standards .
They are routinely sold or otherwise given away , and the players chosen rarely make an impact in the league .
This trade was n’t even good enough for a whole second round pick , only an option to swap picks .
That ’s just giving away a player .
Camby ’s worth more that that .
Heck , pretty much anyone is worth more than that .
Yes , I ’ll concede that Camby is injury prone , a tad expensive ( $ 10 million for each of the next two seasons ) , and on the down slope of his career .
But this is a guy that won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award in the 2006 - ’07 season and was NBA All - Defensive First Team the past two seasons .
That ’s a valuable player .
In 79 games last year he led the league in blocks and averaged 13.1 rebounds .
Any team would love to have him and that kind of defensive presence .
Instead the Nuggets gave him away , in a desperate attempt to avoid the luxury tax .
Considering the money thrown around to mediocre free agents , how the Nuggets got so little for Camby is just sad .
The Nuggets were even a playoff team last season , but decided to sabotage this season before it started .
They wanted to cuts costs , found someone with salary cap space , and then bent over as that team named it ’s price .
Why not keep Camby and trade him later in the season when teams are looking for a stretch drive acquisition ?
Why not actually plan out your spending better and not make panic trades ?
Who knows ?
The Nuggets do n’t .
8. New York Rangers are snookered by Wade Redden ( July 2008 )
There were a ton of questionable signings in hockey this summer ( Jeff Finger , Brian Campbell , Ron Hainsey , etc… ) as teams threw around money like it was going out of style .
But the winner for worst contract appears to be Wade Redden .
Once upon a time , Redden was a pretty good player .
He even represented Team Canada in the Winter Olympics .
But something happened to Redden , his play began to slip , and he was all but run out of Ottawa last spring .
Undeterred , the Rangers signed him to a six - year , $ 39 million contract .
That ’s a perfect example of being rewarded for diminishing returns .
The term of six years is absolutely stunning as it runs until Redden is 37 and averages 6.5 million a year , one of the higher annual salaries in the entire league .
There ’s simply no way Redden can justify the contract without finding a fountain of youth .
His play so far has n’t been encouraging as he ’s been questionable defensively , invisible offensively , and has contributed his fair share to a poor power play .
What ’s worse ?
Because the NHL uses a salary cap , the wasted money may come back to haunt the Rangers .
As their young players develop and hit free agency , will they have the cap room to retain them ?
They ’re already pushing up against the cap , a factor that may have hurt in their recent pursuit of Mats Sundin .
7. Minnesota dumps Johan Santana for a random box of parts ( January 2008 )
This one stings doubly for the Twins .
First , Detroit and Cleveland were expected to dominate the AL Central , but it was the Twins who tied for the division win and headed for a playoff .
Maybe they could have used an ace pitcher like Santana against the White Sox ?
Could it have made the difference in winning a World Series ?
Unknown , but it could n’t have hurt .
Second , the team really did n’t get a good return from the Mets .
It ’s actually puzzling that they settled for what they did .
This was arguably the best pitcher in all of baseball .
All the big name franchises were interested and placed bids .
Allegedly , the Twins asked for players like Phil Hughes from the Yankees and Jon Lester from the Red Sox .
But the mediocre packaged they settled for has no prospect of that caliber .
Only Carlos Gómez was considered a pretty good prospect , but not nearly the level of Hughes or Lester .
Plus Gómez is very , very raw .
As you saw in his rookie season he showed speed and glove work , but his poor batting actually made him below replacement level .
Of the other three players acquired in the deal ( pitchers Philip Humber , Deolis Guerra , and Kevin Mulvey ) , only Mulvey was decent in 2008 .
Even more puzzling was how many pitchers the Twins acquired .
If there ’s one thing the Twins are already very deep in , it ’s young pitching .
They could have used this trade as an opportunity to fill the void the organization has with position players , both in the minors and majors .
It ’s simply the wrong kind of package for them .
One could argue this is the best Minnesota could do given the market .
After all , Santana was set to be a free agent after the season .
However , only a few months later the Indians got a much better haul for three months C.C. Sabathia , including true elite prospect Matt Laporta .
In this list of top prospects for 2009 , LaPorta ranks 7th in all of baseball .
None of the players the Twins received cracks the Top 100 .
That suggest that the Twin sold real low on Santana .
To add insult to injury , the Twins signed Liván Hernández to fill the innings Santana pitched and Hernández was awful .
This really should have gone a lot better for the Twins .
6 . Avery ’s sloppy seconds come back to haunt the Dallas Stars ( July 2008 )
Noted agitator Sean Avery signed a four - year deal for a guaranteed $ 15.5 million with the Dallas Starsin the offseason .
He ’d been a roommate of current Stars co-general manager Brett Hull in the past , so maybe he was signed for some of the wrong reasons .
It ’s no secret that Avery is a volatile personality , annoying those in his own dressing room as much as his opponents on the ice .
Because he is highly skilled at rubbing people the wrong way , he ’s a risky signing for any team .
To date , Avery ’s on - ice performance for Dallas has been largely poor .
He has scored just three goals , a poor total for someone making nearly four million a season .
And that was before an incident involving remarks directed towards Flames ’ defense man Dion Phaneuf .
Phaneuf is dating Avery ’s ex-girlfriend Elisha Cuthbert , which prompted Avery to exclaim , “ I am going to say one thing .
I am really happy to be back in Calgary .
I love Canada .
I just want to comment on how , it has become a common thing in the NHL for guys to fall in love with my sloppy seconds .
I do not know what that is about , but enjoy the game . ”
The comment also may encompass Kings forward Jarret Stoll , who is dating another of Avery ’s ex-girlfriends , Rachel Hunter .
After the remarks , the NHL suspended him indefinitely for “ conduct detrimental to the league or the game of hockey . ”
He and the Stars soon parted ways , as on December 14 the Stars announced that Avery would not return to the team .
In addition to the remarks , his play was a source of frustration to his teammates and he had alienated himself to his teammates .
As of now , the team is actively pursuing options to permanently rid themselves of Avery .
$ 15.5 million for three goals ?
That ’s money well spent !
5. Robbie Keane goes to Liverpool for a lot of money ( July 2008 )
Robbie Keane was billed as the perfect attacking partner for Fernando Torres when he joined Liverpool in a transfer from Tottenham at a cost of £ 20.3 million .
Soccer fans were skeptical , as Keane ’s never been viewed as one of the upper echelon elite footballers .
True to expectations , it has not gone well .
In 23 appearances for Liverpool , Keane has rarely completed a match , and has scored just twice in the Premiership play ( 4 times overall ) .
Now Keane is rumored to be up for sale this coming transfer period at half the price Liverpool played .
A loss of 50 % of value in mere months ?
Sounds like the stock market of late .
Robbie Keane is living proof that the cliché you always get what you pay for is not accurate .
4. Raiders try the DeAngelo Hall Experience ( March 2008 )
Picking on the Oakland Raiders seems like beating a dead horse , but in this case it has to be done .
Their off - season was simply a complete mess .
Here are some of the terrible contracts they gave out which did n’t crack this list : they signed DT Tommy Kelly for 7 years , $ 50 million with $ 18 million guaranteed ; S Gibril Wilson for 6 years , $ 39 million with $ 16 million guaranteed ; and gimpy kneed WR Javon Walker for 6 years , $ 55 million with $ 16 million guaranteed .
That ’s a who ’s who of bad contracts .
And yet there ’s something even worse than those signings .
In March , Oakland managed to trade second and fifth round picks to the Atlanta Falcons for the rights to DeAngelo Hall .
Now the Raiders suck , so the second round pick was a pretty high selection .
That ’s something they might have used on someone good ( well they ’re the Raiders so they probably would have blown the selection ) .
Because the Raiders had already traded their third round pick , it left them with only one selection on day one of the NFL draft .
That ’s not a recipe for success for a rebuilding squad .
And yet it gets worse .
The team immediately signed Hall to a seven year , $ 70 million dollar contract with a reported $ 24.5 million guaranteed .
That might not be terrible move if Hall was good .
But Hall got toasted repeatedly early in the season , and was released after eight games .
Seriously , just a half a year .
A couple draft picks and all that money for a whooping eight games for a terrible team .
Nice move Oakland !
3. Dallas downgrades Devin Harris for Jason Kidd ( February 2008 )
The trade that almost did n’t happen .
I ’m sure Dallas fans wish it did n’t .
After Devean George threw a wrench into the original trade , the teams continued to negotiate and arrived at this debacle .
The revised version reportedly cost the Mavericks an additional 11 million dollars .
It sent Jason Kidd , forward Malik Allen , and swing man Antoine Wright to Dallas in exchange for Devin Harris , center DeSagana Diop , swing man Trenton Hassell , guard Maurice Ager , forward Keith Van Horn , first - round draft picks in 2008 and 2010 , and $ 3 million in cash .
Now Kidd was a great player , and while he remains a decent one , he is a shadow of his former self .
His offense is eroding to problematic levels and he is plagued by defensive problems , something that does n’t always show up in the box scores .
At 35 he ’s slipping , something that happened to players like Gary Payton and Tim Hardaway at similar ages .
And he ’s getting paid $ 21.3 million this season .
But the real problem is that the 25 year old Devin Harris is already the better player , averaing 24.5 points and 6.6 assists this season for the Nets .
For the Mavericks , a team in must win now mode , this is just further setting them back for winning a championship .
Had they kept Harris , they might be competing for a championship .
Without him , they ’re just another team .
2. Orioles fleece the Mariners for Erik Bedard ( February 2008 )
Here ’s the full trade : Bedard for George Sherrill , Adam Jones , Chris Tillman , Tony Butler , and Kameron Mickolio .
Now here ’s the scorecard after one season .
Sherrill made the AL All - Star team , Jones developed into an exciting young center fielder who will only be 23 next season , Tillman is considered one of the best prospects in baseball ( # 18 on this list , also see John Sickel ’s report ) , and Bedard pitched 81 meaningless innings for one of baseball ’s worst teams while tearing his labrum .
Seattle ’s first problem was thinking they were better than they were .
They viewed Bedard as the final piece to being a contender , but they really were n’t all that close .
The next problem is that Bedard got hurt , and labrum tears are pretty much the worst injury a pitcher can get .
Sure , there ’s some bad luck involved with pitcher injuries , but it ’s not like Bedard did n’t have warning signs .
He ’s already had Tommy John surgery and has never topped 200 innings in a season .
The guy has always seems to be nicked up .
Worse yet , Bedard ’s a free agent after the 2009 season .
In the event he can come back and is healthy next year , he ’ll probably just leave as a free agent for greener pastures .
Meanwhile the Orioles can build around the talented Tillman and Jones for years , and everything else they get out of the deal is just gravy .
In fact , the folks over at U.S.S.
Mariner have dubbed this the official worst trade in Mariners history .
That ’s saying something coming from a team that sent Ken Griffey Jr. and Randy Johnson packing in the middle of their illustrious careers .
1. Grizzlies trade Pau Gasol for a bunch of magic beans ( February 2008 )
I guess there was something in the air last February , as there were some brutal trades executed .
In this one the Memphis Grizzlies gave away their best player for pretty much nothing .
Okay , so Gasol might be a little overpaid and a tad soft , but he ’s productive , in the prime of his career , and helped led Spain to a silver medal in the Summer Olympics .
The official haul was that the Lakers gave up Kwame Brown , rookie Javaris Crittenton , the rights to Marc Gasol , and two first - round draft picks .
Marc is
Pau ’s brother and pretty much the only valuable piece in the deal .
Because the Lakers are so good the first round picks will end up being fairly low in the draft , and the Phoenix Suns and other teams have literally just sold picks better than this .
Am I to believe this was literally the best that could be obained ?
Only a few months before the deal , Bill Simmons rated Gasol as the 39th most valuable commodity in the league .
What the hell happened here ?
The Grizzlies might as well have kept Gasol and had actual talent on their roster .
Mozilla 's mobile Firefox browser , which is codenamed Fennec , is now available for Windows Mobile .
Mozilla has released a pre-alpha test build of the Windows Mobile port for users who want to get an early look at the program .
This release is designed to work on an HTC Touch Pro and might not work yet on other devices .
I was unable to run it on my HTC TyTN II .
The Fennec project aims to bring the Firefox experience to mobile devices .
Although Mozilla 's browser has historically been too resource - intensive to take on the mobile market , the work to reduce memory overhead for the Firefox 3 release and ongoing efforts to improve the browser 's JavaScript performance have finally made it a viable option on handhelds .
We got our first look at Fennec last year when an early prototype was released .
Mozilla followed it up with an alpha release that showcased Fennec 's new finger - friendly user interface .
A second alpha , which was released in December , included significant optimizations that improved the browser 's responsiveness and brought it a step closer to being a practical option for day - to - day use .
Those early releases all targeted Nokia 's N810 Internet Tablet device , which runs the Linux - based Maemo platform .
A Windows Mobile port was being developed in parallel , but this is the first time that a version of Fennec has been officially released for Microsoft 's platform .
Patches to facilitate Windows Mobile support for the Netscape Portable Runtime ( NSPR ) — the browser 's underlying platform portability layer — have been merged into Mozilla 's main source tree , making it possible to compile the Windows Mobile port directly from the trunk .
The release is distributed as a 9MB CAB installer which you can download from Mozilla 's FTP repository .
It includes a mobile version of XULRunner which is used as Fennec 's runtime .
The port is still at an early stage of development , but the availability of a Windows Mobile version demonstrates Mozilla 's commitment to bring the browser to a wide range of handsets across multiple platforms .
Mozilla has also committed to building a Symbian port .
" This release is prealpha , and intended to get the product into the hands of early adopters in order to get feed back and bug reports , " said Mozilla mobile developer Brad Lassey in a blog entry .
" In order to focus our efforts on getting this release out , we have targeted only one device , the HTC Touch Pro .
This has a number of user interface implications , including graphics designed for a 300 dpi screen , control layout intended for a vga screen and reliance on a hardware keyboard for text input . "
There are several other pieces that are not yet in place .
Lassey says that the update system is n't functioning yet and support for plugins has been disabled .
Fixing the plugin feature is a high priority for the team , he says .
Tough competition
The mobile browser market is highly competitive and there are some compelling alternatives to Fennec that are already available for Windows Mobile users .
Opera has done great things with Opera Mobile 9.5 , which delivers a Web browsing experience that almost rivals the iPhone and has some interesting additional features such as support for the W3C Web widget standard .
Another alternative that has a lot of potential is SkyFire , a mobile browser that leverages sever - side Gecko rendering and provides excellent support for streaming video .
Even Microsoft is gearing up to deliver a decent mobile browser to replace its disgracefully useless Pocket Internet Explorer .
Fennec offers several key advantages over the rest of the pack , but the most significant is its extensibility .
Much like Firefox on the desktop , Fennec is designed to support third - party extensions that can increase the functionality of the browser and enhance the user interface .
In our previous reviews , I looked briefly at some of the first major extensions , including one that allows users to post messages to Twitter through Fennec 's URL bar .
Far more impressive examples have emerged now that the platform has had an opportunity to mature .
Developer Felipe Gomes recently published a video that demonstrates an experimental gesture - based control system for Fennec that is implemented as an add - on , much like the mouse gesture extensions available for the desktop version of Firefox .
Mozilla is making excellent progress on Fennec and is already software that exceeds my expectations .
It 's being used experimentally in some creative ways and has a lot of potential .
When it matures and becomes compatible with additional devices , it could become a major force in the mobile Web ecosystem .

Forensic evidence that has helped convict thousands of defendants for nearly a century is often the product of shoddy scientific practices that should be upgraded and standardized , according to accounts of a draft report by the nation ’s pre-eminent scientific research group .
The report by the National Academy of Sciences is to be released this month .
People who have seen it say it is a sweeping critique of many forensic methods that the police and prosecutors rely on , including fingerprinting , firearms identification and analysis of bite marks , blood spatter , hair and handwriting .
The report says such analyses are often handled by poorly trained technicians who then exaggerate the accuracy of their methods in court .
It concludes that Congress should create a federal agency to guarantee the independence of the field , which has been dominated by law enforcement agencies , say forensic professionals , scholars and scientists who have seen review copies of the study .
Early reviewers said the report was still subject to change .
The result of a two - year review , the report follows a series of widely publicized crime laboratory failures , including the case of Brandon Mayfield , a lawyer from Portland , Ore. , and Muslim convert who was wrongly arrested in the 2004 terrorist train bombing in Madrid that killed 191 people and wounded 2,000 .

Twitter meetups , or Tweetups as they 're commonly called , are pretty much ubiquitous these days .
You ca n't escape them .
The @ nametags .
The random awkward conversations that result when you have more than 140 characters to express yourself .
Tweetups take an otherwise great service like Twitter and turn it into something much bigger .
Why ?
Because you are able to gather with online friends , meet new contacts to enhance your career , and have a few drinks .
So here are a few quick tips for both the organization and managing of the actual event .
Have your own Tweetup planning dos and don'ts ?
Tell us about them in the comments .
Organizing the Tweetup : DO
1. Utilize your Twitter network as a way to drum up support , help and ideas .
The number of PR and marketing people on Twitter now is astounding .
Use their collective wisdom and networks to create buzz and support for your event .
2. Actually visit the venue .
Seems incredibly simple right ?
But not everyone takes the time and effort to actually visit the bar , conference room , or park where the Tweetup will happen .
I 've never heard of anyone making a great business connection at a dark dive bar .
3 . Plan for more people to show up than you think .
It 's Twitter .
These people do know how to spread the word better than anyone .
According to Sonny Gill : " Tweetups do n't necessarily have to consist of avid Twitterers .
However active , they are still a part of the community . "
Everyone should be welcome and thus you should plan to accommodate them .
4. Ensure a few core people / speakers are at the event .
Trust me if @ ChrisBrogan or @ GregVerdino are at an event ... it will draw a lot more buzz than @stuartcfoster .
5. Use Email .
Even though it supposedly has fallen out of favor , having the contact information for a variety of individuals is beneficial for all involved .
You can keep this core group informed of developments .
6 . Use a service like Eventbrite , Amiando or meetup.com to organize your guests , collect donations and otherwise provide shareable content .
It takes all the legwork out of the administrative work that a large Tweetup entails .
If you are planning on a smaller gathering ... this may not be necessary and you can use Facebook or your blog to organize .
Organizing the Tweetup : DON'T
7. Secure a venue with limited or no WiFi .
At a minimum the CrackBerry / iPhone users should have good service .
People like technology .
But they wo n't like YOU if they can't use their tech at your event .
( This is of course size / type of Tweetup dependent , if in a large conference room / venue : WiFi and cell phone reception should be working .
However , if you are in smaller venue or bar Jeff Cutler of jeffcutler.com reports : " I have an iPhone , but anyone with mobile Web knows that when 200 people in one spot are on 3G / Edge it disintegrates . "
This negates the need for an elaborate setup in smaller venues .
8 . Have an event in an inappropriate place .
If you are having 200 people and you decide to squeeze them into a 20x20 room ... it may not be a good idea .
If you have a DJ at a networking event ... it may not be a good idea .
If you have an event where it is difficult to communicate in any way ... it might be a bad idea .
You get the idea ?
9 . Have a vague premise for the Tweetup .
Most people want to know what they are here for so they can dress or plan accordingly .
No one wants to be the guy that shows up in jeans to the black tie event .
So ensure that this does not happen , have a clearly defined cause or purpose for the Tweetup .
10 . Half ass it .
If you spend the time , money and energy into putting together a Tweetup do n't pull it together at the last minute .
So plan accordingly and do your homework .
At the Tweetup : DO
11 . Get to the event early .
Simple manners .
You want to make sure people come to the right place and will be able to enjoy themselves .
" As the organizer , it 's essential you come early especially if you are bringing / receiving food or materials .
In the case of the SXSW Chicago Tweetup , I want to make sure to have all the schedule sheets at the event so when people arrive they have a topic to discuss , " said Len Kendall from Critical Mass .
12 . Collect business cards .
Event dependent ; most folks will be card carrying members of the business / technology world and will be at the Tweetup to network .
If you have an electronic scanner this is even better .
You can send a list of attendees to your email list , providing additional value .
13 . Provide food .
If you schedule a Tweetup around a meal ... provide food .
If you DON'T plan on providing food , definitely inform your attendees .
Sometimes at these events I think my stomach does more networking than my mouth .
At the Tweetup : DON'T
14 . Fade into the background .
If it 's your event ... you ’d better damn well be front and center to handle and address any concerns / problems that may arise .
Daniel B. Honigman the lead social media strategist at Tribune Interactive urges " organizers to be sure to introduce new folks around .
If you see someone coming out for their first Tweetup , be sure to spend extra time with them introduce them around and make them feel welcome . "
15 . Have bad name tags and pens .
If I can't see your Twitter name .
I 'm not going to know who you are .
The same is true for all people at your event .
16 . Blow people off .
Trust me .
Nothing is worse than being snubbed .
So if you want to have a great Tweetup , you have to talk to the 16 year old kid with the same respect that you would show Seth Godin .
Just good business sense and karma .
17 . Go open bar .
Unless you want complete shenanigans ( and to be broke ) , you do n't want @JoeBusinessGuy to be completely tanked .
Also it weeds out people just after the free booze .
Tweetups are fun , productive , and great for walking away with a lot of contacts and leads .
So if you are feeling adventurous and do n't mind doing a bit of hustling you can host / organize your own Tweetup .
I 'm looking forward to attending it :) .

Ottawa must do more to build ties with Canadians living abroad or risk losing the economic benefit of the country 's large , educated , and sometimes influential , overseas population , according to a report from a think - tank on Canada 's relations with Asia .
" As we have come to accept that overseas affiliates of Canadian corporations are net overseas assets that can generate long - term benefits for the country , now we need to consider the Canadian diaspora as a long - term asset to be cultivated , not spurned , " said Kenny Zhang , of the Vancouver - based Asia - Pacific Foundation .
Mr. Zhang and his colleagues have found that Canadian tax , citizenship and voting rules contribute to a sense that there is a two - tier system that disadvantages Canada 's expats .
Different rules " have in fact created two groups of Canadians : ' full fledged ' Canadians residing in Canada and ' lesser ' Canadians , or foreigners with Canadian passports , living abroad , " he said in the report .
There are 2.7 - million Canadians living overseas — proportionately more Canadians live abroad than citizens of the U.S. , Australia , India or China — including some influential and successful businesspeople with strong ties to Canada .
In Hong Kong , for instance , telecoms billionaire Richard Li sits on the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Advisory Council and is well - known for his progressive views on the territory 's move toward democracy .
Mr. Li is also a regular visitor to Canada , where he began his working career with investment dealer Gordon Capital , and his philanthropy includes a $ 1 - million donation to the Canadian National Arts Centre Foundation .
In nearby Macau , University of Toronto grad Lawrence Ho , the so - called " Prince of Macau " runs much of that city 's gambling business , and has also been the recipient of numerous Asian business awards .
Elsewhere , Canadian Don Lam of Vinacapital is the guru on investing in Vietnam .
But there are also many others who are often highly - skilled , and well connected to international networks of trade and commerce .
The Asia Pacific Foundation found for instance that Canadians moving to Hong Kong are heavily concentrated among young people in professional positions or higher - level managerial jobs .
The Foundation 's research indicated that the policy issues related to having so many Canadians living abroad extends into consular affairs , trade , innovation , health and finance .
Of particular current concern is a new law , set to come into affect in April that will prevent children born to or adopted by Canadians outside the country from passing citizenship on to their children if they are also born abroad - in other words children born to naturalized Canadians would not have the same citizenship rights as children of those born in Canada .
The new rules " will create a two - tiered system with children born or adopted overseas relegated to an ' inferior ' class of citizenship , " Mr. Zhang said .
The controversy over the new legislation has been front page news in the main English language newspaper in Hong Kong where there are about a quarter of a million Canadian passport holders .
Suggestions in the Asia Pacific Foundation 's report include that Canadians abroad should be consulted on changes to immigration and citizenship rules , and that consideration should be given to having a member of parliament to represent the interests of the approximately 9 % of Canadians living overseas .
In a separate report last month , the Foundation also urged Ottawa to " embrace Chinese transnationalism . "
" Canada will lose out in the global quest for talent in the knowledge - based economy unless it updates some of its ideas and policies on immigration , " the report said .
Highly - skilled Chinese - Canadians are likely to return to their country of origin unless Canada can provide attractive career opportunities to match those in China , the report warned .
Ottawa should also review taxation policies , rules on intellectual property rights and citizenship , to try to foster better relationships with Chinese - Canadians that return to China for work .

With no one denying the obvious fact that America is in a deep slump anymore , the discussion has instead shifted to why it happened .
The Austrians ( including me ) who predicted these problems based on Greenspans low interest rate policy know of course that the main cause was that low interest rate policy , with his numerous bailouts of failed financial institutions also creating a moral hazard that encouraged risky behavior .
But non-Austrians who for various reasons seem determined to exonerate the central bank have instead offered various other explanations .
I will not here answer them all , and will instead simply comment on the most common alternative explanations and the various arguments used explicitly for the purpose of exonerating Greenspan .
From the supply - side Republican establishment who until 2007 and in some cases well into 2008 denied the existence of any serious problems the blame is cast on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Community Reinvestment Act ( CRA ) .
Despite having been so wrong , they are closer to the truth than other deniers as the factors they blame did .
Surely the fear of being accused of violating the CRA made some lenders more willing to lend to some low - income and minority households that really werent credit worthy .
And surely , the role of Fannie and Freddie in buying up many of the mortgage - backed securities and then selling them on with their guarantees helped increase such lending .
But there is little reason to believe that either of those factors was more than something that aggravated slightly the crisis .
After all , both Fannie & Freddie and the CRA had existed for decades without causing anything similar to this .
And most sub - prime loans were issued by institutions not covered by the CRA , and the act itself is nt really that draconian as it says that lenders arent compelled to make loans that are likely to be unprofitable .
Similarly , lending not covered by Fannie & Freddie expanded rapidly too during the bubble .
One argument that particularly left - wingers have advanced is that " deregulation  or " lack of regulation " is the cause of the problems .
Rarely do they specify exactly what regulations they refer to .
( I suspect that many simply have such great faith in government that there must be some lack of regulation that causes any problems .
What regulation is unimportant to them )
Often it is said that securitization , and lack of regulation of it after the repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act , is the problem .

Young people identify drinking as a fun , social habit Health campaigns warning of the dangers of alcohol are being ignored by many young people who see binge drinking as acceptable , researchers say .
A study by Birmingham and Bath universities suggests the government must stop " demonising " young people in its attempts to promote safe drinking .
Researchers interviewed 89 people in England aged 18 - 25 over three years .
They say ministers will have to look again at health campaigns if they are to have any kind of significant impact .
' Not successful ' Funded by the Economic and Social Research Council , the study concluded young people did not see their own drinking cultures reflected in adverts which took a negative stance .
It said warnings not to drink more than two or three units of alcohol day are seen as unrealistic by many 18 to 25 - year - olds .
The young people did , however , identify with adverts which promoted alcohol as a fun , social habit .
The project found that alcohol played a significant part in forming a " group identity " and that drinking and alcohol - related stories played an " important role " in binding different social groups together .
Professor Christian Griffin , who led the research team , said the government had to take action .
She said : " Top of my list would have to be to stop demonising and making generalisations about young people and their drinking .
We also need to listen and incorporate their views and perspectives . "
Shaping attitudes
The researchers carried out in - depth interviews for The Young People and Alcohol project in three unidentified locations in England .
These included a major city centre in the Midlands with a diverse population , a seaside town , and a small market town in the West Country with a more homogenous population and fewer places to drink .
It focused on how adverts and other marketing practices shaped people 's attitudes to drinking and included the analysis of 216 alcohol adverts , both in print and broadcast form .
The team found that educational adverts which often advocated " safe levels " of alcohol consumption , such as this year 's Home Office £ 4 m anti-binge - drinking campaign , were viewed as " laughably unrealistic " .
The TV images showed young people injuring themselves , being violent and smearing vomit in their hair .

However , adverts which highlighted that drinking was a " cool " habit and a form of " calculated hedonism " did appeal to and influence the audience .
The researchers noted that participants discussed the harm , risks and pleasures of drinking but this was set firmly within a culture of " drinking to excess " , which they described as a form of " fun " .
Professor Isabelle Szmigin , who assisted the study , told the BBC : " For young people , drinking is very much a part of their social life but we feel that a lot of the government literature tends to present a picture of it being an individual responsibility rather than a social one .
" Young people do engage with the idea of responsible drinking but far more from the social side .
They ensure there are designated drivers ; people looking out for each other and that their friends are safe . "
' Get message ' Don Shenker , the chief executive of the charity Alcohol Concern , said new campaigns were needed to highlight the more immediate possible consequences of drinking too much .
" The type of messages around drinking for young people need to be much more focused on the short - term aspects - things like being a victim of a crime , ending up in hospital due to intoxication , the way that alcohol affects your looks for example , " he said .
The government has said the aim of its recent campaign against binge drinking was to encourage people to " think twice about the serious consequences " .

What I am about to write will sound out of character .�
In writing , I often try to strike a balance between what should be , and what is possible . �
In this piece , I am temporarily ignoring what should be , for what could help solve our economic problems at minimum societal cost .�
Please understand that I am a principled man who hates inflation , but with the doofuses that mismanage the Fed , I am aiming for “ second best ” policies here .
-==-=–=-==–=-=-=-=
Al McGuire , past coach of Marquette Basketball , was once asked ( something like ) , � Would you rather have an A student or a C student at the free throw line in a tense situation ?��
His answer was the C student , because he wouldn�t think about the situation , he would just act , and sink the free throws .
The current Fed is clever .�
Too clever by half .�
They have aimed for a trifecta of fixing short - term lending markets , not raising inflation , and stimulating the economy . �
Though they may have had modest success with the first goal , the second goal has been rendered irrelevant , and the third goal is a failure .
It would have been better if the Fed had simply revved up the printing presses ( virtual as most of them are ) , and began monetizing the government debt . �
That is too crude of a strategy for our central bankers , who have delicate constitutions , and are fighting a war that ended 20 years ago .
How would higher inflation help the current situation ?
Wages and the nominal value of collateral underlying loans would rise , reducing credit stress .
People and institutions would stop sitting on their savings waiting for prices to fall further before acting .
Inflation would cheapen the dollar , making imports more expensive and exports cheaper , stimulating the US economy .
Inflation would reduce the real value of debts owed to foreigners .
The Fed is wasting its time with its alphabet soup of credit easing programs .�
They accomplish almost nothing for the real economy , while lavishing liquidity on markets that tangentially help financial institutions .�
That is a great way to aid average Americans , not .
Far better to fire up the helicopters ( that ’s a figure of speech ) , and mail a check for $ 1000 to every person with a Social Security Number ( or their parents if they are in their minority ) .�
All of the complexity in the TARP and in the stimulus bills could be dispensed with , if we trusted the American people . �
Give them the money , not the credit markets .�

Historically ,
In times of extreme credit stress , the US has acted in this way , to relieve the stress of an indebted population through inflation . �

Though I am not crazy about inflation ( it will hurt me ) , nonetheless it would be good for the nation as a whole . �
( Of course , with harm to those on fixed incomes . )
Mortgage rates would rise , and other interest rates would rise , harming economic activity , but the economic tempo would still increase as people would seek to use their money before it declines in value . �
Inflation is a cost worth paying in order to get the economy moving again , giving debtors some breathing room .

Questions over woman hailed as first to swim Atlantic
If you 've been playing close attention to the papers today , you 'll notice many carry the remarkable story of Jennifer Figge .
The 56 - year - old from Aspen , Colorado , is being hailed as the first woman to swim the Atlantic , thereby claiming a world record , according to the Associated Press , which is quoted as the source for the articles .
But a closer look at the reported details reveals that if true , Figge really has completed a remarkable feat .
The Guardian says that the endurance athlete took 24 days to make the crossing from the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Africa to Trinidad , propelling herself across 2,000 miles of ocean .
A quick calculation shows that Figge would have had to swim 80 miles a day at least to cover the distance in the reported length of time .
But her business manager , David Higden has admitted that there were about five days where Figge did not even get into the water since the sea was so stormy and remained aboard the catamaran which accompanied her journey .
The AP story goes on to say that Figge woke up most days around 7 am and assessed whether the weather was fit for swimming .
Her longest stint in the water was about eight hours while her shortest was 21 minutes .
We also know that she had planned to swim to the Bahamas but was blown off course to Trinidad .
Such setbacks do bring into question exactly how many miles
Figge did swim during her crossing .
So far she has not commented bar her initial quotes to AP .
Figge has said however she plans to swim a further 900 or so miles to the British Virgin Islands from Trinidad , arriving in late February , when her crew will work out the total distance she swam .
So is it too early to declare world records ?
Benoît Lecomte from France made the first known solo transatlantic swim in 1998 , covering 4,000 miles in 73 days .
He was accompanied by boat but swam six to eight hours a day , earning him a place in the Guinness Book of Records .
Figge is certainly the first woman to accomplish a feat of her kind , but it is debatable whether she swam enough miles to earn the world record title .
Readers have already expressed their suspicion .
On the Huffington Post 's website , comments have been left questioning what percentage of the journey she completed by boat , and whether her vessel continued to drift at night while she was asleep .
One poster who goes by the name of " gaijinpl " has picked apart the numbers to come to this conclusion : " Impossible .
The claim is fraudulent in some way .
If you do the math , and know that the north equatorial current maxes out at around 5.5 mph , there 's something seriously wrong with this story . "
Gaijinl says she would have had to covered 77.78 miles a day at 9.72 mph .
" With best possible current conditions , that 's still a 4.25 mph sustained speed .
As a good comparison , the fastest any woman has ever swum the English Channel has been 7.5 hours , at a rate of 2.8 m ph .
A sustained rate of even 2.8 mph over 27 eight - hour days would also be impossible .
" So , either she 's had the world 's best set of conditions , or she 's a fraud .
The boat carried her some indeterminate portion in the right direction .
Can I say I ran the NYC marathon if I take the subway part of the way ? "
Readers of the Times website are equally doubtful about her achievements .
As one commentator on the Huff 's site writes , answers are needed " otherwise the idea of swimming across the ocean is really quite meaningless " .
It is quite possible that Figge has achieved this exhausting crossing .
The American is no stranger to endurance activities , having started them 20 years ago when her son urged her to give up smoking .
Her Facebook lists an impressive list of swims and runs , including – if you believe it – a 180 - mile run across Mexico where the final 60 miles were completed with a cast on her left leg .
So what is the true story here ?
Is Figge an extraordinary women with an achievement to be proud of or is there something fishy going on ?
Or is it that the story was badly reported by news agencies ?
Even Higden has said in her defence : " Nobody could swim across the Atlantic .
It 's physically impossible .
It would take literally years . "
Deceased bristlecone pine tree in Great Basin National Park , Nevada ; oldest known non-clonal organism .
Prometheus ( recorded as WPN - 114 ) was the oldest known non-clonal organism , a Great Basin bristlecone pine ( Pinus longaeva ) tree growing near the tree line on Wheeler Peak in eastern Nevada , United States .
The tree , which was at least 4,862 years old and possibly more than 5,000 , was cut down in 1964 by a graduate student and United States Forest Service personnel for research purposes .
[ 1 ]
Those involved did not know of its world - record age before the cutting , but the circumstances and decision - making process remain controversial .
The tree 's name refers to the mythological figure Prometheus , who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man .
[ 2 ]
The designation WPN - 114 was given by the original researcher , Donald Rusk Currey , and means it was the 114th tree he sampled in his research in Nevada 's White Pine County .
About the tree [ edit ]
Prometheus was a living member of a population of bristlecone pine trees near the tree line on the lateral moraine of a former glacier on Wheeler Peak , in Great Basin National Park , eastern Nevada .
Wheeler Peak is the highest mountain in the Snake Range , and the highest mountain entirely in the state of Nevada .
The bristlecone pine population on this mountain is divided into at least two distinct sub-populations , one of which is accessible by a popular interpretive trail .
Prometheus , however , grew in an area reachable only by off - trail hiking .
In either 1958 or 1961 , a group of naturalists who admired Prometheus 's grove gave names to a number of the largest or most distinctive trees , including Prometheus . [ 3 ]
Currey originally estimated the tree was at least 4844 years old .
A few years later , this was increased to 4862 by Donald Graybill of the University of Arizona 's Laboratory of Tree - Ring Research .
These ring counts were done on a trunk cross-section taken about 2.5 m ( 8 feet ) above the original germination point of the tree , because the innermost rings were missing below that point .
Adjusting Graybill 's figure by adding the estimated number of years required to reach that height , plus a correction for the estimated number of missing rings ( not uncommon in trees at the tree line ) , it is probable that the tree was at least 5000 years old when felled .
That made it the oldest known unitary ( i.e. non-clonal ) organism at the time , exceeding even the Methuselah tree of the White Mountains ' Schulman Grove , in California , though Methuselah was later redated to 4850 years old . [ 4 ]
In 2010 , a reportedly living bristlecone pine in California 's White Mountains was measured by Tom Harlan to be 5062 years old .
Unfortunately , this pine has not been found after Harlan 's death in 2013 , and its core has not been located at the Laboratory of Tree - Ring Research . [ 5 ]
Whether Prometheus should have been considered the oldest organism ever known depends on the definition of " oldest " and " organism " .
Certain sprouting ( clonal ) organisms , such as creosote bush or aspen , may have older individuals if the entire clonal organism is considered .
[ 6 ]
By that standard , the oldest living organism is a grove of quaking aspens in Utah known as Pando , at perhaps as much as 80,000 years old , although likely much less .
In a clonal organism , however , the individual clonal stems are not nearly so old , and no part of the organism is particularly old at any given time .
Until 2012 , Prometheus was thus the oldest non-clonal organism yet discovered , with its innermost , extant rings exceeding 4862 years of age .
Cutting of the tree [ edit ]
The cut stump of the Prometheus tree
In the 1950s dendrochronologists were making active efforts to find the oldest living tree species in order to use the analysis of the rings for various research purposes , such as the evaluation of former climates , the dating of archaeological ruins , and addressing the basic scientific question of maximum potential lifespan .
Bristlecone pines in California 's
White Mountains and elsewhere were discovered by Edmund Schulman to be older than any species yet discovered .
This spurred interest in finding very old bristlecones , possibly older than the Methuselah tree , aged by Schulman in 1957 at over 4,700 years .
Donald R. Currey was a graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill studying the climate dynamics of the Little Ice Age using dendrochronology techniques .
In 1963 he became aware of the bristlecone populations in the Snake Range in general , and on Wheeler Peak in particular .
Based on the trees ' size , growth rate and growth forms , he became convinced that some were very old , cored some of them , and found trees exceeding 3,000 years in age , but Currey was not able to obtain a continuous series of overlapping cores from WPN - 114 .
Here , stories diverge .
It is not clear whether Currey requested , or Forest Service personnel suggested , that he cut down and section the tree in lieu of coring it .
There is also some uncertainty as to why a core sample could not be obtained .
One version has it that he broke or lodged his only long increment borer and could not obtain another before the end of the field season ; [ 7 ] another claims he broke two of them , while another implies that a core sample was too difficult to obtain and also would not provide as much definitive information as a full cross-section of the tree .
Currey said that the tree cores were too small and difficult to read so he used a chain saw and cut the tree down . [ 8 ]
In addition , there are conflicting views of Prometheus 's uniqueness in the Wheeler Peak grove .
It is reported that Currey and / or the Forest Service personnel who authorized the cutting believed the tree was just one of many large , very old trees in the grove .
Others , at least one of whom was involved in the decision - making and tree cutting , believe that the tree was clearly unique — obviously older than other trees in the area.[ citation needed ]
At least one person involved says that Currey knew that to be true at the time , although there is no known admission from Currey that he did , and others have disputed that the tree , based on observation alone , was obviously much older than the others . [ 3] [ 8 ]
Another uncertainty is that it is not clear why the felling of such an old tree was necessary given what Currey was studying .
Since the Little Ice Age had started no more than 600 years ago , many trees could presumably have provided the information he was seeking for that time period .
In Currey 's original report in the journal Ecology ( Currey , 1965 ) , however , he refers to the Little Ice Age as encompassing the period from 2000 BC to the present , thus defining the Age over a much longer time period than is currently accepted .
Whether this was a common view at the time is not known .
In the article , Currey indicates that he sectioned the tree as much to determine whether the oldest bristlecones were necessarily confined to California 's White Mountains ( as some dendrochronologists had been claiming ) as from its usefulness in regard to studies of the Little Ice Age . [ 8 ]
Whatever the rationale , the tree was cut down and sectioned in August 1964 , and several pieces of the sections were hauled out to be processed and analyzed , first by Currey , then by others in later years .
Sections or pieces of the tree have ended up in various places , some of them publicly accessible , including the Great Basin National Park visitor center ( Baker , Nevada ) , the Ely Convention Center ( Ely , Nevada ) , the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree - Ring Research ( Tucson , Arizona ) , and the U.S. Forest Service 's Institute of Forest Genetics ( Placerville , California ) .
Repercussions [ edit ]
It has been argued that the cutting down of Prometheus was an important factor in the movement to protect bristlecones in general , and the Wheeler Peak groves in particular . [ 9 ]
There had been a movement to protect the mountain and contiguous areas as a national park before the incident , and 22 years later the area gained national park status .
Contemporary references [ edit ]
In August 2014 , marking the fiftieth anniversary of the tree 's cutting , a two - day memorial for Prometheus was held in Great Basin National Park by artist Jeff Weiss . [ 10 ]

Vim is an editor that requires a significant early investment to learn how to use with any effectiveness .
It then takes a significant early investment to get comfortable using it .
After that , you could spend the rest of your life learning to use it , learning something new about it every single day , and still have more to learn after forty years .
The investment in the learning curve is definitely worth it in my opinion , however , as the productivity gains I have achieved using Vim , and the comfortable intuitiveness of it , by far eclipse any initial investment in learning it .
Note that this is all predicated upon the assumption that you touch - type using a QWERTY keyboard layout .
If you do n’t , you ’re better off using something like SciTE instead .
An editor does n’t get as intuitive and productivity - enhancing as Vim is without doing so for a strict subset of typists , and the primary assumption on which Vim relies is that you ’re a QWERTY keyboard touch - typist .
I hear it works reasonably well for Dvorak keyboards , too , but there are one or two things that end up slightly “ off ” unless you change some of the defaults for Vim commands .
Getting Vim
Vim is open source ( but , alas , not copyfree ) software that is in the software management archives of every major open source Unix - like OS in existence , including BSD Unix systems and Linux distributions .
As such , installing is trivial on such systems .
Check the software installation process particular to your open source Unix - like OS of choice for details .
I recommend getting the console - based Vim and using that at first , if that is reasonably possible .
If you are using MS Windows and are n’t the type to use Cygwin or some other Unix emulation environment , though , you should probably use gVim instead .
GVim is a version of Vim that comes with a GUI interface , complete with clicky buttons , and is pretty much a necessity if you want to use Vim in a standard MS Windows environment because of the severely crippled support for console - based applications on that OS .
Other than under such circumstances , the only time I ’d recommend gVim is when you try out the console - based interface first and discover that you just ca n’t handle a more keyboard - driven text editor at first and need a more gentle introduction to modal , keyboard driven editors .
Before giving up on the console - based interface , though , try it out for a few days ( or , if you do n’t do much text editing in an average day , maybe longer ) .
Anyway . . . if you ’re on an OS that , like MS Windows , does n’t have a modern software management system , or you want to install Vim outside of your software management system for some reason , you can download Vim from the Web .
Many open source Unix - like OSes come with Vim already installed , though , so you may not even have to install it .
Be aware that some of them ( such as Ubuntu ) have a “ slim ” version of Vim installed by default instead of the standard Vim editor , however .
This lighter weight version lacks some functionality , and if you do n’t have a compelling reason to use the smaller version , you should probably just install the full - size version .
Even the standard , full - size version is smaller than two megabytes , last I checked , so you are n’t likely to consume an undesirable quantity of storage space on your hard drive .
Starting Vim
With less productive , more GUI - oriented text editors ( how do you like the way I slipped that bias in there ? ) , you ’re probably used to opening a text editor , getting a blank , untitled file , and filling it with text before deciding on a name and saving it .
You can do that with Vim , too , but I recommend you adopt a different approach when using it .
Instead , specify the name of the file when you first open it .
The console - based Vim is started with a command entered at the shell prompt .
You ’ll probably do this within a terminal emulator such as KTerm , GNOME Terminal , ETerm , XTerm , the MacOS X Terminal , or rxvt .
Entering the command vim is enough to open the editor , but to open it by specifying a file name ( such as an existing file you want to edit or a new file you create at that moment ) , you would enter something like :
vim filename.txt
Part of the reason I recommend specifying the name in advance is that Vim caches your file to the hard drive every now and then by default in case of a crash ( as in the case of someone tripping over the power cord of your computer and causing it to be unplugged while you ’re in the middle of typing ) .
The next time you open the file , if you specify the same file name , it will offer options for recovering the file from that cached version of the file .
Otherwise — well , I ’m not really sure what it does , otherwise , because I ’ve never had to find out .
Maybe it does n’t create a cached version until after the first time you save it .
Maybe it uses some cryptic name based on the time and date , or a default name .
I just think it ’s a good idea to name your file when you open it .
If you disagree , do things differently .
Using Modal Editing
When learning Vim , the first thing you need to know is that it uses modes for different parts of its operation , and if you start trying to enter text while you ’re in the Command mode you can do all kinds of weird damage to a text document .
Luckily , you can probably undo the damage very easily , as long as you do n’t accidentally save and exit the program while you ’re busily doing damage .
The program starts up in Command mode .
In Command mode , you can use single - character keyboard shortcuts and typed commands that start with a colon to achieve quite a lot of very efficient editing very quickly with very few keystrokes ( once you learn how , and get familiar with it ) .
Actually , Command mode is what it ’s called in old - school vi ; Vim is an extended , “ improved ” version of vi .
Vim calls it “ Normal ” mode , which I find silly , so I keep calling it Command mode .
To start actually entering text normally , you need to enter Insert mode .
Do that from Command mode just by pressing the < I > key .
To exit Insert mode , going back to Command mode , press the < Esc > key .
To undo changes , pres the < U > key while in Command mode .
The entire last time you were in Insert mode , complete with any changes that were made in Insert mode , is considered a single change for purposes of undo / redo .
To redo something you just undid , type : redo and hit enter — the : tells Vim you ’re going to type a command .
Saving and exiting must be done in Command mode .
To exit without saving , use the q !
command ( i.e. , type :q ! ) .
To save without exiting , use the w command .
To save and exit all at once , you can use the x command .
To specify a filename when saving it , in a sort of “ Save As ” situation , you can do so with a command like :
:w filename.txt
Finally , it might help to understand the philosophy of modal editing .
For that ,
Why , oh WHY , do those #?@!
nutheads use vi ? is what I recommend reading .
Learning Vim
You really just have to use the hell out of it to get comfortable .
It will probably prove somewhat difficult at first , but as I already said , I think the initial learning curve is well worth it for the long - term productivity gains .
If that ’s not true for you , c’est la vie .
A few resources for learning more :
If you have Vim installed on your computer , you should be able to start a tutorial for it by entering vimtutor in a terminal emulator window .
There ’s a built - in help system in Vim that you can use to search Vim documentation for how to perform specific tasks .
It does n’t always provide the most intuitive approach to finding what you need , but you get to it by typing something like :h search in Command mode , where “ search ” is a search term .
In fact , if you literally enter :h search in Command mode , you ’ll get help information on how to search a document for text that matches a particular regular expression .
The same site that offers the explanation of the philosophy and benefits of modal editing , linked above , also offers some vi /Vim tips .
The Vim Tips Wiki might be of some use to you .
So might Mastering the VI editor .
Be sure to check out the Vi Lovers Home Page .
You might want to bookmark a Vi Cheat Sheet .
This is just one of many on the Web .
An excellent book for learning about how to make your way around in a Unix - like environment without the GUI — good for both experts and novices — is A Practical Guide to Linux Commands , Editors , and Shell Programming .
It has a decent section on vi/Vim in it , too .
More resources can be found on the Vim subreddit .
. . . and Beyond
Hopefully , you find that helpful .
I ’ll probably provide some Vim usage tips that I ’ve found particularly helpful and somewhat unobvious in the near future .
Once you really learn how to use vi / Vim , you can learn to throw the vi gang sign , and be a vi gangsta .
Make sure Firefox is working by checking the proxy is active and then try to go to a web page .
You can also try a site like WhatIsMyIp.com to verify the ip you have with the proxy is different than without .
If everything is working then you can be assured that all of your browsing traffic is being encrypted through the tunnel and no one at your current location will be able to see your traffic over the network .
Once you are done with the proxy just exit the ssh xterm or kill this instance of ssh with Ctrl -c .
Remember to set Firefox back to " Direct Connection " if you want to directly browse from your location otherwise you will not be going anywhere .

Questions ?
How can I setup two or more ssh tunnels through two or more machines ?
At some point you may need to tunnel through multiple ssh tunnels through multiple machines .
This is quite easy to do as long as you have ssh access to every machine you want to tunnel through .
In this example we will be tunneling from a desktop machine through a machine called host1 and then to a machine called host2 which will then access the internet .
Something like so :
Firefox desktop -> host1 -> host2 -> internet
First , make sure you went through the beginning on this page and know how to get firefox to proxy through a SOCKS5 proxy on localhost port 8080 .
Then run the following ssh command on the desktop running Firefox .
This will setup an encrypted ssh tunnel to host1 from the " Firefox desktop " .
desktop $ ssh - C2qTnN username@host1 -L 8080:localhost :8080
Now , you need to ssh to host1 directly .
Once you are on host1 run the following .
This will collect any data from the first tunnel originating from the " Firefox desktop " to host1 and tunnel that data to host2 .
host1 $ ssh - C2qTnN -D 8080 username@host2
So , how does this setup work ?
Firefox on the desktop will initiate a SOCKS5 connection to localhost port 8080 on the desktop machine .
Since a ssh tunnel is listening on localhost : 8080 it will ssh tunnel the traffic to host1 which will forward this traffic to host1 's localhost : 8080 .
On host1 the second ssh command will tunnel all traffic it receives on localhost : 8080 from the desktop machine to host2 .
On host2 the traffic will then be able to go out to the internet at large .
If you have DNS SOCKS5 resolution on as well then all web traffic _and_ dns queries will goto host2 through both tunnels .
From the view of the internet all queries originating from the " Firefox desktop " will look like they come from host2 .
Nice and anonymous .
What if I need to tunnel through more then two machines ?
Then just keep repeating " ssh - C2qTnN username@host1 - L 8080:localhost :8080 " command for each incremental host .
Once you decide you very last host you want the data to access the internet with then use the " ssh - C2qTnN - D 8080 username@host2 " command .
To make sure you tunnel is working correctly using a site like ipchicken.com to see what ip address you are coming from .
In the case of our example above ipchicken should report the ip address of host2 .
Do you have any recommended modifications for Firefox in " about : config " ?
First , make sure to check out our Firefox Add - on " Calomel SSL Validation " .
More open proxy connections :
When you use a proxy , Firefox limits the amount of concurrent open connections to 8 .
This is too small for most users as many people open multiple tabs to many sites .
When more then 8 connections are made the browser seems to be " stuck " because Firefox will wait till an open connection is closed before making a new one .
To avoid this problem it is highly suggested to increase the persistent connections value from 8 to 25 .
network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-proxy
25
Turn off pop-up tips :
If you are annoyed by pop up text when your mouse hovers over a web element you can turn that function off .
browser.chrome.toolbar_tips false
No animations : Stop all animated gifs and pictures like ads and annoying dancing cartoons characters .
image.animation_mode none
No blinking text : Blinking text is annoying .
Webmasters should not use it .
In case they do , we will disallow the function in the browser .
browser.blink_allowed false
Parallel connections :
An easy way to speed up Firefox is to increase the amount of parallel connections the browser makes to the server .
Open up Firefox and type in " about : config " in the URL .
Then search for the string " conn " You should see the following entries listed .
Modify them as follows :
network.http.max-connections 25 network.http.max-connections-per-server 25 network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-proxy 25 network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server
25
It is _not_ recommended to use more then 25 parallel connections due to abuse of the remote server and concurrency bottlenecks on the local system .
Understand that if you have a slow system then more parallel connections can actually slow the browser down considerably .
Also , if you try to open too many connections to a server then that server many consider you hostile and block or blacklist you .
Pipelining Enabled :
The fastest and most efficient way to implement a browser is to use pipelining .
This is where a single persistent connection is used , but instead of waiting for each response before sending the next request , several requests are sent out at a time .
This reduces the amount of time the client and server are waiting for requests or responses to cross the network .
Pipelined requests with a single connection are faster than multiple HTTP / 1.0 requests in parallel , and considerably reduce the number of packets transmitted across the network .
Apache supports both HTTP / 1.0 keep - alive and HTTP / 1.1 persistent connections .
Pipelining is implement entirely at the browser end if supported by the remote web server , using persistent connections .
To enable pipelining in Firefox browser goto the url about : config .
Then search for " pipe " and set the following :
network.http.pipelining true network.http.pipelining.maxrequests 8 network.http.pipelining.ssl true network.http.proxy.pipelining true
TLSv1 with AES256 , AES128 and 3DES 168 Only :
When connecting to SSL based servers ( https ) you only want to use the strongest ciphers available .
Most web server admins can setup their servers to prefer weak ciphers over strong ciphers for any reason ; sometimes they want a less CPU intensive encryption or perhaps they just configured the server wrong .
Even Google 's encrypted pages prefer RC4 instead of AES and this is not our idea of good security .
We want to make sure that our version of Firefox only uses AES 256 bit , AES 128 bit or 3DES 168 bit ciphers .
Open up a window and type " about : config " .
Then in the " Filter " bar at the top search for the following .
Double clicking on each line will change the value .
tls and set the lines to true .
and set the lines to true .
ssl2 and set every line entry to false .
and set every line entry to false .
ssl3 and set every line to false _except_ lines containing the strings " aes_256 " and " aes_128 " .
and set every line to false _except_ lines containing the strings " aes_256 " and " aes_128 " .
security.ssl3.rsa_des_ede3_sha and set it to true .
This is the weakest cipher and may be needed for some older SSL sites .
Now your browser will _only_ accept the TLSv1 protocol in AES256 bit cipher encryption no matter what previous weaker ciphers a web server prefers .
This configuration also makes your browser FIPS 120 - 2 compliant ( year 2030 specs ) .
Is there any way I can switch proxies faster ?
There are add - ons , also called extensions , for Firefox called FoxyProxy or SwitchProxyTool you can use .
They offer the ability to setup multiple proxy settings and choose the one you want , or turn them off , using a drop down menu .
I noticed you use compression in the ssh tunnel proxy .
Why ?
The majority of the data you are retrieving using the browser is text or HTML data .
This type of data compresses very well at up to 80 % .
Using compression in the tunnel will speed up the delivery of the data considerably .

Quotable :
I got interested in political economy to a very large extent because Karl Brunner had started the Interlaken Seminars in Switzerland .
There were a lot of people there who were trained in philosophy or sociology .
Since my training was in economics , I thought we ought to try to model some of these problems .
I began to read Hayek at that point , articularly The Constitution of Liberty .
It is a fascinating book , dealing with all the problems of how institutions fit together .
I was very fortunate to work with Scott Richard , and later with Alex Cukierman , on trying to model some of these processes .
We tried to develop simple models in which there was a government that did something more than provide a public good , or act as if it had solved the planner ’s problem .
One of the works that influenced me at that time , as I said , was Hayek .
Hayek would certainly not try to solve the planner ’s problem .
He saw life as being a great deal more uncertain and government as being very unlike an optimizing planner .
Where classical and neoclassical economics emphasized the certainty of life , Hayek and the Austrians emphasized the uncertainty of life .
That aspect of the Hayekian program had great appeal for me .
Karl and I had earlier worked on information and uncertainty as a reason for using money — that is , using an institution such as the medium of exchange .
Why not other institutions ?
One source of uncertainty is uncertainty about accruing information .
These interests led Brunner and me to work on permanent and transitory influences .
I did some work using filtering – trying to sort out the nature of these different shocks based on some work by Eduard Bomhoff and his student Clemens Kool .
More :
I was getting interested in political economy at one time and so I would talk to [ Karl Brunner ] about Hayek , Popper and about the Austrians ..
Q. Had he read
Hayek at that time or did you get him to do so ?
A . He had read it when he was much younger .
I possibly had read it also when I was much younger .
But I think its always been my view that certain books strike you very differently depending upon the stage you are and how receptive you are to the ideas .
Probably when I read Hayek as a young man with a very strong leftist leaning I did not get interested in the Road to Serfdom or the Constitution of Liberty .
I believed that society could reinvent itself in the short - term if necessary .
The view that I took from Hayek is the importance of uncertainty , tradition and institutions .
Hayek and Popper , who also are very much in that tradition , had a great influence on me sometime in my 30s .
I had not read Popper earlier .
I felt very differently about Hayek when I read it as a 30 year old then when I read it as an 18 or 20 year old .
More :
Q. O.K. , now besides Karl Brunner are there other economists who have had a really major influence on your thinking ?
A. Well I mentioned Hayek .
There are two ways .
One is because of my interest in political economy .
The other way is that Hayek was a pioneer in the use of information in economics .
One of the papers that Karl and I wrote together that I continue to like was a paper called “ The Uses of Money ” .
In that paper we tried to incorporate information and the cost of information to explain why people use money .
One of Hayek ’s most basic ideas is that institutions are a way of reducing uncertainty .
Man struggles to find institutional arrangements which on average make life a bit more predictable .
Our “ Uses of Money ” is not so much about money as we conventionally think about it , it ’s about the idea of a medium of exchange , the function of an institution called the medium of exchange and how the medium of exchange as an institution resolves a part of people ’s uncertainty about the future .

OK , it ’s just one data point .
All I know is sales of FogBugz and Copilot .
But what I ’m seeing is this : October - December 2008 were terrible — sales were 20 % lower than usual — but starting January 5th , we saw a significant bounce back to the same level of sales as we had before this recession started , and it ’s continued to this day .
This could be a fluke ; it might not reflect any reality .
Or it could be a sign that tech firms , for the moment , are doing reasonably well .
The Joel on Software job board is holding steady at about 50 jobs listed , down from a peak around 100 , but there are still a significant number of openings for great developers .
Does this jive with your experience ?

I kinda have death on the brain right now , which led me to pose this week 's question to the Dtoid staff .
And I learned a valuable lesson : Citing an example in the topic is a good way to derail a conversation to discussing said example for a long time .
Still , it made for some good chatter .
This week 's guest is the incomparable Mxyzptlk , who I continue to curse for having to choose the most difficult to spell name in the DC Universe for his handle .
Follow along past the jump to see what the gang thinks about the finality of death as it is known in gaming today .
Conrad Zimmerman :
The concept of a final death , the " Game Over " screen , has all but disappeared in videogames .
Between checkpoints and autosaves , there 's barely any penalty for death any longer .
And , as we all know from the latest Prince of Persia , some developers are even working to eliminate the act of dying altogether .
But simply because you can't technically " die " in a videogame , does that automatically make a game easier ?
Is death in gaming a psychological hindrance to success ?
Should we care that this aspect of games is going by the wayside ?
Dyson :
Anyone who complains about the non-death in Persia needs to reexamine the way the play games .
To look at this particular game and say that it is too easy denotes a viewpoint of a person who either ; has n't played games in the last ten years , or has n't been paying attention to the games that they have been playing .
Although no one technically ever dies in a video game - you can always put in another quarter , right ?
- every game is designed to keep you going .
The " deaths " are merely a stopping block to progression and only , in gaming 's current form form , teach how to get better at the scenario in which you failed .
Old school games are truly games that occasionally punish you for failing , and they are the main reason that I still think that people who can best older games are better at gaming than people who only play today 's games .
There were real negatives to bad games back in the day and complete failure would set you back to an earlier level or sometimes even to the title screen .
Even though that was the case back then , games have become more experiences than true challenges in today 's market .
Games now will always give you infinite second chances when failing .
Dead Space , for example , will restart you back at the last loading pint .
Halo , Crackdown , and Call of Duty , will all give you a respawn point when you get overwhelmed and die .
To credit Persia with some sort of lack of challenge is ridiculous because it only does the exact same thing that all other current games do , but it gets penalized because it's a platformer .
So you can't really die in Persia ?
Wow .
Show me a current gen game that you do die in , please .
The only difference in Persia is that is does n't say " you die " when you fail .
It still sends you back to the last checkmark like all other current games and still provides a challenge in gaming skill .
If you 're a person that finds this unpalatable , then I suggest that you find some other type of hobby to enjoy because this is how gaming is today .
As far as there being no true Game Over screen in today 's games , I feel that it is indicative of the type of games that people of this generation are used to and is now the industry standard in game development .
If you 're missing out the feeling of a true challenge in gaming , I suggest you go back at least one or two game generations and play those games .
If you are upset by the way that games have moved from challenging experiences to just experiences , then I suggest that you direct your ire towards yourself .
The way games are today is because of you .
Your dollars spent on games that support this play style are directly responsible for the continuation of the style .
To quote V for Vendetta , " If you 're looking for the guilty , you need only look into a mirror . "
Adam Dork : Ummm , does this mean we need a new discussion ?
I can't argue with that ... although I feel that PoP's " set - back " death thingy was no hindrance to your progress in the game in which other games do feel you are " punished " or set back in some way cause I actually cared if i didnt succeed .
In PoP , I never had any cares about what happened to the Prince , especially during the fight / duels .
There did n't seem to be any consequence for does n't something wrong which steers me to be a better player .
Who cares if I miss a block in a duel with the warrior , I can't die or get hurt .
At most , he gets a little health back that takes a hit or two to bring back down .
It did n't make me want to try at all .
Same with the jumping sequences , I did n't want to try cause the deaths seemed meaningless .
So that is my problem with non-deaths in PoP .
Joseph Leray :
That 's interesting .
Even though Adam agrees with Dyson , there 's still something missing .
For me , dying in God of War or Ninja Gaiden just made me want to try again .
Even though there 's no " penalty " except for some lost time , something about the game (s ) made me want to come back and be better ( or , sometimes , just luckier ) .
I have n't played the new Prince of Persia yet , so I can't comment , but Adam 's explanation makes it seem like there 's some sort of psychological disconnect between Elika saving your ass and the need to become better at the game .
Dyson : Apologies if I sidetracked this .
I just get a little irked when fools be nagging on this game for something that happens in every game out today .
Does not dying in a game make it easier ?
Yes .
To quote Topher , who I think inadvertently quoted me , " the only thing keeping you from finishing a game these days is time . "
I 'm pretty sure that I 've said this multiple times on RFGO !
and I still believe that it 's true .
Joseph Leray :
Well , there are still a few that adhere to old ways -- Godhand , most shmups , Ninja Gaiden ( although some of its difficulty is artificial ) , etc .
But yeah , for the most part , this is an argument we should 've been having 8 years ago .
Which is n't to say that this Dtoid Discusses is n't relevant -- I just think it 's interesting how Prince of Persia has created a polemic out of a design choice 10 years in the making .
Weird how we latched on to it .
Anthony Burch : I think it 's more interesting to ask whether or not this death - that - is n't - death choice affects other aspects of the design .
For instance , many jumps and obstalce sections in PoP were not particularly well - done ( you could dodge one killer black thing on a wallrun but run into a second during the same run because you can't change speed or direction after initiating your wallrun ) , seemingly because the level designers figured , " eh , fuck it , they 're only going to get pushed back thirty seconds . "
Dyson : I do like where this discussion is going , though .
And it 's not to say that there are things lacking in the new PoP , but it getting slammed for the reason of never having a true death is stupid .
Being a person that totally enjoys gaming in all its forms , I 've noticed that the lack of any true end game in games of today does make for better experiences , but worse gamers .
I do n't rail against this idea too often , but when people of this gen tell me that they 're good at games I just laugh .
Not being able to die in a game takes away from trying to be better at it .
Not saying that games today do n't project that fail / succeed impact , but PoP was the only current game that gets rid of that mentality completely and allows the gamer just experince .
Is n't that what gamers want these days ?
Maybe I 'm a little out of touch , but I can't see how in this landscape that this is nothing more than a progression of how games are headed as opposed to a failing on the game 's design .
PoP gave you what you wanted , did it not ?
A game that lets you play it without any penalty .
Jonathan Ross : Some of DtoidLA was actually talking about PoP earlier today , and a discussion similar to this came up .
If done properly , I do n't think that no death is necessarily a bad thing .
I think when people criticize Prince of Persia for being to easy , they get drawn to the no-death aspect of it , but it 's really more of the fact that the game is just a giant series of quick time events that do n't even really require precise timing .
I have n't played a ton of the game so I do n't feel qualified to really go into it , but even from watching people play it really just seemed like a " press A every 5 seconds " kind of deal and it did n't matter if your timing was off .
Because PoP is the only game that is coming to mind right now where death is literally absent ( I know there are more , but I 'm too tired to think of them right now ) , I do n't have much else to add .
If we want to add in a discussion though about how games are becoming easier in general , and it 's much , much harder to die in the first place , then I have a whole boatload of things to say about the bullshit that is immediate regeneration of health in most of today 's FPSes .
Adam Dork : Yeah , PoP was definitely a big QTE game .
I felt like I played half of the game with only one hand on the controller .
It could 've almost been made for a DVD player and be the same .
Jonathan Ross : I 'm going to do something crazy and use a sports analogy here , but generally to me , a game with no penalties whatsoever almost seems like a sports game where you do n't keep score and " everyone wins " .
Some people like it , but it 's not particularly my cup of tea .
I view games ( with a couple exceptions ) as a competition .
I 'm either playing against other people , playing against the computer , or playing against myself .
Victory feels much more hollow when there really were n't any obstacles along the way .
Adam Dork : I never wanted a game without penalty .
Penalty makes me try different tactics and makes me want to play the game better .
It strives me to do a better job .
Penalty makes me care .
Dyson : Ross , I could spend hours on the fact that if you hold still in an FPS you get " healthier . "
If games are going for true realism , and one of the many detractors of that idea is the I found a ham in a garbage can that is ubiquitous in games like Final Fight from back in the day , I can understand the mentality .
But to say that somehow holding still regenerates your overall health , to me , is equally dumb .
Stating that some factor of keeping yourself alive over another is a somewhat moot point when all the mechanics of staying alive in any game , regardless of their generation , needs a certain amount of belief suspension .
Jonathan Ross :
The belief suspension I do n't really mind , since picking up a health pack and being fine , or getting shot 5 times and still being alive are just as unrealistic , and some games actually give a semi- decent reason as to why your health regenerates .
The problem I have is with what it 's done to the gameplay , and I understand that a lot of it has to do with putting twitchy shooting games onto consoles , where they generally have to run at a slower pace for a variety of reasons .
I have two big problems with it :
1 . If you find yourself getting overwhelmed , you just hide behind a concrete barrier , basically become invincible , and then pop out 10 seconds later with a brand new " life " .
There 's no incentive to aim well , play strategically , or really try to plan anything because if you get in trouble , you can just hide and everything is perfect again .
2 . To compensate , the " difficulty " in these games typically comes from the computer just throwing cheap , almost unavoidable 1 hit kills at you , where progressing almost becomes more about luck than any kind of skill .
Some parts of the original Gears of War I could blow through on the hardest difficulty , and then other parts I would just get one hit killed over and over again , and the parts that would happen at changed every time I played .
Left 4
Dead still stands out to me as a game with a perfect challenge level , because when I die , I KNOW it 's because I ( or my teammates ) fucked up .
It 's not because a hunter fell out of the sky and one hit killed me , it 's not because a smoker halfway across the map I could n't see headshotted me with his tongue ; it 's because my teammates and I made a critical mistake .
Someone shot a boomer , someone ran ahead / behind , I decided to continue on instead of taking out the smoker I saw stalking us through the last section .
THAT is the kind of difficulty I fear we 're moving away from , and we can even see it in PoP where Anthony was talking about the jump you have to make where you can't time it properly because you can't see what 's around the corner .
I can enjoy an easy game just as much as a hard game , but I want to know that the actions I take and the decisions I make have a direct impact on whether I succeed or not .
Hopefully I 'm not derailing the original topic too much , but I think this talk about difficulty is pretty closely tied to death in gaming ...
Jonathan Holmes : I 'd like to get back to Conrad 's original question for a second .
( editor 's note : Why bother ? )
Is death in gaming dead ?
No , in traditional videogaming , death is alive and well .
Games like Geometry Wars , Wii Play : Tanks , Mega Man 9 , and The Last Guy are all fairly punishing in terms of the amount of death they hand out , and far those deaths set you back .
However , in " interactive narrative experiences " like BioShock , PoP , GTA , and in the typewriter free Resident Evil 5 , it looks like death is dying .
It 's not totally dead yet , but it 's headed there , and I think that 's Ok .
If you put over fifty million of dollars into making a game , you 're going to want people to play it from beginning to end , and for them to have fun the entire time .
You would n't want to risk the player getting frustrating and quitting your game permanently because they died .
When people who have n't been playing games for +10 years die in a game , they often think " Shit , I 'm dead .
Death is permanent .
Therefore , I permanently quit playing this game . "
That 's why I think they chose to make death not really " death " in PoP .
The series is all about defying natural law and doing the impossible , so I can see why the really did n't want anyone playing the game to get that sinking that they " died " .
For me , not having that sinking feeling is a turn off , but I can imagine that for a lot of people it makes all the difference in making a game appealing .
Like take Pikmin for example .
For years , I 've been trying to get people to play that game ( and by " people " , I mean girls that I 've dated ) .
Almost all of them hated the game .
Why ?
Because they can't stand the guilt they feel when even one Pikmin dies .
They 'd rather not play the game at all than shoulder that kind of life responsibility .
I 've told them so many times " Do n't give up !
That one Pikmin might have died , put you 're still alive !
You can always grow more ! " , but it does n't matter .
The death of just one Pikmin is usually enough to turn them off to the game for good .
Nintendo did too good of a job at maiking you love those little fuckers .
Brad Rice : I just went through several hours of grinding last night in Soul Nomad in an attempt to make the last boss easier to beat .
In that time , I most definitely died a half dozen times , and lost a few hours worth of gameplay .
I think that in RPGs -- especially tactics RPGs -- you have to make a big gamble with grinding and death .
In both Soul Nomad and Disgaea , I have to be smart about how I protect every unit , and most importantly , my leader .
So , the fear of death is constantly upon me as I try to win big in terms of leveling up and getting some kick - ass items , but I could lose all of it if I make a wrong choice .
So , at least in one genre , the fear is still alive and well .
Jonathan Holmes : Good point , Brad .
One of the main reasons I do n't play a lot of tactics RPGs these days is that the fear of loosing a unit is often to much for me , since death if usually permanent in those genres .
Mxyzptlk : I believe that the goal in phasing out the " Game Over " screen has n't necessarily been to make games easier , just less tedious .
To be frank , the entire reason it exists in the first place is as a carry - over from the arcade days , where the designer 's job was to get you to plunk as many quarters in the machine as possible .
Games are still evolving as a medium , and developers are torn between trying to cater to gamers who crave skill - based challenges and those who play for the experience .
As I see it ( and I have yet to play it , so I can only go on what I 've heard and observed second - hand ) , Prince of Persia is leaning heavily towards being an " experience " .
I think we 'll be seeing more and more games with a narrative go this route .
Other titles like Alone in the Dark have experimented with ways to make titles more accessible to a larger number of people .
Let 's face it , if someone hits a brick wall and is n't able to beat a game because of a high difficulty , they 're less likely to spend the money to buy more games .
That being said , there 's always going to be a place for titles that reward players for skill , such as Geometry Wars or the highest difficulties in Rock Band / Guitar Hero .
I 'm sort of amused that for all the complaining about Prince of Persia , nobody has mentioned another recent game where death has zero consequence : Braid .
All you need to do is simply hold down a button and rewind time back as long as you wish .
Even in PoP : Sands of Time you were limited as to how many times and how long you could go back .
Jonathan Ross :
In regards to Braid , I think it works because of the type of game it is .
In a puzzle game like that , you 're not going to be able to move forward until you figure out what you need to do ; if you restart and keep trying the same thing over and over again , it 's not going to work .
The game is really figuring out the puzzles instead of brute force trial and error like Mega Man or Gears is .
In Prince of Persia , there does n't seem to be much thought or figuring things out - you push A when it tells you too and sometimes something you could n't see or avoid because you do n't have control over the timing would kill you , and you just do it again hoping you guess the timing right .
Additionally , a number of the later puzzles in Braid acted as a " game over " , because you could very easily get stuck and have to restart the level .
You were n't dying , per se , but you could mess up to the point of having to go back to the very beginning .
I do agree though that having death not be a consequence is not necessarily a bad thing .
I Wanna Be
The Guy would usually throw you just back to the beginning of the screen when you died with unlimited lives , and there were typically saves on almost every screen .
Because of the nature of the gameplay though , you still feel a sense of accomplishment and that you 've beaten something when you pass a level , just because it 's insanely hard and often takes a fair amount of thinking to figure out .
My concern is that the shift to these " experiences " removes the sense of accomplishment , which is one of the main reasons I enjoy playing games in the first place .
I do n't want games to end up basically becoming movies where you 're just pressing " A " to get to the next 5 minutes worth of footage - at the very least , I want to have to do something to earn it .
Whether switching your credit card will cost anything close to the example outlined above — and whether that nets out to be a moneymaker — depends on a number of factors .
Among them : Savings on interest .
Switching to a low - rate or 0 percent interest rate card for a six - month introductory period can reduce the overall interest you pay on the outstanding balance .
The amount of that savings depends on how long it takes to pay off the balance once the rate adjusts to its normal level , the amount of monthly payments and whether other transactions ( i.e. , cash advances or purchases ) are charged to the account .

Credit scores .
Canceling an older credit card can impact your credit score and affect the ability to get other credit cards and loans .
The dollar value of this cost depends on a number of variables but should be considered when switching credit cards .
Methodology and assumptions :
For the transfer amount , we used a credit card with an outstanding balance of $ 7,300 , the average amount of credit card debt in 2007 according to the Consumer Finances Survey published by the Federal Reserve in February 2009 .
This example assumes the consumer is making two payments a month using recurring automatic payments to the old card .
A study released by the Federal Reserve in October 2008 says the number of payments initiated on billers ’ sites is unknown .
However , rewards card users frequently sign up for such payment methods to boost spending for rewards points .
Time cost :
What is the value of your time ?
The closest estimate is what workers are paid by employers .
According to the U.S. Department of Labor ’s Bureau of Labor Statistics , the average wage for a nonfarm , production nonsupervisory worker was $ 18.49 in January 2009 .

What say you ?
I think many men can appreciate a good female superhero .
Be it Wonder Woman , one of the female X - Men , or something in the video game world like Lara Croft .
What guy does n’t want to see a women kicking ass ?
I mean that was the central premise of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Alias on television .
And I enjoyed those shows .
But imagine if some of your favorite heroes were women ?
Not just Wonder Woman , but let ’s say The Flash or Daredevil .
Guess what ?
People already have .
Individuals like Portal Comic and Elsa Chan have come up with depictions of female version of various characters , be it from comics , video games , or even the movies .
And I ’m not talking about Batgirl or Supergirl .
I ’m talking about characters like the female Aquaman to the right , or Aquawoman if you will .
And there are plenty of other examples .

In our latest browser speed tests , I half - heartedly complained that Firefox eats up memory over long periods of use .
Our lovely , helpful commenters pointed out that there is , indeed , a tweak to help with that .

It 's important to note that this about : config tweak does n't actually change how Firefox uses ( and hoards ) memory over actual use .
For the purposes of user speed , then , it 's not much change .
But while Windows can normally grab memory back from applications that are minimized , Firefox prevents that and keeps all the memory it acquired during your multi-tab wanderings — unless you enable this tweak , which some have claimed also makes Firefox scale down the big memory pile it had going upon re-focusing .

Let 's get started .
Type about : config into your address bar , hit Enter , and confirm to your browser that you 'll be careful messing with your configuration .
Unless you 've performed this specific change before , right - click somewhere outside all those period - separated values and choose New / Boolean .
In the window that pops up , enter config.
trim_on_minimize and hit OK , then select " True " in the next dialog .
Close out your about : config window , restart Firefox , and you 're now demanding that Firefox give up some of that sweet , sweet RAM when it 's not even showing on your desktop .
This could lead , of course , to slower functionality when re-maximizing Firefox , or even bugginess .
And those who are using Firefox just fine with its standard memory settings should probably leave well enough alone .
You can read up on just what this trick does at the MozillaZine Knowledge Base .
Need to undo it ?
Simply head back to about : config , start typing in the boolean variable 's name again ( config.trim_on_minimize ) , and when it pops up , switch it back to " False " by double - clicking or right - clicking .
Have you used this little Firefox tweak to save memory and stuck with it ?
Finding it buggy and unreliable ?

Parents Say No to Artificial Sweeteners
Despite the findings by Health Canada that artificial sweeteners are safe , parents in B.C. have decided to play it safe and say no .
The B.C. Ministry of Education has recently pulled all artificial sweeteners from being sold in B.C. primary and middle schools after consultations with parents of school children .
" I 'd be very suspicious of Aspartame , " said former Nicola Valley Teacher 's Union leader , Ralph Poynting .
" I would n't put it in there , why take the chance ? "
The findings were issued in the September 2007 Guidelines for Food and Beverage Sales in B.C. Schools enacted by the B.C. ministries of education and health as part of a healthy schools initiative .
The ministry came to its after consultations with parents , trustees , and dieticians .
The guidelines allow for artificial sweeteners in small amounts and
as a condiment in secondary schools , but not in elementary or middle
schools .
" The studies related to aspartame clarify enough concern as regards adverse health effects , that their use in schools should be banned , " said neurosurgeon , Russell Blaylock , in an exclusive interview with the Merritt News .
" Careful studies , including the original studies by G.D. Searle company , demonstrate a significant cancer risk , especially for brain cancers , breast cancer , lymphomas and leukemias , such that would justify their being banned , " he continued .
Blaylock considers artificial sweeteners and MSG as " excitotoxins " that play a critical role in neuro - degenerative diseases like Parkinson 's Disease , Alzheimer 's , and MS .
Health Canada has allowed the use of artificial sweeteners since 1981 , when former U.S. Secretary of Defense , Donald Rumsfeld , then CEO of the Searle Corporation , petitioned the Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) for approval .
The passing came despite the fact that the FDA 's Public Board of Inquiry , made up of scientists , voted unanimously against the approval of aspartame .
On July 15 , 1981 , Dr. Arthur Hayes Jr , in one of his first acts as FDA Commissioner , overruled the Public Board of Inquiry and approved NutraSweet for dry products .
Health Canada followed suit and the artificial sweetener industry was
born .
Health Canada scientists have concluded that the reported findings of the European Ramazzini Foundation of Oncology , which found malignancies in rats tested with doses of aspartame , did not indicate a need to change the existing restrictions already outlined in the Food and Drug Regulations .
Health Canada concludes that the overwhelming body of evidence supports the safety of artificial sweeteners .
Health Canada has requested the complete raw data from the Ramazzini Foundation and has been analyzing it since 2006 .
There has been no word yet on their analysis .
Some of the most common artificial sweeteners are : Aspartame , Sucralose , Splenda , Acesulfame - K ( Acesfulfame Potassium ) , NutraSweet , as well as Saccharin .
Aspartame is composed of L - Aspartly - L- phenylalanine methyl ester .
They can be found in beverages , breath mints , chewing gum , prescription drugs , supplements and vitamins , and various other food products .
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Symptoms attributed to Aspartame in complaints submitted to the FDA show headaches as the highest complaint followed by dizziness .
Aspartame related complaints make up 80 per cent of total complaints to the FDA each year .

Workers had to be led to safety when a fire broke out at a food processing plant in Northamptonshire .
More than 40 firefighters were called to tackle the blaze at TMI Foods on the Lodge Farm industrial estate in Northampton on Monday night .

Firefighters said there was no indication as to the cause of the fire , though an investigation has begun .

His grandfather Prescott Bush was a U.S. senator , and his father and brother were presidents .
Yet Jeb Bush does n't believe in political dynasties , and seems perfectly willing to let his family 's legacy of serving in high office in Washington pass him by .
It 's " possible , " he says , that he 'll never run again -- for anything .
That includes ...
“ It is the policy of this administration to invoke the state secrets privilege only when necessary and in the most appropriate cases , ” he said , adding that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. had asked for a review of pending cases in which the government had previously asserted a state secret privilege .
“ The attorney general has directed that senior Justice Department officials review all assertions of the state secrets privilege to ensure that the privilege is being invoked only in legally appropriate situations , ” he said .
“ It is vital that we protect information that , if released , could jeopardize national security . ”
The court papers describe horrific treatment in secret prisons .
Mr. Mohamed claimed that during his detention in Morocco , “ he was routinely beaten , suffering broken bones and , on occasion , loss of consciousness .
His clothes were cut off with a scalpel and the same scalpel was then used to make incisions on his body , including his penis .
A hot stinging liquid was then poured into open wounds on his penis where he had been cut .
He was frequently threatened with rape , electrocution and death . ”
Ben Wizner , a lawyer for the A.C.L.U. , told the judges that many of the facts that the government is trying to keep secret are scarcely secret at all , since the administration ’s rendition program and the particulars of many of the cases have been revealed in news reports and in the work of government investigations from around the world .
“ The only place in the world where these claims ca n’t be discussed , ” Mr. Wizner said , “ is in this courtroom . ”
What the A.C.L.U. is asking , he said , is that the case be allowed to go forward , giving the courts a chance to decide , based on classified information revealed solely to the judge , what should be allowed to be discussed .
But Mr. Letter said that the lower court judge , James Ware , did receive classified information and came to the correct conclusion in dismissing the case last year .
He urged the judges to pore over the same material , and predicted “ you will understand precisely , as Judge Ware did , why this case ca n’t be litigated . ”
In a related matter , Patrick J. Leahy , the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , on Monday proposed the establishment of a “ truth commission ” to investigate the Bush administration ’s treatment of detainees and other issues , like the firings of United States attorneys by the Justice Department .
The commission , he said , could grant immunity to witnesses to explore the facts without the threat of criminal prosecution .
The president is popular for now - but while his stimulus package is being hailed as a victory , no one truly believes it will work
On Friday , the day Congress passed the stimulus bill , more than 250 people arrived at the Holiday Inn in Somerset for a careers fair .
There are scenes like this all over the country .
In San Francisco last week , queues for a similar fair went out of the door and around the block .
In Miami last month , a thousand people waited in line , some overnight , for just 35 firefighter jobs .
But New Jersey has not quite suffered like the rest of the country , and in Somerset the line of hopefuls is long but moves reasonably fast .
For the most part , they came in sober suits dressed as though - if someone made an offer - they could start work today .
Most clutched résumés and stared off into the middle distance , trying not to catch anyone 's eye .
And in a county broadly reflective of the nation demographically , white men over the age of 40 were considerably overrepresented .
The fact that there is a queue at all in Somerset county is significant .
According to the census , Somerset has a median income that is almost twice the national average and a poverty rate below 25 % .
If there 's a line here , then there are lines everywhere .
Larry , 48 , used to organise meetings within the pharmaceutical industry but was laid off in July .
When he started at the firm two years ago there were 75 employees - now there are just over 20 .
" We 've become a bloated society and we need to readjust to a much simpler lifestyle , " he says .
" Because these are tough times and things will probably get worse before they get better . "
Everyone waiting has their own story , but two threads keeps emerging .
Almost all were laid off in the last nine months .
And had you asked them a year ago , none of them would have believed they would be in the position they are today .
If there is one thing more staggering than the scale of this economic crisis , it is its pace .
The vertiginous decline in house prices , portfolios , government budgets , payrolls and balance sheets has forced a reckoning with the world as we thought we knew it .
On the same day that they waited in Somerset , four banks failed .
The banks were small and spanned the country from Oregon to Florida .
Beyond their locales they will not be missed .
And yet together their demise makes you wonder how many canaries you can fit in a mine .
In 2007 there were three bank failures in the whole year .
Last year there were 25 .
Now we are up to four in one day , making 13 already since the year started .
These were small enough to fail .
According to some economists , if the larger banks were forced to struggle on alone they would have suffered a similar fate long ago .
" At this moment , the liabilities they have far exceed their assets , " Adam Posen , of the Peterson Institute , told the New York Times , referring to the banking sector .
" They are insolvent . "
In less than a year we have gone from George Bush claiming " I do n't think we 're headed to a recession " to a Newsweek cover declaring " We 're all socialists now " .
Nobody knows who to believe .
As banks crash , jobs vanish and pensions disappear , the anxiety becomes endemic .
In the last three months alone , the percentage of those for whom jobs are their principal worry has almost doubled .
Something has to give .
As the line in Somerset suggests , the crisis has now reached those least likely to take to the streets but most likely to go to the polls .
" As the financial crisis has deepened , affluent Americans , in particular , have grown increasingly sceptical that the economy will come back in the coming year , " concluded a Pew research poll last week .
This time last year it was mainly the low - paid and poorly educated who feared for their livelihoods .
Now , graduates and the wealthy are similarly gloomy .
How long they will endure such reduced circumstances , who they will blame , and what they will do about it remains to be seen .
America may have neither the class consciousness nor organisation to spark the kind of protests we have seen in France , eastern Europe and elsewhere in recent weeks .
But it has the levels of class division that could produce both .
Political cultures are as volatile as markets .
When a popular American response emerges to this crisis , we will probably have no more warning than we did of the crisis itself .
What is becoming increasingly clear is that it will not find a home in mainstream politics .
President Barack Obama is popular for now .
But his programme for reinvigorating the economy is not .
Indeed , it is a sign of the dislocation between politics and everyday life that while the $ 787bn stimulus package that Obama is expected to sign today is being hailed as a great victory , nobody truly believes it will work .
The Republicans are only relevant in terms of what they can prevent happening as opposed to what they can make happen .
Meanwhile , as his treasury secretary , Timothy Geithner , outlines his plans for saving capitalism , capital flees .
For now , people are relying on their own resourcefulness .
Back in Somerset they are cutting out the fat .
Susan Saez , a lively woman who used to sell high - end jewellery , jokes about how she has trimmed her budget .
" I save on makeup because I do n't go out , " she says .
" I 've grown my bangs long so I do n't have to have the eye surgery I was going to have done .
And we gave up wine .
If I was n't , married I 'd be living with my mother . "
When the woman behind her says she got her hair cut for the fair , Saez nods her approval .
" That 's smart .
You should get it cut short , that way you do n't have to get it cut so often . "
But it is only so long before they are down to the bone .
The woman standing behind Saez , who refused to give her name , says she was laid off from a doctor 's surgery , and whispers about friends who are going to the food banks .
" I thought medicine was supposed to be safe , " she says .
" I 'm not going to the food bank ... not yet , but that is not something I never thought I would see in my lifetime . "
Outside , the fair 's organiser , Bob Hillman , stands like a ringmaster , with a tie full of American flags , seducing the line with possibilities that might lie inside if they make an effort .
" Your part is about more than just showing up today , " he says .
" You ca n't just go in and come out after five minutes .
The more people you talk to the better chance there is that you 'll have much better opportunities than if you do n't . "
He tells the story of a man in Salt Lake City who got a job and ended up back at the fair a few years later as a recruiter .
And of a computer technician who had no idea that there were jobs for his sector in the sheriff 's department .
Inside , most of the stalls are for people to set themselves up as independent contractors for companies like Avon or as self - managed satellite TV installers .
The longest line , where I met Larry , was to get someone to critique your résumé .
At the construction stand they offer free frisbees honouring military veterans .
Five minutes after she went in , Saez walks out again .
" I showed my face , I shook a hand , I got a pen , " she says .
" I do n't want to sell makeup .
And besides , there 's no one to sell it to . "

There is a notable , sad absence of recipes that involve coconut on this site and it ’s like totally my husband ’s fault .
The boy thinks he does n’t like coconut and every time I mention something that involves it he says “ maybe you can make something chocolate instead ? ”
But he ’s wrong , no really , he is .
I believe that he does like coconut , he just does n’t like that shredded , hard to chew stuff people stick to the outside of otherwise - tasty frosting .
It ’s not the flavor that bugs him .
And so I set out to prove him wrong by making these cookies , where the coconut is toasted and then ground and you get all of the flavor but not of the annoyingly papery texture .
Alex was adamantly opposed , so I promised to either dip or fill them with chocolate or raspberry or even better , filled with raspberry and dipped in chocolate and do you know what happened ?
None of this was necessary .
Because I WAS RIGHT !
He loves these cookies and he does love coconut when it ’s not gagging and leathery and did I mention I WAS RIGHT ?
Because , well , I probably have one or three or a dozen times this week .
I ’m really fun and mature like that .
This is n’t to say that you could n’t make these into sandwich cookies or even cuter , linzer - style hearts if you have two size heart cookie cutters and want a little belly of jam to show through on the top cookie .
You could dip a corner of the cookie in melted white or dark chocolate , or both .
I even thought about adding lime zest to go with the tropical theme , as lime and coconut were made to be together .
But promise me that before you do anything to them , you will try them as they are .
Because they ’re amazing : crispy , buttery , nutty , fragrant and perfectly salted , just the right amount to bring all the flavors into perfect harmony .
Chocolate !
Like I was going to leave you chocolate fanatics hanging — it is Valentine ’s Day week after all .
I created an index of all of the chocolate - heavy recipes on this site .
Of course , were I to have put together every recipe with any amount of chocolate on this site , well , I may as well have duplicated the entire archives .
Instead , I focused on confections where chocolate is the main attraction , or the kinds of things the chocoholic in your life dreams about .

Is Harry Reid going to do the right thing and boot this guy out ?
He said some of the most vile things against Obama that were spoken .
Especially after Obama saved his bacon in CT .
Joe Must Go !
Bolstered by a newly expanded majority , Harry Reid met with Joe Lieberman on Thursday to sketch out the conditions by which the Connecticut independent could continue to caucus with Senate Democrats .
But Lieberman did not accept Reid 's initial offers , leaving his future in the caucus uncertain , and potentially setting off a campaign to pressure the Democratic steering committee to decide Lieberman 's fate .
Reid offered Lieberman a deal to step down as chairman of the homeland security committee but take over the reins of another subcommittee , likely overseeing economic or small business issues officials said .
snip
Unfortunately for the Connecticut Senator , it is highly unlikely that Democrats would act against the wishes of Majority Leader Reid , who wants Lieberman to give up his chairmanship .
Moreover , progressive activists have been anticipating this move for months , and have organized efforts to pressure steering committee members to strip Lieberman of his perks .

KDE 4 , distributors , and bleeding - edge software

Buried deep inside a recent interview with Linus Torvalds was the revelation that he had moved away from KDE and back to GNOME — which he famously abandoned in 2005 .
The cause of that switch was the problems he had with KDE 4.0 , which seems to be a popular reaction to that release .
Various media outlets , Slashdot in particular , elevated Torvalds 's switch to the headline of the interview .
That led , of course , to some loud complaints from the KDE community , but also a much more thoughtful response from KDE project lead Aaron Seigo .
While it is somewhat interesting to know Torvalds 's choice for his desktop , there are other , more important issues that stem from the controversy .
Never one to mince words , Torvalds is clear in his unhappiness : " I used to be a KDE user .
I thought KDE 4.0 was such a disaster , I switched to GNOME . "
But , he does go on to acknowledge that he understands , perhaps even partially agrees with , the reasons behind it :
[...] but I think they did it badly .
They did so [ many ] changes , it was a half - baked release .
It may turn out to be the right decision in the end , and I will retry KDE , but I suspect I 'm not the only person they lost .
There has been a regular stream of reports of unhappy KDE users , with many folks switching to GNOME due to KDE 4.0 not living up to their expectations — or even being usable at all .
Part of the problem stems from Fedora 's decision to move to KDE 4 in Fedora 9 , but not give users a way to fall back to KDE 3.5 .
When Torvalds upgraded to Fedora 9 , he got a desktop that " was not as functional " , leading him to go back to GNOME — though , he hates " the fact that my right button does n't do what I want it to do " , which was one of the reasons he moved to KDE in the first place .
One facet of the problem , as Seigo points out , is the race between distributions to incorporate the most leading — perhaps bleeding — edge software versions .
It is clear that KDE did not do enough to communicate what it thought 4.0 was : " KDE 4.0.0 is our ' will eat your children ' release of KDE4 , not the next release of KDE 3.5 " is how Seigo described it when it was released .
That message , along with the idea that KDE 4 would not be ready to replace 3.5 until 4.1 was released , did n't really propagate though .
It was hard for users , distributions , and the press to separate the KDE vision of the future from the actual reality of what was delivered .
There clearly were users , perhaps less vocal or with fewer requirements , who stuck with KDE through the transition .
The author notes that he went through the same upgrade path in Fedora without suffering any major problems .
Reduced functionality and some annoyances were certainly present , but it was not enough to cause a switch to a different desktop environment .
It is impossible to get any real numbers for users who switched , had a distribution that allowed them to stick with 3.5 , or just muddled through until KDE 4 became more usable .
But , without a doubt , the handling of the KDE 4.0 release gave the project a rather nasty black eye .
Seigo also minces few words when pointing to the distributions to take a large part of that blame :
I have to admit that it 's really hard to stay positive about the efforts of downstreams when they wander around feeling they should be above reproach while simultaneously hurting our ( theirs and ours ) users in a rush to be more bad ass bleeding edge than any other cool dude distro in town .
I hope this time instead of handing out spankings , the distros can sit back and think about things and try and figure out how they played an unfortunate part in the 4.0 fiasco .
There is no real substitute to distributions and projects like KDE working together to determine what should be packaged up in the next distribution release .
It is unclear where exactly that process broke down for Fedora 9 , but it certainly led to much of the outcry about KDE 4 .
But , if they had it to do all over again , how would KDE have handled things differently ?
Projects want to make their latest releases available to users , so that testing , bug reporting , and fixing can happen .
That is the service that distributions provide .
But users rightly expect a certain base level of functionality in the tools that get released .
To some extent , it is a classic chicken - and - egg problem .
In his defense of the 4.0 release process , Seigo notes that releases , as opposed to alphas or betas , are the only way to get attention from users and testers :
Between the rc's and the tagging of 4.0.0 the number of reports from testing skyrocketed .
This is great , and shows that when I assert " people do n't test when it 's alpha or even beta " I 'm absolutely correct .
This is not about tricking people either : people seem to forget that the open source method is based on participation not consumption .
So testers look for a cue to start testing ; that is their form of participation .
" alpha " and even " beta " is often not enough of a cue , especially today when so many of our testing users are not nearly as technically skilled with the compiler , debuggers , etc as the typical Free software user was 10 years ago .
It would be easy to just fault KDE for releasing too early , but Seigo does have a point about " participation " .
Likely due to their exuberance at what they had accomplished for KDE 4 , the developers were blinded to the inadequacies of the release for day - to - day use — at least for some users .
The project needed to clearly get the message out that it might not be usable by all and it failed to do that .
It 's a fine line , but for something as integral as a desktop environment , it would have been better to find a way to release with more things working .
The flip side , of course , is that it takes testing to figure out what is n't working — which is part of the service users provide back to the projects .
This is not the first time we have seen this kind of thing .
Red Hat , and now Fedora , have always been rather — some would say overly — aggressive about including new software into releases .
Some readers will likely remember the problems with the switch to glibc - 2.0 in Red Hat 5 .
Others may fondly recall Red Hat 7 , which shipped an unreleased GCC that did n't build the kernel correctly .
We may be seeing something similar play out with the recently announced plans to include btrfs in Fedora 11 .
While it has been merged into the mainline kernel for 2.6.29 ( due in March ) , it is most definitely not in its final form .
There are likely to be stability issues as well as possible changes to the user - space API .
There is even the possibility of an on - disk format change , though Chris Mason and the btrfs developers are hoping to avoid it .
Much like with KDE 4 , btrfs will likely benefit from more users , but there is the risk that some will either miss or ignore the warnings and lose critical data in a btrfs volume .
Should that turn out to be some high - profile developer who declares the filesystem to be a " disaster " , it could be a setback to the adoption of btrfs .
KDE 4.2 has just been released , and early reports would indicate that it is very functional .
With the problems from the KDE 4.0 release — now a year old — fading in the memory of many , a rekindling of those flames is probably less than completely welcomed by the project .
But the lessons they learned , even if solutions are not obvious , are important for KDE as well as other projects .
Because free software is developed and released in the open , much can be learned from other projects ' mistakes .
It is yet another benefit that openness provides .
Earlier this month Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ( of the Kennedy Kennedys ) was asked at a congressional hearing if a 2002 over - the - top quote attributed to him - that hog farmers are a greater threat to Americans than Osama bin Laden - was accurate .
“ I do n’t know if that ( quotation ) is accurate , but I believe it and support it , ” said Kennedy , who has been waging a substantial legal fight against the meat industry for years .
While one may question Kennedy ’s judgment , he does have a point , whether his testimony that a single hog consignment can put out more pollution than a city of a million people is spot - on or not .
One sentence in another recent news article backed up Kennedy ’s concerns and was dumbfounding : “ The trillions of farm animals around the world generate 18 percent of the emissions that are raising global temperatures , according to United Nations estimates , more even than from cars , buses and airplanes . ”
Hey , between the New York Times and the U.N. , they could n’t make up this stuff , right ?
No wonder a 187 - nation gathering of environment ministers held talks in December in Poznan , Poland , on a new treaty to combat global warning , with U.N. climate officials calling agriculture one of the two most “ problematic ” sectors , the other being transportation .
Both ends of cows and other ruminants discharge flatus ( mainly methane that traps heat 25 times more efficiently than carbon dioxide ) ; animal manure contains not just methane but nitrous oxide , which is even more powerful a warming agent .
Animals need a lot of land and feed such as soy , which contributes to clearing forests and their trees and vegetation that absorb carbon dioxide .
Meat also requires refrigeration from farm to marketplace to home .
Ever more animals are needed - in large developing countries like China , India and Brazil , meat consumption is soaring , and globally is expected to double between 2000 and 2050 .
There are various partial solutions short of the obvious one preferred by vegetarians ( eat no meat ) or dietitians ( eat less meat ) .
In Sterksel , the Netherlands , a Times article said a group of farmers cook manure from their 3,000 pigs to capture the methane trapped within it , and then use the gas to make electricity for the local power grid ; California is working on a similar program .
Other , more high - tech , projects include inventing feed that will make cows belch less methane .
Some do - gooders want a “ sin tax ” on pork and beef and , in Sweden , they now label food products so shoppers can tell how much emission can be attributed to steak compared to , say , turkey ( a pound of beef has 11 times as much greenhouse gas emission as a pound of chicken and 100 times as much as a pound of carrots , a Swedish group says ) .
In Denmark , farmers must bury manure under the soil , which enhances its fertilizing effect , reduces odors , and prevents emissions from escaping .
New Zealand will by 2013 include agriculture in its new emissions trading scheme .
In Maryland , the Department of the Environment has new rules this year bringing the state in line with most other states regulating where , how and how long chicken farmers can spread manure on their fields or store it in outdoor piles .
This is no small matter , as the poultry industry , concentrated along the Eastern Shore , is Maryland ’s most lucrative form of agriculture and one of its largest employers , contributing more than $ 700 million annually to the state ’s economy .
Its 570 million chickens create piles of manure , which not only fill the air with ammonia but in some cases leech with runoff into the Chesapeake Bay , one of the nation ’s most polluted estuaries .
The phosphorous and nitrogen spawn algae that deplete oxygen needed by other aquatic life .
The crab population has fallen 70 percent in the past two decades , while the number of working oystermen has plummeted from 6,000 to less than 500 .
Agriculture accounts for over 40 percent of the nitrogen and phosphorous in the Bay and over 70 percent of the sediment .
Some Maryland farms have been working to help the environment , planting trees and environmental buffers around chicken houses and feeding the birds an ingredient to cut down on phosphorous in their manure , some of which they recycle in the world ’s largest chicken manure recycling plant , which produces organic fertilizer pellets .
While neither Burger King nor Chic - Fil - A is likely to go out of business anytime soon on account of a sudden aversion to belching cows or pooping fowl , the role that agriculture plays in the environment is a serious issue that clearly deserves attention .
The farmers of Sterksel in the Netherlands , the officials of the Department of the Environment for the State of Maryland , and Kennedy ( bin Laden comment aside ) may be on to something helpful .

Django , mod_wsgi and HTTP Authentication
I sometimes use HTTP ( Basic ) Authentication to authenticate requests to an API of a website .
Using cookie and form - based authentication for an API which will be used programmatically is generally a PITA .
If the views are exposed via HTTPS ( SSL / TLS encrypted ) then I see no problem in using HTTP Basic Authentication .
There is a good snippet available on djangosnippets.org , which implements a decorator for protecting individual views with HTTP Basic Authentication .
You can see the code here : Snippet 243 .
The usage is pretty straightforward , just add the decorator to a view that should be accessible to clients authenticated by HTTP Basic Auth :
@logged_in_or_basicauth ( ) def api_view ( request ) : ...
A good companion may be the require_POST decorator from django.views.decorators.http , which you can use on ( api - ) views , which only alter data and therefore should only receive HTTP POST requests .
Decorators can be stacked , so you can write :
@require_POST @logged_in_or_basicauth ( ) def api_view ( request ) : ...
The decorator will handle all the details of the HTTP Basic Authentication for you , so now let 's get back to the reason , why I 'm writing this text :
If you want to use this method to protect your views and you host your Django project on Apache with mod_wsgi , you have to add one setting to your Apache configuration :
WSGIPassAuthorization
On
If you do n't configure this mod_wsgi will not pass the HTTP Authentication headers to your Django application and your app will not be able to authenticate the requests .
Mod_wsgi will not pass authentication headers by default to prevent leaking passwords to WSGI applications .
If Apache itself handles the authentication , it 's clear that this is the right approach , but as we want Django to do the authentication be sure to configure mod_wsgi accordingly .
More details can be found in the mod_wsgi documentation about access control mechanisms .
Dear Mr Rotem ,
I have to say that the arrogance of your article in The Age , arguing that the paper should not have published a piece by Hamas official Khalid Meshaal left me stunned .
Even by the standards of your Government it was quite something .
Do you really think that you are entitled , as Israel ’s ambassador to Australia , to tell The Age who it should and should not be publishing ?
And yet , as I read on , you climbed to even greater heights of audacity .
You managed to brag about Israel ’s free press and democratic credentials , while calling on our press in Australia to restrict its freedoms — which coming from you amounts to an order from a foreign administration .
Perhaps , as a representative of Israel ’s Government , you ’ve become used to the idea of restricting critical scrutiny of Israel ’s actions .?
Of course , the arrogant attitude of your Government towards those who dare criticise Israel ’s actions is nothing new .
I have n’t forgotten when your Government decided that it would not allow academic Norman Finkelstein into Israel .
Your free press did manage to speak out about that , but your demonstration of contempt for freedom of opinion was surprising in its brazenness .
And there was more to come .
Not so long ago , I read in your press about Israel ’s decision not to admit the United Nations special rapporteur on the occupied territories , Princeton professor Richard Falk .
Your Government took this decision on the grounds that Falk thought Israel ’s human rights record was abysmal .
This is the kind of reasoning that makes perfect sense to military dictatorships around the world , and does rather compromise your attempts to lecture us on how to conduct a mature political debate .
But your Government ’s habitual arrogance , expressed through its contempt for international opinion , went even further .
Surely you recall that foreign journalists , desperate to get into Gaza to find out what was happening during Israel ’s onslaught , were prevented from doing so by Israel ’s army .
As the Yedioth Ahronot newspaper noted , even relatively conservative foreign journalists were forced to see the parallels between Israel ’s attitude to the press and that of Burma and Zimbabwe .
Mr Rotem , we know that your country seeks to restrict political dissent .
Your own free press , which you ’re so proud of , has been deploring the crackdowns on those who wanted to protest the latest series of Israeli atrocities .
( Are you also proud of arresting over 700 anti-war protestors ? )
We ’ve noticed that your country has decided to ban both of the Arab parties currently in the Knesset from running in the next elections .
As Haaretz ’s editorial on the matter noted , the petition to ban Balad came from the Yisrael Beiteinu party .
Your Government has repeatedly welcomed its head , Avigdor Lieberman into cabinet posts .
But while you admonish us for publishing what you call Meshaal ’s " hate - filled rhetoric " — and readers can judge that piece for themselves — you apparently see no problem with Lieberman ’s views — which include promoting the further expulsion of Palestinians from Israel – getting plenty of play in your press .
With that kind of double - standard in your attitude , who are you , Mr Rotem , to lecture us on what our press should and should not print ?
What do you think Australia has to learn from Israel on this matter ?
I ’m actually glad you were ridiculous enough to claim that Meshaal " sought to inflame anti-Semitic rhetoric " .
This is a textbook case of calling someone ’s argument " anti-Semitic " simply to demonise them and to avoid engaging with what they are saying .
( In this case , it ’s a little depressing that this is the best you can do — after all , the man you were attacking is the head of an organisation whose founding charter cites " The Protocols of the Elders of Zion " . )
But the problem is n’t that Meshaal ’s article was anti-Semitic , which it was n’t .
It ’s that he plainly described the suffering of the Gazans , which ordinary people find shocking .
And for good reason .
You claim to be appalled that The Age would run an op - ed by one of the leaders of a " terrorist organisation " , one that would dare commit such crimes as " aim rockets at civilian targets " , and one which " stages attacks on civilians " .
Do you think we ’re stupid ?
Do you think that we have n’t noticed your crimes against the Palestinians ?
Consider , for example , what Amnesty International has discovered , now that you ’ve finally allowed them into Gaza .
Their fact - finding team says that " previously busy neighbourhoods have been flattened into moonscapes … power lines have been torn down , and water mains ripped up .
Gaza ’s infrastructure is now in dire condition . "
The summary of the preliminary investigations goes on to note that " [ s ] chools , medical facilities and UN buildings all took direct hits from the Israeli army ’s indiscriminate shelling [ italics added ] .
Artillery shells for use on conventional battlefields , not for pinpoint targets , have been fired into dense residential areas . "
Amnesty also noted that the UNRWA Field Office in Gaza City was shelled on 15 January , destroying " [ w ] arehouses full of food , medicine and other humanitarian aid " , in just one of the reported instances of Israel ’s use of white phosphorous ammunition .
Amnesty says that white phosphorous should never be used in civilian areas , but it was not only used to destroy tons of aid supplies , but also in an attack on al - Quds hospital in Gaza .
Of course , because you did n’t let journalists into Gaza while you were bombing it , we ’ve only been able to get a fragmented idea of your crimes there so far .
But we ’ve already heard enough stories of your bombing civilian areas , of your soldiers shooting Palestinians waving white flags , and of other atrocities .
Are we meant to forget about the hundreds of Palestinian children you ’ve killed over the last few weeks ?
Are we meant to forget about the shameless and inconsistent apologetics you ’ve offered for the few atrocities that have attracted the scrutiny of the Western media ?
Hamas did kill three Israeli civilians during your campaign of bombing and invading Gaza .
Yet your crimes against the Palestinians are literally over a hundred times worse , if we only count murders of civilians through the use of indiscriminate weapons .
Meanwhile Israel ’s crimes against the Palestinians living under occupation for decades stretch on into many other areas , and Israel ’s appalling siege on Gaza has made this latest onslaught particularly grim .
Mr Rotem , I find your views grossly offensive .
But I support your right to print them in any paper willing to publish your vulgar propaganda .
The more the better , since it is in this realm of free , open debate that your Government is weakest .
And all the tanks in the world wo n’t change that .
Yours Sincerely ,
Michael Brull
Queensland , with its picturesque coastline , was the number one relocation destination in Australia , although the survey also noted a 44 per cent increase in the number of people moving to Adelaide and a 42 per cent increase in moves to Melbourne .
When the price of insurance against the Government defaulting on its bonds becomes more expensive than the equivalent cover for McDonald 's , either the markets are getting it horribly wrong or there is something distinctly rotten with the state of UK plc .
Certainly the market 's ability to price risk accurately has been called into question over the past few years .
In banking , retailing and oil , for example , the markets have n't always got the valuations right .
But the problems facing Britain go beyond market failure .
Our economy is in a deep recession and faces the prospect of continued negative growth and rapidly rising unemployment .
We also boast one of the biggest budget deficits in the world , which has swelled as Gordon Brown has sought to pour a fiscal stimulus of giant proportions into the economic engine .
Britain 's debt is projected to climb to £ 1 trillion by 2012 .

Germany 's minister of finance , Peer Steinbruck , broke diplomatic ranks last week by calling Mr Brown 's fiscal medicine a return to " crass Keynesianism " .
His blunt broadside seems to have drawn considerable support .
Evidence of that support has come from the foreign exchange arena , with sterling plunging in value .
Just over a year ago , newspapers were full of stories on how to spend your spare cash abroad , as sterling rocketed in value against the US dollar and the euro .
Last November , £ 1 could buy you $ 2.10 .
Today you'd be lucky to get $ 1.49 .
The fall of sterling has been even more marked against the euro .
Today , £ 1 will get you around € 1.131 .
Parity , something that seemed inconceivable a few years ago , could be around the corner .
Nick Fullerton , from broker FC Exchange , says : " Sterling has already moved significantly and there has been a great deal of damage over recent months .
After further rate cuts , sterling could reach the € 1.10 level .
Parity is fairly far away in my opinion due to the extent of movement already .
If it did start to breach the € 1.10 territory , we would see a lot of speculative movement and technical barriers – where large institutions programme trades to buy – would be hit .
€ 1.1086 is the important figure where everyone is expecting support to come .
If this is breached , then who knows where it could go . "
Sterling has long been due a fall , having been hugely overvalued in the past few years .
But now this longstanding anomaly has been rectified , it is the extent of further weakening that is vexing City minds .
And many think sterling 's downward journey has further to go in 2009 .
" I think sterling will go beyond parity against the euro , " says Stuart Thomson , chief economist at Ignis Asset Management .
" It has always been the most vulnerable to the credit crunch because of our reliance on financial services and the current account deficit .
Sterling has been overvalued in recent times because of the relative strength of these sectors , but I think those days are over now . "
Mr Thomson believes the pound is likely to settle at a longer - term equilibrium of around $ 1.40 , but could , in the short term , spike as high as $ 1.70 .
Against the euro , he thinks sterling could perch itself just above parity in the longer term .
At the euro 's launch in 1999 , £ 1 could buy you € 1.40 .

" We are looking at UK growth based on productivity gains more akin to 1970s levels in the coming years , " adds Mr Thomson .
" What we have at the moment is n't , in my opinion , a sterling crisis .
We are moving towards fair value quickly , but there is a very real chance we could hit the crisis point next year . "
Horizons in the Square Mile typically span days rather than years , but it is instructive to look back at the recent history of financial crises .
In the late 1960s , under the old fixed , but adjustable , sterling - dollar exchange rate , the pound was devalued by 14 per cent .
Harold Wilson , then Prime Minister , famously sought to reassure a sceptical nation when he stated : " It does not mean that the pound here in Britain , in your pocket or purse or in your bank , has been devalued . "
His promise rang hollow , as inflation spiralled out of control .
During the 1976 sterling crisis , the Chancellor , Denis Healey , was forced to go cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) to ask for £ 2.3 bn of bailout cash , as Britain was in effect exposed as bust .
Back then , the Government 's solution was to instigate a sweeping package of public expenditure cuts and tax rises – precisely the opposite to what was implemented by Alistair Darling in thepre-Budget report .
But sterling crises have n't been the sole preserve of Labour administrations .
In 1992 the value of the pound vacillated as Conservative Chancellor Norman Lamont pulled the levers of monetary policy to little effect – and Britain was forced to abandon its plans to join the euro as it quit the exchange rate mechanism ( ERM ) .
George Soros , the Hungarian hedge - fund trader , famously pocketed more than $ 1bn worth of profit betting against Mr Lamont 's interest rate shifts .
Of these three crises , Wilson 's in 1967 probably resonates most today .
Then , too , Britain was coming to the end of a boom period and sterling had been overvalued for a long time .
Though the ERM crisis was different in nature from today 's problem , William Buiter , a former member of the Bank of England 's Monetary Policy Committee , suggests that joining the euro is one way for Mr Brown to escape from the looming currency mess .
Britain would first peg sterling to the euro as a precursor to full membership – a move that would stabilise Britain 's macroeconomic and financial situation .
Then , if interest rate hikes proved necessary to stabilise the exchange rate , argues Mr Buiter , they would come with much greater credibility than during the 1992 run on the pound .
Back in 1992 , the Government controlled monetary policy .
Now , in theory at least , the Bank of England is totally independent .
But last week Mr Brown ruled out joining the euro , " ' this year , next year and beyond " .
The depreciation of sterling makes our exports to other countries much cheaper for foreigners .
Unfortunately , any kicker from the tumbling pound has n't filtered through yet .
Last week , figures from the CBI showed exports among its members were 45 per cent down , in spite of sterling 's fall .
Our goods may be cheaper , but other countries do n't have the cash to buy them .
Sterling 's depreciation also raises the spectre of galloping inflation as we import relatively more expensive goods from abroad .
Back in 1967 , Harold Wilson said the 14 per cent depreciation of sterling would enable Britain to " break out from the straitjacket " of boom - and - bust economics .
However , Britain 's economy then declined into a period of discontent .
Although the medicine administered by Mr Brown today is very different from that prescribed by Wilson , an alternative outcome does n't appear to be on the cards .
The pound seems set on a very rocky road in 2009 .
" So easy to learn , so hard to win . "
That 's how Somerville resident Brian Loring describes the timeless game of rock - paper - scissors .
Last Wednesday night at PA 's Lounge , though , he called himself " Rock Star , " strutting around in a cowboy hat and reflective shades , ready for action .
" I came to win . "
It was Loring who inspired his wife , Mimi Graney — director of Somerville 's Union Square Main Streets booster group — to suggest a rock - paper - scissors tournament for what turned out to be the organization 's largest " Second Wednesdays " community event yet .
With 58 registered participants — sporting nicknames like " Iron Fist , " " Hands Like Feet , " and " Sissy Fist " — and dozens more on hand to cheer ( or for the beer ) , the fists , palms , and fingers were flying .
" It 's like sumo for nerds , " emcee Gerry Green exclaimed at one point , as a steadily enthusiastic stream of competitors took the stage for four bracketed rounds of play .
The contestants ' experience varied .
" I play with my seven - year - old nephew all the time , " said 33 - year - old Lauren " Pile Driver " Pouchak .
" He throws scissors first . "
Strategy , too , was mixed .
One Somervillian said only " luck and wit " could help you when the fists hit the air , while another planned a complex application of game theory .
The tournament received a late endorsement from the World Rock Paper Scissors Society , which is ( technically ) no joke .
According to the 35 - page tournament rule book , opponents must stand at least a cubit apart .
When you throw paper , make sure you 're not throwing vertical paper , a /k / a " the handshake " — that 's not allowed .
And when throwing scissors , your index and middle finger must be between 30 and 45 degrees apart .
The refs — event organizers Anne Keffer and Jason Kean — were n't exactly holding protractors up to contestants ' fingers , and , well . . . they may have missed a call or two here and there , but after three beers , who 's counting ?
In the end , it came down to Nate " Papelcut " Taneja , a 28 - year - old Inman Square resident , versus Daniel " Shark " Shark , an unassuming 19 - year - old BU student who probably did n't realize when he crossed the river that he'd end his evening battling someone wearing a set of paper - clenching shears dangling from a gold chain .
Papelcut eventually fell to the Shark , who took home half of the door proceeds ( $ 128 ) , a rock - paper - scissors champion mug , and a copy of the game Rochambeau Twist , created by Somerville - based Veritas Games .
But for organizers and attendees alike , it was n't so much about winning or losing as it was about coming together around something that is , as Keffer described it , " completely ridiculous . "

Updating farming practices key to hitting ambitious efficiency target .
Chinese farmers need to change the way they irrigate crops to help avoid drought .
Punchstock
China must rapidly improve its outdated irrigation infrastructure if its ambitious plans to save water are to be realized , experts believe .
By 2020 , China wants to reduce water - use per unit of gross domestic product ( GDP ) by 60 % .
The plan was announced last weekend – amid the country 's worst drought for half a century – by the water - resources minister Chen Lei in the administration 's annual national conference in Guilin , Guangxi province .
The move marks a shift in policy .
China has , to date , focused on exploiting its water resources , but will now adopt a strategy of water - demand management that is based on making better use of water already mobilized , said Chen .
The ministry will also set out three " red lines " that will limit the total amount of water extraction and waste - water disposal , and increase the efficiency with which water is used .
" This is a very important strategic shift in water management , " says Ma Jun , director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs , a non-governmental organization in Beijing .
" It is a step in the right direction , " he adds .
Ma stresses , however , that myriad approaches needs to work in parallel to make fundamental changes in the situation – including sufficient financial backup , policies with clear incentives and sanctions , law enforcement , technological innovation , market mechanisms and public education .
Drying up
Official statistics show that China is short of 40 billion cubic metres of water a year on average : 300 million people are faced with drinking - water shortages and 15.3 million hectares of farmland – 13 % of the country 's total – are stricken by drought every year .
According to the Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters , the drought , which started in November , has affected 20 million hectares of crops nationwide – an increase of 58 % compared with the previous year .
This spring 's wheat is the hardest hit .
To many , such as Gong Peng , an ecologist at the University of California in Berkeley , California and the Beijing - based Institute of Remote Sensing Applications , Chinese Academy of Sciences , the current crisis is symptomatic of the lack of sustainable water - management polices and proactive measures to tackle droughts .
This is particularly the case with Chinese agriculture , which accounts for 70 % of the country 's water - use .
China 's irrigation systems reach less than half of the total farmland .
In Henan province , for instance , which is the most drought - stricken this spring , only a third of the farmed areas are properly irrigated .
Most of the irrigation systems in China were built in the 1950s and are poorly maintained .
Moreover , most farmers use flood irrigation – where water is allowed to flood an entire field – a millennia - old practice that wastes a great deal of water .
Drop by drop
To meet the ambitious water - conservation target , " China must modernize its irrigation infrastructure and switch to drip irrigation , " says Haim Gvirtzman , a hydrologist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem , Israel .
Drip irrigation is by far the most water - efficient method of irrigation , whereby water is delivered at or near the root zone of plants , drop by drop , through an extensive web of tubing .

" Switching to drip irrigation would help to save at least half of the water , " says Gvirtzman .
" It 's cheaper in the long run , too . "
The level of water resources per person in Israel is only 12 % of that in China , he adds .
By using water more effectively – and by recycling 70 % of its sewage water for agricultural irrigation – Israel gets by with the very limited water at its disposal .
Many believe that China also needs to have a long - term , systemic plan to restore its over - extracted groundwater .
" In the North China Plain , you need to dig as deep as 300 metres in some areas to get fresh water – whereas a few decades ago , a couple of metres would normally do , " says , Gong .
According to Ma's book , China 's Water Crisis1 , more than half of the 60 billion cubic metres of unreplenishable , deep groundwater had been extracted in the region , creating a huge groundwater funnel with an area of 40,000 square metres .
The over - extraction of groundwater has decreased the run-off of many rivers – including the Yellow River , which has dried up in its lower reaches many times in the past decades , notably for 226 days in 1997 .
" Groundwater is the lifeline during prolonged droughts , when surface water disappears quickly , " says Gong .
" To restore and maintain groundwater at a safe level should be a paramount counter - drought measure , " he adds .
Editor ’s note : Back in 2009 , Playboy still enjoyed a peculiar perch in American culture — for all sorts of reasons , good and bad .
It was also , as reporter Katharine Gammon found , a database .
Thanks to over half a century of ( weirdly , let ’s be honest ) publishing centerfolds ’ nominal body metrics , it became a document of the way a certain kind of person thought about idealized body mass index .
And that BMI did n’t exactly track with the times .
American women ’s average BMI went up ; Playboy ’s largely imagined BMI went down .
Now that Playboy is getting out of the skin trade , we thought we ’d look back at the numbers .
The world has moved on , but data ?
That ’s forever .
Facts and Figures
Playboy ’s Playmate data sheets ( you know , where they claim to enjoy cupcakes and The Deer Hunter ) provide height and weight , among other stats .
Our analysis shows that models are shedding pounds and gaining altitude at an alarming rate .
To be fair , Playmates provide their own measurements , so they could be exaggerating .
Plus , we would n’t put it past the editors to stretch the truth ( i.e. , Miss March 2008 may not actually want to write “ comedic short stories ” — or have a 21 - inch waist ) .
But who cares ?
What ’s interesting is n’t the veracity of the numbers , it ’s what the magazine thinks its readers will find ideal .
Are Those Real ?
On the touchy subject of implants , Playboy ’s policy seems to be do n’t ask , do n’t tell .
We plotted each model ’s bust size ( chest circumference at the fullest points ) and cup size ( breast volume ) for all years that data were available ( early ’ 90s to now ) .
While busts have shrunk faster than your 401 ( k ) , cup size has remained a buxom C or D .
We do n’t think evolution can explain this phenomenon .
Implants : A History of Augmentation
1962 : Timmie Jean Lindsey becomes the first woman to receive silicone breast implants .
1992 : Cosmetic silicone augmentations are prohibited for fear of adverse health effects .
1998 : Barbie ’s top - heavy figure ( BMI of 16.2 — too skinny to work as a model in some European countries ) gets a minimal reality check , resulting in a wider waist and narrower hips .
2006 : The FDA reapproves silicone implants for cosmetic purposes .
2007 : More than 347,000 cosmetic breast augmentations are performed in the US .

It should be obvious now even to mesmerized Democrats and starry - eyed progressives that a Barack Obama administration will be more of the same — more illegal wars , more mass murder , and more corporate globalization .
A few days ago Obama reaffirmed his change is more of the same when he selected former Dallas mayor and “ free trade ” advocate Ron Kirk to serve as U.S. Trade Rep in his administration .
Lou Dobbs on Ron Kirk and the North American Union agenda .
“ As a past supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) and China Permanent Normal Trade Relations ( PNTR ) , Kirk will face close scrutiny as he assumes the responsibility for delivering on Obama ’s pledges to fix existing trade agreements and create a new trade policy that benefits more people , ” reports the Eyes on Trade blog .
Obama ’s “ pledge ” will be about the same as his “ change , ” that is to say smoke and mirrors .
Ron Kirk is a servant to the global elite and the international bankers .
From The Choate - Weinberg Report :
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The Administration ’s point person on trade will be Ron Kirk , who is glaringly unqualified for the job .
In the late 1990s , Kirk was the Mayor of Dallas , Texas , and in 2002 , a candidate for the U.S. Senate seat now held by his GOP opponent .
Kirk has no experience in negotiating major trade deals or enforcing them .
As Mayor , he supported NAFTA and as candidate for the U.S. Senate he supported having the U.S. make more free trade pacts .
After failing to win the 2002 Texas Senate race , Kirk joined the giant Houston law firm of Vinson Elkins , where he lobbied the Texas Legislature for the Wall Street private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co and TPG , a global investment firm .
TPG has more than $ 50 billion of capital under management around the world .
KKR controls 51 private equity portfolio companies and has a total value of more than $ 68 billion .
KKR has done the largest buyouts in the history of the U.S. , the Netherlands , Denmark , India , Australia , Turkey , Singapore , and France .
Besides its U.S. offices , Vinson Elkins has offices in Abu Dhabi , Beijing , Dubai , Hong Kong , London , Moscow , Shanghai and Tokyo .
The principal criticism of the Clinton and Bush trade policies is that they were not about trade , but about making the world safe for U.S. investments .
It was investment policy .
Those policies , reduced to binding international treaties , facilitated and speeded the outsourcing of U.S. factories , jobs , and service work , even as they made the import of those foreign - made goods and services quota and tariff - free in the U.S .
U.S. Trade Representative designate Kirk has the perfect background and connections to continue those corporate - pleasing investment policies for the Obama Administration .
His will be a familiar career path – continue to serve corporate interests while in charge of U.S. trade matters and then become a highly paid international “ consultant ” after leaving Office .

Tessa Jowell , the Olympics minister , defended her estranged husband , David Mills , yesterday as he was sentenced to four and a half years in an Italian jail for taking a $ 600,000 ( £ 400,000 ) bribe as a reward for withholding court testimony to help Italy 's prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi .
The conviction , which Mills said he would appeal against , ends a three - year trial that nearly derailed the ministerial career of one of Tony Blair 's allies .
Jowell , who was culture secretary at the time , admitted signing a document crucial to the receipt of what the court in Milan yesterday ruled was a bribe .
She asserted her innocence by separating from her husband after the allegations emerged .
Yesterday the Tories said they would not be making party political capital out of the conviction of the tax lawyer .
In a statement yesterday , Jowell stood by Mills , saying : " This is a terrible blow to David and , although we are separated , I have never doubted his innocence . "
Mills , 64 , was not present in court when the judge , Nicoletta Gandus , read out her verdict , but said in a statement that he was very disappointed by the verdict and would appeal against it .
" I am innocent , but this is a highly political case , " he said .
" I am hopeful that the verdict and sentence will be set aside on appeal , and am told that I will have excellent grounds . "
Gandus said Mills would have to pay € 250,000 ( £ 220,000 ) in damages for the perversion of justice caused by his distorted evidence given at two trials in which Berlusconi was a defendant .
She also ordered Mills to pay a further € 25,000 in costs .
Mills 's lawyer , Federico Cecconi , told reporters afterwards : " This is a verdict based on a prosecution case that was anything but consolidated .
It contravenes the logic and dynamics of the trial . "
Berlusconi , indicted alongside Mills , who acted as his legal adviser on offshore dealings , is no longer a defendant .
His government passed a law last year giving the prime minister and other top Italian officials immunity from prosecution .
It is thought to be the first time in Italy that someone has been found guilty of taking a bribe without the giver of the money being identified .
Gandus 's reasons for her verdict will be released in writing at a later date .
Mills is entitled under Italian law to two appeals and the crucial issue now is whether they can be heard before the offence , of which he has been convicted , becomes " timed out " in February next year by a statute of limitations .
The prosecutor , Fabio de Pasquale , said : " It is possible , if they get a move on . "
The fact that Mills failed to appear at his trial was criticised by the judge .
Mills initially admitted having accepted what he had considered a gift or loan .
But subsequently he retracted his statement , leaving the prosecution with the formidable task of trying to establish how the money had reached him through a chain of offshore trusts and hedge funds .
In 2000 , Jowell and her husband took out a loan , securing it on their terraced house in Kentish Town , north London , and investing the proceeds in a hedge fund .
The following month , the loan was repaid with the $ 600,000 that has been at the centre of the trial .
After the transaction came to light , Jowell said she only became aware four years later , in August 2004 , that her husband had received money he " had reasonable grounds to believe was a gift " .
Tony Blair accepted her assurance .
The issue of Berlusconi 's immunity is now being considered by Italy 's constitutional court .
The Italian government recently secured Berlusconi 's position further with a clause inserted in a bill to reform the judiciary .
If approved by parliament , it will mean that , even if such immunity were lifted , the judge presiding over the case that ended yesterday would not be able to apply its outcome automatically to Berlusconi .
She would be obliged to begin proceedings all over again .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Obama administration plans to reverse a regulation from late in the Bush administration allowing health - care workers to refuse to provide services based on moral objections , an official said Friday .
The rule protects the rights of health care providers who refuse to participate in certain procedures .
The Provider Refusal Rule was proposed by the Bush White House in August and enacted on January 20 , the day President Barack Obama took office .
It expanded on a 30 - year - old law establishing a " conscience clause " for " health - care professionals who do n't want to perform abortions . "
Under the rule , workers in health - care settings -- from doctors to janitors -- can refuse to provide services , information or advice to patients on subjects such as contraception , family planning , blood transfusions and even vaccine counseling if they are morally against it .
" We recognize and understand that some providers have objections to providing abortions , according to an official at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .
The official declined to be identified because the policy change had not been announced .
" We want to ensure that current law protects them .
" But we do not want to impose new limitations on services that would allow providers to refuse to provide to women and their families services like family planning and contraception that would actually help prevent the need for an abortion in the first place . "
Many health - care organizations , including the American Medical Association , believe health - care providers have an obligation to their patients to advise them of the options despite their own beliefs .
Critics of the current rule argue there are already laws on the books protecting health - care professionals when it comes to refusing care for personal reasons .
Dr. Suzanne T. Poppema , board chair of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health , praised Obama " for placing good health care above ideological demands . "
" Physicians across the country were outraged when the Bush administration , in its final days , limited women 's access to reproductive health care , " she said .
" Hundreds of doctors protested these midnight regulations and urged President Obama to repeal them quickly .
We are thrilled that President Obama took the first steps today to ensure that our patients ' health is once again protected . "
But Tony Perkins , president of the Family Research Council , said , " Protecting the right of all health - care providers to make professional judgments based on moral convictions and ethical standards is foundational to federal law and is necessary to ensure that access to health care is not diminished , which will occur if health - care workers are forced out of their jobs because of their ethical stances .
" President 's Obama 's intention to change the language of these protections would result in the government becoming the conscience and not the individual .
It is a person 's right to exercise their moral judgment , not the government 's to decide it for them . "
An announcement reversing the current rule is expected early next week , the HHS official said .
Any final action would have to be taken after a 30 - day public comment period .

WASHINGTON ( Fortune ) -- A Congressional panel grilled five of the world 's richest and most powerful hedge fund managers Thursday as lawmakers sought to understand how much blame they could assign the little - understood hedge fund industry for the global economic collapse .
The managers testifying before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform included John Paulson , George Soros , Philip Falcone , James Simons and Kenneth Griffin , a group that made on average more than $ 1 billion in 2007 .
Committee Chairman Henry Waxman said his reasons for holding a hearing were twofold :
He wanted these men , " some of the most successful and knowledgeable investors in our financial markets , " to discuss how to nurse the financial system back to life .
And he wanted the committee to examine how hedge funds contributed to the current financial crisis , whether they pose a systemic risk to the financial system , and how best to regulate the industry , which is now subject to very little oversight .
Noting that we are in the worst financial crisis since the 1930s , George Soros told the committee : " The salient feature of the current financial crisis is that it was not caused by some external shock ...
The crisis was generated by the financial system itself . "
Soros ' prepared testimony read very much like an advertisement for his latest book , " The New Paradigm for Financial Markets ; " but on the point of how much blame hedge funds should shoulder , Soros was less explicit .
He noted that while funds may have helped inflate the bubble , " the bubble has now burst and hedge funds will be decimated . "
The hearing is the latest in a series held by Waxman to understand how different players contributed to the global financial collapse .
While ratings agencies , bankers and regulators like Alan Greenspan have been blamed by pundits and politicians , the hedge funds have become an increasingly popular villain as the story of the crisis has unfolded because of the mystery and tremendous wealth that are the hallmarks of the industry .
But hedge fund managers have suffered along with the markets , delivering their worst - ever returns this year .
The industry has shrunk from more than $ 2 trillion a year ago to about $ 1.7 trillion today .
Not only have managers lost money amid the credit and equity turbulence , investors have yanked funds out of the industry in order to hold more cash or to protect themselves from further losses .
Even though hedge fund losses have been severe , the industry as a whole is outperforming the broader market .
As Houman Shadab , a research fellow at George Mason University , noted in earlier testimony , the hedge fund industry as a whole is down about 15 % for the year , while the S&P is down more than 30 % .
While few questions were actually answered during the hearing , what was certain was that the industry will face more regulation .
Moreover , this push will occur amid an economic downturn that will hit Main Street hard and likely give lawmakers populist support to impose perhaps severe limitations on hedge fund activity or higher taxes .
Massachusetts Democrat John
Tierney noted that ever more average investors are exposed to hedge funds as pension funds pour money into the asset class .
These investment pools will suffer the same losses as the so - called sophisticated investors ( i.e. wealthy individuals and fund - of - fund managers ) that hedge funds have traditionally served .
Regulation , the committee agreed , will take into account this fact .
The Wall Street Journal reports , as was rumored on Friday , that AIG appears on the verge of approving a considerably enlarged and sweetened rescue package from the government .
We were less than happy with the idea when it first surfaced ( see our rant “ The Black Hole Gets Bigger : AIG Back for Yet Another Bailout “ ) .
Let us review the basics :
1. AIG came desperate to the US government for a rescue , and a whopper at that .
The Federal government has no oversight responsibility for AIG , which oh by the way , just happens to have very large overseas operations ( in other words , one could take the position that AIG ’s problems , for a whole host of reasons , are really not the Federal government ’s problem ) .
However , having seen the disruption that the collapse of Lehman caused , and knowing that AIG was a substantial and unhedged writer of credit default swaps , the powers that be were worried that a bankruptcy could be cataclysmic .
2 . The initial deal was punitive by design .
Some key elements of the Fed ’s loan : – An $ 85 billion , two year facility with interest at Libor + 850 basis points ( and note the 850 basis point was the commitment fee , payable on the whole amount ; the Libor addition kicked on on funds drawn down ) –
The loan was secured by all of AIG ’s assets and those of its primary non-regulated subsidiaries –
The government received 79.9 % of AIG and had a veto right on payment of common and preferred stock .
–
The loan was to be repaid by asset sales
Now this could and should have been treated as a nationalization in all but name .
The very top management was replaced ( and realistically , only limited housecleaning would be possible given the specialized nature of many of their businesses ) .
The only reason the government did not take 100 % of the equity was for the same reason they only took 79.9 % of Freddie and Fannie in their conservatorship : going above that level would force the Federal government to consolidate their balance sheets .
But instead , stunningly , the accounting fiction , that AIG is an independent operation with rights , as opposed to a ward of the state , is not only being dignified , it is being acted upon .
Look at the list of terms above .
The government has the right to seize absolutely everything of value AIG has until it pays off the loans , hold virtually all of the equity , and can veto many key actions ( the senior position with respect to the assets gives it more rights than those listed above ) .
Think of AIG as a felon : until it pays its debts to society , it has virtually no rights .
Well , that was the theory , but now the deal has been retraded twice .
The first time was done with as little notice as possible , but the dispersal of another $ 37.8 billion was rather hard to hide .
Per the Wall Street Journal story :
The U.S. government was near a deal Sunday night to scrap its original $ 123 billion bailout of American International Group Inc. and replace it with a new $ 150 billion package , according to people familiar with the matter .
While the proposed arrangement would considerably ease terms on the faltering insurer , it would give the government an unprecedented role as an actor in financial markets .
It could also spark a political backlash , especially from congressional Democrats , because the Treasury , while adding to its AIG obligations , has thus far refused to extend a hand to the struggling Big Three auto makers .
Before we get to the particulars , read the overview .
AIG is getting yet more money , now close to double the initial commitment , and the terms are being made more favorable .
And not by a little .
Note the Journal , hardly a critic of Big Business , used the term “ considerably ” .
As we discussed in our earlier post , there is only one legitimate reason for modifying the terms of AIG ’s loans : that the cash outflow for the interest might be so high that it is worsening the liquidity pressures on AIG .
Fine , Keep the interest payments the same , but allow a significant portion ( 50 % ? 65 %? ) to be deferred and added to principal .
A second issue mentioned in today ’s Wall Street Journal was that AIG is now concerned that they might not be able to repay the loan in two years .
Fine .
Extend the term another year .
Those are the ONLY changes warranted .
Remember , AIG does NOT has any God - given right to existence .
If every significant operation AIG has must be sold to repay the taxpayer , and AIG ceases to exist , that would be a perfectly fine outcome .
A systemic collapse would have been avoided , taxpayers would have gotten as much as possible out of a bad situation , and AIG would be liquidated in an orderly fashion .
What is wrong with that picture ?
Instead , AIG is being coddled for no reason whatsoever .
Back to the Journal :
Details of the revised deal could be announced as soon as Monday — when the company is expected to report third - quarter earnings — but remained in flux .
Under the terms being discussed late Sunday , the government would give AIG more money , including $ 40 billion from the U.S. Treasury ’s $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program .
It would also demand less interest than on the bulk of the original loan , while freeing AIG from exposure to some of the risky financial instruments that nearly caused it to file for bankruptcy protection .
The $ 150 billion in government aid consists of a $ 60 billion loan , a $ 40 billion preferred stock investment and $ 50 billion in capital largely to buy and backstop distressed assets in two special financing vehicles .
Well , actually there is a reason , and it stinks to high heaven .
Remember the original consternation about the TARP , when it was thought to be a vehicle for buying bad assets from banks .
The only way that arrangement made sense was if the Treasury paid inflated prices , which served two purposes .
First , it was a back door mechanism for recapitalizing banks .
Second , the inflated prices could be used by banks holding similar assets for valuation purposes .
When banks are reluctant to lend to each other because they are worried about the solvency risk of their counterparties , that means they already distrust their published financials .
But the Treasury department thinks that making their statements even more dubious by letting them uses phony valuations is a solution .
And lo and behold , the Treasury is going to buy crap assets at amazing prices :
Under the terms being finalized on Sunday night , the government would replace its original $ 85 billion loan with a two - year duration with a $ 60 billion loan with a five - year duration .
Interest on the loan would drop from 8.5 % plus three - month Libor interest - rate benchmark to 3 % plus Libor .
( Libor , the London interbank offered rate , is a common short - term benchmark . )
Yves here .
We are n’t to the dud asset part yet , but behold the nonsense .
AIG gets a 5 year term , up from two , and a massive gift in the form of a 5 % reduction in its rate of interest .
A complete gimmie .
Every mortgage borrower in America whose bank has gotten any money from the TARP should write their Congressman asking to know why they are n’t getting a their interest rate reduced by nearly half .
Ah , but I forget .
Your bankruptcy , sadly , does not pose a threat to the financial system .
Back to the Journal :
In addition , the government would tap the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program to inject $ 40 billion into AIG in return for preferred shares .
Those shares would carry 10 % annual interest payments .
The government ’s equity interest in AIG would remain at 79.9 % following the changes .
Yves here .
Um , shares do not carry interest payments .
They can have dividends paid at a fixed rate .
The terminology here is highly misleading and gives the impression that the preferred dividends have the same standing as interest payments , when they are subordinate .
Back to the article :
The government ’s initial intervention was driven by concern that AIG ’s failure to meet it obligations in the credit default swap market would create a global financial meltdown .
( A credit default swap , or CDS , is essentially an insurance policy on a bond acquired by investors to guard against default .
AIG wrote tens of billions of dollars worth of these contracts . )
Under the revised deal , AIG would transfer the troubled holdings into two separate entities that would be capitalized by the government .
The first such vehicle would be capitalized with $ 30 billion from the government and $ 5 billion from AIG .
That money would be used to acquire the underlying securities with a face value of $ 70 billion that AIG agreed to insure with the credit default swaps .
These securities , known as collateralized debt obligations , are thinly traded investments that include pools of loans .
The vehicle would seek to acquire the securities from their trading partners on the CDS contracts for about 50 cents on the dollar .
The securities in question do n’t account for all of AIG ’s credit default swap exposure but are connected to the most troubled assets .
Most of the trading partners AIG would seek to acquire the assets from are other financial institutions .
The government may be betting that federal involvement will encourage the trading partners to sell the assets to the AIG vehicle .
A price of 50 cents on the dollar for CDOs across all tranches , particularly when the objective is to buy the dreckiest dreck ( the ones where AIG ’s losses on its CDS guarantees would be greatest ) is simply breathtaking .
It ’s a wet dream for anyone who owns them .
Remember , this would be the price across ALL tranches .
Recall that in Merrill ’s not - all - that - long - ago sale of its super - senior CDOs ( the very best tranches ) it got a nominal price of 22 cents on the dollar , but that did not accurately represent the economics of the transaction .
The hedge fund Lone Star paid only 25 % of that amount ( or 5.5 cents ) in cash , the rest was contingent on performance .
So Merrill might have sold the CDOs for as little as 5.5 % .
Ah , I bet Lone Star is now scrambling to see if it won the lottery .
If its Merrill CDOs happened to be guaranteed by AIG ( and Sunday ’s story by Gretchen Morgenson said they were until AIG got leery of its exposures ) then Merrill ( and BofA ) have just gotten wildly lucky .
BofA will get the maximum it was entitled to , and Lone Star , having paid only 5.5 % of face in case , will get to recoup 50 % less the 16.5 % contingent payment it will have to make to BofA .
So it will get over six times the amount it put as risk in less than a year .
Back to the Journal :
Once it holds the securities , AIG could cancel the credit default swaps and take possession of the collateral it had posted back the contracts .
The total collateral at stake is about $ 30 billion .
It may also have some unintended consequences across the markets .
For the plan to work , AIG ’s trading partners — the banks and financial institutions that are on the other side of its credit - default - swap contracts — may have to agree to any changes in the terms of their agreements with AIG .
Such changes could cause those partners , which have pried billions of dollars worth of collateral from AIG over the past year , to return some or much of the collateral .
That could be a costly exercise for some financial institutions , because the cash they received from AIG has in recent months been a cheap source of funding for many banks .
The agreements may be difficult to work out .
Some financial institutions that face AIG in credit - default swaps do n’t actually hold the physical securities on which they purchased protection .
Merrill Lynch & Co. , for example , previously sold many mortgage CDOs it underwrote to European banks .
Through a complex set of transactions , Merrill took back the credit risk of some of those assets and hedged that risk by buying credit - default swaps from AIG .
When the securities fell in value , the European banks demanded collateral from Merrill which in turn demanded collateral from AIG .
Frankly , I regard this section as noise .
The real objective is to overpay for the CDOs and provide a huge subsidy to the current holders , who are presumed to be banks ( a lot of the really crappy late vintage CDOs were sold in Europe ) but per the Lone Star example , some of the fortunate beneficiaries may turn out to be hedge funds .
If AIG can unwind any of these CDOs , good luck .
My understanding is that this has only been done in cases of payment failure .
If the CDO is substantially held ( meaning each of the tranches as well as the whole ) by an entity friendly to AIG , then the game changes , but given the cost of unwinding a CDO , query whether that would be the best route to go .
This statement ( from the middle of the story ) sums up the sheer dishonesty of the entire exercise :
The revised structure is designed to improve both AIG ’s ability to sell assets for a decent price and the taxpayer ’s ability to recoup the money that has been pumped into the insurer .
It also transfers to the government many of the risks once absorbed by AIG , potentially exposing the government to billions of dollars in future losses .
The phrase “ designed to improve … .
the taxpayer ’s ability to recoup the money that has been pumped into the insurer ” is a complete and utter lie .
The authors ( Matthew Karnitsching , Liam Pleven and Serena Ng ) and whoever edited the piece should be ashamed of printing such a blatant falsehood .
The changes in terms , in every respect , make the deal worse for the taxpayer .
But for the Journal to perpetuate such pro-business rubbish is par for the course .
We said in our title that the AIG case constitutes looting .
We refer to notion as set forth by Nobel prize winner George Akerlof and Paul Romer in their 1994 paper , “ Looting : The Economic Underworld of Bankruptcy for Profit . ”
Its abstract :
During the 1980s , a number of unusual financial crises occurred .
In Chile , for example , the financial sector collapsed , leaving the government with responsibility for extensive foreign debts .
In the United States , large numbers of government - insured savings and loans became insolvent – and the government picked up the tab .
In Dallas , Texas , real estate prices and construction continued to boom even after vacancies had skyrocketed , and the suffered a dramatic collapse .
Also in the United States , the junk bond market , which fueled the takeover wave , had a similar boom and bust .
In this paper , we use simple theory and direct evidence to highlight a common thread that runs through these four episodes .
The theory suggests that this common thread may be relevant to other cases in which countries took on excessive foreign debt , governments had to bail out insolvent financial institutions , real estate prices increased dramatically and then fell , or new financial markets experienced a boom and bust .
We describe the evidence , however , only for the cases of financial crisis in Chile , the thrift crisis in the United States , Dallas real estate and thrifts , and junk bonds .
Our theoretical analysis shows that an economic underground can come to life if firms have an incentive to go broke for profit at society ’s expense ( to loot ) instead of to go for broke ( to gamble on success ) .
Bankruptcy for profit will occur if poor accounting , lax regulation , or low penalties for abuse give owners an incentive to pay themselves more than their firms are worth and then default on their debt obligations .
This is precisely what happened at AIG .
Executives there are handsomely paid , yet senior management cast a blind eye as one unit earned outsized profits while taking risks that would have driven AIG into bankruptcy were it not for the Fed ’s rescue .
Before you say , “ Well , it was just a few bad apples , ” the biggest single job of senior management in a financial institution ought to be to assure the health and survival of the entity , which means risk management and control is top of the list ( it was at Goldman when it was a private firm ) .
Anytime a unit starts reporting very large profits , managers should be all over it like a cheap suit to make sure the earnings are not the product of massive risktaking .
It only takes one aggressive trader plus inattentive management to bring down an entire firm , as Nick Leeson demonstrated with Barings .
But the worst is that not only was the initial AIG de facto bankruptcy a case of looting , the government has now decided to aid and abet AIG management in further looting .
What pro-taxpayer purpose is there in the improvement of terms above ?
None .
As we pointed out , there were only a couple of reasons for easing up on AIG , and they could have been provided for with minor changes that would not leave the taxpayer materially worse off .
Instead , major concessions have been made to AIG , all to the detriment of the taxpayer .
AIG management now has job security for five years ( and AIG top brass is very well paid ) and better odds of salvaging something for themselves when the five years are up thanks to the government giving them an unwarranted subsidy .
When the TARP was announced , we called it “ Mussolini - Style Corporatism in Action . ”
Sadly , it looks as if events are panning out as foretold .
Last summer , Mel Karmazin was rattling off his trademark one - liners to talk up the future of Sirius XM Radio , the combined company he ran that had just been blessed by regulators .
He was planning to cut costs and expand a business that was already a fixture in the lives of millions of Americans .
“ Forty - three cents a day — it ’s not even vending machine coffee , ” he said at the time , parrying a question about whether the softening economy might hurt subscriptions .
But now Sirius XM , the satellite radio company , has problems with much bigger price tags .
It has hired advisers to prepare for a possible bankruptcy filing , people involved in the process said .
That would , of course , be a grim turn of events for the normally upbeat Mr. Karmazin , Sirius XM ’s chief executive , who had hoped to create a mobile entertainment juggernaut with stars like Howard Stern .

So now we know what 's at the end of the rainbow - and it's not a pot of gold .
Instead it meets the northbound carriageway of the Highway 241 toll road in Orange County , California .
And according to witnesses it was travelling at just over 30 mph .
This amazing picture was snapped last Sunday , following a storm on the west coast of the US , by amateur photographer Jason Erdkamp 's iPhone .
According to myth there is a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow , perhaps hidden by leprechauns .
But Jason , from the Los Angeles suburb of Lake Forest , said : " There was no pot of gold , but I did win $ 25 that night on a lottery ticket . "
So , you need to know why dogs eat poop ?
Here are the reasons ...
In this article you ’ll find out why dogs eat poop .
This behavior , known medically as coprophagia , can be frustrating .
If you understand it , you ’ll have a better chance of fixing the problem .
Twenty reasons why dogs eat poop are provided to you .
Why Dogs Eat Poop : Definition of Coprophagia
Coprophagia is the ingestion of poop that is neither accidental nor incidental .
It is deliberate and habitual .
Other abnormal canine eating issues include pica ( eating of nonfood material ) , psychogenic water drinking ( consuming more water than necessary for regular daily use ) , anorexia ( starvation to the point of extreme , and deadly weight loss ) , and gorging ( serious , unhealthy overeating ) .
The focus here is on coprophagia and why dogs eat poop .
But , you ’ll see that dogs can have a variety of other eating problems .
Interestingly , you ’ll probably also notice that several of these eating problems are also found in humans , such as anorexia and gorging .
We ’re kind of like our canine friends sometimes , are n’t we .
Below there are 20 reasons listed why dogs eat poop .
In addition , at the end of this article you ’ll see a summarization of the reasons .
Hopefully you will understand exactly why dogs eat poop so that you can solve the problem or take some action to improve the situation .
Why Dogs Eat Poop : 20 Reasons
1 . Your dog might be hungry .
If your dog does n't have access to food , he might eat poop .
2 . Some dogs will eat poop to clean up an area like a housekeeper .
This is most likely if your dog is confined to a crate or kennel , or when he 's chained up or otherwise restricted .
He 's taking care of his space .
3 . If your dog likes to carry poop , and then eat it , it could be genetics .
Some dogs have instincts to carry stuff in their mouths .
4 . Your dog might be eating poop because of parasites or worms .
They can suck nutrients out of your dog , driving him to eat poop .
It might also leave him extra hungry because of the lack of proper fuel .
5 . Your dog might be eating cat poop or other animal poop to get key nutrients and minerals not available in his own food .
6 . Some dogs will simply eat poop to pass the time .
Dogs will eat poop because they are bored or lonely .
It can be a sign of neglect .
7 . Your dog might eat poop because he 's anxious , nervous or otherwise upset .
Stress will drive animals to do odd things .
8 . Some dogs will eat poop to hide the evidence .
If you punish your dog for pooping , he might eat it to stop you from getting angry .
9 . If your dog has puppies , she might eat puppy poop .
This is an instinct to hide the poop from predators .
Poop is evidence .
Getting ride of it keeps her puppies safe .
10 .
Some young dogs and puppies will eat poop as a novelty .
That is , they 'll eat poop as an experiment .
They do n't know better .
11 . If your dog watches you pick up poop , he might learn to do the same .
This is called allelomimetic behavior .
Your dog observes you and learns from you , by putting the poop in his mouth you put poop in a bag .
12 . Your dog might see others dogs eating poop .
From this , they learn to eat poop too .
13 .
Many dogs simply like the taste of poop .
This obviously does n't make sense to dog owners but that 's irrelevant .
Some dog like to eat it and that 's that .
It 's warm , moist , and very much like what your dog was given as a very young puppy .
14 .
If your dog food lacks key nutrients , he might eat poop .
Your dog is trying to get " food " with nutrients any way possible , even from his own poop .
15 . Sometimes dog poop seems like dog food .
This can happen when dog food is low quality and includes materials that are easily passed and not absorbed by your dog .
When the dog poops , it seems to be very much like the food he just consumed !
16 .
In some cases , dogs will eat poop if they are given too much food .
This is especially true if your dog 's diet is high in fat .
17 . Some dogs will eat poop to gain attention .
Many dog owners get very upset when their dog eats poop , which means the dog gets attention .
This is a wonderful opportunity for your dog to interact with you , although it is because of negative attention .
18 . It is possible that some dogs will eat the poop of other , more dominant dogs .
Your dog might be more submissive than other dogs , resulting in strange poop eating behavior .
This seems to occur more in households with multiple dogs where dominance and submission is a factor .
Obviously this does n't explain much about dogs eating cat poop or other animal poop .
19 .
It is possible that your dog wants to eat more than one time per day .
If you only feed your dog once per day , and your dog eats poop , it could be an indication they want to eat more frequently .
20 .
In some cases , your dog will eat poop by accident .
Dogs are curious and will try to eat almost anything , including poop .
Dogs explore the world through taste and smell , much more than humans .
Summarization : Why Dogs Eat Poop
So , now you have seen 20 reasons why dogs eat poop .
It could be a signal for higher quality food , more food , less food , or more frequent meals .
It could be related to your dog ’s desire for more attention and interaction .
Your dog might be eating poop out of instinct whereas in other cases it might a learned behavior from you or by watching other dogs .

So , on one winter evening in late 2002 , five executives from the telecommunications group met for dinner at a traditional Bavarian restaurant in a Munich suburb .
Surrounded by dark wood panels and posters celebrating German engineering , the group discussed how to better disguise its payments , while making sure that employees did n’t pocket the money , Mr. Siekaczek said .
To handle the business side of bribery , the executives turned to Mr. Siekaczek , a man renowned within the company for his personal honesty , his deep company loyalty  and his experiences in the shadowy world of illegal bribery .
“ It had nothing to do with being law - abiding , because we all knew what we did was unlawful . ”
Mr. Siekaczek said .
“ What mattered here was that the person put in charge was stable and would n’t go astray . ”
Although Mr. Siekaczek was reluctant to take the job offered that night , he justified it as economic necessity .
If Siemens did n’t pay bribes , it would lose contracts and its employees might lose their jobs .
“ We thought we had to do it , ” Mr. Siekaczek said .
“ Otherwise , we ’d ruin the company . ”
Indeed , he considers his personal probity a point of honor .
He describes himself as “ the man in the middle , ” “ the banker ” or , with tongue in cheek , “ the master of disaster . ”
But , he said , he never set up a bribe .
Nor did he directly hand over money to a corrupt official .
German prosecutors say they have no evidence that he personally enriched himself , though German documents show that Mr. Siekaczek oversaw the transfer of some $ 65 million through hard - to - trace offshore bank accounts .
“ I was not the man responsible for bribery , ” he said .
“ I organized the cash . ”
Mr. Siekaczek set things in motion by moving money out of accounts in Austria to Liechtenstein and Switzerland , where bank secrecy laws provided greater cover and anonymity .
He said he also reached out to a trustee in Switzerland who set up front companies to conceal money trails from Siemens to offshore bank accounts in Dubai and the British Virgin Islands .
One hair care brand reported sales of blonde products up by two - thirds compared to a year ago .
Hairdresser Andrew Barton , creator of the Shiny Happy Hair range , is certain the trend is linked to the country ’s economic woes .
He said : “ With only 10 per cent of UK women having naturally blonde hair , choosing to be blonde must be more than about how you look .
“ I do n’t believe it is purely a coincidence that there ’s been a huge sales rise in blonde hair products during these tough financial times . ”
Blonde hair is seen as a symbol of youth because women ’s hair tends to get darker as they age .
Mr Barton said : “ Many of my ­female clients say they feel more confident , more youthful and more attractive when they go blonde and they get more attention . ”
Constitutional Convention & Conference of States
The 14th Amendment Is Unconstitutional
- Judge L.H. Perez
It is difficult to emphasize strongly enough , the importance of this memorandum written by Judge Perez .
History is always written by the ' victor ' .
In this case — again — the victor was the small group of powerful U.S. and International financiers who have orchestrated every war in which Americans have fought and died , and who have installed their minions in all levels of both federal and state government today ... executive , legislative , judicial , bureaucratic .
Because this group also controls the media and the educational system in America , they have successfully promulgated their version of the War of Northern Aggression which they labeled the ' Civil War ' .
Just within this past year ( 2000 ) , as we broached the subject of the controlled opposition to the southern flag on the Sweet Liberty broadcast , several informed guests revealed the lies surrounding and concealing the real facts about that bloody war in which hundreds of thousands of Americans were slaughtered ( brother killing brother — Christians killing Christians ) ; whole southern states and millions of lives were destroyed ; and out of the chaos ... the blood , mud , fire and ashes ( " utter destruction " ) came the 14th Amendment which effectively dismantled the Constitution .
Except ... it is not valid .
We learned that the 14th Amendment was : 1 ) fraudulently , unlawfully , illegally proposed by the U.S. Congress rendering it null and void at the outset ; 2 ) ratified in the Southern states by ' rump legislatures ' , literally by military force at bayonet point — threat , duress and coercion — rendering it null and void in the second instance ; 3 ) had nothing to do with giving freed slaves citizenship status and instead created a new status of citizenship for all Americans ( U.S. citizens rather than Citizens of our respective states ) which in effect enslaved us all ; 4 ) dissolved and replaced constitutional law with the ' Laws of Commerce and Admiralty ' ... and 5 ) in a very real sense became a new constitution within the constitution .
We 've been advised by several legal researchers ( NOT lawyers ) that if the autonomous states declared it 's invalidity ( the 14th Amendment ) the entire out - of - thin - air economic stranglehold on this nation , along with the current system of Talmudic law would collapse .
No need for an amendment to repeal the 14th because it is not a lawful part of the Constitution .
In fact , if the missing lawfully ratified 13th Amendment was re-inserted , the one could replace the other .
To fully protect the rights of descendants of slaves , each state could declare equal rights of all legal Citizens .
Too simple ?
Too logical ?
Have we , too , become addicted to the voluminous laws so crafted by the lawyers that not even elected officials understand them ?
Are state legislators so brain - washed and controlled by the political hierarchy they would n't even understand this concept ?
Read the detailed report by Judge Perez and decide for yourself ... could this be undone if enough of us worked together with state legislators ?

THE 14TH AMENDMENT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
- Judge L.H. Perez
T he purported 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution is and should be held to be ineffective , invalid , null , void , and unconstitutional for the following reasons :
1. The Joint Resolution proposing said Amendment was not submitted to or adopted by a Constitutional Congress .
Article I , Section 3 , and Article V of the U.S. Constitution .
2. The Joint Resolution was not submitted to the President for his approval .
Article I , Section 7 .
3 . The proposed 14th Amendment was rejected by more than one - fourth of all the States then in the Union , and it was never ratified by three - fourths of all the States in the Union .
I. The Unconstitutional Congress
The United States Constitution provides :
Article 1 , Section 3 . " The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State ***"
Article V provides : " No State , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate . "
The fact that twenty - three ( 23 ) Senators had been unlawfully excluded from the U.S. Senate , in order to secure a two - thirds vote for adoption of the Joint Resolution proposing the 14th Amendment is shown by Resolutions of protest adopted by the following state legislatures :
The New Jersey Legislature by Resolution of March 27 , 1868 , protested as follows :
The said proposed amendment not having yet received the assent of the three - fourths of the states , which is necessary to make it valid , the natural and constitutional right of this state to withdraw its assent is undeniable ***.
That it being necessary by the constitution that every amendment to the same should be proposed by two - thirds of both houses of congress , the authors of said proposition , for the purpose of securing the assent of the requisite majority , determined to , and did , exclude from the said two houses eighty representatives from eleven states of the Union , upon the pretense that there were no such states in the Union ; but , finding that two - thirds of the remainder of the said houses could not be brought to assent to the said proposition , they deliberately formed and carried out the design of mutilating the integrity of the United States Senate , and without any pretext or justification , other than the possession of the power , without the right , and in palpable violation of the Constitution , ejected a member of their own body , representing this state , and thus practically denied to New Jersey its equal suffrage in the Senate , and thereby nominally secured the vote of two - thirds of the said houses .
( New Jersey Acts , March 27 , 1868 )
The Alabama Legislature protested against being deprived of representation in the Senate of the U.S. Congress .
( Alabama House Journal , 1866 , pp. 210-213 )
The Texas Legislature by Resolution on October 15 , 1866 , protested as follows :
The amendment to the Constitution proposed by this joint resolution as Article XIV is presented to the Legislature of Texas for its action thereon , under Article V of that Constitution .
This Article V , providing the mode of making amendments to that instrument , contemplates the participation by all the States through their representatives in Congress , in proposing amendments .
As representatives in Congress from nearly one - third of the States were excluded from the Congress proposing the amendments , the constitutional requirement was not complied with ; it was violated in letter and in spirit ; and the proposing of these amendments to States which were excluded from all participation in their initiation in Congress , is a nullity .
( Texas House Journal , 1866 , p. 577 . )
The Arkansas Legislature , by Resolution on December 17 , 1866 , protested as follows :
The Constitution authorized two - thirds of both houses of Congress to propose amendments ; and , as eleven States were excluded from deliberation and decision upon the one now submitted , the conclusion is inevitable that it is not proposed by legal authority , but in palpable violation of the Constitution .
( Arkansas House Journal , 1866 , p. 287 . )
The Georgia Legislature , by Resolution on November 1866 , protested as follows :
Since the reorganization of the State government , Georgia has elected Senators and Representatives .
So has every other State .
They have been arbitrarily refused admission to their seats , not on the ground that the qualifications of the members elected did not conform to the fourth paragraph , second section , first article of the Constitution , but because their right of representation was denied by a portion of the States having equal but not greater rights than themselves .
They have in fact been forcibly excluded ; and , inasmuch as all legislative power granted by the States to Congress is defined , and this power of exclusion is not among the powers expressly or by implication , the assemblage , at the capitol , of representatives from a portion of the States , to the exclusion of the representatives of another portion , cannot be a constitutional Congress , when the representation of each State forms an integral part of the whole .
This amendment is tendered to Georgia for ratification , under that power in the Constitution which authorizes two - thirds of the Congress to propose amendments .
We have endeavored to establish that Georgia had a right , in the first place , as part of the Congress to act upon the question , " Shall these amendments be proposed ? "
Every other excluded State had the same right .
The first constitutional privilege has been arbitrarily denied .
Had these amendments been submitted to a constitutional Congress , they never would have been proposed to the States .
Two - thirds of the whole Congress never would have proposed to eleven States voluntarily to reduce their political power in the Union , and at the same time , disfranchise the larger portion of the intellect , integrity and patriotism of the eleven co-equal States .
( Georgia House Journal , November 9 , 1866 , pp. 66 - 67 )
The Florida Legislature , by Resolution of December 5 , 1866 , protested as follows :
Let this alteration be made in the organic system and some new and more startling demands may or may not be required by the predominant party previous to allowing the ten States now unlawfully and unconstitutionally deprived of their right of representation to enter the Halls of the National Legislature .
Their right of representation is guaranteed by the Constitution of this country and there is no act , not even that of rebellion , can deprive them of its exercise .
( Florida House Journal , 1866 )
The South Carolina Legislature by Resolution of November 27 , 1866 protested as follows :
Eleven of the Southern States , including South Carolina , are deprived of their representation in Congress .
Although their Senators and Representatives have been duly elected and have presented themselves for the purpose of taking their seats , their credentials have , in most instances , been laid upon the table without being read , or have been referred to a committee , who have failed to make any report on the subject .
In short , Congress has refused to exercise its Constitutional functions , and decide either upon the election , the return , or the qualification of these selected by States and people to represent us .
Some of the Senators and Representatives from the Southern States were prepared to take the test oath , but even these have been persistently ignored , and kept out of the seats to which they were entitled under the Constitution and laws .
Hence this amendment has not been proposed by " two - thirds of both Houses " of a legally constituted Congress , and is not , Constitutionally or legitimately , before a single Legislature for ratification .
( South Carolina House Journal , 1866 , pp. 33 and 34 )
The North Carolina Legislature protested by Resolution of December 6 , 1866 as follows :
The Federal Constitution declares in substance , that Congress shall consist of a House of Representatives , composed of members apportioned among the respective States in the ratio of their population , and of a Senate , composed of two members from each State .
And in the Article which concerns Amendments , it is expressly provided that ' no State , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate . '
The contemplated Amendment was not proposed to the States by a Congress thus constituted .
At the time of its adoption , the eleven seceding States were deprived of representation , both in the Senate and House , although they all , except the State of Texas , had Senators and Representatives duly elected and claiming their privileges under the Constitution .
In consequence of this , these States had no voice on the important question of proposing the Amendment .
Had they been allowed to give their votes , the proposition would doubtless have failed to command the required two - thirds majority .
If the votes of these States are necessary to a valid ratification of the Amendment , they were equally necessary on the question of proposing it to the States ; for it would be difficult , in the opinion of the Committee , to show by what process in logic , men of intelligence could arrive at a different conclusion .
( North Carolina Senate Journal , 1866 - 67 , pp. 92 and 93 . )
1I . Joint Resolution Ineffective
Article I , Section 7 provides that not only every bill which shall have been passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States Congress , but that :
Every order , resolution , or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him shall be repassed by two - thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill .
The Joint Resolution proposing the 14th Amendment , ( 14 Statutes at Large , p. 358 etc. ) was never presented to the President of the United States for his approval , as President Andrew Johnson stated in his message on June 22 , 1866 .
( Senate Journal , 39th Congress , lst session .
p , 563 , and House Journal , p. 889 )
III .
Proposed Amendment Never Ratified by Three - Fourths of the States
1. Pretermitting the ineffectiveness of said resolution , as above , fifteen ( 15 ) States out of then thirty - seven ( 37 ) States of the Union rejected the proposed 14th Amendment between the date of its submission to the States by the Secretary of State on June 16 , 1866 and March 24 , 1868 , thereby further nullifying said resolution and making it impossible for its ratification by the constitutionally required three - fourths of such States , as shown by the rejections thereof by the Legislatures of the following states :
Texas rejected the 14th Amendment on October 27 , 1866 .
( House Journal 1866 , pp. 578-584 ; Senate Journal 1866 , p. 471 )
Georgia rejected the 14th Amendment on November 9 , 1866 .
( House Journal 1866 , p. 68 ; Senate Journal 1866 , p. 72 . )
Florida rejected the 14th Amendment on December 6 , 1866 .
( House Journal 1866 , p. 76 ; Senate Journal 1866 , p. 8 )
Alabama rejected the 14th Amendment on December 7 , 1866 .
( House Journal 1866 , pp. 210-213 ; Senate Journal 1866 , p. 183 )
North Carolina rejected the 14th Amendment on December 14 , 1866 .
( House Journal 1866 - 1867 , p. 183 ; Senate Journal 1866 -1867 , p. 138 )
Arkansas rejected the 14th Amendment on December 17 , 1866 .
( House Journal 1866 , pp. 288-291 ; Senate Journal 1866 , p. 262
South Carolina rejected the 14th Amendment on December 20 , 1866 .
( McPherson , Reconstruction , p. 194 ; Annual Encyclopedia , p. 452 )
Kentucky rejected the 14th Amendment on January 8 , 1867 .
( House Journal 1867 , p. 60 ; Senate Journal 1867 , p. 62 )
Virginia rejected the 14th Amendment on January 9 , 1867 .
( House Journal 1866 - 1867 , p. 108 ; Senate Journal 1866 -1867 , p. 101 )
Louisiana rejected the 14th Amendment on February 6 , 1867 .
( McPherson , Reconstruction , p. 194 ; Annual Encyclopedia , p. 452 )
Delaware rejected the 14th Amendment on February 7 , 1867 ( House Journal 1867 , p. 223 ; Senate Journal 1867 , p. 176 )
Maryland rejected the 14th Amendment on March 23 , 1867 ( House Journal 1867 , p. 1141 ; Senate Journal 1867 , p. 808 )
Mississippi rejected the 14th Amendment on January 31 , 1867 .
( McPherson , Reconstruction , p. 194 )
Ohio rejected the 14th Amendment on January 15 , 1868 ( House Journal 1868 , pp. 44-50 ; Senate Journal 1868 , pp. 33-38 . )
New Jersey rejected the 14th Amendment on March 24 , 1868 .
( Minutes of the Assembly 1868 , p. 743 ; Senate Journal 1868 , p. 356 )
There was no question that all of the Southern states which rejected the 14th Amendment had legally constituted governments , were fully recognized by the federal government , and were functioning as member states of the Union at the time of their rejection .
President Andrew Johnson , in his Veto message of March 2 , 1867 , ( House Journal , 39th Congress , 2nd Sessn. , p. 563 etc. ) pointed out :
It is not denied that the States in question have each of them an actual government with all the power , executive , judicial , and legislative , which properly belong to a free State .
They are organized like the other States of the Union , and , like them , they make , administer , and execute the laws which concern their domestic affairs .
If further proof were needed that these States were operating under legally constituted governments as member States of the Union , the ratification of the 13th Amendment by December 8 , 1865 undoubtedly supplies this official prool
If the Southern States were not member States of the Union , the 13th Amendment would not have been submitted to their Legislatures for ratification .
2. The 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution was proposed by Joint Resolution of Congress , ( 13 Statutes at Large , p. 567 ) and was approved February 1 , 1865 by President Abraham Lincoln , as required by Article I , Section 7 of the United States Constitution .
the President 's signature is affixed to the Resolution .
The 13th Amendment was ratified by 27 states of he then thirty - six ( 36 ) states of the Union , including he Southern States of Virginia , Louisiana , Arkansas , South Carolina , Alabama , North Carolina , and Georgia .
This is shown by the Proclamation of the Secretary of State December 18 , 1865 .
( 13 Statutes at Large , p. 774 . )
Without the votes of these seven ( 7 ) Southern State Legislatures the 13th Amendment would have failed .
There can be no doubt but that the ratification by these seven ( 7 ) Southern States of the 13th Amendment again established the fact that their Legislatures and State governments were duly and lawfully constituted and functioning as such under their States Constitutions .
3. Furthermore , on April 2 , 1866 , President Andrew Johnson issued a proclamation that , " the insurrection which heretofore existed in the States of Georgia , South Carolina , Virginia , North Carolina , Tennessee , Alabama , Louisiana , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Florida is at an end , and is henceforth to be so regarded . "
( Presidential Proclamation No. 153 , General Records of the United States , G.S.A. National Archives and Records Service . )
On August 20 , 1866 , President Andrew Johnson issued another proclamation ( 14 Statutes at Large , p. 814 ) pointing out the fact that the House of Representatives and Senate had adopted identical Resolutions on July 22nd ( House Journal , 37th Congress , lst Sessn. , 123 etc. ) and July 25th , 1861 , ( Senate Journal , 37th Congress , lst Sessn. , p. 91 etc. ) that the Civil War forced by disunionists of the Southern States , was not waged for the purpose of conquest or to overthrow the rights and established institutions of those States , but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and to preserve the Union with all equality and rights of the several states unimpaired , and that as soon as these objects are accomplished , the war ought to cease .
The President 's proclamation on June 13 , 1865 , declared the insurrection in the State of Tennessee had been suppressed .
( 13 Statutes at Large , p. 763 . )
The President 's proclamation on April 2 , 1866 , ( 14 Statutes at Large , p. 811 ) declared the insurrection in the other Southern States , except Texas , no longer existed .
On August 20 1866 , ( 14 Statutes at Large , p. 814 ) the President proclaimed that the insurrection in the State of Texas had been completely ended , and his proclamation continued :
the insurrection which heretofore existed in the State of Texas is at an end , and is to be henceforth so regarded in that State , as in the other States before named in which the said insurrection was proclaimed to be at an end by the aforesaid proclamation of the second day of April , one - thousand , eight - hundred and sixty - six .
And I do further proclaim that the said insurrection is at an end , and that peace , order , tranquility , and civil authority now exist , in and throughout the whole United States of America .
4 . When the State of Louisiana rejected the 14th Amendment on February 6 , 1867 , [ making the 10th State to have rejected the same , or more than one - fourth of the total number of 36 States of the Union ( as of that date ) , and leaving less than three - fourths of the States to possibly ratify the same ] the Amendment failed of ratification in fact and in law .
It could not have been revived except by a new Joint Resolution of the Senate and House of Representatives in accordance with Constitutional requirement .
5 . Faced with the positive failure of ratification of the 14th Amendment , both Houses of Congress passed over the veto of the President three Acts known as Reconstruction Acts , between the dates of March 2 and July 19 , 1867 , especially the third of said Acts , 15 Stat. p. 14 etc. , designed illegally to remove with " Military force " the lawfully constituted State Legislatures of the ten ( 10 ) Southern States of Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , Georgia , Florida , Alabama , Mississippi , Arkansas , Louisiana , and Texas .
In President Andrew Johnson 's Veto message on the Reconstruction Act of March 2 , 1867 , ( House Journal , 39th Congress , 2nd Sessn. p. 563 etc. ) he pointed out these unconstitutionalities :
If ever the American citizen should be left to the free exercise of his own judgment , it is when he is engaged in the work of forming the fundamental law under which he is to live .
That work is his work , and it cannot properly be taken out of his hands .
All this legislation proceeds upon the contrary Assumption that the people of each of these States shall have no constitution , except such as may be arbitrarily dictated by Congress , and formed under the restraint of military rule .
A plain statement of facts makes this evident .
In all these States there are existing constitutions , framed in the accustomed way by the people .
Congress , however , declares that these constitutions are not " loyal and republican , " and requires the people to form them anew .
What , then , in the opinion of Congress , is necessary to make the constitution of a State " loyal and republican ? "
The original act answers the question :
It is universal negro suffrage , a question which the federal Constitution leaves exclusively to the States themselves .
All this legislative machinery of martial law , military coercion , and political disenfranchisement is avowedly for that purpose and none other .
The existing constitutions of the ten States conform to the acknowledged standards of loyalty and republicanism .
Indeed , if there are degrees in republican forms of government , their constitutions are more republican now , than when these States — four of which were members of the original thirteen — first became members of the Union .
In President Andrew Johnson 's Veto message on the Reconstruction Act on July 19 , 1867 , ( 40th Congress , lst Sessn. , House Journal p. 232 etc. ) he pointed out various unconstitutionalities as follows :
The veto of the original bill of the 2d of March was based on two distinct grounds , the interference of Congress in matters strictly pertaining to the reserved powers of the States , and the establishment of military tribunals for the trial of citizens in time of peace .
A singular contradiction is apparent here .
Congress declares these local State governments to be illegal governments , and then provides that these illegal governments shall be carried on by federal officers , who are to perform the very duties of its own officers by this illegal State authority .
It certainly would be a novel spectacle if Congress should attempt to carry on a legal State government by the agency of its own officers .
It is yet more strange that Congress attempts to sustain and carry on an illegal State government by the same federal agency .
****
It is now too late to say that these ten political communities are not States of this Union .
Declarations to the contrary made in these three acts are contradicted again and again by repeated acts of legislation enacted by Congress from the year 1861 to the year 1867 .
During that period , while these States were in actual rebellion , and after that rebellion was brought to a close , they have been again and again recognized as States of the Union .
Representation has been apportioned to them as States .
They have been divided into judicial districts for the holding of district and circuit courts of the United States , as States of the Union only can be distracted .
The last act on this subject was passed July 23 , 1866 , by which every one of these ten States was arranged into districts and circuits .
They have been called upon by Congress to act through their legislatures upon at least two amendments to the Constitution of the United States .
As States they have ratified one amendment , which required the vote of twenty - seven States of the thirty - six then composing the Union .
When the requisite twenty - seven votes were given in favor of that amendment — seven of which votes were given by seven of these ten States — it was proclaimed to be a part of the Constitution of the United States , and slavery was declared no longer to exist within the United States or any place subject to its jurisdiction .
If these seven States were not legal States of the Union , it follows as an inevitable consequence that in some of the States slavery yet exists .
It does not exist in these seven States , for they have abolished it also in their State Constitutions ; but Kentucky not having done so , it would still remain in that State .
But , in truth , if this assumption that these States have no legal State governments be true , then the abolition of slavery by these illegal governments binds no one , for Congress now denies to these States the power to abolish slavery by denying to them the power to elect a legal State legislature , or to frame a constitution for any purpose , even for such a purpose as the abolition of slavery .
As to the other constitutional amendment having reference to suffrage , it happens that these States have not accepted it .
The consequence is , that it has never been proclaimed or understood , even by Congress , to be a part of the Constitution of the United States .
The Senate of the United States has repeatedly given its sanction to the appointment of judges , district attorneys , and marshals for every one of these States ; yet , if they are not legal States , not one of these judges is authorized to hold a court .
So , too , both houses of Congress have passed appropriation bills to pay all these judges , attorneys , and officers of the United States for exercising their functions in these States .
Again , in the machinery of the internal revenue laws , all these States are distracted , not " territories " but as " States . "
So much for continuous legislative recognition .
The instances cited , however , fall far short of all that might be enumerated .
Executive recognition , as is well known , has been frequent and unwavering .
The same may be said as to judicial recognition through the Supreme Court of the United States .
****
To me these considerations are conclusive of the unconstitutionality of this part of the bill before me , and I earnestly commend their consideration to the deliberate judgement of Congress .
( And now to the Court . )
Within a period of less than a year the legislation of Congress has attempted to strip the executive department of the government of some of its essential powers .
The Constitution , and the authority provided in it , devolve upon the President the power and duty to see that the laws are faithfully executed .
The Constitution , in order to carry out this power gives him the choice of the agents , and makes them subject to his control and supervision .
But in the execution of these laws the constitutional obligation upon the President remains , but the powers to exercise that constitutional duty is effectually taken away .
The military commander is , as to the power of appointment , made to take the place of its President , and the General of the Army , the place of the Senate ; and any attempt on the part of the President to assert his own constitutional power may under pretense of law , be met by official insubordination .
It is to be feared that these military officers , looking to the authority given by these laws rather than to the letter of the Constitution , will recognize no authority but the commander of the district and the General of the army .
If there were no other objection than this to this proposed legislation , it would be sufficient .
No one can contend that the Reconstruction Acts were ever upheld as being valid and constitutional
They were brought into question , but the Courts either avoided decision or were prevented by Congress from finally adjudication upon their constitutionality .
In Mississippi v. President Andrew Johnson , ( 4 Wall. 475-502 ) , where the suit sought to enjoin
the President of the United States from enforcing provisions of the Reconstruction Acts , the U.S. Supreme Court held that the President cannot be enjoined because for the Judicial Department of the government to attempt to enforced the performance of the duties by the President might be justly characterized , in the language of Chief Justice Marshall , as " an absurd and excessive extravagance . "
The Court further said that if the Court granted the injunction against enforcement of the Reconstruction Acts , and if the President refused obedience , it is needless to observe that the Court is without power to enforce its process .
In a joint action , the states of Georgia and Mississippi brought suit against the President and the Secretary of War , ( 6 Wall. 50 78 , 154 U.S. 554 ) .
The Court said that :
The bill then sets forth that the intent and design of the Acts of Congress , as apparent on their face and by their terms , are to overthrow and annul this existing state government , and to erect another and different government in its place , unauthorized by the Constitution and in defiance of its guaranties ; and that in furtherance of this intent and design , the defendants , the Secretary of War , the General of the Army , and Major - General Pope , acting under orders of the President , are about setting in motion a portion of the army to take military possession of the state , and threaten to subvert her government and subject her people to military rule ; that the state is holding inadequate means to resist the power and force of the Executive Department of the United States ; and she therefore insists that such protection can , and ought to be afforded by a decree or order of his court in the premises .
The application for injunction by these two states to prohibit the Executive Department from carrying out the provisions of the Reconstruction Acts directed to the overthrow of their government , including the dissolution of their state legislatures , were denied on the grounds that the organization of the government into three great departments , the executive , legislative and Judicial , carried limitations of the powers of each by the Constitution .
This case went the same way as the previous case of Mississippi against President Johnson and was dismissed without adjudicating upon the constitutionality of the Reconstruction Acts .
In another case , Ex parte William H. McCardle ( 7 Wall. 506-515 ) , a petition for the writ of habeas corpus for unlawful restraint by military force of a citizen not in the military service of the United States was before the United States Supreme Court .
After the case was argued and taken under advisement , and before conference in regard to the decision to be made , Congress passed an emergency act , ( Act of March 27 , 1868 , 15 Stat. at L. 44 ) , vetoed by the President and repassed over his veto , repealing the jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court in such cases .
Accordingly , the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal without passing upon the constitutionality of the reconstruction Acts , under which the non-military citizen was held by the military without benefit of writ of habeas corpus , in violation of Section 9 , Article I , of the U.S. Constitution which prohibits the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus .
That Act of Congress placed the Reconstruction Acts beyond judicial recourse and avoided tests of constitutionality .
It is recorded that one of the Supreme Court Justices , Grier , protested against the action of the Court as follows :
This case was fully argued in the beginning of this month .
It is a case which involves the liberty and rights , not only of the appellant but millions of our fellow citizens .
The country and the parties had a right to expect that it would receive the immediate and solemn attention of the court .
By the postponement of this case we shall subject ourselves , whether justly or unjustly , to the imputation that we have evaded the performance of a duty imposed on us by the Constitution , and waited for Legislative interposition to supersede our action , and relieve us from responsibility .
I am not willing to be a partaker of the eulogy or opprobrium that may follow .
I can only say ...
I am ashamed that such opprobrium should be cast upon the court and that it can not be refuted .
The ten States were organized into Military Districts under the unconstitutional " Reconstruction Acts , " their lawfully constituted Legislatures illegally were removed by " military force , " and they were replaced by rump , o- call Legislatures , seven of which carried out military orders and pretended to ratify the 14th Amendment , as follows :
Arkansas on April 6 , 1868 ( McPherson , Reconstruction , p. 53 ) .
North Carolina on July 2 , 1868 ( House Journal 1868 , 15 ; Senate Journal 1868 , p. 15 ) .
Florida on June 9 , 1868 ( House Journal 1868 , p. 9 ; Senate Journal 1868 , p. 8 ) .
Louisiana on July 9 , 1868 ( Senate Journal 1868 , p. 1 ) .
South Carolina on July 9 , 1868 ( House Journal 1868 , 50 ; Senate Journal 1868 , p. 12 ) .
Alabama on July 13 , 1868 ( Senate Journal , 40th Congress , 2nd Sessn. p. 725 ) .
Georgia on July 21 , 1868 ( House Journal 1868 , p. 50 ) .
6 . Of the above seven ( 7 ) States whose Legislatures re removed and replaced by rump , so - call Legislatures , six ( 6 ) Legislatures of the States of Louisiana , Arkansas , South Carolina , Alabama , North Carolina , and Georgia had ratified the 13th Amendment , as shown the Secretary of State 's Proclamation of December 8 , 1865 .
Without the six ( 6 ) States ' Ratifications , the 13th Amendment could not and would not have been ratified because said six ( 6 ) States made a total twenty - seven ( 27 ) out of thirty - six ( 36 ) States or exactly three - fourths of the states as required by Article V the U.S. Constitution for ratification .
Furthermore , governments of the States of Louisiana and Arkansas had been re-established under a Proclamation issued by President Abraham Lincoln on December 8 , 1863 .
( Vol . I , pp. 288-306 ; Vol. II , pp. 1429 -1448 —
" The Federal and State Constitutions , " etc. , compiled under Act of Congress on June 30 , 1906 , Francis Newton Thorpe , Washington Government Printing Office , 906 . )
The government of Georgia had been re-established under a Proclamation issued by President Andrew Johnson dated June 17 , 1865 .
( Same , Thorpe , Vol. II , pp. 809-822 . )
The government of Alabama had been re-established under a Proclamation issued by President Andrew Johnson dated June 30 , 1865 .
( Same , Thorpe , Vol. VI , pp. 3269-3281 . )
The government of South Carolina had been re-established under a Proclamation issued by President Andrew Johnson dated June 30 , 1865 .
( Same , Thorpe , 1 . VI , pp. 3269-3281 . )
These three " Reconstruction Acts " ( 14 Statutes at Large , p. 428 , etc. ; 15 Statues at Large , p. 14 , etc. ) under which the above State Legislatures were illegally removed and unlawful rump or puppet so - called Legislatures were substituted in a mock effort to ratify the 14th Amendment , were unconstitutional , null and void , ab initio , and all acts done thereunder were also null and void , including the purported ratification of the 14th Amendment by said six ( 6 ) Southern puppet State Legislatures of Arkansas , North Carolina , Louisiana , South Carolina , Alabama , and Georgia .
Those Reconstruction Acts of Congress and all acts and things unlawfully done thereunder were in violation of Article IV , Section 4 of the United States Constitution , which required the United States to guarantee every State in the Union a republican form of government .
They violated Article I , Section 3 , and Article V of the Constitution , which entitled every State in the Union to two Senators , because under provisions of these unlawful Acts of Congress , ten ( 10 ) States were deprived of having two Senators , or equal suffrage in the Senate .
7 . The Secretary of State expressed doubt as to whether three - fourths of the required states had ratified the 14th Amendment , shown by his Proclamation of July 20 , 1868 ( 15 Statutes at Large , p. 706 ) .
Promptly on July 21 , 1868 a Joint Resolution ( House Journal , 40th Congress , 2nd Sessn. p. 1126 etc. ) was adopted by the Senate and House of Representatives declaring that three - fourths of the several States of the Union had ratified the 14th Amendment .
That resolution , however , included purported ratifications by the unlawful puppet Legislatures of five ( 5 ) States , Arkansas , North Carolina , Louisiana , South Carolina , and Alabama , which had previously rejected the 14th Amendment by action of their lawfully constituted Legislatures , as above shown .
This Joint Resolution assumed to perform the function of the Secretary of State in whom Congress , by Act of April 20 , 1818 , had vested the function of issuing such proclamation declaring the ratification of Constitutional Amendments .
The Secretary of State bowed to the action of Congress and issued his Proclamation of July 28 , 1868 , ( 15 Statutes at Large , p. 708 ) in which he stated that he was acting under authority of the Act of April 20 , 1818 , but pursuant to said Resolution of July 21 , 1868 .
He listed three - fourths or so of the then thirty - seven ( 37 ) states as having ratified the 14th Amendment , including the purported ratification of the unlawful puppet Legislatures of the States of Arkansas , North Carolina , Louisiana , South Carolina , and Alabama .
Without said five ( 5 ) unlawful purported ratifications there would have been only 25 states left to ratify out of 37 when a minimum of 28 states was required for ratification by three - fourths of the States of the Union .
The Joint resolution of Congress and the resulting Proclamation of the Secretary of State also included purported ratifications by the States of Ohio and New Jersey although the Proclamation recognized the fact that the Legislatures of said states , several months previously , had withdrawn their ratifications and effectively rejected the 14th Amendment in January , 1868 , and April , 1868 .
Therefore , deducting these two states from the purported ratifications of the 14th Amendment , only 23 State ratifications at most could be claimed ; whereas the ratification of 28 States , or three - fourths of 37 States in the Union , were required to ratify the 14th Amendment .
From all of the above documented historic facts , it is inescapable that the 14th Amendment never was validly adopted as an article of the Constitution , that it has no legal effect , and it should be declared by the Courts to be unconstitutional , and therefore null , void , and of no effect .
The Constitution Strikes the 14th Amendment with Nullity
The defenders of the 14th Amendment contended that the U.S. Supreme Court has finally decided upon its validity .
Such is not the case .
In what is considered the leading case , Coleman v. Miller , 307 U.S. 448 , 59 S. Ct. 972 , the U. S. Supreme Court did not uphold the validity of the 14th Amendment .
In that case , the Court brushed aside constitutional questions as though they did not exist .
For instance , the Court made the statement that :
The legislatures of Georgia , North Carolina , and South Carolina had rejected the amendment in November and December , 1866 .
New governments were erected in those States ( and in others ) under the direction of Congress .
The new legislatures ratified the amendment , that of North Carolina on July 4 , 1868 , that of South Carolina on July 9 , 1868 , and that of Georgia on July 21 , 1868 .
And the Court gave no consideration to the fact that Georgia , North Carolina and South Carolina were three of the original states of the Union with valid and existing constitutions on an equal footing with other original states and those later admitted into the Union .
What constitutional right did Congress have to remove those state governments and their legislatures under unlawful military power set up by the unconstitutional " Reconstruction Acts , " which had for their purpose , the destruction and removal of these legal state governments and the nullification of their Constitutions ?
The fact that these three states and seven other Southern States had existing Constitutions , were recognized as states of the Union , again and again ; had been divided into judicial districts for holding their district and circuit courts of the United States ; had been called upon by Congress to act through their Legislatures upon two Amendments , the 13th and 14th , and by their ratifications had actually made possible the adoption of the 3th Amendment ; as well as their state governments having been re-established under Presidential Proclamations , as shown by President Andrew Johnson 's Veto message and proclamations , were all brushed aside by the Court in Coleman by the statement that :
New governments were erected in those States ( and in others ) under the direction of Congress .
and that these new legislatures ratified the Amendment .
The U.S. Supreme Court overlooked that it previously had held that at no time were these Southern States out of the Union .
White v. Hart , 1871 , 13 Wall , 646 , 654 .
In Coleman , the Court did not adjudicate upon the invalidity of the Acts of Congress which set aside those state Constitutions and abolished their state legislatures — the Court simply referred to the fact that their legally constituted legislatures had rejected the 14th Amendment and that the " new legislatures " had ratified the Amendment .
The Court overlooked the fact , too , that the State of Virginia was also one of the original states with its Constitution and Legislature in full operation under its civil government at the time .
The Court also ignored the fact that the other six Southern States , which were given the same treatment by Congress under the unconstitutional " Reconstruction Acts , " all had legal constitutions and a republican form government in each state , as was recognized by Congress by its admission of those states into the Union .
The Court certainly must take judicial cognizance of the fact that before a new state is admitted by Congress into the Union , Congress enacts an Enabling Act , to enable the inhabitants of the territory to adopt a Constitution to set up a republican form of government as a condition precedent to the admission of the state into the Union , and upon approval of such Constitution , Congress then passes the Act of Admission of such state .
All this was ignored and brushed aside by the Court in the Coleman case .
However , in Coleman the Court inadvertently said this :
Whenever official notice is received at the Department of State that any amendment proposed to the Constitution of the United States had been adopted , according to the provisions of the Constitution , the Secretary of State shall forthwith cause the amendment to be published , with his certificate , specifying the States by which the same may have been adopted , and that the same has become valid , to all intents and purposes , as a part of the Constitution of the United States .
In Hawke v. Smith , 1920 , 253 U.S. 221 , 40 S. Ct. 227 , the U.S. Supreme Court unmistakably held :
The fifth article is a grant of authority by the people to Congress .
The determination of the method of ratification is the exercise of a national power specifically granted by the Constitution : that power is conferred upon Congress , and is limited to two methods , by auction of the Legislatures of three - fourths of the states , or conventions in a like number of states .
Dodge v. Woolsey , 18 How .
331 , 348 , 15 L. Ed. 401 .
The framers of the Constitution might have adopted a different method .
Ratification might have been left to a vote of the people , or to some authority of government other than that selected .
The language of the article is plain , and admits of no doubt in its interpretation .
It is not the function of courts or legislative bodies , national or state , to alter the method which the Constitution has fixed .
We submit that in none of the cases , in . which the Court avoided the constitutional issues involved in the composition of the Congress which adopted the Joint Resolution for the 14th Amendment , did the Court pass upon the constitutionality of the Congress which purported to adopt the Joint Resolution for the 14th Amendment , with 80 Representatives and 23 Senators ' in effect , forcibly ejected or denied their seats and their votes on the Joint Resolution proposing the Amendment , in order to pass the same by a two - thirds vote , as pointed out in the New Jersey Legislature Resolution on March 27 , 1868 .
The constitutional requirements set forth in Article V of the Constitution permit Congress to propose amendments only whenever two - thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary .
That is , two thirds of both houses then constituted without forcible ejections .
Such a fragmentary Congress also violated the constitutional requirements of Article V that no state , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate .
There is no such thing as giving life to an amendment illegally proposed or never legally ratified by three - fourths of the states .
There is no such thing as amendment by laches ; no such thing as amendment by waiver ; no such thing as amendment by acquiescence ; and no such thing amendment by any other means whatsoever except he means specified in Article V of the Constitution itself .
It does not suffice to say that there have been hundreds of cases decided under the 14th Amendment to supply the constitutional deficiencies in its proposal or ratification as required by Article V .
If hundreds of litigants did not question the validity of the 14th Amendment , or questioned the same perfunctorily without submitting documentary proof of the facts of record which made its purported adoption unconstitutional , their failure cannot change the Constitution for the millions in America .
The same thing is true of laches ; the same thing is true of acquiescence ; the same thing is true of ill - considered court decisions .
To ascribe constitutional life to an alleged amendment which never came into being according to specific methods laid down in Article V can not be done without doing violence to Article V itself .
This is true , because the only question open to the courts is whether the alleged 14th Amendment became a part of the Constitution through a method required by Article V .
Anything beyond that which a court is called upon to hold in order to validate an amendment , would be equivalent to writing into Article V another mode of amendment which has never been authorized by the people of the United States .
On this point , therefore , the question is , was the 14th Amendment proposed and ratified in accordance with Article V ?
In answering this question , it is of no real moment that decisions have been rendered in which the parties did not contest or submit proper evidence , or the Court assumed that there was a 14th Amendment .
If a statute never in fact passed by Congress , through some error of administration and printing got into the published reports of the statues , and if under such supposed statute courts had levied punishment upon a number of persons charged under it , and if the error in the published volume was discovered and the fact became known that no such statute had ever passed in Congress , it is unthinkable that the courts would continue to administer punishment in similar cases , on a non existent statute because prior decisions had done so .
If that be true as to a statue we need only realize the greater truth when the principle is applied to the solemn question of the contents of the Constitution .
While the defects in the method of proposing and the subsequent method of computing " ratification " is briefed elsewhere , it should be noted that the failure to comply with Article V began with the first action by Congress .
The very Congress which proposed the alleged 14th Amendment under the first part of Article V was itself , at that very time , violating the last part as well as the first part of Article V of the Constitution .
We shall see how this was done .
There is one , and only one , provision of the Constitution of the United States which is forever immutable which can never be changed or expunged .
The Courts cannot alter it ; the executives cannot change it ; the Congress can not change it .
The States themselves — even all the States , in perfect concert , cannot amend it in any manner whatsoever , whether they act through conventions called for the purpose or through their legislatures .
Not even the unanimous vote of every voter in the United States could amend this provision .
It is a perpetual fixture in the constitution , so perpetual and so fixed that if the people of the United States desired to change or exclude it , they would be compelled to abolish he Constitution and start afresh .
The unalterable provision is this : " that no State , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate . "
A state , by its own consent , may waive this right of equal suffrage , but that is the only legal method by which a failure to accord this immutable right of equal suffrage in the Senate can be justified .
Certainly not by forrcible ejection and denial by a majority in Congress , as was done for the adoption of the Joint Resolution for he 14th Amendment .
Statements by the Court in the Coleman case that Congress was left in complete control of the mandatory process , and therefore it was a political affair for Congress to decide if an amendment had been ratified , does not square with Article V of the Constitution which shows no intention to leave Congress in charge of deciding whether there has been a ratification .
Even a constitutionally recognized Congress is given but one volition in Article V , that is , to vote whether to propose an amendment on its own initiative .
The remaining steps Congress are mandatory .
If two - thirds of both houses hall deem it necessary , Congress shall propose amendments ; if the Legislatures of two - thirds of the States make application , Congress shall call a convention .
For the Court to give Congress any power beyond that to e found in Article V is to write the new material into article V .
It would be inconceivable that the Congress of the United States could propose , compel submission to , and then give life to an invalid amendment by resolving that its effort had succeeded , regardless of compliance with he positive provisions of Article V .
It should need no further citations to sustain the reposition that neither the Joint Resolution proposing he 14th Amendment nor its ratification by the required three - fourths of the States in the Union were in compliance with the requirements of Article V of the Constitution .
When the mandatory provisions of the Constitution e violated , the Constitution itself strikes with nullity the Act that did violence to its provisions .
Thus , the Constitution strikes with nullity the purported 14th Amendment .
The Courts , bound by oath to support the Constitution , should review all the evidence herein submitted and easure the facts proving violations of the mandatory revisions of the Constitution with Article V , and finally ender judgment declaring said purported Amendment ever to have been adopted as required by the Constitution .
The Constitution makes it the sworn duty of the judges to uphold the Constitution which strikes with nullity the 14th Amendment .
And , as Chief Justice Marshall pointed out for a unanimous Court in Marbury v. Madison ( 1 Cranch 136 179 ) :
The framers of the Constitution contemplated the instrument as a rule for the government of courts , as well as of the legislature .
Why does a judge swear to discharge his duties agreeably to the Constitution of the United States , if that constitution forms no rule for his government ?
If such be the real state of things , that is worse than solemn mockery .
To prescribe , or take this oath , becomes equally a crime .
Thus , the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle , supposed to be essential to all written constitutions * * * * courts , as well as other departments , are bound by that instrument .
The federal courts actually refuse to hear argument on the invalidity of the 14th Amendment , even when the issue is presented squarely by the pleadings and the evidence as above .
Only an aroused public sentiment in favor of preserving the Constitution and our institutions and freedoms under constitutional government , and the future security of our country , will break the political barrier which now prevents judicial consideration of the unconstitutionality of the 14th Amendment .
Point - a - La-hache , La .
L. H. Perez
CDR Note :
In view of the evidence available , the fact of the invalidity of the 14th Amendment is blatant and irrefutable .
In view of the fact that — never mind the obvious corruption in the courts at the time the invalid amendment was challenged — the courts today appear to operate under the invalid 14th Amendment , it would hardly be presumable that a court challenge , regardless the aroused public sentiment , would be successful .
However , this is not a matter for courts to decide .
It is a matter for the people to take into hand ; to instruct the legislatures of their respective states to declare its ( 14th Amendment ) invalidity , while also declaring the unalienable rights of all legal residents in the State , regardless race , color or creed .
Switzerland 's biggest bank , UBS , is to pay $ 780 m ( £ 547 m ) to the US authorities to avoid a criminal prosecution for helping thousands of wealthy Americans avoid tax by hiding their money in secret bank accounts .
In a settlement announced last night , UBS admitted breaking American law by participating in a scheme to defraud the US internal revenue service .
The long - running case went to the heart of Switzerland 's tradition of bank privacy .
The US justice department had accused UBS of actively encouraging Americans to use its bank accounts to avoid paying tax .
In a highly unusual move , UBS has agreed to hand over the names and account details of certain American clients to the US government .
It will pay $ 380 m in disgorgement of profits and $ 400 m to make up for unpaid tax .
UBS 's chairman , Peter Kurer , said the bank " sincerely regrets " compliance failures identified in the case : " We accept full responsibility for these improper activities . "
He said UBS was still committed to privacy : " Client confidentiality , to which UBS remains committed , was never designed to protect fraudulent acts . "
Under US law , Americans are supposed to declare all foreign bank accounts containing more than $ 10,000 .
According to prosecutors , some 20,000 Americans had private accounts at UBS containing $ 20 bn between 2002 and 2007 .
Some 17,000 of these accounts were concealed from the tax authorities .
UBS 's reputation took a beating last year when a former private banking executive , Bradley Birkenfeld , pleaded guilty to helping a billionaire client evade tax .
Birkenfeld made a series of lurid allegations about UBS 's tactics .

A Palestinian family rushes from the scene of an Israeli missile strike on a building in the Rafah refugee camp , southern Gaza Strip , 28 December 2008 .
( Hatem Omar / MaanImages )
IOF
IOF
UNRWA
In one of its bloodiest military operations , the Israeli Occupation Forces ( ) initiated a wide - scale air strike operation against the Gaza Strip .
Dozens of targets were attacked from the air simultaneously using heavy missiles and bombs .
Mostly , the strikes targeted police and security installations across the densely populated Gaza Strip , which is indicative of ’s disregard for civilian life and well - being .
More than 900 people have been killed and injured , most of whom are non-combatants .
The number of casualties was because the timing of the strike , which coincided with the change in school shifts when tens of thousands of schoolchildren were on their way to or from school .
Seven [ the United Nations agency for Palestine refugees ] Gaza Vocational Training Center students were also killed in one of the air strikes in Gaza City .
According to Al Mezan ’s monitoring , at approximately 11:30 am on Saturday 27 December 2008 , Israeli military aircraft launched a coordinated series of air strikes targeting dozens of police , security and other premises across the Gaza Strip .
The first wave of attacks lasted for less than five minutes , during which more than 100 missiles and bombs were dropped on Gaza .
One of the largest strikes targeted the Arafat Police Town , which is located near several UNRWA schools .
Dozens of people were killed in this attack , including tens of young men who were undergoing training to join the police .
Moreover , Colonel General Tawfik Jabir , who is the Police General Director in the Gaza Strip , and Captain Ahmed al - Jabari , the Director of the Security and Protection Apparatus , were killed in the same attack .
The IOF air strikes were unprecedented in their fierceness .
Police stations located in densely populated neighborhoods were attacked , destroying them and causing severe damage to tens of schools and homes and killing dozens of civilians , including children and old people .
Air strikes have continued through the night , targeting houses and other civilian premises , including water - wells , workshops , mosques and communications facilities .
A guard of a water well and three employees of the Palestinian Telecommunications Company were killed in North Gaza .
Another two men were killed in a strike that targeted the al - Borno Mosque near al - Shifa Hospital in Gaza City .
The hospital was damaged in the same strike .
Moreover , IOF targeted prisons , including Gaza ’s main prison facility of al - Saraya at noon today .
Initial reports indicate that many policemen and prisoners were killed and injured in this attack .
Additionally , dozens of homes were destroyed , along with tens of UNRWA and government schools and clinics .
Local government offices and private vehicles were also destroyed .
Al Mezan ’s initial monitoring indicates that at least 257 people have been killed in the IOF ’s strikes in the last 24 hours .
Of those , the vast majority are non-combatants and civilians ; including 20 children , nine women and 60 civilians .
The majority of the rest of the casualties are members of the civilian police who were inside their stations or undertaking training .
At least 597 people were also injured , including 35 children whose wounds were reportedly critical .
Al Mezan believes that the number of casualties is expected to increase as many victims have been buried by their families without being registered at hospitals .
Furthermore , a high number of people lie at hospitals between death and life .
Moreover , dozens of people who were lightly wounded and therefore not admitted to hospitals were not counted .
As the air strikes continue , more people fall victim to them .
This makes this operation one of Israel ’s bloodiest , most criminal military actions in Gaza in the past few decades .
This escalation comes amidst unprecedented deterioration of the humanitarian conditions Gaza ’s 1.5 million persons face because of Israel ’s tight siege which prevents their access to food , medicine and power .
Ordinary Gazans have particularly been suffering from shortages in water supplies , cooking gas and foodstuffs .
The siege has also impacted hospitals ’ capacity to function under severe shortages in medicines and equipment .
Hospitals ’ ability to handle very high numbers of casualties in a short time since yesterday has been particularly problematic , and particularly during the first hour after the first wave of attacks yesterday .
With the strongest possible terms , Al Mezan Center for Human Rights condemns the IOF ’s criminal military escalation in the Gaza Strip , which indiscriminately harms civilians and civilian property , and blatantly breaches the rules of international humanitarian law , qualifying as war crimes .
Al Mezan particularly condemns the IOF attacks against civilian objects in which children and uninvolved civilians have been killed and maimed despite the advanced technological capabilities that the IOF employs in their surveillance of the Gaza Strip .
Al Mezan stresses that police members who do not take part in any hostilities are not considered legitimate military targets under international humanitarian law and must not be deliberately targeted .
It further stresses that Israel must respect the rules of international law at all times , particularly when the use of force is involved .
A reaction to rocket attacks cannot justify the perpetration of grave breaches of international humanitarian law , i.e. war crimes and crimes against humanity .
Al Mezan warns about the continued silence of the international community in the face of Israel ’s escalation , which only encourages Israel to further escalate its attacks .
Al Mezan calls on the international community to intervene urgently to protect the civilian population in harmony with its legal and ethical obligations under international law .
International intervention is required urgently as the IOF ’s attacks on Gaza continue .

Inquiring minds are asking " To what extent is the Fed is in the dark ? "
Amazingly Bernanke answered that question today in Congress with complete candor .
All you need to know is how to translate his statements .
Please consider Bernanke tells Congress
Fed knows what it is doing .
Federal Reserve Board chairman Ben Bernanke tried to assure Congress and investors that federal regulators are not grasping at straws in the response to the financial crisis .
" We 're not making it up , " Bernanke told the House Financial Services panel .
" We 're working along a program that has been applied in various contexts . "
" We 're not completely in the dark . "
My Translation
Bernanke is trying to reinforce his message to Congress that the Fed and the Obama administration now have at least the outlines of a bank rescue plan in place that will show results over time and that banks are not on an out - of - control course to nationalization .
My Comment
Bernanke assurance Tuesday to the Senate Banking Committee that the federal government does n't want to nationalize the nation 's largest banks was cited as a major factor in the stock market 's rebound .
Bernanke said regulators would ensure than banks did not turn into zombie banks .
My Comment
Bernanke said that the government was prepared to inject capital to fix holes in the banks caused to the sudden sharp drop in their assets .
But the size of the holes remains an open question .

Google has already indicated that it plans to offer a platform for Chrome browser extensions , but now we finally have what looks like a firm date on when that will arrive .
Apparently , a Google developer conference scheduled for May 27th will include a session on developing extensions for Chrome , which leads Google Operating System to conclude that we ’ll see the extensions platform go live on or before that date .
The Chrome team has already published documentation outlining general goals and principles for how they believe the extension system should operate .
High on the list of reasons that adding extensions to Chrome is important is that it will make the browser more attractive to “ users coming from other browsers who are used to certain extensions that they can't live without . ”
While extensions will certainly make the browser more attractive to a certain subset of users , the bigger fish to fry for Google is adding a Mac version .
That too is in the works ( see documentation here ) , but if Chrome wants to draw in a lot more users of its browser , Mac support will be key , as these users have so far been completely shutout of experiencing the benefits of Chrome .
As for how Chrome is doing so far , in addition to their self - reported 10 million downloads , our internal numbers show that Chrome is currently used by 4.50 % of our visitors , up from 4.00 % in the previous 30 days .
Those numbers are no doubt higher than the general population given our tech focus , but point to a slight uptick in Chrome adoption .

Islamist regime has killed dozens and tortured others as ' collaborators ' with Israel in war 's aftermath , Amnesty and Guardian sources say
New evidence has emerged revealing the extent of the crackdown by Hamas during and after Israel 's war in Gaza last month .
Amnesty International said Hamas forces and militias were involved in a " campaign of abductions , deliberate and unlawful killings , torture and death threats against those they accuse of ' collaborating ' with Israel , as well as opponents and critics " .
It said at least two dozen men had been shot by Hamas since the end of December and " scores of others " shot in the legs , kneecapped or beaten .
Amnesty gave detailed accounts of some of the cases and said there was " incontrovertible evidence " that Hamas security forces and militia were " responsible for grave human rights abuses " .
Hamas officials have admitted hunting for suspected collaborators , but they have denied this campaign of attacks .
Hamas apparently fears it lost some of its control in Gaza during Israel 's devastating three - week war and launched a new and violent crackdown to enforce its rule , targeting not only those suspected of giving information to the Israeli military but also escaped prisoners and all perceived internal opponents .
The new evidence corroborates witness accounts given to the Guardian , as well as an investigation by the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights , based in Gaza City , that found 32 people had been killed by the Palestinian security services and other gunmen in Gaza since the war began , and that dozens more were shot or beaten .
In an interview today , one Palestinian working for a civil society organisation described how he was forced to leave Gaza because of the growing intimidation and threats .
Mowaffaq Alami , 36 , worked for the One Voice organisation in Gaza promoting grassroots discussions about Israeli - Palestinian peace proposals .
After Hamas took full security control of Gaza in June 2007 , its forces raided the group 's office and seized computers and other equipment .
One Voice later closed its office , but the staff went on working from home .
Then Hamas ordered all civil society groups to obtain its permission to continue their work .
One Voice refused and six months ago halted all its work in Gaza .
" People are afraid to live normal lives , to express their opinions freely , " Alami said .
" There is no freedom of speech , of movement , of travelling or having real healthcare .
Hamas is raising George Bush 's policy : those not with us are against us . "
One of his colleagues was forced to leave Gaza after receiving threats from Hamas .
The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights said Hamas had tightened its restrictions on civil society groups , ordering them to inform the Hamas authorities before receiving or distributing aid and obtain Hamas approval before starting new construction or development work .
Alami , who secured a rare permit to leave Gaza a week ago with his family to live in the West Bank , said there were frequently differences between orders given by local Hamas commanders on the ground and the more senior leadership within the movement .
Other small extremist movements were also beginning to return to force again – one prominent cafe in Gaza City was bombed last week .
He said many Palestinians no longer felt affiliated to any political group , either Hamas or Fatah , its West Bank - based rival .
" Politicians and the media think that there is a simple division between Gaza and the West Bank , between Hamas and Fatah ...
The majority of the Palestinian people today are with none of them . "
1. GUESS WHO'S BACK
For a man whose last public act was to splash his wedding across the pages of Hello !
magazine in 2006 , where he proudly showed off his new wife Kim , daughter Hailie and an endearingly ill - fitting lounge suit , Marshall Bruce Mathers III was in a strangely reclusive mood when he began his long - awaited return to the public eye three months ago .
The 36 - year - old white rapper , better known as Eminem but occasionally styling himself Slim Shady , turned up at the launch of his autobiography , The Way I Am , at a sports shop in Manhattan wearing the uncomfortable look of a man to whom fame and fortune have brought little in the way of happiness – and a healthy dose of insecurity .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Fellow guests , most of whom he 'd personally invited , as it was , after all , his party , were ordered not to speak unless spoken to .
Book - signing was out of the question , since Eminem does n't " do " autographs .
He posed briefly for photos , frowning behind a pair of spectacles , before disappearing downstairs with fellow musicians 50 Cent and LL Cool J .
" Em was pretty much a rabbit in headlights , " recalls Hattie Collins , founder of the urban lifestyle magazine RWD , who was present .
" We were told not to talk to him .
People like 50 Cent were walking around , shaking hands and being generally sociable , so it was a friendly event .
But I guess he just did n't feel ready to be back in the public eye . "
Twenty minutes later , Eminem re-emerged .
He breezed through the room , pausing only to answer a few questions for a local hip - hop station ( earlier that day , he 'd given a sometimes monosyllabic but occasionally intriguing half - hour interview to Radio 1's Zane Lowe ) .
Then he was ushered into a black SUV and driven away .
So began Eminem 's great comeback .
As the opening salvo in a musical renaissance that has been four years in the making , and will culminate very shortly in the release of an album that ( if you believe the hype ) could end up being one of the greatest records of recent times , it left a certain something to be desired .
2. MY NAME IS ...
Things were n't always like this .
A decade ago , Mathers – an angry young man from the wrong side of Detroit – decided to bleach his hair , adopt the alter ego Slim Shady , and transform the landscape of popular music .
In six years , from 1999 to 2005 , he recorded five extraordinary albums which sold nearly 50 million copies , and gave the city of Motown a new chapter in its musical history .
Today , Detroit is ground zero of America 's economic meltdown , its motor industries bankrupt and its housing market worthless .
Entire streets in Warren , the bleak suburb where Eminem grew up , can be brought and sold for less than a family car .
Hotels , shops and even bars on 8 Mile , the road that gave its name to the semi-autobiographical film Eminem made , have bars protecting their workforce from feral locals .
Across great swathes of the city , the only surviving industries involve prostitution and drugs .
Visitors are warned not to venture out of doors after dark – though the bitterly cold Michigan winter hardly encourages such adventure , particularly now that the state has run out of money to grit or snowplough its roads .
Last week , the corpse of a homeless man was discovered encased entirely in a block of ice in the basement of a city - centre skyscraper .
No one knew how long he'd been there .
Eminem grew up at the tail end of his town 's decline from prosperity to despair .
And he chronicled it all with outrageous energy , and a wicked sense of humor .
His best music overflowed with with linguistic vitality and literary energy .
Eminem proved that a white man could master hip - hop , and inspired an extraordinary devotion from often - disaffected fans .
Eventually , he was hailed as the greatest rapper alive , filling stadiums and front pages with consummate ease .
At first , Eminem rapped about his soap - opera life – complete with dysfunctional relationships , a trailer - park mother and his impoverished childhood .
When he achieved tabloid notoriety , he rapped about that .
Either way , he turned his life into public property .
Eminem's was the " other " America , a gritty world of industrial decline and social decay rooted in his home town .
His music was often angry or pugnacious , but could also be lifted by his sense of humour and by the anthemic intensity of hits such as " Lose Yourself " , which won an Oscar , and " Stan " , one of the greatest hip - hop tracks of all time .
" He came from us .
He was one of us .
We saw him go from being a person we'd see every Saturday at the hip - hop shop to the biggest star in the world , " recalls Marv One , a Detroit rap artist who had a cameo role in Eminem 's film 8 Mile .
" What happened with that guy was awesome . "
As his fame grew , Eminem became a magnet for controversy .
He was accused of glorifying misogyny , homophobia , bad language and violence .
He was arrested on gun charges .
On one occasion , George Bush , upset by his lack of respect for the forces of conservatism , labelled him : " The greatest threat to America 's children since polio . "
Yet , with time , he secured a following that stretched across every demographic of the record - buying public , inspiring fans as incongruously middle - of - the - road as Alan Yentob and Jenny Agutter .
In one headline - grabbing endorsement , confirming him as the favourite cultural influence of the chattering classes , a white - haired Seamus Heaney declared him , in all seriousness , the saviour of modern poetry .
" There is this guy Eminem , " said the Nobel laureate .
" He has created a sense of what is possible .
He has sent a voltage around a generation .
He has done this not just through his subversive attitude , but also his verbal energy . "
Then , at the height of his remarkable fame , Eminem disappeared .
3. ALL FALL DOWN
The CCC club , or at least its former premises , sits between a barber 's shop and a pawnbroker on a desolate stretch of 8 Mile , the road that runs east to west across Detroit , separating the traditionally black inner city from its chiefly white suburbs .
Today , like many businesses in a city ravaged by the decline of the car industry , where family homes change hands for as little as $ 2,000 , it has ceased trading .
But on 11 April 2006 , the venue bore witness to an event that has assumed totemic significance in the Eminem story : the killing of 32 - year - old DeShaun Dupree Holton .
Holton , better known as the rap artist Proof , was Eminem 's closest friend .
They had met aged 14 , at Lincoln High School in Warren .
Proof encouraged him to rap , nurtured his talent , and recruited him to the Detroit rap collective D12 .
Later , he became Eminem 's " hype man " – the performer who precedes a rap superstar onstage , warms up the crowd , and provides his backing vocals .
Proof 's killing ( he was shot three times in the head and chest during a bar brawl that has never been properly explained ) affected Eminem deeply .
" I have never felt so much pain in my life , " he recalled in The Way I Am .
" I 've had death in my family before – two of my uncles committed suicide – and it took chunks out of my life ...
After he passed , it was a year before I could really do anything normal again .
It was tough for me to even get out of bed , let alone write a rhyme ... my brain was scattered . "
Eminem was already showing signs of fatigue .
The previous August he 'd cancelled a world tour , claiming to be exhausted after years on the road and suffering from a dependency on sleeping pills .
Losing Proof was a knockout blow .
It prompted him to withdraw completely from the world , retreating to his vast mansion in Clinton Township , just outside Detroit .
For more than two years Eminem barely ventured out of doors , let alone appeared in public .
Not a single record was released , or interview given .
Noting that his last original album
came out in 2004 , the media filled the vacuum with rumour and revelation .
Grim stories began alleging that the usually muscular star , who kept fit through a mixture of workouts and energetic stage performances , was bingeing on junk food and had ballooned in weight to 240 lb .
Paparazzi pictures emerged of him in a wheelchair , following a bout of pneumonia .
His marriage to Kim fell apart again , and his estranged mother published a muckraking memoir .
By the middle of 2008 , with his career still on hold and his private life in turmoil , concerned fans feared that Eminem was going the way of Michael Jackson .
Former associates in Detroit described him as " missing in action " .
More worryingly , reports began suggesting that Eminem had begun to doubt his own abilities to " hear a hit " .
He seemed consumed by self - doubt and destined for retirement .
Though only in his mid-thirties , headline writers dubbed him the Howard Hughes of hip - hop , and said he'd never rap again .
But they were wrong .
4. RELAPSE
On 15 October 2008 , Eminem announced a comeback .
The news was broken during a late - night interview with Shade 45 , a satellite radio station he part - owns , when he announced that he was working on a new album called Relapse .
The record would be produced by Dr Dre , a long - time collaborator who signed him to the record label Interscope in the late 1990s .
Within hours , news of his return had electrified the record industry and sent ripples of excitement through his still - loyal fanbase .
After hearing him perform a two - minute riff titled " I 'm having a relapse " , Shade 45 listeners reported him to be back on top of his game .
Days later , a second track called " Crack a Bottle " , featuring 50 Cent and Dr Dre , was leaked on the internet .
It garnered some solid reviews , in spite of being by no means a finished version .
( Eminem claimed to be " really heated " about the leak in an email interview with Billboard , saying : " It 's like someone catches you peeping in your window before you got the Spider - Man costume all zipped up ! " )
Today , the album is still being completed , in conditions of near - total secrecy .
The release date was originally slated to be 23 December 2008 .
Then it was put back to 2 March 2009 .
At present , it looks like hitting the shelves in the middle of next month .
" We 've been told nothing about this record , and I mean nothing , " says a source at Polydor , the multinational owner of Interscope .
" It 's top secret .
In terms of timing , the plan is to release it between new records from 50 Cent and Dre , who are both also signed to Interscope .
Whenever it comes out , it will be huge . "
The hype machine would hardly suggest otherwise .
But there are intriguing signs that a blockbuster record could be in the making .
In October , Elton John was spotted breezing into the Ferndale recording studio where Relapse is being recorded .
" He stayed half a week , " says a witness to the visit .
" No one realised the significance , though the Detroit Free Press did mention that Elton had been in town .
He and Em worked together before , when they did that duet at the Grammys , and had always said that they 'd record something original together .
Em has huge respect for Elton , and the feeling is mutual .
Elton really gets his music .
Anything they produce will be total dope : some of Em 's biggest records have been collaborations with mainstream pop stars – Dido on Stan , for example – and they really do n't come much bigger , or more mainstream , than the man with the red piano . "
The death of Proof has also given Eminem fresh material to mine ( essential for an artist who writes mostly about himself ) .
Although he could be forgiven for rustiness , he is reported to have been " hitting a roll " in the studio .
" In the later albums , he 'd started to throw some quite political stuff in about Bush , and also talk about his family life , and risk soppiness with the lullaby track ' Mockingbird ' , about Hailie , " says Eminem 's biographer , Nick Hasted .
" This time , I would think there will be some anger on the record , as there always is , but its overall theme will almost certainly be Proof ; I would expect a fairly powerful tribute . "
Any fears about Eminem 's physical condition can also be laid to rest : at his book launch in October , he bore no trace of excess weight .
There 's a reason for that : he 's been undergoing gym sessions with the famous boxing trainer , Emanuel Steward .
" The guy is in excellent shape now , excellent , " says a source close to Steward .
" He 's a workout maven , and one of those healthy body , healthy mind people , and right now , he 's in the right place to just blow the world away . "
5. THE REAL SLIM SHADY
It is a little - known fact that the only book Eminem read as a child was the dictionary .
He pored over it , searching for words that rhymed with each other that could later be pulled out of the bag during the freestyle rap " battles " that provided his education in hip - hop .
The years spent studying the English language lie at the core of his technical brilliance .
They turned him into the greatest rapper of his time .
But they did so at a personal cost : for Eminem could be uncharitably described as an anorak .
His life starts and ends with music .
He writes constantly , scrawling lines on sheets of notepaper in a crabby handwriting .
When he's not composing new verse , or messing around in a studio , he 'll be listening to hip - hop .
" The guy 's a studio rat , " says producer Terry Simaan , the owner of Oh Trey 9 , one of the Detroit 's most influential hip - hop labels .
" If he feels like it , he 'll spend 12 , 15 hours a day in a studio . "
As a result – and this is critical when considering the potential impact of Relapse – Eminem 's so - called " missing years " have actually been surprisingly productive .
" He 's never stopped recording .
Ever , " adds Simaan .
" I hear they 've got over 300 songs in the can from what he 's produced in the last three years .
I 've seen him write .
He 's a fast worker .
He 'll write one line , then three lines , then four lines , in all separate parts of the page .
Then he 'll come back to it , and say this is a sweet line , or that 's working for him , and just pull everything together almost instantly .
The guy 's a total genius . "
In other words , Eminem now has a vast catalogue of material from which to cherry - pick the dozen - odd tracks that will make up Relapse .
Like a mad genius , inside his Detroit mansion , he has been stockpiling an extraordinary collection of unreleased music .
It is now being polished by Dr Dre , a notorious perfectionist .
" Eminem had a career break .
But I would n't say it was a rest , " says Mark Hicks , the former manager of D - 12 , and an occasional acquaintance .
" He 's a lover of music and making music , so despite what everyone said , he never stopped working , or quit rap .
He was in the studio every day .
He just did n't want to go on tour , or have to do everything that comes with selling an album . "
Hicks says that Relapse will see Eminem back to the peak of his talents , re-adopting his old , aggressive , alter ego Slim Shady .
" On his last record , I think how he put it was that he wanted to say goodbye to Hollywood , and stop being part of the entertainment world any more .
But he 's a special guy , he 's been on a roll , and he was never going to just disappear for ever . "
6. ROLE MODEL
In the summer of 2003 , Eminem bought a vast , 29 - room mansion in Rochester Hills , an upmarket suburb of Detroit .
It was previously the property of the the K - Mart chairman Chuck Conaway , and boasted heated marble floors , mahogany panelling , a helipad , two swimming pools and several acres of landscaped grounds .
Strangely , Eminem has barely lived in the mansion , choosing instead to reside at his smaller gated property in Clinton Township .
Friends say the second home is an expensive white elephant , aimed at throwing obsessive fans off his scent .
" Proof 's death bothered Em a lot , and he started to get a bit paranoid and worry that he might be next , " said one associate , speaking on condition of anonymity .
" It also made him realise his responsibilities .
He did n't need any more money , and he hated being away from his daughter , so he decided that he would n't leave her alone to go touring any more . "
As a result , Eminem has spent recent years reinventing himself as a family man .
His domestic circle includes Hailie and her adopted sibling Alaina , who is the daughter of his ex-wife Kim 's sister , together with his brother Nathan who , while also pursuing a career in hip - hop ( though apparently as a promoter rather than artist ) , completes the domestic set - up .
" A lot of my security guys also work for Marshall as bodyguards , " says Mike Danner , the manager of St Andrews , the famous Detroit hip - hop venue featured in Eminem 's semi-autobiographical film 8 Mile .
" From what they tell me , when he 's not in the studio , he 's with his kids , either playing with them at home , or taking them to school . "
Eminem 's recent maturity is probably related to his own upbringing .
He was brought up in crushing poverty by a single parent ( his father Marshall walked out on his mother Deborah shortly after he was born ) and has always been unreservedly anxious to give Hailie the childhood he never had .
He maintained a healthy suspicion of the hangers - on that attach themselves to a rising star , and decided to forgo the trappings of success , even flying charter ( unthinkable for a rap star ) until 2001 .
His enduring determination to make the most of what remains of fatherhood means he 's unlikely now to go on tour to promote Relapse .
" I have one story that sums Em up , " ventures a friend .
" After his second album he was in the jewellery store .
He really liked a watch , but was worried that he'd not be able to afford it , so called his manager , Paul Rosenberg , to check he had enough cash .
The watch turned out to be $ 15,000 .
At the time , Em was one of the hottest artists on the planet .
He was worth millions .
So Paul told him not to be silly , and just buy the watch .
" But Em was like , ' I do n't want to run out of money , I want my daughter to be able to go to college . '
That 's really tells the kind of guy he is .
I think fame surprised him .
I do n't think he really had realised who he was what kind of money he had , and what he'd achieved , until suddenly he woke up one day as the biggest star in the world .
Whoever you are , that 's going to make you a bit nuts . "
7. CRACK A BOTTLE
The rapper Nas recently contended that hip - hop is dead .
Critics say it has run out of steam , stopped evolving , and in common with the rest of the music industry , reached a point of commercial hopelessness and artistic stagnation .
At the end of his autobiography , Eminem addresses this question head - on , casting himself not as a potential saviour of a dying genre , but as the master chronicler of his own , contradictory life story .
And it is this , combined with the richness of Eminem 's soaring talent , that makes the arrival Relapse feel so pregnant with possibility .
" Whether I 'm someone 's favourite rapper or not , whether I 'm thought of as one of the best , one of the most half - assed , whatever it is , I am one of the most personal , " he explains .
" That 's why people relate to me , because I show so much of myself .
That 's why random taxi drivers call me ' Marshall ' .
And the reason I put so much of myself out there in the first place is because I had no idea I was going to be so famous .
I had no idea , no fucking clue .
If I had to do it again , I do n't know if I would .
I 'm glad , though , that my music has brought people together . "
Hellboy has definitely been among our favorite comic figurines .
The best thing about Hellboy was the punch in the character where a monster turns into hero .
Although this transition doesnâ€™t fetch him a wax statue in Madame Tussauds , a groovy Lego treatment still works for him .
The Hellboy Lego by Misterzumbi surely looks amazing .
I donâ€™t think any other form of replication would have done justice to its overall persona as this one does .
Also check the Hellboy Mechabot Action Figure which puts across a creative makeover for this character .

Tips & Warnings
REQUIRED6 LED 's of the same color .
If you 're a beginner you 'll probably need more because you will burn them out .
( $ 1.50 ) A transistor , this will amplify the signals sent from your iPod .
There are many kinds almost any will work .
( $ 2.00 ) A resistor , more if you are a beginner .
Anywhere from 375 to 425 Ohms will be fine . ( $ 0.50 ) Some electrical wire .3 AA batteries you may need more if you are using high voltage LED 's. 1 pair of headphones that you can destroy .
OPTIONALA wire cuttersA small housing box for your project .
Some way to hold your batteries ( I used a remote from an old remote controlled car ) .
Read the tips and warnings at the bottom of this page .
Arrange and connect your five LED 's in parallel .
This is done by connecting all the negative wires of the LED 's and connecting all the positive wires of the LED 's to each other .
See the picture for more help .
Take theearphone and cut it off .
Cut at the very highest so there is more wire to use .
The other earphone can be cut off and attached to a speaker but this guide wo n't be covering that .
Inside one of those earphone wires there should be two wires , separate them .
Take the two wires you obtained from one earphone and connect them on opposite sides of your resistor .
Take your LED 's wired in parallel and connect one positive side to the positive power source .
It does not matter which positive side you connect .
Obtain your transistor .
Connect the base wire from the transistor to one end of the resistor .
Connect the collector wire of the transistor to a negative end of the LED's .
Connect the emmiter wire to the negative power source .
Verify all your connections with the full picture .
There you have it !
Connect the wire from the earphone into a jack in your iPod or computer , crank up the volume and enjoy the light show .
The negative cathode wire of an LED is always shorter .
The positive anode wire of an LED is always longer .
All transistors are not the same .
Find out the base , emmiter , and collector of your transistor before you leave the store .
If you do n't it will be a real haggle trying to figure out which one is which .
A balloon - borne experiment flying over Antarctica measured a surprisingly high number of energetic electrons streaming in from space ( Image : T Gregory Guzik )
Dark matter is proving less shadowy than its name suggests .
Its signature may have been detected by a balloon - borne experiment that measured a surprisingly high number of energetic electrons streaming in from space .
High - energy electrons are found throughout space and are accelerated when stars explode in supernovae .
But a balloon - borne detector flying over Antarctica called the Advanced Thin Ionization Calorimeter ( ATIC ) has detected 70 more high - energy electrons than the normal background level attributed to supernova blasts .
John Wefel of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge , who led the collaboration , says there are two possible explanations .
Advertisement
The electrons could come from a nearby astrophysical object , such as a pulsar , that lies within 3000 light years from Earth .
But the team has spent four years trying to fit the signal to such an object and has yet to find a good match .
The alternative is that the electrons were produced when two dark matter particles met and destroyed each other .
That hypothesis is strengthened by the electrons ’ observed energies , which range from 300 to 800 gigaelectronvolts .
“ There is nothing that we know of in high - energy physics or astrophysics that happens in this energy range , ” says Wefel .
Extra dimensions
What ’s more , the signal peaked at 650 GeV and then rapidly declined to the background level at 800 GeV .
According to Wefel , this is the kind of signature you would expect if a type of exotic particle known as a Kaluza Klein particle was the dark matter culprit , with the peak at 650 GeV corresponding to its mass .
This type of particle is a WIMP ( weakly interacting massive particle ) , one of the most promising candidates for dark matter , and comes from theories in which the universe has extra spatial dimensions .
These extra dimensions can only be detected by observing WIMPS that have leaked into the four dimensions ( three of space and one of time ) that are familiar to us .
The past few years have been good for dark matter hunters .
In 2007 , NASA ’s WMAP satellite , which measures the big bang ’s afterglow , picked up an excess of microwaves from around the centre of our galaxy .
This ‘ WMAP haze ’ could be radiation produced when dark matter particles collide .
Other signals
A few months ago , another group found tantalising hints of dark matter in antimatter measurements taken by a detector known as PAMELA .
So how do the results from ATIC fit in with these ?
Even though the data from PAMELA cover a different energy range from the ATIC signal , Wefel believes that “ there is no contradiction between ATIC and PAMELA , at least to within the uncertainties on the presently available data ” , he told New Scientist .
“ It is possible that we may be observing the same source . ”
But ATIC has detected 200 times more potential dark matter than WMAP did at the galactic centre .
“ We need a boost factor of 200 for the results to be compatible , ” says Wefel .
“ So either the WMAP haze is wrong , the theory is wrong , or dark matter is not uniformly distributed all over the place . ”
The search continues
With so many unanswered questions , will we ever be able to say conclusively that dark matter has been spotted ?
Wefel thinks that experiments such as the recently launched Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope should continue to discover new possible sources of dark matter .
These sources will need to be studied in other wavelengths and with other instruments in order to determine their properties .
“ Then we shall see if any of them have the capability to produce the electron signal that ATIC observed , ” says Wefel .
“ How long do you search before you give up ?
I ca n’t say but I suspect we ’ll keep going until Fermi and other instruments run out of new source discoveries .
Meanwhile other experiments will try to study the electrons in more detail to see if they can ‘ pin down ’ the signature of dark matter annihilation . ”
However the pieces fit together , other experts say the ATIC discovery is intriguing .
That ’s because there are still some questions about what accelerates electrons and other charged particles in space , called cosmic rays .
“ Even if it proves not to be dark matter , the puzzle of how very high - energy cosmic rays are produced is still a mystery , and this work will help shed some light on it , ” thinks Andy Taylor , an astrophysicist from the University of Edinburgh .

Overview
Code ( May 23 , 2005 ) Debug ( June 6 , 2005 ) Test Refactor
Click here to view the article with full size images .
Like a concept car strutting its stuff , the Visual Studio 2010 Concept IDE is packed with over - the - top features and weird ideas .
Tame as it may look , this UI designed for one thing : jamming out code .
Save the bizarre Windows Media - esque skins for the punks , we ’ve got work to do .
Here it is :
Concept One : The Solution Explorer ( green box )
The green box at top left clearly identifies the name of the solution and provides two nice summary stats : total type count and total source line count .
Click the green arrow to slide out a panel providing full configuration options for the solution .
Concept Two : Assembler ( yellow box )
Add , remove or build assemblies from the Assembler .
Display assemblies in alphabetical or build order .
Build individual assemblies by clicking the build number on the right .
The shaded circles indicate the number of code files in the assembly - with darker colors indicating a greater number of files .
Click the yellow arrow to slide out a panel replete with assembly configuration dream tools .
Concept Three : CodeFile Crawler ( blue box )
You ’ve got exactly one jillion code files in your assembly , right ?
Use the Crawler to find the one you need to work on next .
Search by type , type name , namespace or use the root feature to select a root type - the Crawler will then find all referenced types down to level zero .
If that ’s too many types , use the Level Cutter to limit the results to a given level .
Concept Four : Head ( color - coded area above the editor )
After you select a type in the Crawler , the type name and relevant stats are displayed in the Head .
Of course , the stats update as you code .
Concept Five : Remoting Eye ( large circular icon in the head )
Of course you ’re pair programming – the eye tells you so .
Whenever the eye is displayed , your programming partner ’s computer is connected to the session .
Click the eye and select “ Pass The Baton ” to send a current copy , the diffs , or checkout the same files from your partner 's computer ( whatever your version control system wants to do ) and then switch your UI into remote mode .
Concept Six : Click Strip ( directly above of the editor )
All types referenced by the currently selected type are displayed in the strip , just click them to view the code file for that type .
Concept Seven : Ashes ( gray box )
On the right , the code files which have been selected in the past , along with summary stats indicating the amount of work done on each are listed .
Enter the first few letters of a code file into the Filter box at the top to jump to an entry .
Concept Eight : Floating Run Button
Vertically centered to the right of the method in which the caret is currently positioned is the floating run button .
It builds and runs the application ( just like F5 ) .
Concept Nine : Floating Search and Replace
The giant magnifying glass at the top corner of the editor indicates that the poor man ’s refactoring tool is within easy reach .
Yes it does all the standard search and replace stuff .
Concept Ten : Greenboard
The Greenboard is a popup window displayed when the floating run button is clicked .
Each assembly to be built is accompanied by a bar graph , proportionally sized based on the amount of source in the assembly .
Error messages are collected at the bottom of the board .
If an assembly fails to build , the Greenboard automatically closes and the Error Trap is displayed .
Concept Eleven : Error Trap
The ErrorTrap appears when compilation fails .
It makes for clear , quick identification of errors .

In this second part of the Visual Studio 2010 Concept IDE article , we address debugging .
Before we get started , let ’s first use the shuttering system in the Concept IDE to make code king .
Here all shutters have been collapsed , maximizing the code editor :
Concept Twelve : Visual Breakpoint Conditions
Breakpoint conditions can now be entered directly into the editor , just click the small red arrow labeled “ Condition ” to slide out a panel below the breakpoint and code away .
Conditions are persistent , that is , as long as the line of source where the breakpoint is defined exists , the condition for that line is remembered thereafter .
Concept Thirteen : Stepper
Hovering over the all - important line of code currently executing is the Stepper .
This little navigator makes it easy to Step Into , Step Over or Step Out .
It also enumerates the various property getters poised for resolution as of the current line .
You can easily skip over these on your way into the method of interest , or step into them by clicking in the Stepper .
Getters which contain anything beyond a simple return of a field value are marked with a special icon .
These generated diagrams form a map of the running application .
See which objects are instantiated , which methods have been called and easily inspect object values .
Minis , and the standards by which they are generated are discussed in detail here .
Concept Fifteen : Visual Stack
Minis give us the opportunity to present the stack as a diagram , with certain methods , property getters / setters or interface implementations “ lit up ” to show that they are currently receiving attention from the CPU .
Click anywhere in the Mini and the source for that member is displayed in the Code Editor .
Create Watch values by dragging from the Mini to the Watch window .
Concept Sixteen : Object Dash
Click the small orange square at the top left of a Mini to display the Object Dash .
This small watch window defaults to the field values in the object , but can be customized with code - based watches .
The default values can be quickly removed by clicking the checkboxes on the left .
Once you customize an Object Dash , those customizations are remembered per type .
Object Dashes can also be launched from anywhere in the Debug UI where an object reference is displayed ( for example the Call Stack , the Watch window , or the Code Editor itself ) by placing your mouse over the reference and clicking Ctrl - Shift - O .
Concept Seventeen : LiveObjects
When the debugger hits a breakpoint , use the LiveObjects panel to view the currently existing objects .
Concept Eighteen : The Barge
The Barge is a list of all objects which have been garbage collected , including the amount of memory reclaimed .
Reduce the noise in this list by right - clicking and filtering out delegates , attributes , collections or the descendants of any type .
Concept Nineteen : Origins
It ’s definitely great to know which objects currently exist ( LiveObjects ) or have existed ( the Barge ) .
When the object counts look wrong and you need to know the methods where these objects were created , check the Origins panel .
Double - click the method to display the source in the code editor .
Concept Twenty : Trax
From the moment you hit the floating run button , to the moment you shut down the application , the lines of code executed and the amount of CPU time consumed by each is tracked .
Use the Trax Summary to locate the most time intensive or noisy methods .
Select a method in the Summary and the SubTracker will show all time - intensive calls in that method .
Click one of these calls in the SubTracker or the “ bullet ” in the Code Editor to continue drilling down .
Trax also highlights each line of source that executed during the last run , making it easy to differentiate which lines executed from those lines which did not .
Your Turn
And that ’s it .
What about the Visual Forms Designer , Refactoring , UML , Tests , and that AI Buddy who codes everything for me ?
Wo n’t these gizmos be in there by 2010 ?
Well , that ’s where you come in .
Suggest ways of bringing this UI forward even further , and we will incorporate the best in revisions of this article !
The Concepts Behind The Concept IDE
Edward R. Tuft - esque ideas in this IDE are :
The “ look ” of this IDE was inspired by the works of Edward R. Tufte .
The editing area is white , drawing your attention to the focus of your work : the code .
Color coding on the left divides the major areas , and clearly identifies them in the Head when they are selected ( i.e. when the giant arrow is clicked . )
Any name created by you is displayed in black .
Any name which is part of the IDE is deemphasized .
“ Hard ” separator lines have been avoided .
Alan Cooper - esque ideas in this IDE are :
Solid - State
Everything is saved , including the undo stacks of all code files , the last type selected , the ashes list , etc .
Whether you unplug your computer from the wall , or orchestrate a nice agreeable Start | Turn
Off sequence , the IDE looks exactly the same the next time you launch it .
Sovereign App
Designed to be maximized and used for hours at a time , this UI has understated controls and provides no distracting 3 - D effects , save hot controls , which draw in an XP style when the mouse is over them .
Affordance is provided through cursor hinting and hot control effects ; expert users can “ discover ” functions as they go .
Putting Will Over Might
The jillion things a developer might want to do in the IDE have been relegated to dialogs and the menu .
The few things that a developer will definitely need to do every day ( or every minute ) have been placed front center .
Links
you manage to quash the cultivation of one illegal crop ( opium poppies ) , and the farmers just switch to another ( cannabis ) :
Late on an October afternoon , Muhammad Ayud , 30 , a kindly sharecropper , was finishing a day of work at the three - acre parcel he farms here in this poor village just outside the town of Balkh .
His plot was covered by a forest of cannabis plants , some more than nine feet tall .
“ This is nothing , ” he said , gesturing toward the towering plants .
“ If you give it real fertilizer , you ’d see how tall it grows ! ” - nytimes
man , I want to be a kindly sharecropper with cannabis plants so gargantuan you have to use a cherrypicker to get at the topmost parts , or a chainsaw to cut them down .
‘ Did you just use the word smart ? ’
Memorable moments from Tuesday 's presidential debate
They bickered on who should appoint the next Supreme Court justice , their stances on health care and even brought each other ’s families into the fray .
NEW JAMAICA DOCUMENTARY WITH A TWIST | 45 min. wide screen , digital dolby surround sound
Sex Tourism , a product of slavery , is not new to the Caribbean VIEW TRAILER CAST / CREW PHOTO ALBUM PURCHASE DVD
Three flights are due into Montego Bay , one from Toronto , one from Fort Lauderdale , the other from London .
When white women flock to Jamaica for a little fun in the sun , the R&R they 're often looking for is not " Rest and Relaxation " but to " Rent a Rasta " according to director J. Michael Seyfert .
His eye - opening expose ' of the same name sheds light on a barely acknowledged form of sex tourism , namely , white women who visit the Caribbean Islands to get their groove back with the help of black locals .
This documentary claims that , each year , as many as 80,000 females from a variety of relatively - wealthy Western nations descend on Jamaica alone .
*********
In sight and sound , RENT a RASTA portrays the many fronts in which Babylon fights the Movement of Rastafari in Jamaica .
How slavery continues until this very day .
When Babylon " discovered " the " New World " , the original inhabitants were either killed or ghetto- ized while millions of Africans were taken from their homes to work as slaves on the land that was stolen by their slave masters .
The whole western " Judeo - Christian " " Civilization " is built on the slave trade and colonialization .
Although everything is officially abolished many years ago , the practice continues until this very day .
Who feels it , knows it , as they say .
In Jamaica , they know it .
It was there , that the Movement of Rastafari was born with the crowning in Ethiopia of Ras Tafari Makonnen as Haile Selassie the 1st , the 225th descendant of King Solomon .
There was the true Judeo - Christian Civilization !
Ever since it 's birth , the Movement has been the target of Babylon System .
Persecution , disinformation , condemnation , infiltration , corruption , every trick in the book is used against this group .
RENT a RASTA deals directly with Babylon 's down - pressing of Jamaican people and Rastafarians in particular .
The raw picture of what Babylon is really doing becomes clear .
The term itself refers to a practice of sex - slavery : hordes of tourists flood the island in search for paid sex with black dread locked men .
The practice is shown in the video , people openly talk about it .
In the Rastaman 's Camp , there 's a completely different picture .
Several Rastas are interviewed as they speak about the suffering , about being in Babylon .
The contrast in sight and sound is shockingly clear .
While the narrator does his best to make sense out of the con-fusion shown in sight and sound , the video proofs without the shadow of a doubt just how abominable and evil Babylon really is .
While the real Rastas are suffering , telling the people to stop sinning and live a righteous life , Babylon has her own ( per)version of Rastafari which makes some others filthy rich .
Yah , watch t'is flim and try to understand the issues .
*********
Perhaps most telling is the desperate summation of a suffering black woman seen begging for an end to the Jamaican people 's neverending cycle of poverty .
She wants , " the white world to come give us our deliverance , because it was them who take us out of our land and carry us here . "
Viewed in this light , Rent a Rasta is a clarion call which establishes that sex tourism is not merely the harmless indulgence of horny white women gone wild , but a burgeoning trend which continues to wreak havoc on a Caribbean culture and family structure already in crisis .

Not condoned Wayne Cummings , president of the Negril Chamber of Commerce and first vice president of the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association ( JHTA ) , told the Sunday Herald that sex tourism is not condoned by the organisations that he represents .
He pointed out that although many visitors to exotic locations such as Jamaica often arrive with hope of finding an “ escort ” , the country has made efforts to move away from this image .
“ It still happens , but we categorise it as tourist harassment .
We invite tourists here for sun , sea , sand and Jamaican hospitality , which does not necessarily include sexual favours , ” said Cummings .
He added that sex tourism brought with it many negative implications such as the spread of infectious diseases and a tarnished national image .
“ Those persons in the sex tourism industry are better served by getting training and incorporate themselves into legitimate tourism jobs , ” he said .
Cummings indicated that tourism interests in the resort towns have better working relationships with the police , and this has prevented the problem from being an overt one .
He also indicated that tourism interests have also begun to address the problem through education .
Cummings also spoke to the issue of staff training at the Sandals hotel chain to ensure that internal and external interaction does not become or appear untoward .

It 's a ' ' Stella moment ' ' on the beach .
A handsome young Jamaican with bulging pectorals strides up to three middle - aged women strolling barefoot by the sea .
His opening gambit is an invitation to ride on his glass - bottom boat .
Then the real business : '' Yes mon , my friend and I noticed you last night .
You were wearing sneakers , '' he says to one .
'' Oh yeah ? ''
'' We said , ' Those are oldies but goldies ! ' '' he continues .
'' How dare you ! ''
The woman 's brassy American accent is a marked contrast to the melodious Jamaican one .
'' Did n't your mother teach you how to talk to ladies ?
' Oldies ? ' ''
The women storm off past a fence that cordons off their all - inclusive resort , leaving their suitor behind .
David Patrick , about 30 , scratches an ear ruefully but takes the rejection in stride .
'' Women been coming in droves since that movie , '' he says .
He 's talking about How Stella Got Her Groove Back , the movie about a woman who goes to Jamaica and falls in love with a man half her age and rediscovers her enthusiasm for life .
'' It 's not just Americans , '' Patrick says .
'' English women , Germans , Swiss - they all say the same thing :
That they 've come to get their groove back . ''
The movie was based on a book by Terry McMillan who said she kept running into women who bought tickets to Jamaica after Stella became a bestseller in 1996 .
The movie , starring Angela Bassett as Stella and Taye Diggs as her lover Winston , appears to have had even more of an effect .
'' Jamaica could n't have paid for the publicity we 're getting , '' says photographer Ken Ramsay , referring to scenes that linger on white - sand beaches , turquoise and emerald waters , cloudless skies and exotic flowers .
Jamaica 's Tourist Board has screened the film for U.S. travel agents and aired TV spots promoting the island as a lovers ' getaway .
Mark Adkins , a manager at the public relations agency Adkins - Rome Entertainment and Marketing in Los Angeles , describes an enthusiastic response , with ''a lot of women ... saying they wanted to go to Jamaica to find their Winston . ''
'' We 're seeing groups of ladies coming together that look like the type Terry McMillan was writing about - more single ladies , '' says hotel manager Brian Sang .
Sang , executive manager of the Jamaica Grande resort at Ocho Rios on the island 's north coast , says one visitor sent him a poem saying she and her girlfriends were '' coming to get their groove back . ''
A new lexicon has grown around the movie .
'' I 've heard tourists say things like , ' There 's a Stella thing going on here , '' ' Sang says .

Is there prostitution in Negril ?
Yes .
Although it is not legal .
You will see many men and women looking to show you love .
Many beautiful women will surround single men at the clubs , and single women will receive the same treatment from the local men .
If you 're single , it will be assumed that you 're on the island seeking a ' likkle love beneat ' de palms . '
Any remonstration to the contrary will likely be met with wearying attempts to get you to change your mind .
Black women can expect to hear a ' roots ' trip .
If you go along with the flirting , do n't expect a Jamaican man to understand if you 've no intent of going all the way .
Your innocent acceptance will be taken as a sign of acquiescence .
The Jamaican male has a fragile ego and is likely to react strongly to feeling like a fool .
Do n't beat about the bush for fear of hurting the man 's feelings .
Many foreign women welcome these advances , as evidenced by the proliferation of ' rent - a- Rastas ' - semiprofessional good - time guys , or gigolos - on the arms of North American and European women .
Most often , the man is excited more by your economic clout than your looks - a foreign catch brings status and the possibility for wheedling some cash .
You 'll be the moneybags in any romantic encounter .
Posted by Jamaica Good Time Atmosfæren er fremdeles avslappet ogtilbakelent , turistlivet lever side om side med lokallivet .
Du kommer nærmere lokalbefolkningen her enn ihotellpalassenes Montego Bay og turistskipenes Ocho Rios .
Sammenlignet med disse andre turiststedene er dette detvirkelige Jamaica hvor lokalbefolkningen er like forundrethver gang du avslår en blås .
Og det skal du .
Her er det ikkesigaretter det er snakk om , ikke en gang sigarer .
Politiethar ikke lenger noe slapt forhold til narkotikabruk .
Barerastaene kan blåse i vei med en slags religiøsvelsignelse .
La gå at du ikke lenger kan vandrekilometer på kilometer uten å snuble i annen manns fotspor , at forlokkende skilt strekker sine fangarmer ut frapalmeskyggene , at du stadig oppvartes av menn og kvinner medpssst ' ende tilbud .
Gi fra deg noen ord og et smil og etbestemt nei , så bryr de seg ikke om å slite seg innpåvidere .
Respect man , respect .
La gå at ingen synes ådanse på de legendariske reggaekonsertene i strandkanten , atde mest tjener som fremvisning av prostituerte i allevektklasser og begge kjønn .
Og at Negril har et visst ryktesom trekker til seg hvite kvinner ute etter et svarteventyr .
Rent - a - rasta heter det her .

In search of the Big Bamboo According to some published reports , as many as 80,000 women from America and Europe travel every year to the Caribbean island of Jamaica to have uncomplicated sex with available " rastatutes " .
Naturally , all this scandal makes the real Rastas livid .
Their history is long and their hardships many , yet these beach - cruising playboys give their religion ( not to mention their lifestyle ) a bad reputation .
Director J. Michael Seyfert is out to change all that .
He wants to uncover this unseemly practice and prove that the men exchanging copulation for cash have very little connection to the Rastafari faith .
Instead , they are what you would call Rent - a - Rasta — ersatz imitations of the real deal .
Beginning as a supposed exposé of the sex - for - sale industry in Jamaica ( think How Stella Got Her Groove Back without famous authors or actresses ) but quickly devolving into an overview of the Rastafari religion .
Inside are four or five really engaging stories — the history of slavery in the West Indies , the current reparations and repatriation movement , the story of Haile Selassie and his deification , the current socio- economic climate in the Caribbean , and the notion that fat , older , or otherwise unattractive females worldwide come to this area for the sole purpose of getting their whore on .
We are intrigued by the notion of such scandalous trysts , well aware that author Terry McMillan ( who first uncovered this female version of the mid-life crisis ) is currently dragging her boy - toy through a messy , highly - publicized divorce , and Seyfert introduces us to some wonderfully caddish characters .
We hear impassioned pleas from regular followers , as well as the frequent dismissal of " false Rastas . "
Important names in the religion are given their moment of historical significance , and we even witness a good - natured debate among a group of men over who is the true savior — Jesus or Haile Selassie .
Would it have been better to discuss Rastafari , its various factions , its divided views on repatriation , and the basic tenets of its belief system , and leave the rest alone ?
Why not address the dreads , the strict diet and leisure mandates ( pot = OK ; alcohol and tobacco ?
No way ) , and the varying influences on the rules and regulations .
The idea that smoking " ganja " came from Hindus after all , and many of the religions more stringent codes were derived from a combination of Christianity , Islam , and Judaism .
We hear how the Rastas refer to themselves as " Jews " ( in a more metaphysical sense ) and how people who claim to be Jewish are , in their mind , less than devout .
They consider such an ethnic term the same as referring to someone as girl - ish , or child - ish — like a girl or child , but in fact not really one at all .
Such confrontational comments add a refreshing bit of energy .
Such confrontational comments add a refreshing bit of energy .
Seyfert avoids many of the island 's more picturesque elements ( beaches , waterfalls , mountains ) to focus on Rasta temples and up - close compositions .
Consisting mostly of fabulously expressive faces , we feel both the happiness and the hardship beaming from every single person interviewed .
The 1.85:1 non-anamorphic letterboxed image is crisp and clear , the product of an excellent digital camera creation .
There is no flaring or bleeding , and the amount of detail is delightful .
The soundtrack , featuring wonderfully atmospheric dub and reggae is presented in a Dolby Digital Stereo Surround mix that is bass - heavy and mostly midrange .

Contributing Writer , [ GAS ]
You must be wondering how you entered a parallel universe in which a [ GAS ] headline can include the words “ Microsoft ” , “ browser ” , and “ secure ” — without the words “ not ” , “ disaster ” , or “ joke ” .
And given the history of security flaws in Internet Explorer over the years , the folks at Redmond need to put a whole lot of money where their mouth is when they claim to be developing a browser that implements a better security model than Firefox , Google Chrome , or even OP ( PDF ) .
But that ’s exactly the claim of a team at Microsoft Research , where they ’ve developed a prototype and written a paper ( PDF ) about a proposed web browser they call “ Gazelle . ”
Both Chrome and OP have already explored the idea of achieving greater security and reliability by creating separate processes to manage different concerns within the browser .
Gazelle uses the same idea , but draws the lines between processes a bit differently .
In Gazelle , the Browser Kernel ( BK ) manages all direct access to the operating system and the network .
Individual page - rendering processes may only access these resources indirectly , via an API through the BK .
Gazelle also strictly enforces process separation along same - origin policy ( SOP ) lines .
If you have a web page that embeds an iframe that ’s sourced from a different domain , for example , Google Chrome hosts that entire page including the iframe within the same process .
In Gazelle , each domain - host - protocol source gets its own process .
The process for the iframe renders the display for the area that it occupies as a “ tenant ” , but has no access to any part of the page outside that area .
The main page , or “ landlord ” , manages the dimensions of the iframe , but has no access to the content within it .
Neither process manipulates the screen directly — that ’s relegated to the BK .
Gazelle ’s SOP rules are also more strict than those of existing browsers .
Subdomains are not considered the same origin as their parent domain — so a script hosted at scripts .
mydomain.com would not have access to elements of a page hosted at mydomain.com , for instance .
However , a path ( e.g. , mydomain.com / scripts ) would still be considered part of the same origin .
Unlike the OP browser , Gazelle does not separate JavaScript , CSS , and HTML handling into separate processes .
Microsoft researchers feel that such a separation adds no real security benefit , while adding a significant interprocess communication overhead .
So Gazelle combines everything required to render content from a single source within a sandboxed process .
That process is paired with a sandboxed instance of browser plugins to form what is called a “ principal ” .
Principals can communicate with the BK and with each other , but only through the defined API .
Plugins operate under the same source restrictions as web content , so they only have access to page content that comes from the same origin as the plugins themselves .
The team has put quite a lot of thought into how to handle user - generated events as well .
In general , a mouse click for example gets forwarded to the principal in charge of the area occupying that screen real estate .
Topmost window wins , and every principal ’s assigned area must be opaque — eliminating many types of clickjacking vulnerabilities .
The prototype version of the browser reportedly works reasonably well — the team has identified many areas for improvement , but it displayed 19 out of the top 20 Alexa - ranked sites without any issues .
Performance will need work — which should n’t be a surprise given the design of the prototype : the BK is written in C# , and the browser instance is a Trident WebControl wrapped in an “ interposition layer ” of code that prevents the WebControl from doing anything directly with the system or the network .
We can only hope , should Gazelle become a production browser , that Microsoft would abandon Trident in favor of a more standard and better - performing rendering engine .

MARAJ , Lebanon 
For 25 years ,
Ali al - Jarrah managed to live on both sides of the bitterest divide running through this region .
To friends and neighbors , he was an earnest supporter of the Palestinian cause , an affable , white - haired family man who worked as an administrator at a nearby school .
To Israel , he appears to have been a valued spy , sending reports and taking clandestine photographs of Palestinian groups and Hezbollah since 1983 .
Now he sits in a Lebanese prison cell , accused by the authorities of betraying his country to an enemy state .
Months after his arrest , his friends and former colleagues are still in shock over the extent of his deceptions : the carefully disguised trips abroad , the unexplained cash , the secret second wife .
Lebanese investigators say he has confessed to a career of espionage spectacular in its scope and longevity , a real - life John le Carré novel .
Many intelligence agents are said to operate in the civil chaos of Lebanon , but Mr. Jarrah ’s arrest has shed a rare light onto a world of spying and subversion that usually persists in secret .

Congress Mauls Marketing
Big banks come under increasing pressure to clamp down on perks and marketing .
This impacts the business of sports , with Casey Wasserman , Wasserman Media Group and CNBC 's Darren Rovell .
To win this struggle to reveal the truth we need to know where we are in terms of the 8 Stages of the evolution of our movement so we can plan and carry out more effective social action .
In January 2002 , when we first marched to demand a Congressional Investigation of 9 - 11 , we passed out worksheets , which mapped out the Eight Stages of Social Movements ( chart is on page 130 of Global Outlook ) , and the Effective and Ineffective Roles that activists play ( page 132 ) , pointing out that we were at
Stage One - Alerting the public that a Critical Social Problem Exists .
Bill Moyer , author of Doing Democracy The MAP Model for Organizing Social Movements , a strategist for Martin Luther King , Jr. who had been organizing and empowering activists for forty years , was with us .
He taught that all social movements have been about the struggle between power - holders and the rest of us , that societal myths allow power - holders to maintain their position , and that exposing their secret violation of those myths , ideals , values is a catalyst for social change .
All social change , from the abolition of slavery , the right to vote for African Americans and women , the growing environmental movement has helped empower people and pulled other movements forward .
When movements succeed , however , there is backlash , power - holders try to undermine social gains .
This phenomena is at the core of 9/11 , an act of fear perpetrated by a criminal elite who feared losing power .
Terrorism and war are classic methods to expand state power .
9/11 was used to roll back civil liberties globally , justify the construction of a police state to protect the few against the majority who oppose government and corporate policies , and to frighten the world into silence and submission .
As Aung Sung Suu Kyi wrote :
" It is not power that corrupts , but fear -- fear of losing power and fear of the scourge of those who wield it . "
The biggest societal myth of all is that power - holders are all powerful , wise , and the rest of us - stupid , powerless , atomized , weak , vulnerable , unable to change our situation .
In a climate of fear , power - holders prevail .
When the supporting myths are shattered , and people find the courage to oppose and expose tyranny , tyrants fall , institutions fail , policies can change to allow genuine self - governance .
The last four and a half years the media and government have relentlessly threatened the American people and the world with pending terrorist attacks , and unending war .
The attempts of the Bush Administration to crush any genuine investigation , the dubious joint Senate House Intelligence Oversight Committee ’s Official Inquiry into “ the failure of the intelligence agencies to prevent the attacks , the eventual announcement of the creation of a ' Cover - up Commission ' to be run by Henry Kissinger ( which was like waving a red flag and saying “ We did it ! ” ) gave the critics of the official story credibility .
Stage Two – Prove Failure of Official Institutions
In 2004 , books were written , films were made ; citizens ’ organized International Inquiries , hearings , mock Grand Jury trials .
citizens ’ presented evidence , and provided analyses of the September 11th attacks that were more substantiated than the ' conspiracy theory ’ the government and press used to sell the Patriot Act , war , the construction of ' Homeland Security ' and the expansion and reorganization of the military and intelligence agencies .
An Emergency ' Truth ' Convergence held in DC on the anniversary of the 9/11 report and the Downing Street Memo , brought together many movements , all struggling against press censorship of their issues .
A pattern became discernible .
Stage Three - Ripening Conditions
Stage
Three occurs when recognition of the problem and victims grow and 20 to 30 % oppose policies .
This has happened more than once in the 9/11 Truth Movement , when the victims ’ families forced the creation of The 9/11 Commission , and again when the victims ’ of the deadly toxic dust emanating from the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings drew attention to the deadly lies about the safety of air quality at Ground Zero which claimed more lives than the collapses .
The government would like people to be content with the Report , the recommendations of the 9 - 11 Commission , but these large myths have been challenged on many fronts .
Stage Four - Trigger Event
Passage of the Patriot Act , violations of fundamental constitutional rights , the surfacing of damning evidence of doctored intelligence , and official lies in the mainstream press has sparked a wave of new groups , websites , protests , actions across the country .
Fahrenheit 9-11 surfaced the damning footage of Bush ’s non-response to news of the terrorist attacks and the Bush - bin Ladin family ties to a wider audience , the tip of the 9/11 Truth iceberg .
Resolutions appeared to demand a repeal of the Patriot Act .
The desire to rid the country of the Bush Regime drew a tremendous amount of energy .
Large numbers protested at the New York Republican Convention , and worked to get out the vote for the 2004 Presidential election .
The 2nd stolen election created a greater movement for ' real ' election reform , and greater awareness of the ability of the press to censor vital information surrounding the myth that America is a ' legitimate democracy . '
Questioning 9/11 broke the mainstream press baricade .
Stage Five - Perception of Failure
Stage Six - Majority Public Opinion
Movements can splinter , but when they continue to grow they reach Majority Public Opinion .
The action generally moves off the streets into schools , churches , civic groups , theater , music .
Sometimes massive demonstrations are called and huge numbers come together under umbrella issues .
There is an effort underway to conduct a Zogby Poll to determine exactly what most people think about 9/11 at this moment in time .
[ Results of that poll show the public is divided on 9 - 11 with half believing the official story and the other half believing that there has been a cover - up - and half unaware of the most basic facts about 9 - 11 - such as the inexplicable collapse of Building # 7 which was omitted entirely from the official Report .
This places the 9 - 11 Truth Movement squarely in Stage Four . ]
Certainly the credibility to the Bush regime is at an all - time low .
Barrie Zwicker discovered while polling audiences that people ’s understanding of 9 - 11 often goes through stages , depending on their ability to overcome fear and examine the information .
9/11 challenges not only a person 's view of the world , but forces one to ask themselves a much deeper question “ Who am I ? ”
Unscientific polls , such as a recent poll on CNN after Charlie Sheen publicly questioned the official story showed up to 84 % of the public believe that there has been a cover - up of the truth .
Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney ’s brave stance on 9 - 11 cost her one election .
Her courage and persistence got her re-elected to elicit testimony during the Congressional Black Annual Legislative Conference in DC September 2005 on “ The 9/11 Omission : What the Commission Got Wrong . ”
Placing the problem on the political agenda earned McKinney attacks from the press and the Democratic leadership .
She also entered the taboo area of exposing how the vote was stolen in a new award winning film - American Blackout , by Guerrilla News Network .
For any social movement to succeed , the public must be convinced , at least three times to overcome their fears
1st - To recognize the problem .
2nd- To oppose current conditions and policies .
3rd -
To want and no longer fear alternatives .
At Stanford University on April 21 , 2006 , the President had to change his plans because over a thousand protesters successfully blocked his visit to the Hoover Institute .
He did n’t dare show his face ; he is more frightened of the citizens than they are of him .
The tide has turned .
More people are involved in Social Movements than ever before , although they are spread widely through the 9/11 truth , anti-war , anti-corporate , global - justice , immigrant rights , voting reform , electoral reform , college not combat , environmental , labor , human rights , movements , whose goals are inextricably linked .
Pressuring power - holders on their entrenched positions are a new crop of candidates raising taboo topics , such as 9/11 , demanding impeachment , and shifting the budget out of a “ kill and control war economy . ”
While more and more people are coming to question 9/11 , thanks to the relentless work of the movement , filmmakers , and the addition of voices such as theologian , David Ray Griffin , and BYU ’s Steven Jones , the attacks on the movement are taking the form of media ' hit pieces ' and television and movie productions lavishly attempting to sell the official line .
Bush has said , “ You can fool some of the people all the time , and those are the ones we need to concentrate on . ”
However , Hurricane Katrina blew off what remained of his credibility as the devastating images of flood victims and Bush ’s behavior , photo ops and words revealed his capacity to tell brazen falsehoods .
Upcoming conferences , books , films , demonstrations , the participation of people at every level of society in the movement puts more and more pressure on power - holders and support for change of policies and power - holders .
Stage 7 - Success
The invincibility of the most dangerous empire the planet has ever seen is crumbling quickly before our eyes .
We are on the cusp of Stage 7 where a large majority oppose current policies and no longer fear alternatives .
Power - holders are switching positions and manuevering to control damage .
There will be new laws , a change in Congress , and in the visible government leaders .
How far we can affect change and how much backlash there will be to what successes we achieve is unknown .
What will replace the war - monger culture is dependent on which story people choose to believe , and how actively they push for more than cosmetic reform .
Stage 8 - Continuation
Continuation , the cycle and stages repeat in the evolution of human society .
A handful of 9 - 11 Truth Activists can help nudge the trajectory of history off the adolescent suicidal path that we have been on .
To make the major paradigm shift from a “ dominating paradigm of Fear and Violence ” to a mature , responsible “ emerging peaceful paradigm ” demands the engagement and involvement of multitudes of people .
Individually and collectively , we need to recognize that power resides in all of us .
A friend of mine , Norie Huddle , says “ Together we can do what no one of us could do alone . ” and suggested rules for this emerging paradigm which she dubbed “ The Best Game on Earth :
- Speak the truth .
- Acknowledge the truth when others speak it .
- Come from love and respect .
- Leave the trail better than you found it .
- Expect miracles .
- Do what gives you joy and create joy in what you do .
- Be generous with who you are and what you have .
- Be a good friend and teammate .
- Clean up your messes , learn the lessons and move on .
- If you have an idea for how to improve The Game , share it !
Parts of the country are ahead of others in seeing through the prevalent societal myths .
David Ray Griffin outlined 9 specific 9/11 myths in his recent talks in the Bay Area .
" OUT LOUD - 9-11 AN INSIDE JOB ? " was a headline in the San Francisco Chronicle beneath a photo of the wreckage of the World Trade Center and a decent article and photo of David Ray Griffin .
[ A cover story in the North Bay Bohemian ( appeared 6/14/06 ) and on Le Monde Diplomatique ( July 2006 ) . ]
Europe and Asia have seen the official story debunked on primetime television .
There are hopes for a real international investigation into 9/11 .
[ Webster Tarpley and Jimmy Walter has been lobbying for a genuine International Investigation into 9/11 , and have sparked some interest in a number of countries who are beginning to challenge the official narrative on their primetime television shows and on the front pages of newspapers . ]
It is our responsibility , as Americans , to rein in our government ; regime change ( impeachment ) should begin at home .
As activists we should include 9/11 in the Impeachment Resolutions .
If your ' Congress critter ' wo n’t touch impeachment , oust them , even if you have to run for office yourself , because no one else will do it .
[ In Chicago , there were quite a few 9 - 11 Truth candidates , many candidates support our position , even though they are not headlining it as their issue . ]
P.S. More on Stage Four - Take - Off
About Stage Four ...
Generally social movements surprise and shock everyone when they suddenly burst upon the stage after being ignored by the media for years or decades .
A TRIGGER event , will suddenly help the public see that “ There is a Problem . ”
The public responds with passion , demanding an explanation from Powerholders , and ready to learn more from the Movement .
Activists can wear different hats , and at various stages some hats are more visible and needed than others .
During Stage Four - Citizens & Rebels take the stage .
It is a time for non-violent actions which can be replicated across the country - rallies , marches , boycotts , strikes , sit-ins , civil disobedience .
Processes that create a public social crisis and places the issue on the agenda .
This requires thousands of people across the country taking action and forming new groups .
Here are the basic goals and pitfalls / dangers we should be aware of now , according to Bill Moyer :
Goals Create new nationwide grassroots - based social movement
Put powerholders ’ actual policies in public spotlight & on the agenda
Create a public platform from which the movement can educate the public
Create public dissonance by showing 2 distinct views of reality - the movements ’ and the powerholders ’
Win public sympathy and majority public opinion
Become recognized as legitimate opposition .

What is the Ig Nobel Prize and who won it this year ?
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- A British multiple sclerosis sufferer is attempting to clarify the law on assisted suicide , an option she has said she wants if her pain becomes unbearable .
Multiple sclerosis sufferer Debbie Purdy , pictured with husband Omar Puente in October 2008 .
Debbie Purdy , 45 , was at the Court of Appeal in London Tuesday to challenge an October judgment from the High Court , which refused to clarify the law .
Purdy suffers from primary progressive multiple sclerosis , in which symptoms become progressively worse over time .
She has said she wants the option to travel abroad to have an assisted death should her suffering become unbearable .
Under Britain 's current law , Purdy 's husband , Omar Puente , could face 14 years in prison if he accompanies her to a country , such as Switzerland , where assisted suicide is legal .
Purdy 's case had asked the High Court judges to tell her at what point her husband would be breaking the law if she committed suicide with his help .
" If Omar sits with me on the plane to Switzerland he is breaking the law , even if I make the arrangements myself , " Purdy said ahead of Tuesday 's appeal .
" What I , and everybody else , do n't know is the criteria on which the authorities judge whether it is in the public interest to prosecute Omar .
I think we are entitled to know this information . "
Her appeal will be heard at the court in London on Tuesday and Wednesday .
Vital Signs Each month CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta brings viewers health stories from around the world .

Purdy says that if her case is not resolved , she may decide to go alone to a clinic while she is still able to on her own .
She says she would prefer making that journey much later , only once her condition deteriorates , so she can die with her husband by her side .
" It has become apparent through the support I have received during my case that this is no longer just about myself and Omar , but it 's about clarification of the law for all UK citizens who may be facing these decisions now , or want reassurance for the future , " Purdy said .
Dignity in Dying , a British charity that has worked on Purdy 's case , says it is important for the British government to distinguish between people who maliciously encourage suicide and those who accompany a loved one abroad to die .
" Ultimately we would like to see the law in the UK changed to allow terminally ill , suffering , mentally competent adults the safeguarded choice of an assisted death , so that people like Debbie do n't have to travel abroad for this compassionate assistance , " said Sarah Wootton , executive director of Dignity in Dying .
" While any change in the law is a matter for Parliament , we hope that the courts will at least clarify our existing law . "
Dignity in Dying campaigns to give terminally ill patients the option of an assisted death so they " would not be forced to contemplate dying before they are ready , " according to the group 's Web site .
Under current law , the 1961 Suicide Act , assisting a suicide is a crime punishable by up to 14 years imprisonment .
Anyone who aids , abets , counsels or procures the suicide of another , or an attempt by another to commit suicide , is liable .
A Ministry of Justice spokesman refused to comment specifically on Purdy 's case .
" The government believes that any change to the law in this area is an issue of individual conscience and a matter for Parliament to decide , rather than government policy , " said the spokesman , who asked not to be named in line with policy .
To date , no one who has accompanied a loved one to the Swiss clinic Dignitas has been prosecuted , but they have been questioned by police and threatened with prosecution , according to Dignity in Dying .

< OpenSearchDescription xmlns= " http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/ " xmlns:moz= " http://www.mozilla.org/2006/browser/search/ " > < ShortName > [ SNK ] </ ShortName > < Description > [ Search engine full name and summary ] </ Description > < InputEncoding > [ UTF - 8 ] </ InputEncoding > < Image width = " 16 " height = " 16 " type = " image/x-icon " >
[ https://example.com/favicon.ico]
</ Image > < Url type =" text / html " template= " [ searchURL ] "> < Param name= " [ key name ] " value= " {searchTerms} " /> <!-- other Params if you need them …
--> < Param name= " [ other key name ] " value= " [ parameter value ] " /> </ Url> < Url type=" application/x-suggestions+json " template= " [ suggestionURL ] " /> < moz :SearchForm > [ https://example.com/search] </moz:SearchForm > </ OpenSearchDescription >
ShortName A short name for the search engine .
It must be 16 or fewer characters of plain text , with no HTML or other markup .
Description A brief description of the search engine .
It must be 1024 or fewer characters of plain text , with no HTML or other markup .
InputEncoding
The character encoding to use when submitting input to the search engine .
Image URI of an icon for the search engine .
When possible , include a 16 × 16 image of type image / x- icon ( such as / favicon.ico ) and a 64×64 image of type image / jpeg or image / png .
The URI may also use the data : URI scheme .
( You can generate a data : URI from an icon file at The data : URI kitchen . )
< Image height = " 16 " width = " 16 " type= " image/x-icon " >
https://example.com/favicon.ico</Image> <!-- or -->
< Image height = " 16 " width = " 16 " >data:image/x-icon;base64 ,AAABAAEAEBAAA
… DAAA =</ Image >
Firefox caches the icon as a base64 data : URI ( search plug-ins are stored in the profile 's searchplugins / folder ) .
http : and https : URLs are converted to data : URIs when this is done .
Note :
For icons loaded remotely ( that is , from https :// URIs as opposed to data : URIs ) , Firefox will reject icons larger than 10 kilobytes .
Url Describes the URL or URLs to use for the search .
The template attribute indicates the base URL for the search query .
Firefox supports three URL types : type =" text / html " specifies the URL for the actual search query .
specifies the URL for the actual search query .
type=" application/x-suggestions+json " specifies the URL for fetching search suggestions .
In Firefox 63 onwards , type=" application / json " is accepted as an alias of this .
specifies the URL for fetching search suggestions .
In Firefox 63 onwards , is accepted as an alias of this .
type=" application / x-moz-keywordsearch " specifies the URL used when a keyword search is entered in the location bar .
This is supported only in Firefox .
For these URL types , you can use { searchTerms} to substitute the search terms entered by the user in the search bar or location bar .
Other supported dynamic search parameters are described in OpenSearch 1.1 parameters .
For search suggestions , the application / x- suggestions + json URL template is used to fetch a suggestion list in JSON format .
For details on how to implement search suggestion support on a server , see Supporting search suggestions in search plugins .
Param
The parameters that must be passed in along with the search query as key / value pairs .
When specifying values , you can use { searchTerms} to insert the search terms entered by the user in the search bar .
moz:SearchForm
The URL for the site 's search page for which the plugin .
This lets Firefox users visit the web site directly .
Note : Since this element is Firefox - specific , and not part of the OpenSearch specification , we use the moz : XML namespace prefix in the example above to ensure that other user agents that do n't support this element can safely ignore it .
Autodiscovery of search plugins
Web sites with search plugins can advertise them so Firefox users can easily install the plugins .
To support autodiscovery , add a < link > element for each plugin to the < head > of your web page :
< link rel= " search " type=" application/opensearchdescription+xml " title= " searchTitle " href= " pluginURL " >
Replace the bolded items as explained below :
searchTitle
The name of the search to perform , such as " Search MDC " or " Yahoo ! Search " .
This must match your plugin file 's < ShortName > .
pluginURL
The URL to the XML search plugin , so the browser can download it .
If your site offers multiple search plugins , you can support autodiscovery for them all .
For example :
< link rel= " search " type=" application/opensearchdescription+xml " title= " MySite : By Author " href = " http://example.com/mysiteauthor.xml " > < link rel= " search " type=" application/opensearchdescription+xml " title= " MySite : By Title " href = " http://example.com/mysitetitle.xml " >
This way , your site can offer plugins to search by author , or by title .
In Firefox , an icon change in the search box indicates there 's a provided search plugin .
( See image , the green plus sign . )
Thus if a search box is not shown in the user 's UI , they will receive no indication .
In general , behavior varies among browsers .
OpenSearch plugins can automatically update .
To support this , include an extra Url element with type = " application/opensearchdescription+xml " and rel= " self " .
The template attribute should be the URL of the OpenSearch document to automatically update to .
For example :
< Url type=" application/opensearchdescription+xml " rel= " self " template = " https://example.com/mysearchdescription.xml " />
Note :
At this time , At this time , addons.mozilla.org ( AMO ) does n't support automatic updating of OpenSearch plugins .
If you want to put your search plugin on AMO , remove the auto - updating feature before submitting it .
Troubleshooting Tips
If there is a mistake in your Search Plugin XML , you could run into errors when adding a discovered plugin .
If the error message is n't be helpful , the following tips could help you find the problem .
Your server should serve OpenSearch plugins using Content - Type : application/opensearchdescription+xml .
.
Be sure that your Search Plugin XML is well formed .
You can check by loading the file directly into Firefox .
Ampersands ( & ) in the template URL must be escaped as & , and tags must be closed with a trailing slash or matching end tag .
URL must be escaped as , and tags must be closed with a trailing slash or matching end tag .
The xmlns attribute is important — without it you could get the error message " Firefox could not download the search plugin " .
attribute is important — without it you could get the error message " Firefox could not download the search plugin " .
You must include a text / html URL — search plugins including only Atom or RSS URL types ( which is valid , but Firefox does n't support ) will also generate the " could not download the search plugin " error .
include a URL — search plugins including only Atom or RSS URL types ( which is valid , but Firefox does n't support ) will also generate the " could not download the search plugin " error .
Remotely fetched favicons must not be larger than 10KB ( see bug 361923 ) .
In addition , the search plugin service provides a logging mechanism that may be useful to plugin developers .
Use about : config to set the pref ' browser.search.log ' to true .
Then , logging information will appear in Firefox 's Error Console ( Tools 〉 Error Console ) when search plugins are added .

Controversial rules that could ban many agents are a step closer to approval .
Farmers fear they will have access to fewer pesticides if a new regulation package is passed .
Punchstock
The European Union ( EU ) is due next month to finally approve controversial legislation to tighten up pesticide rules .
The legislation has been three years in the making , with a steady watering down of the rules in response to claims that they will lower crop yields and raise food prices .
The European Parliament has now backed by an overwhelming majority a compromise package that will regulate the production and licensing of pesticides and incorporate a directive on their sustainable use .
Why was the new legislation needed ?
Under the existing system , which was introduced in 1991 , new pesticides are authorized by the European Commission .
Each member state then decides whether to approve their use in their own countries .
The new legislation aims make the approval of these compounds more uniform throughout Europe .
There was also growing public concern that the existing system lets through pesticides that endanger people 's health .
" We believe that in order to destroy fungi , insects and weeds , pesticides do not have to be so hazardous that they are carcinogenic , toxic to reproduction or have equally dangerous properties , " says Elliott Cannell , co-ordinator at the Pesticide Action Network in London .
" There must be safer alternatives . "
What will happen under the new rules ?
The new rules introduce criteria that the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) , which is accountable to the European Commission , will use to determine which substances are too hazardous to approve .
Under these criteria , substances classified as carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic to reproduction ; endocrine - disrupting ; persistent , bioaccumulative and toxic ; or very persistent and very bioaccumulative will , except in certain circumstances , be banned throughout Europe .
The EFSA will then draw up a list of approved pest - destroying ingredients that can used in crop-protection products .
Under the existing rules , pesticides are licensed for 10 years .
Under the new regulations , once these licenses come up for renewal , the products will be allowed to stay on the market only if their active ingredients are on the approved list .
The directive promotes the use of non-chemical pest - control methods , bans aerial crop spraying without specific authorization and curbs the use of pesticides in areas such as parks and playgrounds .
Member states will also have to adopt targets for reduced use of pesticides .
Why was the legislation so controversial ?
The new licensing rules are based on the hazardous properties of substances within the product rather than , as at present , an assessment of the risk to health and the environment posed by their application .
The crop-protection industry , led by its EU trade association the European Crop Protection Association ( ECPA ) in Brussels , claims that this approach is unscientific .
The lobby group initially said that the new rules would lead to the withdrawal of so many pesticides that crop yields will fall drastically , triggering big rises in food prices .
Sean Rickard , a senior lecturer at the Cranfield School of Management , Bedfordshire , England , predicted that , as a result of the legislation set out in an earlier draft , EU grain prices would double along with the price of potatoes and brassicas like spinach and cabbage .
A major sticking point during the negotiations over a compromise package was the concept of endocrine disruption , which was not defined in the initial draft .
The negotiators have opted to temporarily define it as products that show some evidence of carcinogenicity and toxicity for reproduction .
However , the European Commission must come up with a permanent and specific definition of the term within four years .
What do pesticides producers think of it now ?
Fears over yields and prices have lessened as the proposed legislation has been watered down .
The Swedish Chemicals Agency ( KEMI ) estimates that the compromise package will result in just 23 existing substances being banned , or around 5 % of the 500 currently approved .
Furthermore , most of these would not be excluded from the market until their approvals come up for renewal .
The ECPA had been fiercely opposed to the licensing rules but now believes that it can live with the legislation .
" We do n't like the legislation , particularly the regulation on approvals , but the compromise is now the best of a bad job , " says Euros Jones , the ECPA 's director of regulatory affairs .
" If there had to be more negotiations over the legislation we could end up with something even worse . "
What happens next ?
The licensing regulation and the new directive on sustainable use will almost certainly be approved next month by the Council of Ministers , representing the governments of the EU 's 27 member states .
The regulation would then start to be implemented next year while the directive would have to be incorporated into the national laws of all member states by 2011 .
Individual member states will then have to adopt National Action Plans to reduce the risks of pesticides and to eliminate their use .
The list of approved substances will have to be drawn up by EFSA on the basis of safety and other data provided mainly by the crop producers .
Environmental groups and many members of the European Parliament believe that the new regulation will lead to the eventual banning of many substances that are in use today .
They expect , for example , that the fungicide carbendazim — classified as carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic to reproduction — as well as metconazole and tebuconazole , also fungicides considered to be endocrine disrupting , will be withdrawn .
Some worry that public concerns will drive decisions , but the ECPA says this will not necessarily be the case .
" Once we enter the implementation phase of the process , we intend to make sure that the path that is followed is based on fact , not fear , " says Friedhelm Schmider , director - general of the ECPA .
