Renzi , Doolittle , and the “ DC Madam ”
Capitol Hill awash in corruption and criminality
By Tom Carter
2 May 2007
April was a not a good month for the Republican Party .
Two Congressional Republicans were forced to step down from their seats on powerful House committees amidst separate corruption and influence - peddling investigations — and may eventually lose their seats in Congress or go to jail — while the head of the US Agency for International Development , Randall Tobias , resigned from his post Monday after he was named as a client of a Washington DC call girl service .
While the mainstream media treats these affairs as largely isolated , abnormal incidents , a closer look at these scandals contributes to a portrait of truly rotten political superstructure , everywhere rife with corruption , nepotism , and lawlessness .
The crisis afflicting the middle layers of the Bush administration and the Republican Party reflects deepening political rifts and tensions presently wracking the entire American political establishment .
On Monday , Bush administration ’s foremost opponent of prostitution , Randall Tobias , resigned after he was named as a client of an alleged DC - area prostitution service , called variously the Pamela Martin Escort Service or Pamela Martin & Associates .
He admitted that he paid for massages at his condo , but denied paying for anything more .
Tobias , the head of the Agency for International Development and former vice - chairman of AT&T , has been known to refuse foreign aid to countries that do not do enough to crack down on prostitution .
In his capacity as Director of Foreign Assistance , Tobias was also known for promoting sexual abstinence , as opposed to condoms , as a means of combating HIV / AIDS .
The proprietress of the Pamela Martin service , Deborah Jeanne Palfrey , now popularly identified in the media as the “ DC Madam , ” has been indicted and awaits trial .
Several women have indicated that they will testify that they worked as prostitutes for Palfrey , and several men have come forward to admit to paying for sex through her organization .
Palfrey , in a curious effort to acquire defense witnesses , suddenly released to ABC News a list of former clients of her service that includes some 15,000 names !
She assumes , perhaps correctly , that those whom she identifies will insist that the $ 300 per hour services provided by her escorts were within the legal limits .
“ I sure as heck am not going to federal prison for one day , let alone four to eight years , because I ’m shy about bringing in the deputy secretary of whatever , not for a second , ” Palfrey said following a recent court appearance .
“ I ’ll bring every last one of them in if it ’s necessary . ”
One can only speculate as to who exactly is on this list , but given the somewhat nervous reaction of the press , it seems safe to assume that Tobias will not be the last to go .
According to the ABC News ’ web site , a preliminary review of the list of clients revealed “ a Bush administration economist , the head of a conservative think tank , a prominent CEO , several lobbyists , and a handful of military officials . ”
“ I believe there is something very , very rotten at the core of my circumstance , ” observed Palfrey , standing outside the courthouse Monday .
In 2005 , while on the House Natural Resources Committee , Representative Rick Renzi of Arizona concealed a $ 200,000 payment he received from James Sandlin , a former business partner , in apparent violation of House ethics rules .
The fact that Renzi concealed the payment raised suspicions that it was intended as compensation for a $ 4 million land deal Renzi helped close on Sandlin ’s behalf .
Renzi and Sandlin had jointly started a real - estate company in 2001 , Fountain Realty and Development ; Sandlin eventually bought Renzi ’s stake .
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that in exchange for a federal land swap deal approved by Congress , involving some of North America ’s largest untapped copper lodes in Arizona , Renzi asked Resolution Copper Company to buy land from Sandlin .
Resolution Copper refused to take part in the deal .
When Petrified Forest group offered to buy Sandlin ’s property for $ 4 million — 4 times what Sandlin paid for it in 2003 — Renzi dropped his support for the land swap deal with Resolution Copper .
On April 25 , the Wall Street Journal revealed that in the run-up to the November 2006 elections , US Attorney Paul K. Charlton was contacted by Renzi ’s chief of staff , Brian Murray , who asked about a US probe into the land deal .
Charlton considered this improper , and subsequently contacted the Justice Department .
Charlton was among the eight federal prosecutors fired six weeks later .
Renzi has denied that he will resign , even as both the Republican and Democratic parties are lining up candidates to run in a special election should his seat be vacated .
Renzi did , however , resign from all three of his committee posts , which included seats on the powerful House Intelligence Committee , the House Natural Resources Committee and the House Financial Services Committee .
The ongoing investigations into the activities of Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff are revealing an elaborate web of influence - peddling , bribery , and corruption involving far - right Christian and Zionist allies of the Republican Party , and have already resulted in criminal convictions for two Republican representatives — Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham of California and Bob Ney of Ohio — as well as Abramoff himself , who is now cooperating with federal prosecutors .
California Representative John Doolittle is currently under scrutiny for inserting a total of $ 37 million into various defense spending bills while he was on the House Appropriations Committee that went to a firm associated with Brent Wilkes , a Pentagon contractor who is accused of providing cash , perks , and incentives to Cunningham .
Doolittle has also admitted that now - incarcerated Jack Abramoff was a “ friend ” who donated to his campaigns and shared his skybox at a Washington DC sports stadium .
John Doolittle ’s wife Julie runs a political consulting company out of the family ’s California mansion called Sierra Dominion Financial Solutions , Incorporated , which received more than $ 60,000 in business from Abramoff between 2002 and 2004 .
Filing cabinets and computers associated with this company were seized in this month ’s FBI raid .
At one fundraiser for Doolittle , at which President Bush spoke , Mrs. Doolittle was paid a 15 percent commission on the funds raised , or $ 90,000 .
The House Appropriations Committee from which Doolittle resigned is one of the most powerful committees on Capitol Hill , responsible for appropriating revenue and allocating resources to the various government departments .
The recent emergency war supplemental funding bill Bush is expected to veto today , for instance , was approved by the Appropriations Committee on March 16 .
Mark Zachares , a prominent official in the Northern Mariana Islands , was also recently charged in the Abramoff case .
He is charged with using his influence to ensure the profitability of Abramoff ’s businesses as well as those of his clients and allies in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands .
In return , he received a $ 10,000 golf trip to St Andrews in Scotland as well as a call to Karl Rove ’s office recommending him for a position in the Department of the Interior .
Photograph by Aubrey Woods , Seymour Tribune Nineteen - year - old Garrett Gray , in stripes behind , and 18 - year - old Coleman King , center , told police they brutally beat and killed a man after he suggested a homosexual act with King .
But some say they made up the story as a way to get sympathy for their case .
The simple facts in Shorty Hall 's murder shout major media .
Brian Williams or Katie Couric , maybe .
Bill Moyers , someday .
Indianapolis Star , unquestionably .
The 1998 hate - crime murder of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming is commonly invoked in comparison .
Thirty - five - year - old , 5 - foot - 4 , 100 - pound Aaron Hall was brutally beaten on April 12 for hours by two teens who have described the murder in chilling detail to police .
Each says
Hall precipitated the violence by making a homosexual suggestion .
The beatings included repeated pummelings with fists and boots and dragging Hall down a wooden staircase by his feet as " his head bounced down all of the steps , " in one of the accused 's words .
He died naked and alone , in a field , where he had crawled after his killers dumped his body in a roadside ditch .
Police found Hall 's body 10 days after his death wrapped in a tarp in the garage of Jackson County Deputy Coroner Terry Gray , whose son is one of the accused .
According to the local paper , The Crothersville Times , a witness said 19 - year - old Garrett Gray , upon learning that Hall was dead , " began vomiting and making statements of what his dad would say when he found out about this incident . "
The fact that this tale has received almost no media attention outside Jackson County , Monroe 's far southeast - corner neighbor , is but one of its bizarre twists .
Another is the suggestion that Hall made no sexual advance on 18 - year - old Coleman King , the other accused , that he and Gray made up the story as an excuse for murder .
There 's a legal theory for their argument .
It 's called the " gay panic defense , " and it suggests that temporary insanity from exposure to homosexuality is a defense against murder .
Matthew Shepard 's killers tried to use it .
***
Gray , Coleman and others , including 21 - year - old Robert Hendricks and uncharged co-conspirator John Hodge , told police remarkably similar stories about a violent reaction to a homosexual advance in Gray 's Crothersville home , according to court documents filed by police in the case .
Coleman said he got to Gray 's place around noon and that he and Hendricks went to the Stop - In Liquors in town and picked up Hall on their way back .
According to the Times : " King said they were all drinking beer and whiskey when Hall grabbed him in the groin , asking King to perform oral sex .
King said he punched Hall , then jumped on him , punching him several more times .
King said Gray also punched Hall while King held Hall down . "
Gray said King left the room after initially assaulting Hall .
Gray said he walked over to ask Hall if he was all right .
" Gray then admitted to striking Hall several times in the eye area causing significant damage , " the Times reported .
Gray told police that King walked back into the room and moved Hall to the couch .
" According to Gray , King then straddled Hall and began physically assaulting him multiple times with his hands , " the paper said .
Hendricks said the beatings " went on for several hours before Hall was loaded into Gray 's pickup . "
Before dragging
Hall down the steps to Gray 's Ford Ranger pickup , Gray said they assaulted him again on the deck .
King said he and Gray " continued beating Hall as Hendricks drove south to the dirt farm lane . "
There they dumped Hall in a ditch and threw his camouflage coat over his body .
" King admitted to striking Hall a few more times , " the Times said .
" The trio then left Hall in the ditch . "
***
Hodge told police that he was working during the beating .
Gray sent him a multimedia text message on his phone with a photograph of Hall , in between Gray and King , with a swollen eye and lip .
About 15 minutes later , Hendricks called Hodge from the scene .
The Times reported that Hendricks shouted : " They 're beatin ' the hell out of that guy . "
Hodge told police he could hear screaming and yelling in the background and thought he heard Hall yelling , " Bitches . "
The next morning Hodge went to Gray 's house , and he and Hendricks drove to the site where Hall 's body had been dumped because Hendricks wanted Hall 's camouflage jacket .
They saw only clothes in the ditch .
" Hodge then described seeing something in the field that he thought at first was a dead deer , " the paper reported .
" Hodge said he walked towards the object and said it was a human body .
Hodge said he went back and forth a few times before he finally approached the body .
Hodge said the body was completely naked and was severely beaten .
He said he recognized the subject to be Aaron Hall and that Hall was dead . "
Hodge , Gray and King all said they returned to the field a couple days later and removed the body .
They wrapped it in a blue tarp and hid it in Gray 's detached garage .

Crothersville is a town of 1,500 , located midway between Louisville and Indianapolis just off Interstate 65 in the southeast corner of Jackson County .
According to the U.S. Census , it is 97.6 percent white , and 75.4 percent of its residents 25 or older have high school educations .
The national average is 80.4 .
It 's not the sort of place that makes big news often .
One of the more recent times was in 2005 when a 10 - year - old Crothersville girl named Katie Collman was kidnapped , sexually assaulted and murdered .
" Ironically , it was Terry Gray , Garrett Gray 's father , who served as the Collman family spokesman during the investigation and court proceedings , " the Times reported .
The Collman case was big news .
Indianapolis Star - columnist - turned - Internet - blogger Ruth Holliday noted on May 8 that it " had a lot of twists and turns . "
A search of the Star Web site turns up more than a dozen stories .
Yet the Star has left the Hall murder to the Jackson County media , the never - to - be- trusted Indianapolis and Louisville television stations and bloggers like Advance Indiana 's Gary Welsh , who has covered the story in depth and , along with Holliday , has questioned the lack of major media attention .
A search of the Star Web site for Aaron Hall returned zero stories .
On May 3 , Welsh , who is an advocate for hate crimes legislation in Indiana , wrote a column titled " Why Wo n't the Star Cover The Hate Crime Killing of Aaron Hall ? "
He noted that the paper " has been silent " about the Hall case but that editorial writer RiShawn Biddle argued in his May 1 Star blog that a hate crimes law would not have prevented Hall 's murder .
In his blog , Biddle argued that the " murkiness of the case shows that it may not even have been considered a hate crime . "
***
Biddle 's assessment is shared by others , especially in Jackson County .
Many of them see it as bunch of kids drinking and going crazy .
An anonymous contributor wrote in Welsh 's blog : " No one in the News knows what the hell they 're talking about .
I know what went on i really do .
It was n't a hate crime .
Garrett hit him because he said F# % % you and your mom and his mom was dead .
Anyone that knows him knows that . "
One local woman , who also says the murder was not a hate crime , told the Alternative that Gray 's mother has been dead for years .
On April 29 , Welsh reported that Crothersville resident Leslie Horton told him that rumors in town are that " Aaron was gay and had AIDS " to shift the blame away from them and onto Hall , thereby " stigmatizing him in the hope of getting off easy . "
" People are losing sight that this man was not gay in the slightest , " Horton told Welsh .
" It was a ploy to make their crime seem justifiable since it seems to be condoned by some evil people in this world . "

The gay panic defense led to an acquittal in a murder case in West Virginia , according to a story in a 1993 Barnes & Noble book Some Days Nothing Goes Right .
Numerous Internet sources , including Wikipedia and Answers.com , report the same passage .
" The Sun -Times Wire reported in Harrisville , West Virginia , USA , that one Dean Ludwig Bethoven , aged thirty , accepted a ride home from a bar by funeral director Dent Pickman , and fell asleep in his car .
" When he woke up later at Pickman 's house , he found his body covered with ' ketchup , mustard , mayonnaise , pickles - things out of the refrigerator , ' and Dent Pickman licking mayonnaise off his naked body .
' I went crazy , ' said Bethoven , who stabbed Pickman to death with a kitchen knife .
The jury acquitted him of murder . "
One of the highest - profile gay panic defense cases was a 1995 murder in which a man killed a friend after learning on the The Jenny Jones
Show that the friend was sexually attracted to him .
Jonathan Schmitz confessed but said he was angered and humiliated by his friend 's advances .
He was convicted of second - degree murder and received a 25 - to - 50 year prison sentence .
The judge in the Shepard case threw out the killers ' use of gay panic .
He ruled it was " either a temporary insanity defense or a diminished capacity defense , such as irresistible impulse , which are not allowed in Wyoming ... "
Shepard 's killers later recanted their story on national television , characterizing the murder as a robbery attempt gone awry under the influence of drugs .
Each received two consecutive life sentences .

I 'm not looking for a new hobby per se , just trying to figure out what my peers spend their time on after the work day is done .
These post work evenings of nothing to do but fiddle around with one of too many hobbies , zone out infront of the TV , and end up drinking a bit too much are starting to get to me .
I 'm interested in learning how common this is and what folks do to combat it .
You 're married or single , have no kids , hold a regular job and are out of school .
So what do you do in the evenings after work ?
All right , this article from NASA is totally pandering to my Star Trek geekiness .
I know I ’m being manipulated , but I just … can ’t… resist .
According to NASA , their upcoming SIM PlanetQuest mission should be able to find Star Trek ’s planet Vulcan .
You know , Spock ’s home ?
Okay , I ’ll try and put this into some kind of scientific justification .
The SIM PlanetQuest is a new mission in the works at NASA .
If all goes well , and it does n’t befall the fate that struck the Terrestrial Planet Finder , it will launch into an Earth - trailing solar orbit .
Once fully operational , it ’ll be able to detect potentially habitable planets as small as the Earth around nearby stars .
Here ’s the Star Trek angle .
One of the stars that it ’ll be able to detect Earth - sized planets around will be 40 Eridani , a triple star system located about 16 light - years from Earth .
In the Star Trek universe , the planet Vulcan , home of Spock , orbits the star 40 Eridani A , which is part of this system .
So , if all goes well , SIM Planet Quest will be able to find an Earth - sized world , in the habitable zone around 40 Eridani A .
It ’ll find Spock ’s homeworld , get it ?
If the Terrestrial Planet Finder does get brought back from canceled status , it ’ll be able to take this research to the next level , and actually search for signatures of life around any worlds which are discovered .

あるセキュリティ研究チームが先ごろ、オープンソースの匿名アクセス・ソフトウェア「 Tor（The Onion Router）」を使用する人々のIPアドレスを暴く方法を発見した。
そのセキュリティ研究チームの代表者であり、デンマークのセキュリティ・コンサルティング会社フォートコンサルに勤務するアンドリュー・クリステンセン氏は、『Practical Onion Hacking』と題したPDF文書に、Torの出口となるサーバ、いわゆる「出口ノード」と呼ばれるサーバを通過するトラフィックを改竄することで、Torによる匿名性を無力化してしまう方法の詳細を示している。
この脆弱性は 、Tor、Javascript 、Shockwaveを使用するブラウザ・ベースのアプリケーションに内在するものであり、システム自体のピア・ツー・ピア（P2P）ルーティング・プロトコルによるものではない。しかし、多くのユーザーのIPアドレスが影響を受ける可能性があるという。
Torは、ユーザーが自身のIPアドレスを明らかにすることなくWebサーバにアクセスできるようにするIPトンネリング・ツール・セット。プライバシー保護関連の非営利団体EFF（Electronic Frontier Foundation）が支援するこのツール・セットは、一連の特別なサーバ、いわゆる「ノード」を使用してアクセスの匿名性を実現する。これらのサーバは暗号化技術を使用してトラフィックのルーティングを行い、接続元のアドレスを保存しない。したがって、接続先となるWebサーバから見えるのは、本当のアドレスではなく、出口ノード、つまりチェーンの最終ノードだけである。
言論の自由を提唱す るTorの支持者は、中国などでのインターネット・アクセス制限を回避できるなどの利点を挙げているが、幼児ポルノや犯罪者に“隠れみの”を提供しているという非難も一部から出ていた。また、Torは専門家が便利に使えることだけを念頭としているため、ツール・セットとしては不備が多く、仮説に基づく不安定要素が多すぎるとの指摘もある。
クリステンセン氏は、今回の報告について、次のように結論している。
「 われわれは 、Tor自体に脆弱性を認めたわけではなく、Torを使用するアプリケーションの脆弱性や特徴を悪用すれば、人々のプライバシーを暴き、匿名性を無効にできることを実証したのだ。これらのトラフィックの内容の大部分は明らかにすることができると思う。というのも、Torを通過するトラフィックはFirefoxとInternet Explorerで表示され、平文で伝送されるからだ」
クリステンセン氏をはじめとするセキュリティ研究チームは、Webの専門家であれば、プライバシーを暴く操作が行われないようにシステムを構成できると説明している。しかし、そのためには、Java、Javascript、ActiveX、Flashなどのブラウザ・プラグインをオフにしたうえで、Torがネーム・アドレスを解決できるように設定し、SSLを使用なければならない。いずれも平均的なユーザーには望めないことばかりだ。
クリステンセン氏らは、上記のリポートに続き、『Peeling the Onion』と題した新しいリポートも発表している。同リポートにはTor関連の脆弱性の概要がより理論的に示されている。

Shiite Muslims are the product of the violent schism that followed the death of the prophet Muhammad in AD 632 , and through the centuries have generally been the losers in the struggle to lead the faithful and to divide patronage and power .
That has left them with a sharp feeling of dispossession , of being a people denied their destiny by corrupt rulers .
The split started with a fight over who should lead the faithful after Muhammad 's death .
One side believed that direct descendants of the prophet should take up the mantle of caliph – the leader of the world 's Muslims .
They were known as the Shiat - Ali , or " partisans of Ali , " after the prophet 's cousin and son - in - law Ali , whom they favored to become caliph .
They became known as Shiites .
The other side , Sunnis , thought that any worthy man could lead the faithful , regardless of lineage , and favored Abu Bakr , an early convert to Islam who had married into Muhammad 's family .
" Sunni " is derived from the Arab word for " followers " and is shorthand for " followers of the prophet . "
All religious Shiites nominally observe the advice of an ayatollah on how to follow the law of Islam , or sharia , in the modern context .
For many Iraqis , this role is fulfilled by Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani .
The major Shiite holidays celebrate the now glorious defeats and martyrdoms of Imam Ali and Imam Hussein , Ali 's son , as typified by the preeminent Shiite holiday of Ashura , which marks the slaughter of Hussein and 72 of his followers by a Sunni caliph outside the Iraqi city of Karbala in AD 680 .
In Iraq and Iran , the holiday is marked by elaborate processions of men reenacting their own passion play , many of whom self - flagellate with chains to the beat of drums .
Such expressions of piety are looked at with disgust by hard - line Sunnis like the clergy in Saudi Arabia , who view the veneration of Hussein and other members of the prophet 's family as a violation of monotheism .
This view has frequently led extremist groups like Al Qaeda to attack Shiites as heretics .
One of the most important distinctions between Shiite and Sunni belief is veneration of the imams .
Most Shiites believe that there were 12 legitimate successors to Muhammad as caliph , and that the final imam , now called the Mahdi , disappeared when he was taken up in the arms of God.
Many Shiites believe the Mahdi will return to earth one day and play the role of savior .
The fact that Shiites have long been an oppressed minority – first under the Ottoman Empire , later under states like Iraq and Saudi Arabia – has led to a strong identification with the injustices suffered by Hussein and have lent a political dimension to Shiite worship .
Ashura celebrations , for instance , were banned under Saddam Hussein , who feared they could lead to spontaneous uprisings .

Recent visitors of the DrudgeReport.com will have found huge headlines about the recent conflict between the Brits an Iranians over blowing the whole subject in order to provocateur a war .
Just today the top of Drudge read in huge red letters " BLAIR : WE'VE 48 HOURS TO SAVE SAILORS " creating the impression something significant will happen after 48 hours and everyone needs to start panicking .
In reality the article is a non-story in which Blair just says , " The next 48 hours will be fairly critical . "
Gee
Whiz , that really merits huge panicky red letters .
But in between these attempts to manufacture a war , Drudge has found time to BS about his website traffic to create the impression his website is becoming more popular .
At the front right of the DrudgeReport.com it reads :
FLASH : DRUDGE REPORT'S TOP MONTH IN ITS 12 YEAR HISTORY : MARCH 2007 !
MAIN PAGE LOADED 425,371,511 TIMES ...
TOPS MARCH 2006 'S 287,443,312 ...
MANY THANKS FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT ... THE LOVERS AND THE HATERS ...
AND THE ONES THAT STILL FIND THE INTERNET TOPS FOR NEWS AND INFORMATION !
To the internet novice , this would seem to be a good thing and a sign his traffic is increasing .
In reality , it is just a ruse to give the impression his site is becoming more popular .
If you read what he says carefully you will notice he says " main page LOADED 425,371,511 times " .
This is misleading because in order to artificially increase his page loads Drudge uses a reload script which reloads the page every minute or so .
Hence , if someone just left their computer on DrudgeReport.com for an hour that would equate to 60 page loads .
If you look at his actual traffic graph from the internet 's top ranking website , Alexa.com , you will see his traffic is actually tanking :
Obviously Drudge still gets a massive amount of traffic , but this is clearly an attempt to mislead his readers into believing his site ( and the propaganda which goes with it ) is becoming more popular , when in reality , like all the other Neo - Con propaganda organs , Limbaugh , etc. , it is losing all its readership and is falling dramatically in popularity .
Good riddance .
ROCKVILLE , Maryland ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday announced it is blocking the import from China of five species of seafood until their importers can prove they are not contaminated .
About 10 percent of catfish eaten in the U.S. comes from China , according to the National Fisheries Institute .
" FDA is initiating an import alert against several species of imported Chinese farmed seafood because of numerous cases of contamination with drugs and unsafe food additives , " said Dr. David Acheson , the agency 's assistant commissioner for food protection , in a conference call with reporters .
The species cited are catfish , eel , shrimp , basa and dace , he said .
Basa is similar to catfish ; dace is similar to carp .
The medications cited include the antimicrobials nitrofuran , malachite green , gentian violet and fluoroquinolones .
Nitrofuran , malachite green , and gentian violet have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals .
Use of fluoroquinolones in food - producing animals can result in antibiotic resistance .
None of them is approved for use in farmed seafood in the United States and some of them have been shown to cause cancer when fed to laboratory animals for " prolonged periods of time , " Acheson said .
Alerts have been issued in the past , but Thursday 's announcement is the largest .
Importer must prove safety
The food will not be allowed into the United States until the importer can prove it is free from harmful contaminants , Acheson said .
He said the agency decided to broaden its previous alerts for products from individual companies to a countrywide alert after tests showed that 15 percent of those species of seafood produced by 18 companies in China contained traces of one or more of the contaminants .
" FDA is taking this action to protect the public health of the American people , " he said .
Watch more on the FDA 's import alert on five kinds of fish from China . »
The products " could cause serious health problems if consumed over a long period of time , " he said .
Still , Acheson added , the low levels of contaminants means that there is " no imminent threat " to the public health .
China is the world 's largest producer of farmed fish , accounting for 70 percent of the total produced , he said .
It is the third - largest exporter of farmed fish to the United States .
The action is an import alert , which means that these products from Chinese processors " will be detained and refused entry into the United States until the importer can demonstrate that the product is safe and in compliance with applicable regulations , " said Margaret O' K. Glavin , FDA 's associate commissioner for regulatory affairs .
Last year , the FDA slapped a countrywide alert on all Chinese eel after tests showed residues of an antimicrobial agent , she said .
Since then , and " despite extensive communications between FDA and appropriate Chinese authorities to correct the problem , we have continued to find residues of certain veterinary drugs or food additives that are not permitted for use in the United States , " she added .
Glavin said the FDA inspects 5 percent of seafood from China .
The first alert on Chinese seafood occurred before 2001 , she said .
" We 're not asking for this product to be withdrawn from the market or for people to take this out of their freezers and throw it away , " Acheson said .
" This is a long - term health concern ; it is not an acute health concern . "
China is not the sole offender , Glavin said .
Import alerts have been ordered for firms in the Philippines , Mexico " and several others , " though this is the first countrywide import alert , she said .
More than 80 percent of shrimp eaten in the United States is imported , including 7 percent from China , according to the National Fisheries Institute .
About 10 percent of catfish eaten in the United States comes from China , the seafood industry advocacy group said .
Last year , the United States imported 590,299 metric tons of shrimp from abroad ; 68,150 metric tons of which came from China , according to the Department of Commerce .
The United States imported $ 1.2 billion of fish from China in 2004 , according to H. M. Johson & Associates , a seafood industry research group .

" I joined the Army to go to war , and now I ’m fighting to get out , " says Pfc. Ryan Follan , laughing nervously .
He quickly becomes serious .
" Some of the causes are good , but I do n’t think the war is for the right reasons . "
Follan laughs again , and there ’s a long pause .
" I ’m deploying in a month , actually .
I ’m not a big fan of it , honestly . "
Private Follan is standing in a Taco Bell parking lot just outside Fort Stewart in Savannah , Georgia .
Each day , soldiers gather for lunch at fast food restaurants like this one .
On this particular day , the soldiers at Fort Stewart have visitors .
Last week , a convoy of approximately 20 veterans riding in converted school buses left Fayetteville , North Carolina .
They were sponsored by Veterans for Peace , armed with literature and headed for New Orleans , where they are spending this week rebuilding houses in the Ninth Ward .
On the way , the group stopped at military bases throughout the South .
Their goal ?
They were passing out copies of the Appeal for Redress , GI rights information , and copies of the videos " Ground Truth " and " Sir! No Sir ! "
Veterans for Peace members say they ’re not trying to pressure GIs to resist war .
They want to educate soldiers about their rights .
They know from experience that the military frowns on dissent and does n’t go out of its way to educate soldiers regarding constitutionally protected ways to express their opinions on issues like war and peace .
Despite popular opinion to the contrary , soldiers do indeed have rights to express political dissent .
The Appeal for Redress is a confidential online petition to Congress asking for an end to the Iraq war .
Because the Uniform Code of Military Justice expressly permits members of the military to petition their representatives , the Appeal is 100 percent legal , and since its unveiling in late 2006 the Appeal has gathered over 1,700 signatures .
Private Follan had n’t heard of the Appeal before , but says he thinks he ’ll sign it .
" I ca n’t see any reason why I would n’t , " he says , explaining he has n’t heard a single good reason for the Iraq war .
" If there are good reasons , I have n’t been told them yet .
Maybe I ’ll find out some more reasons when I get there . "
Follan is dressed in desert camouflage fatigues and is with a couple of friends .
He ’s 18 years old , and he joined the Army last July .
He ’s young and really earnest .
He explains that despite his objections to the war , he does n’t mind going .
" I ’m hoping to do the right thing , " he says .
" I have no problem going and helping in any way I can . "
Pfc. Richard Jones was having lunch with Follan .
He ’s quieter , just as young and just as earnest .
He ’s a cavalry scout , with less than a year in the military .
He expects to be deployed in May as well , but is n’t sure .
He ’s well aware of the complexity of the arguments both for and against the war .
" Nobody should go to war .
War ’s not a good thing at all .
But if that ’s what has to be done , then I guess that ’s what has to be done to protect your country and your people .
It would be a lot worse if they were over here saying if you do n’t believe in our religion , and if you speak against it , we ’re gonna kick down your doors , then we ’re going to kill your family .
That ’s not good .
I would n’t wish that on Iraqis either . "
Jones does n’t know if he ’ll sign the Appeal , but he ’s glad to see Veterans for Peace .
" I think it ’s a good thing that they ’re trying to help people .
I do n’t want people to get the impression that we ’re just piddling around not really taking things seriously .
I have no doubt that if we could get out of Iraq right now we would , obviously . "
" I ’m not a big fan of it , " his friend Ryan Follan says again .
" But who is , right ?
It ’s war .
I ca n’t wait to go . "
Follan appears to think about these contradictions and laughs .
" I have no problem being in the Army .
It ’s just the whole being in the Army thing . "
These views were reflected in a shocking number of soldiers last week .
Almost everyone responded favorably to Veterans for Peace , with many soldiers leaving the parking lot with videos and brochures , saying they ’d look into the Appeal for Redress .
While the majority of the media frames the public debate about the Iraq war in terms of supporting the troops vs. opposing the war , the men and women fighting it see things differently .
Soldiers are increasingly expressing unabashed opposition to the war .
Capt .
Ben Gatskey is a tank company commander in the 130 Infantry Division , Second Brigade .
He already served in Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom Three , between January 2005 and January 2006 .
He was supportive of Veterans for Peace and their outreach to the troops .
" I feel that it ’s an honest support of us , and I do appreciate that . "
He served as a logistics officer , a battalion planner in Baghdad , and worked on the transition team training the Iraqi Army .
He too is scheduled for redeployment in May .
" I do n’t really think any soldier ever truly wants to go to war , but that ’s what we do .
Ultimately , it ’s why we have a job , and it comes as no surprise that we ’re being asked to deploy . "
Captain Gatskey declined to share his personal feelings about the war , reframing the question in terms of obligation .
" Part of my duty is leading soldiers into combat , and I take that very seriously , " he said .
He also says that , despite the reports of violence and the civil war , he ’s seen forward motion .
" Based on my interaction with soldiers in the Iraqi Army , it seems like their security forces made quite a bit of progress the year we were there . "
Gatskey believes it ’s important that the public take an active interest in the Iraq war , the military and the public policy they ’re asked to carry out .
" We are direct representatives of the American people and the American way of life , and we take that very seriously , " he said .
" We take our role as ambassador very seriously , and do n’t want to have a disconnect between the American people and the military representing them . "
A little later , two young women emerge from Taco Bell carrying to - go bags .
Although they decline to give their names , each seems almost eager to share their views on the war .
" I do n’t believe in the war .
I really do n’t wanna go to war .
But I have to , so I ’m gonna go , " said one of them .
She joined the Army six months ago , and is assigned to warehouse supply .
She ’s just learning her job and is apprehensive about doing it in a war zone .
She does n’t feel like she has enough training .
Both women say they ’re frustrated with public apathy towards the war and those fighting it .
" It seems like if it does n’t hit close to home , a lot of people do n’t really care , " said the first private .
This is one of the reasons they ’re happy to see Veterans for Peace .
" It makes me feel good to know that other people think the same way I do .
I ’m glad they do n’t want to see us go to Iraq , because we really do n’t want to go . "
Both women joined the military out of economic necessity .
" I do n’t support the war either , " said the second soldier .
" But we all have necessities , so here we are .
I ’m scared , but at the same time , I ’m excited in a weird way .
I ’m going somewhere new . "
Throughout their week on the road , Veterans for Peace met with similar responses to their education and outreach efforts .
Defying public expectation , most soldiers from Fort Bragg to Fort Benning expressed apprehension , ambivalence and concern .
For the most part , they joined the military because they love their country , and because they needed a job .
Many of them are perplexed by the tasks their country is now asking them to perform .
" I just want people to realize that we do n’t want to go over there .
We ’re not looking forward to it , " she said .
" People are over there dying and suffering .
Nothing has been accomplished .
We ’ve sacrificed a lot of our time , and a lot of people have died for all of this .
And for what ? "
In When Hardware is Free , Power is Expensive , I referenced a Google whitepaper ( pdf ) that explained why typical PC power supplies are not particularly efficient :
Most likely , the computer you 're using wastes 30 - 40 % of the electrical power it
consumes because it is using an inefficient power supply .
It 's difficult to believe that something as basic as a power supply could be responsible for that amount of waste , but it 's true .
The problem with power supplies is that they generate heat , which saps away energy meant to power the computer .
That happens when the power supply converts AC current into the DC current needed by computers
Google 's solution for their datacenter computers is a radical makeover – switching wholesale to single - voltage 12 volt power supplies .
The net result of [ the switch to a single - voltage 12 v power supply ] is a dramatic improvement in efficiency ( including the power supply and the regulators ) to about 85 % , at virtually no cost .
In other words , you wo n't have to pay more for a higher - efficiency PC , because the power supply is actually getting simpler , not more complicated .
By spending another $ 20 or so extra , it is possible to use higher - quality components and achieve efficiencies well over 90 % .
You wo n't be able to buy such computers for a while , and Google is n't planning on selling you any .
But we 're working with industry partners such as Intel to make this technology an open standard that everyone can use , and that all vendors hopefully will adopt .
It 's the right solution technically , and the right thing to do for the environment .
Who knows when these hypothetical single - voltage systems will arrive on the market in the form of desktop PCs and laptops we can actually buy .
In the meantime , it is possible to upgrade your computer with a high efficiency multiple - voltage power supply .
Unfortunately , existing high efficiency power supplies are n't available " at virtually no cost " ; they tend to be quite a bit more expensive than their less efficient cousins .
I just upgraded my home PC to a high efficiency power supply :
Core 2 Duo 3.2 GHz CPU ( overclocked , overvolted )
Radeon X1900 XTX primary video card
Radeon X1550 secondary video card
Western Digital Raptor 150 GB primary hard drive
Seagate 750 GB secondary hard drive
Creative X - Fi sound card
Note that this is a fairly power hungry system by current desktop standards .
The gaming - class video card and overclocked / overvolted CPU are the primary culprits .
I used my trusty kill - a- watt to measure the power usage before and after the power supply upgrade .
The power supply was the only component that changed .
Typical PSU Efficient PSU
Off 5 w 5 w Boot ( peak ) 237 w 215 w - 22 w 9.3 % Desktop 205 w 185 w - 20 w 9.8 % 1 × Prime95 236 w 217 w - 19 w 8.1 % 2 × Prime95 257 w 237 w - 20 w 7.8 % DiRT demo peak 270 w 247 w - 23 w 8.5 %
Most typical desktop PC power supplies are only 60 to 75 percent efficient ; high efficiency models offer 80 + percent , all the way up to 85 percent depending on the load .
And that 's exactly what we 're seeing in these results .
With the new high - efficiency power supply installed , I gained about 10 percent efficiency at each load level .
To get an idea of where this system stands in terms of overall power usage , you can compare with a few different systems shown on page 4 of the Silent PC Review Power Supply Fundamentals .
I was surprised to find that my PC uses 5 watts of power even when it 's powered off .
This is what 's known as " standby " electricity loss , and at least one study showed it accounts for 6 to 16 percent of all energy use in homes , and another ( pdf ) estimates that standby power use is now responsible for 1 % of total carbon emissions on earth .
The only way to reduce your computer 's power use to zero watts is to unplug it from the wall , or flip the power switch on the back of the power supply .
If you 're interested in upgrading to a high - efficiency power supply , look for models tagged with the 80 PLUS designation , which are guaranteed 80 % efficient at 20 % , 50 % and 100 % of their rated load .
Many vendors cut corners by stating their power supplies offer " up to " 80 percent efficiency , but what they do n't tell you is that you 'll only reach that level of efficiency under extreme power loads that are unrealistic for most desktops .
Seasonic is a popular choice , as they have aggressively enforced the 80 PLUS certification on almost their entire product line .
But fair warning : you will pay a premium .
You can use the handy calculator provided by the 80 PLUS website to determine how much money you could potentially save on your power bill by switching to a more efficient power supply .
It 's usually not much , unless you happen to run a server farm .
But every little bit helps , and until Google and Intel offer up their single - voltage 12 volt system designs – which supposedly offer greater than 90 percent efficiency – it's the best we can do .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Thursday April 19 2007
After lying almost untouched in the vaults of an Italian university for 500 years , a book on the magic arts written by Leonardo da Vinci 's best friend and teacher has been translated into English for the first time .
The world 's oldest magic text , De viribus quantitatis ( On The Powers Of Numbers ) was penned by Luca Pacioli , a Franciscan monk who shared lodgings with Da Vinci and is believed to have helped the artist with The Last Supper .
It was written in Italian by Pacioli between 1496 and 1508 and contains the first ever reference to card tricks as well as guidance on how to juggle , eat fire and make coins dance .
It is also the first work to note that Da Vinci was left - handed .
Although the book has been described as the " foundation of modern magic and numerical puzzles " , it was never published and has languished in the archives of the University of Bologna , seen only by a small number of scholars since the Middle Ages .
The transcription has taken eight years , involved several translators and cost thousands of pounds .
William Kalush , a magician and the founder of the Conjuring Arts Research Centre in New York , who financed the project , said : " This book is the first major manual that is primarily concerned with teaching how to perform magic . "
" Sources of magic methods go back at least to the first century , but this book teaches not only the methods but also gives a glimpse into how one might perform them with an eye to entertaining an audience . "
The book was rediscovered after David Singmaster , a mathematician , came across a reference to it in a 19th - century manuscript .
" It 's the foundation not only of modern magic but of numerical puzzles too , " he said .
" We do n't know why , but this huge thing has been hidden away in the University of Bologna we presume since the time of Pacioli . "
Experts believe it will give a greater understanding of magical history as well as insights into Da Vinci 's life and work .
Carlo Pedretti , a leading art historian , studied the original Italian text in Bologna in 1954 .
He said : " It 's a very important document .
It shows how much Da Vinci liked games and tricks - but only if they had scientific foundations .
It 's also a very important document from the viewpoint of his work as it mentions The Last Supper . "
The manuscript contains a previously unknown anecdote about Da Vinci .
Dr Pedretti said : " Leonardo was working as an architect and general engineer for Cesare Borgia - the illegitimate son of Pope Alexander VI - who wanted to establish a new state in Italy in 1502 .
On their journey they came across a river and Da Vinci very quickly figured a way to use tree trunks to build a bridge - this is the first time we hear this story . "
Pacioli was born in Tuscany in 1445 and was a travelling mathematics tutor .
He is often called the father of modern accountancy because his book The Summa ( 1494 ) contains the first published description of double - entry bookkeeping , accountancy 's basic technique .
He lived with Da Vinci in Milan from 1496 for several years and taught maths and geometry to the painter , scientist and inventor .
They collaborated on many projects including a book , De Divina Proportione ( 1509 ) , which Da Vinci also illustrated .
De viribus quantitatis is divided into three sections : mathematical problems , puzzles and tricks , and a collection of proverbs and verses .
Tricks include how to write a sentence on the petals of a rose , wash your hands in molten lead and make an egg walk across a table ( " commoners will consider it a miracle " . )
It also contains some of the first known European examples of numerical puzzles , which are similar to those printed in today 's newspapers , such as Sudoku .
There is also a diagram of a moving piece puzzle - such as those found in Christmas crackers - which was the medieval version of the Rubik 's cube .
Elsewhere in its pages , Pacioli explains a technique for writing in code , which may have been inspired by Da Vinci , whose left - handedness meant he sometimes wrote backwards making the words decipherable only with the use of a mirror .
No originality attaches to this work and Pacioli himself called it a compendium .
Some of the problems are found in the notebooks of Da Vinci and although he never mentions Pacioli directly , experts believe that De viribus quantitatis shows their relationship was mutually beneficial .
Lori Pieper , the manuscript 's main translator , said : " There 's one particular case when Pacioli describes a mariner 's clock or compass . "
" He writes , ' Well Leonardo , you can do more of this on your own . '
It implies that Pacioli also gave inventions to Leonardo and it was n't just a one - way street .
They learned from each other . "
Although Da Vinci was a polymath interested in everything from art to anatomy , and Pacioli was a man obsessed by figures and logic , some believe both were enchanted by the magic of numbers .
" Maths and magic are intertwined , " said Eddie Dawes , the Magic Circle 's historian .
" There are a number of magic tricks done with maths which date back a long time - like prediction tricks .
The means by which magic is produced has obviously changed since Pacioli 's day but the basic effects remain much the same . "
De viribus quantitatis was written at a time when people were burnt at the stake for witchcraft and in the manuscript Pacioli seems to want to demystify trickery and to prove it was more about sleight of hand than supernatural powers .
Mr Singmaster said : " Perhaps he wanted to help rid us of our superstitions and make the world more rational and understandable . "
The translation of De viribus quantitatis will be published next year to coincide with its 500th anniversary .
Until then , Da Vinci aficionados and aspiring magicians will have to be content with visiting the Conjuring Arts Research Centre where a copy will be kept .
Tricks of the trade
For washing your hands in melted lead
Take cool well water and soak your hands for a while ; then shake them , you can put them in a pan full of melted lead over a flame , and it will not cook you .
It is even better if you put some ground rock alum in the water ... to the uneducated ... it will appear to be a miracle .
Make a coin go up and down in a glass
Take some magnetic powder and rub it on a quattrino [ copper coin ] before putting the coin in some vinegar .
Then take a little bit of the magnetic powder between your thumb [ and index finger ] and tap the glass of water , where the coin is , and it will come up and go down ... with your hand .
Card tricks
You will be able to teach the said boy , since he is closed [ in a room ] or at a distance , to guess which card some people have touched without seeing it , by way of the numbers you have agreed on with him : that is , by placing a number on the figures and cards according to the trick , and according to the agreement made between you ... since it always appears to those who do not know the way ... that all [ these ] things are done by the magic art of divination .
And thus with spots on dice , and the ring , so you will always be able to do stupendous things with him ... but you must do it cautiously , so that you might not be embarrassed , since the more secret things are , the more beautiful they are .
How to make an egg walk
[ Take ] an egg that has been emptied through a hole made with a pin , and then filled in with white wax , so the hole can not be seen .
And get a hair from a braid , the longest you can , and attach it to the shell with ... solid wax .
Fasten another bit of wax to the other end ... placing the egg on the table , with the nail of your middle finger , pick up the said wax , and by moving it here and there ... it will follow .
This must be [ done ] in a place not too brightly lit , with onlookers at a distance .
Gaming has a lot in common with everyone 's favourite heiress , at least in the public consciousness : it 's pretty , but dumb .
And now that Microsoft , Nintendo and Sony have released their latest games consoles , that statement becomes all the more pertinent - next - gen games look great , but they play like something that could have been made a decade ago .
While visual fidelity has advanced exponentially over time , the technology that governs how games play , react and adapt - the artificial intelligence , or AI - remains relatively rudimentary .
A handful of developers are striving to change this .
The British designer Peter Molyneux , recently awarded an OBE , has spent his career trying to inject sentience and reactivity into games - and with his upcoming title , Fable 2 , he thinks he 's made significant progress .
" AI is certainly the undiscovered country of games design , " he says .
" Any game genre - from hardcore shooters to the most story - driven adventure game - would be truly revolutionised by AI driving plot , characters and scenarios . "
Gaming evolution
This is because presently , every action a player makes in a game has to be anticipated by the developers ; the software will break down or simply remain stagnant if asked to do something that has n't been pre-scheduled .
More sophisticated AI would allow games to come up with solutions to player decisions on the fly .
" That 's where the great wins are , when you start improving AI , " Molyneux says .
" If I as a player can do stuff in the world that is outside what the designer expects , and the game or game characters react appropriately , that 's incredibly powerful .
Suddenly , you think , ' Well , this is n't something that 's just waiting for me to press the B - button ; it 's evolving around what I 'm doing . '
That is very emotionally compelling and , if you get it right , it can often be quite spooky . "
That said , Molyneux does n't believe AI can be solely responsible for intense , dynamic emotional experiences ; they need to be married with what he calls " smoke and mirrors " .
" You have to define what games developers call AI , " he says , " as opposed to academic AI .
There 's actually very little true , academic AI in games .
If I go along to universities and talk to professors of AI , they sort of laugh at us and our crude attempts at real - world AI .
But my promise has always been , ' Well , good AI is what you see , not how it works . '
Whether that 's a mixture of true AI and an illusion is neither here nor there , because it 's really about what it brings to the game . "
Steve Grand - creator of the Creatures AI experiment , AI researcher , android hobbyist and also a recipient of an OBE - is probably the only person in the world with the distinction of creating a successful game driven by true AI .
Which is why he's not particularly enthused by the progress his field has made in the games industry .
" AI is n't so much unappreciated as nonexistent , " he says .
" Most of what counts as AI in the games industry is actually a bunch of ' IF / THEN ' statements .
If a computer character does n't learn something for itself then the programmer must have told it what to do , and anything that does exactly what it 's told and nothing else is not intelligent .
This is changing , and neural networks and other learning systems are beginning to creep in .
But games programmers tend to devalue the phrase ' artificial intelligence ' .
" This is mostly because the importance of AI in computer games is now widely recognised , and hence any attempt to implement it - including Creatures - gets hyped up pretty quickly .
As graphics have improved , the behaviour of characters has got more and more embarrassing .
When characters looked cartoon - like , any vaguely lifelike behaviour was impressive , but now that characters have fluid movements , realistic textures and complex facial expressions , they tend to engage different circuits in the players ' brains .
The better the graphics become , the worse the behaviour looks .
So the need for good AI is well - appreciated .
The snag is that none of us knows how to make it work yet . "
Learning curves
Which is n't to say that Grand has n't tried .
In fact , Creatures is arguably the only AI - driven simulation that could still be classified as a compelling game in its own right .
Basically a facade of evolution , the game allows players to teach their Norns ( the creatures ) to eat , talk , and defend themselves ; they would learn and develop dynamically , and would pass on certain genetic traits to their offspring .
Grand tries to explain its technology : " It consists of a very simplified set of the building blocks of life - nerve cells , enzymes , genes and receptors .
The hard part is explaining how all these virtual objects are assembled together to make something that lives , acts , breeds and evolves .
But if you understood school biology - I mean , if you really understood it , not just learned it - then you already almost understand Norns .
" I think the basic approach - biological and bottom - up - is the only way we 'll ever achieve truly intelligent artificial systems .
But for the time being , it 's not the best way to approach the problem for most games .
If you want to reach for the moon you have to go to the trouble to build yourself a space rocket , but if you only want to lift yourself three feet off the ground you might as well jump .
There are easier ways to make the kind of intelligence most present - day games require , even though these techniques will never lead anywhere . "
Molyneux agrees .
He 's a fan of Creatures and the technology behind it , but he does n't see it as particularly relevant to most mainstream games .
" I have tried prototyping using neural networks , " he concedes , " but you usually never quite get the results you want .
And I think the system we use is a hybrid , really - I would n't want to put a title on the AI we 've developed , but the theory of neural networks does influence it .
I think the whole Creatures approach was incredibly interesting and impressive , but the real problem was that it was a bit of a strange beast .
I did n't quite understand its motivations .
It was a great , interesting attempt , though . "
Even if Molyneux is sceptical about Creatures ' mass - market relevance , his latest project , Fable 2 , at the now Microsoft - owned Lionhead Studios appears to be heavily influenced by Grand 's games .
This is most obvious in the player 's constant companion , his dog .
According to Molyneux , each player 's dog will be unique thanks to their actions .
" We 're really pushing the idea of a learning creature with this game , " he enthuses .
But whether Molyneux will be answering that question with AI or " smoke and mirrors " is hard to say at this point ; Fable 2 wo n't be released until 2008 .
Still , projects like this are an opportunity to advance our understanding of how AI can revolutionise increasingly stale gameplay .
Grand , who 's now focused on robotics , remains confident that games can benefit AI research : " I think it 's probably the best environment for AI that exists , at least until we 've cracked some of the huge problems that are holding back robotics .
When you write a game , your only responsibility is to be entertaining .
It 's not a mission - critical environment , so this gives you plenty of scope for new ideas . "
With luck , more developers like Molyneux will begin taking his words to heart .
It 's unlikely entertainment software will ever employ - or need to employ - the sophisticated AI that Grand works with on a daily basis , but his work should serve as an inspiration to designers and programmers everywhere .
After all , no matter how pretty games become , they 're always going to be dumb if the brains are n't paid some serious attention .

He survived Iraq , only to suffer Death By Government in the " Land of the Free " : Sgt. Derek J. Hale , USMC , ret . ~ RIP
Delaware was the first state to ratify the U.S. Constitution .
It may be the first state to be afflicted with a fully operational death squad — unless a civil lawsuit filed on Friday against the murders of Derek J. Hale results in criminal charges and a complete lustration ( in the Eastern European sense of the term ) of Delaware ’s law enforcement establishment .
Hale , a retired Marine Sergeant who served two tours in Iraq and was decorated before his combat - related medical discharge in January 2006 , was murdered by a heavily armed 8 — 12 - member undercover police team in Wilmington , Delaware last November 6 .
He had come to Wilmington from his home in Manassas , Virginia to participate in a Toys for Tots event .
Derek was house - sitting for a friend on the day he was murdered .
Sandra Lopez , the ex-wife of Derek ’s friend , arrived with an 11 - year - old son and a 6 - year - old daughter just shortly before the police showed up .
After helping Sandra and her children remove some of their personal belongings , Derek was sitting placidly on the front step , clad in jeans and a hooded sweatshirt , when an unmarked police car and a blacked - out SUV arrived and disgorged their murderous cargo .
Unknown to Derek , he had been under police surveillance as part of a ginned - up investigation into the Pagan Motorcycle Club , which he had joined several months before ; the Pagans sponsored the  Toys for Tots Run that had brought Derek to Delaware .
As with any biker club , the Pagans probably included some disreputable people in their ranks .
Derek was emphatically not one of them .
In addition to his honorable military service ( albeit in a consummately dishonorable war ) , Derek ’s personal background was antiseptically clean .
He had a concealed carry permit in Virginia , which would not have been issued to him if he ’d been convicted of a felony , a narcotics or domestic violence charge , or had any record of substance abuse or mental illness .
On the day he was killed , Derek had been under both physical and electronic ( and , according to the civil complaint , illegal ) surveillance .
Police personnel who observed him knew that his behavior was completely innocuous .
And despite the fact that he had done nothing to warrant such treatment , he was considered an un-indicted co-conspirator in a purported narcotics ring run by the Pagans .
The police vehicles screeched to a halt in front of the house shortly after 4:00 p.m .
They ordered Lopez and her children away from Derek — who , predictably , had risen to his feet by this time — and then ordered him to remove his hands from his the pockets of his sweatshirt .
Less than a second later — according to several eyewitnesses at the scene —
Derek was hit with a taser blast that knocked him sideways and sent him into convulsions .
His right hand involuntarily shot out of its pocket , clenching spasmodically .
 Not in front of the kids ,  Derek gasped , as he tried to force his body to cooperate .
 Get the kids out of here . 
The officers continued to order Derek to put up his hands ; he was physically unable to comply .
So they tased him again .
This time he was driven to his side and vomited into a nearby flower bed .
Howard Mixon , a contractor who had been working nearby , could n’t abide the spectacle .
 That ’s not necessary !  he bellowed at the assailants .
 That ’s overkill !
That ’s overkill !
At this point , one of the heroes in blue ( or , in this case , black ) swaggered over to Mixon and snarled ,  I ’ll f*****g show you overkill ! 
Having heroically shut up an unarmed civilian , the officer turned his attention back to Derek — who was being tased yet again .
 I ’m trying to get my hands out ,  Derek exclaimed , desperately trying to make his tortured and traumatized body obey his will .
Horrified , his friend Sandra screamed at the officers :  He is trying to get his hands out , he can not get his hands out ! 
Having established that Derek — an innocent man who had survived two tours of duty in Iraq — was defenseless , one of Wilmington ’s Finest closed in for the kill .
Lt. William Brown of the Wilmington Police Department , who was close enough to seize and handcuff the helpless victim , instead shot him in the chest at point - blank range , tearing apart his vitals with three .40 - caliber rounds .
He did this after Derek had said , repeatedly and explicitly , that he was trying to cooperate .
He did this despite the fact that witnesses on the scene had confirmed that Derek was trying to cooperate .
He did this in front of a traumatized mother and two horrified children .
Why was this done ?
According to Sgt. Steven Elliot of the WPD , Brown slaughtered Derek Hale because he feared for the safety of his fellow officers and believed that the suspect was in a position to pose an imminent threat . 
That subjective belief was sufficient justification to use deadly force ,  according to Sgt. Elliot .
The position  Derek was in , remember , was that of wallowing helplessly in his own vomit , trying to overcome the cumulative effects of three completely unjustified Taser attacks .
When asked by the Wilmington News Journal last week if Hale had ever threatened the officers — remember , there were at least 8 and as many as 12 of them — Elliot replied :  In a sense , [ he threatened the officers ] when he did not comply with their commands . 
He was n’t given a chance to comply :
He was hit with the first Taser strike less than a second after he was commanded to remove his hands from his pockets , and then two more in rapid succession .
The killing took roughly three minutes .
As is always the case when agents of the State murder an innocent person , the WPD immediately went into cover - up mode .
The initial account of the police murder claimed that Derek had struggled with undercover Wilmington vice officers ; that struggle ,  of course , referred to Derek ’s involuntary reaction to multiple , unjustified Taser strikes .
The account likewise mentioned that police recovered  two items that were considered weapons  from Derek ’s body .
Neither was a firearm .
One was a container of pepper spray .
The other was a switchblade knife .
Both were most likely planted on the murder victim :
The police on the scene had pepper spray , and Derek ’s stepbrother , Missouri resident Jason Singleton , insists that Derek never carried a switchblade .
 The last time I saw Derek ,  Jason told the News Journal , he had a small Swiss Army knife .
I ’ve never seen Derek with anything like a switchblade . 
Within hours , the WPD began to fabricate a back - story to justify Derek ’s murder .
Several Delware State Police officers — identified in the suit ( .pdf ) as  Lt. [ Patrick ]
Ogden , Sgt. Randall Hunt , and other individual DSP [ personnel ]  contacted the police in Masassas , Virginia and informed him that Derek had been charged with drug trafficking two days before he was murdered .
This was untrue .
But because it was said by someone invested with the majestic power of the State , it was accepted as true , and cited in a sworn affidavit to secure a warrant to search Derek ’s home .
Conducting this spurious search — which was , remember , play - acting in the service of a cover story — meant shoving aside Derek ’s grieving widow , Elaine , and her two shattered children , who had just lost their stepfather .
Nothing of material consequence was found , but a useful bit of embroidery was added to the cover story .
Less than two weeks earlier , Derek and Elaine had celebrated their first anniversary .
The Delaware State Police officer is guilty of misprision of perjury , as are the officials who collaborated in this deception .
And it ’s entirely likely that the Virginia State Police had guilty knowledge as well .
Last November 21 , in an attempt to pre-empt public outrage , the highest officials of the Delaware State Police issued a press release in conjunction with their counterparts from Virginia .
The statement is a work of unalloyed mendacity .
 Hale resisted arrest and was shot and killed by Wilmington Police on November 6 , 2006 ,  lied the signatories with reference to the claim that he " resisted . "
 Hale was at the center of a long term narcotics trafficking investigation which is still ongoing . 
As we ’ve seen , Hale did not resist arrest , as everyone on the scene knew .
And he was not at the center of any investigation ; before his posthumous promotion to un-indicted co-conspirator ,  he was merely a person of interest because of his affiliation with a motorcycle club .
Most critically , the statement — which bears the august imprimatur of both the Delaware and Virginia State Police departments , remember — asserts :  Both [ State Police ]
Superintendents have confirmed that there was never any false information exchanged by either agency in the investigation of Derek J. Hale , or transmitted between the agencies in order to obtain the search warrant . 
This was another lie .
 Delaware State Police spokesperson Sgt. Melissa Zebley conceded last week that no arrest warrant for Hale was ever issued ,  reported the News Journal on March 22 .
Three days after Hale was murdered , police arrested 12 members of the Pagans Motorcycle Club on various drug and weapons charges , but identified Hale at that point only as a person of interest . 
Last Friday ( May 23 ) , the Rutherford Institute — one of the precious few nominally conservative activist groups that gives half a damn about individual liberty — and a private law firm in Virginia filed a civil rights lawsuit against several Delaware law enforcement and political officials on behalf of Derek ’s widow and parents .
They really should consider including key officials from the Virginia State Police in the suit , as well .
Those who persist in fetishizing local police — who are , at this point , merely local franchises of a unitary , militarized , Homeland Security apparatus — should ponder this atrocity long and hard .
They should contemplate not only the inexplicable eagerness of Lt. William Brown to kill a helpless , paralyzed pseudo - suspect , but also the practiced ease with which the police establishments of two states collaborated in confecting a fiction to cover up that crime .
According to the lawsuit , Lt. Brown , Derek ’s murderer , has violated the constitutional rights of others in the past through the improper use of deadly force and has coached other WPD officers on how to lie about and / or justify the improper use of deadly force . 
Rather than being cashiered , Brown was promoted — just as one would expect of any other dishonest , cowardly thug in the service of any other Third World death squad .
Derek J. Hale survived two tours of duty in Iraq , a country teeming with Pentagon - trained death squads , only to be murdered by their home - grown equivalent .

Debate about e-voting technology may be only just beginning
The county 's electoral official , Blanche Kapustin , says : " When they look at the screen they 'll see that the name of the person they 've selected has turned red .
There 's also a gigantic tick mark next to that person 's name .
" They return to the summary screen , press the " next " button and once they press the " vote " button that 's the end . "
The data , which is collected on a memory device , is taken to a central location to be processed .
But opponents of e-voting say the current system is fundamentally flawed because there is no way that a voter 's intent can ever be proved by anyone , once they have walked away from the screen .
The message is that computers cannot be trusted .
Teresa Hommel , of the website Where 's The Paper ? , says : " If the computers produced a verifiable paper ballot , meaning a printout that the voter would verify before leaving the booth , that then goes into a locked ballot box , and then those paper ballots are publicly counted .
" That would restore the public oversight of the election process . "
' Chads ' controversy
E-voting machines will be used across much of the state of Maryland .
Authorities there say creating an instantaneous paper trail for the public would be logistically difficult , given that every person would have to receive a piece of paper five feet long .
A recount of these strips would take months .
Linda Lamone , of Maryland State Board of Elections , adds : " Under Maryland law any voting system , or any part of any voting system , has to be tested against Federal standards .
" There are no Federal standards for printers .
They 're probably in development but they 're not here now .
" So to install printers on this voting system would be violating Maryland law . "
Historically , a paper trail is not always 100 % reliable .
The " Votomatic " was at the centre of a huge controversy in Florida during the extremely close 2000 presidential election .
The voter selected a candidate by using a hole punch to push out a tiny piece of paper , called a " chad " , next to the name .
Florida election officials recounted ballots looking for " hanging " , " dimpled " and " pregnant " chads .
Multiple votes ?
But paper is just one issue .
Maryland uses the Diebold AccuVote - TS machine , which is among the most controversial .
It would be very easy to build smart cards that would let you vote multiple times
Professor Avi Rubin , Johns Hopkins university
One of the leading critics of Diebold is Professor Avi Rubin , of John Hopkins university , who downloaded a version of the company 's machine code from the internet and analysed it for security problems .
Professor Rubin says : " We found that the way they were protecting the vote tallies on the machines was incorrect .
" The votes were stored on a magnetic card in an unprotected fashion so that anybody who had access to them could change them .
" They also implemented incorrectly the mechanism by which you can only vote once ...
" It would be very easy to build smart cards that would let you vote multiple times .
" In some precincts you could get away with that because people are n't watching vigilantly . "
Despite all these caveats , interest in e-voting has surged since 2002 , when the states were given a use - it - or - lose - it pot of money , worth nearly $ 4 billion , to introduce new technology into polling booths .
Many of the people interviewed in Maryland , Virginia and Washington DC say that if you think the debate about the technology behind e-voting is spirited now , just wait until the day after the election results are announced .

Unsure of how long it would take me to locate Chin ’s monastery , I woke up early , again , so that I could go meet him and get back in time to get some breakfast before heading out with Jenny .
All I had was the name of his monastery and the district of town that it was located in .
I walked across the street from my guesthouse to the hoard of drivers sitting over there waiting for someone to need a ride .
I walked out of the guesthouse with the specific purpose of hiring one of them , which they picked up on right away and surrounded me as soon as I was near , all shouting prices , telling me they were the best driver for the job , that they ’d give me the best tour of the city , take me to Angkor Wat , etc .
Some of them spoke remarkable English , and some of them were pretty convincing salesmen , but for such a simple ride , and a remedial task , I wanted to hire one of the guys who seemed like he may not get as much work as the rest of them , so I picked out one of the older , quieter guys in the group and started trying to explain to him where I wanted to go .
There was an absolute lapse in communication as he spoke no English whatsoever , but fortunately , the good willed Cambodians held no ill will towards him for my choosing him rather than them and were eager to help him figure out where I wanted to go .
I envisioned this scenario happening place in Chicago , and saw the cabbies having a bad attitude towards me for not choosing them and leaving my chosen driver and me on our own , but not here , here they seemed happy to help , even with no hope for financial gain .
With a vague concept of where we wanted to go , I hopped on the back of my driver ’s motorbike .
I suppose it makes sense in retrospect , but since this driver probably gets less work , he was unable to afford a sweet bike like some of the other guys who were bigger hustlers , his was a mid-70 ’s Honda motorcycle with a seat made for about one and a half people , leaving me hanging halfway off the back while still pretty much wrapping my legs right around him .
We headed over to the vicinity of the monastery and I just started shouting the name of it to passersby as we drove trying to solicit some idea of where it was and if we were headed in the right direction .
Through a series of right and wrong directions from pedestrians , we ended up on a small road that ran perpendicular to the main road through town and we headed down it .
Having rained a tad the night before , the dirt road was now thick mud with several holes whose depth was immeasurable by looking at it .
My brilliant driver did an excellent job of negotiating this terrible section of road , weaving clear across the width of it in an attempt to dodge certain capsizing , until we came to a patch where the road was flooded from side to side .
His mantra seemed to be to just maintain velocity and we would push our way through anything , so without hesitating , we punched it and we headed straight into what turned out to be about two feet of water , hitting a relatively large pothole halfway through it nearly sending us to the ground .
Somehow he pulled it off and we emerged from this swamp on the other side , unscathed , and covered in mud from the knee down .
Fortunately I was wearing flip flops and the same denim shorts I ’d been wearing for a week , so now I was disgustingly dirty ; nothing a hose ca n’t take care of though .
As it turned out , we had a bit of an audience standing nearby who got a kick out of the sight of my five and a half foot driver driving a six and a half foot westerner through a massive puddle , but were the most helpful people we had come across thus far and informed us , through a lot of pointing and gesturing , that the monastery was about 30 yards down the street , in the direction we ’d just come from .
Thankful for their directions , but resentful of their not having been standing on the nearside of the lake , we boarded our hog and make a sweeping u-turn to hit the monstrosity head on once again , this time with a bit less speed and a good idea of which line not to take through it , and we made it through without a hitch , more mud , but no potholes .
We stopped next to what looked sort of like dorms ; a row of about ten huts with monks robes hanging out to dry in front of them across the road from a temple .
I got off the bike and made sure my driver knew he was driving me back and to not leave me at the monastery , and I began walking around looking for someone to ask about Chin Vanna ’s whereabouts .
Right as I walked into the little dirt courtyard that all of the huts lead out to , Chin emerged from one of them with the large metal bowl that young monks are always seen carrying and his robe half wrapped around him .
With his upper body exposed it was clear that the students , while educated for free , are certainly malnourished ; his ribs all stuck out and his arms could n’t have been any bigger around than those of a twelve year olds .
He was just as surprised to see me as I was to have him be the first person I saw at the monastery .
He came over and we greeted one another .
He saw that I had the book in my hand and seemed in utter shock that I had pulled through in not only buying the book but in tracking him down at his home to deliver it .
I tried for a minute to ask him how his night was , how his morning was going , and what he was doing today , but soon remembered how difficult small talk is with a difficultly penetrated language barrier , and promptly moved on to the subject of the book .
I looked down at the photocopied version of “ The Alchemist ” and handed it to him , he grabbed it from my hand with humility and seemed almost ashamed to be taking the gift , but equally as excited and thankful for it .
In his broken English he said thank you and that he was really looking forward to reading it and had spent the night wondering if I would actually show up or not .
I told him not to mention it and that it was a pleasure to meet him and that I was very fond of him .
He then said , “ I do n’t know how I can ever repay you for this . ”
My first inclination was that he meant monetarily , but I quickly shed that thought and realized he meant he would n’t ever be able to repay the good deed .
I merely told him not even to think about that , and that the only thing I wanted in return was for him to read it and allow it to do for his life what the book did for mine .
He nodded his head in aggreeance , and thanked me again .
Tears had welled up in both of our eyes by this time , and I continued to reiterate his dreams and told him to study hard , work towards his goals , and get out of Cambodia to raise his family out from under the corruption and aside from the poverty that his family was buried in .
Unable to respond , we engaged in a long handshake , and knowing we would never see each other again , we bowed to one another , I turned and left .
My driver was waiting where I ’d left him , and with no way of understanding what was being said between Chin and I , by the smile he had on his face , he knew exactly what was going on .
We nodded to one another , acknowledging the moment , and off we rode , down the muddy road .
I looked back over my shoulder , and as though out of a movie , I saw Chin looking down at the book , and looking up right as I turned around , we made a final eye contact , he waived , I smiled and nodded , and he disappeared around the corner we just took which almost flung me off of the motorbike since I was n’t ready for it .
Doing things for people who you will see again feels good .
Giving money to a homeless person in your hometown is a great feeling , even though there is the distinct chance that you may run into them again the next time you walk down that street , but doing something completely selfless for someone who you know you will never see again , with out any form of gratification besides your own , is something that ’s truly unparalleled .

" Why I Jumped Ship to Smalltalk , and How Ruby Can Learn From It " . > >
You discussed this a bit on the IOWA list and a couple folks thought > we should bring the discussion over here .
Are you up to providing > a brief summary ?
Julian 's already answered this somewhat , but I 'll give a brief summary as well .
There were two huge advantages to Smalltalk for what I wanted to do with IOWA .
They may not be as important to other people or projects , but they were enough of an advantage for this particular purpose to make the port more than worthwhile .
For other purposes , in other contexts , I continue to use Ruby .
The first has to do with the environment .
The Smalltalk development environment ( and there 's really only one , reproduced with minor variations for every major dialect ) is in itself beautiful : I can go into great detail for those interested in IDEs , but suffice to say that the integration of code browsers , debuggers , inspectors , interactive workspaces , code analysis tools , etc , is unparalleled ; VisualAge for Java had a small hint of it , but Eclipse , for example , does n't even come close .
The crucial feature for me , however is this : the Smalltalk environment has no concept of an edit / run cycle .
Instead , your application is constantly running , in the same process as the environment , and any change you make is made to running code ( for example , each method is compiled to byte code as you finish editing it , and is inserted into the live class ; if you add an instance variable to a class , every instance of that class is tracked down and copied into a new structure with space for the extra inst var ) .
This is nice in general , but it is almost essential for web development .
On many occasions , I have pushed new code to a running web application as a user was halfway through a session , in response to their questions about bugs or missing features ( " What do you mean , that feature 's not there ?
Look again ... " ) .
I would never trust Ruby when doing this , as there are too many gotchas .
Modifying and reloading a .rb file into a running app is not in general a safe operation , and so the user 's session would have to be interrupted , the application restarted , and the session started again from scratch .
Note that this is n't a problem with stateless web apps ( ie , mod_ruby or PHP scripts ) , but the style of web development I do involves long running applications with large amounts of server side state .
The only reliable way to achieve this in Ruby is to have the development environment track changes to source code as actions , not simply diffs to a text file .
That is , removing a method from a class should log somewhere a call to undef_method , changing the superclass of a class should result in something like MyClass = Class.new ( NewSuper ) , and so on .
This leads naturally to a system that stores code not in simple text files , but in some kind of database that inherently knows about objects like classes and methods ; this , in turn , leads to the complaints about not being able to use tools like CVS .
A likely less reliable alternative that I 've thought a bit about would be a smart diff reader - something that could infer an undef_method from the removal of some lines from a text file .
The second has to do with reification .
Everything ( and I mean * everything * ) in Smalltalk can be accessed and manipulated as Smalltalk objects .
The particular instance of this that was useful to me was the ability to manipulate stack frames : Seaside requires a particular variant of call / cc to do some cool but necessary magic ( of which , more perhaps later ) .
Now , Smalltalk does n't even have call / cc , in general , but I was able to implement it in about 10 lines of Smalltalk code because the stack was directly manipulatable .
If I were doing the same thing in Ruby I would have to write a fairly complex C module instead .
It 's a little easier in Smalltalk because so much of the core is directly written in Smalltalk itself ( including the compiler , standard library , development environment , etc ) , but I strongly recommend that as much of Ruby 's internals be exposed as Ruby objects as possible .
Robert Feldt and the RubyVM folk have of course done some work in this direction , but I would be very happy to see it made more of a priority .
Cheers , Avi
Sitting humbly on shelves in stores everywhere is a product , priced at less than $ 3 , that will change the world .
Soon .
It is a fairly ordinary item that nonetheless cuts to the heart of a half - dozen of the most profound , most urgent problems we face .
Energy consumption .
Rising gasoline costs and electric bills .
Greenhouse - gas emissions .
Dependence on coal and foreign oil .
Global warming .

The product is the compact fluorescent lightbulb , a quirky - looking twist of frosted glass .
In the energy business , it is called a “ CFL , ” or an “ energy saver . ”
One scientist calls it an “ ice - cream - cone spiral , ” because in its most - advanced , most - appealing version , it looks like nothing so much as a cone of swirled soft - serve ice cream .
Most people have some experience with swirl bulbs , but typically it has n’t been happy .
In the early 1990s , you would step into a room in a business traveler ’s hotel , flip on the lights by the door and between the beds , turn on the desk lamp and the floor lamp , then stand in the gloom looking around and thinking , “ There must be another switch somewhere that actually turns on the light . ”
Every one of the bulbs flickering to life was a compact fluorescent–and five of them together did n’t provide enough light to read the card listing the lineup of cable - TV channels .
For two decades , CFLs lacked precisely what we expect from lightbulbs : strong , unwavering light ; quiet ; not to mention shapes that actually fit in the places we use bulbs .
Now every one of those problems has been conquered .
The bulbs come on quickly ; their light is bright , white , steady , and silent ; and the old U - shaped tubes–they looked like bulbs from a World War II submarine –have mostly been replaced by the swirl .
Since 1985 , CFLs have changed as much as cell phones and portable music players .
One thing has n’t changed : the energy savings .
Compact fluorescents emit the same light as classic incandescents but use 75 % or 80 % less electricity .
What that means is that if every one of 110 million American households bought just one ice - cream - cone bulb , took it home , and screwed it in the place of an ordinary 60 - watt bulb , the energy saved would be enough to power a city of 1.5 million people .
One bulb swapped out , enough electricity saved to power all the homes in Delaware and Rhode Island .
In terms of oil not burned , or greenhouse gases not exhausted into the atmosphere , one bulb is equivalent to taking 1.3 million cars off the roads .
That ’s the law of large numbers–a small action , multiplied by 110 million .
advertisement
The single greatest source of greenhouse gases in the United States is power plants –half our electricity comes from coal plants .
One bulb swapped out : enough electricity saved to turn off two entire power plants–or skip building the next two .
Just one swirl per home .
The typical U.S. house has between 50 and 100 “ sockets ” ( astonish yourself : Go count the bulbs in your house ) .
So what if we all bought and installed two ice - cream - cone bulbs ?
Five ?
Fifteen ?
Says David Goldstein , a PhD physicist , MacArthur “ genius ” fellow , and senior energy scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council : “ This could be just what the world ’s been waiting for , for the last 20 years . ”
Swirl bulbs do n’t just work , they pay for themselves .
They use so little power compared with old reliable bulbs , a $ 3 swirl pays for itself in lower electric bills in about five months .
Screw one in , turn it on , and it ’s not just lighting your living room , it ’s dropping quarters in your pocket .
The advantages pile up in a way to almost make one giddy .
Compact fluorescents , even in heavy use , last 5 , 7 , 10 years .
Years .
Install one on your 30th birthday ; it may be around to help illuminate your 40th .
In an era when political leaders and companies are too fainthearted to ask Americans to sacrifice anything for the greater good , the modern ice - cream swirl bulb requires no sacrifice .
Buying and using it helps save the world–and also saves the customer money –with no compromise on quality .
Selflessness and self - satisfaction , twirled into a single $ 3 purchase .
So far , the impact of compact fluorescents has been trivial , for a simple reason :
We have n’t bought them .
In our outdated experience , they do n’t work well and they cost too much .
Last year , U.S. consumers spent about $ 1 billion to buy about 2 billion lightbulbs – 5.5 million every day .
Just 5 % , 100 million , were compact fluorescents .
First introduced on March 28 , 1980 , swirls remain a niche product , more curiosity than revolution .
advertisement
But that ’s about to change .
It will change before our very eyes .
A year from now , chances are that you yourself will have installed a swirl or two , and will likely be quite happy with them .
In the name of conservation and good corporate citizenship , not to mention economics , one unlikely company is about haul us to the lightbulb aisle , reeducate us , and sell us a swirl : Wal - Mart .
In the next 12 months , starting with a major push this month , Wal - Mart wants to sell every one of its regular customers – 100 million in all–one swirl bulb .
In the process , Wal - Mart wants to change energy consumption in the United States , and energy consciousness , too .
It also aims to change its own reputation , to use swirls to make clear how seriously Wal - Mart takes its new positioning as an environmental activist .
It ’s a bold goal , a remarkable declaration of Wal - Mart ’s intention to modernize and green up a whole line of business using market oomph .
Teaming up with General Electric , which owns about 60 % of the residential lightbulb market in the United States , Wal - Mart wants to single - handedly double U.S. sales for CFLs in a year , and it wants demand to surge forward after that .
Diane Lindsley , the hardware buyer who decides what goes in the lightbulb aisles at Wal - Mart , thinks 100 million swirls is perfectly reasonable .
“ Yes , ” she says , “ it ’s rational , I think . ”
Before she started buying bulbs for Wal - Mart just three years ago , Lindsley did n’t even know what CFLs were .
Now she pauses in a way that suggests the kind of determination Wal - Mart can bring to bear when its buyers decide they are going to sell Americans something .
“ We have plans in place to where it may not take that long . ”
“ Think how many games Wal - Mart has changed .
There ’s no reason they ca n’t change this game . ”
Which presents a daunting challenge : Wal - Mart ’s push into swirls wo n’t just help consumers and the environment ; it will shatter a business–its own lightbulb business , and that of every lightbulb manufacturer .
Because swirls last so long , every one that ’s sold represents the loss of 6 or 8 or 10 incandescent bulb sales .
Swirls will remake the lightbulb industry –dominated by familiar names GE , Philips , Sylvania –the way digital - music downloads have remade selling albums on CD , the way digital cameras revolutionized selling film and envelopes of snapshots .
CFLs are a classic example of creative destruction .
GE , facing the prospect of mothballing a centurylong franchise in lightbulbs–well , GE is smiling and swallowing hard .
“ CFLs are taking off , ” says Robert Stuart , who heads consumer marketing at GE for lightbulbs .
“ No one has been as vocal about this recently as Wal - Mart .
One hundred million bulbs in a year ?
It ’s an aggressive goal .
GE will find a way to make sure they are able to do that . ”
advertisement
GE , too , has launched a green business initiative : ecomagination , an effort to make environmentally sustainable technologies an ever - larger part of GE ’s business .
Swirls fit well , despite the inevitable cannibalization .
“ The real issue is , if we do n’t do it , someone else will , ” says GE ’s ecomagination vice president , Lorraine Bolsinger , of Wal - Mart ’s effort to push CFLs .
“ It ’s old thinking to imagine that you can hold on to a business model and outsmart the consumer .
You can ’t . ”
Steven Hamburg is an associate professor at Brown University , an expert on energy consumption and global warming who helped Wal - Mart think through the spiral - bulb strategy .
“ Can they change the game ?
Think how many games Wal - Mart has changed .
There ’s no reason they ca n’t change this game . ”
Fan -Fare For Chuck Kerby , it was ceiling fans that made the impact of energy - saving swirl bulbs dramatically clear .
Kerby is a vice president and divisional merchandise manager at Wal - Mart for hardware and paint ( and ceiling fans ) for all of Wal - Mart ’s U.S. stores and supercenters .
Lindsley is one of 12 buyers working for him .
Kerby , who started out collecting shopping carts from the parking lot of Wal - Mart # 189 in Kirksville , Missouri , 23 years ago , has known about CFLs for years .
“ I became aware of them when I would travel and go into a hotel room . ”
Last year , conversations started in Wal - Mart around the potential of swirls to save customers money on utility bills .
“ Somebody asked , ‘ What difference would it make if we changed the bulbs in the ceiling - fan display to CFLs ? ' ” says Kerby .
A typical Wal - Mart has 10 models of ceiling fans on display , each with four bulbs .
Forty bulbs per store , 3,230 stores .
“ Someone went off and did the math , ” says Kerby .
“ They told me we could save $ 6 million in electric bills by changing the incandescents to CFLs in more than 3,000 Wal - Marts .
I could n’t believe it .
I did n’t know I was paying $ 6 million to light those fixtures .
I said , that ca n’t be right , go back and do the math again . ”
The numbers came out the same the second time : savings of $ 6 million a year .
“ That , for me , was an ‘ I got it ’ moment . ”

It was Lee Scott , Wal - Mart ’s CEO , who started Kerby and Lindsley thinking about lightbulbs .
“ Last fall , ” says Kerby , “ we had had two hurricanes ” –Katrina and Rita– “ we had oil production disrupted , we had millions of people displaced in the South , and at a Friday officer ’s meeting not long after Katrina , Lee Scott said , ‘ Our customers are hurting , our customers ’ dollar is not going as far as it could . ’
He challenged everyone in the room to find relevant rollbacks , to lower the price of living and make a difference for our customers . ”
( Wal - Mart - ers really talk that way among themselves . )
In the wake of Katrina , Scott had asked his staff for a briefing on environmental issues , including global warming .
One of the people he sat down with was Hamburg , the Brown professor who has won an award from the EPA for his ability to explain climate change .
“ It was a very frank conversation , ” says Hamburg .
Not much of a Wal - Mart shopper , he had looked at one piece of Wal - Mart ’s environmental performance before .
In 1994 , he critiqued Wal - Mart ’s first environmentally sensitive store .
“ As I told Lee , it was a lot of green - wash .
He needed to do better ….
I said , ‘ What really matters is what ’s on the shelves .
Wal - Mart ’s influence is much greater in the marketplace than in the built environment . ' ”
Hamburg has been working with CFLs since the 1980s , so that subject naturally was on the table with Scott .
“ I think he knew what they were , ” says Hamburg .
“ I said , ‘ It ’s a very direct return to your consumers , and it has a big positive impact on reducing carbon emissions .
So let ’s do it .
You do it . ' ”
The spirals , you could say , were converging .
After Scott ’s exhortation at the Friday officers meeting , Kerby did what a lot of Wal - Mart - ers do when they need to think and reconnect .
He went shopping at Wal - Mart .
“ I went across the street to # 100 , ” says Kerby .
“ I thought about what people rebuilding would need , I thought about energy costs , I filled the cart , and I brought it all back to the office .
I challenged the buyers to look for ways to save money on these important products . ”
One item in his cart : a three - pack of GE compact fluorescents , 60 - watt equivalents , for $ 9.58 –$ 3.19 each .
You could buy three four - packs of classic GE 60 - watt bulbs for that price , 12 regulars for the price of one spiral .

To Diane Lindsley , her boss ’s point was crystal clear .
“ I called GE , ” says Lindsley .
“ We started negotiating . ”
Within two weeks , the price on a three - pack of GE spirals at Wal - Marts across the country was “ rolled back ” to $ 7.58 .
It was a 21 % cut–although the bulbs were still $ 2.53 each , 10 times the cost of an ordinary bulb .
The agreement with GE was for a 90 - day price cut , to help out after Katrina .
Did it make a difference in CFL sales ?
“ Absolutely , ” says Lindsley .
“ Faster than I ’ve ever seen it before .
In days . ”
Then , in late October , says Kerby , “ Our friend Oprah had a segment on her show talking about CFL lightbulbs .
We did n’t ask her to do that or anything .
But there certainly is an Oprah factor out there .
That show led to a tremendous sales increase in the category that we have maintained to this day . ”
Month over month , Lindsley is selling double the number of spirals she did before Katrina .
It was a perfect swirl : Katrina , Rita , $ 70 - a - barrel oil , price - chopping , corporate consciousness - raising , with Oprah ’s lightbulb club thrown in .

“ What had started as , ‘ Let ’s do something to help the consumer for 90 days , ’ well , it became obvious this was n’t a 90 - day strategy , ” says Kerby .
“ World events had changed the lightbulb category .
The time had come for the energy - saving lightbulbs .
It was going to be a different kind of product going forward . ”
Inside the Bulb Incandescent lightbulbs and spiral lightbulbs make light in entirely different ways , and it is that difference that makes spirals so potent .
In a classic 60 - watt incandescent bulb , light comes from the little metal filament quivering inside the sealed glass bulb .
Electricity passes through the metal thread , heating it to 2,300 degrees Celsius , and the filament glows with the heat and throws off light .
Electricity creates heat , heat creates light .
It ’s why incandescent bulbs are so hot –the glass is often 300 degrees .
In the trade , incandescents are sometimes known as “ a hot wire in a bottle . ”
Compact fluorescents are something else again .
In a fluorescent bulb , the glass tube is filled with gas and a tiny dot of mercury .
Electricity leaps off electrodes on either end of the tube and excites the mercury molecules , which have a special property :
When so excited , they emit ultraviolet light .
That invisible UV light strikes the bulb ’s phosphor coating , which itself gets excited and emits visible light , which shines out through the tube .
Heat is much less of a factor–CFLs run at about 100 degrees .
Making the ionized fog bottled inside a CFL dance to the same steady tune as an incandescent has required a lot of research , and an electronics revolution .
Early CFLs cost $ 25 per bulb ( and still paid for themselves in electricity savings ) .
The light they produced was bluish or pinkish , or varied ; the phosphor coating had to be refined .
The ballast–built into the bulb rather than in a separate fixture , as with traditional fluorescent tubes–hummed and did n’t cycle the electricity quickly enough ; it had to be made electronic and miniaturized .
Costs came down , as did size .
The same wizardry that gives us Hallmark birthday cards that play “ Love and Happiness ” makes possible CFLs at $ 2.60 instead of $ 25 .
It is this –the way swirls make light –that saves so much energy .
In an incandescent , only 5 % to 10 % of the electricity passing through the wire becomes visible light ; the rest becomes heat and invisible UV light .
The vibrating mercury vapor atoms in a fluorescent bulb produce light more efficiently than a tungsten filament .
You get more photons for every watt of electricity pumped in .
An old - fashioned incandescent makes 15 lumens per watt ; a 60 - watt bulb shines with 900 lumens .
In a CFL , you get 60 lumens per watt .
To get 900 lumens –to get the light you expect from a 60 - watt bulb –you need only 15 watts .
A 60 - watt classic bulb and a 15 - watt swirl are identically bright –the swirl just uses 45 fewer watts .

The Swirl Cascade
What really revolutionizes the lightbulb experience , and the business itself , is a second quality of swirls , beyond their ability to squeeze more light from a kilowatt : their longevity .
The compact fluorescents that GE , Philips , and Sylvania are putting on shelves are rated to run for 8,000 , 10,000 , or 12,000 hours .
Few bulbs in a home are lit more than four hours a day ; at that rate , an 8,000 - hour bulb lasts five - and - a - half years ; a 12,000 - hour bulb lasts eight years and three months .
As swirls take hold , it will be a surprise , a novel event , when a lightbulb goes dark .
Imagine all those hard - to - reach bulbs that need to be replaced every three months .
From four times a year , to once a decade .
“ This is about selling lightbulbs , but it ’s far bigger .
This has huge implications for the world . ”
And the impact of swirls cascades outward .
Since every CFL has the life span of 6 , or 8 , or 10 equivalent incandescent bulbs , if Wal - Mart alone sells 100 million swirls in the next year , it does away with the need for 100 million old - fashioned bulbs to be manufactured , packaged , shipped , bought , and discarded next year–and every year until 2012 or beyond .
How much is 100 million bulbs ?
It ’s 25 million classic GE four - packs .
That many boxes of bulbs would fill 262 Wal - Mart tractor trailers , a ghost convoy of Wal - Mart trucks , loaded with nothing but lightbulbs , stretching 3.5 miles–a convoy that will never roll .
Every year for six years –just from one bulb , this year .
Not to mention the line of garbage trucks necessary to cart 100 million burned - out incandescent bulbs to the landfill .
What you do n’t make , of course , you never get to sell .
As enthusiasm for compact fluorescents mounted in Bentonville , there were multiple strategy meetings between the Wal - Mart lightbulb people and the GE lightbulb people –including a conversation January 12 between Lee Scott and GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt in which swirls were a significant topic .
GE had launched its ecomagination business push in May 2005 –neatly summarized by Lorraine Bolsinger : “ Green can be green . ”
Scott launched Wal - Mart ’s sustainability repositioning last October in a speech to his own executives .
Understanding the power of the CFL , Scott told them , had helped him see that environmental problems are really a disaster like “ Katrina in slow motion . ”
Pledging to take Wal - Mart and its customers and suppliers down a new path , he declared , “ Environmental problems are our problems . ”
advertisement
Immelt and Scott agreed in January that a major push on swirls was in order .
But strategic enthusiasm does n’t change a simple short - term fact :
Every new energy - saving swirl you sell obliterates sales of six or eight of your classic product .
Incandescents wo n’t ever go away–we still use candles–in part because there are some places CFLs simply do n’t work well .
They are not tiny or elegant enough to be chandelier bulbs .
They do not work as accent lighting .
But in as little as five years , if Wal - Mart sparks a significant conversion to swirls , the lightbulb business will be rocked .
Total unit sales could be half what they are now .
In the short run , there ’s a bonanza : 95 % of sockets in U.S. homes do n’t have swirls in them , and a billion of them , or more , could .
At the moment , with CFLs selling for 10 times what regular bulbs do , there ’s no immediate loss of revenue or profit .
But prices wo n’t stay where they are for long .
At Sam ’s Club , Wal - Mart ’s club - store division , GE swirls already sell at $ 12.73 for an eight - pack – $ 1.59 per bulb , or just six times the cost of old - fashioned bulbs .
At that price , the economics change .
Competition from other retailers will force the price even lower –especially because of what happens next .
Once a third of the sockets in U.S. homes have compact fluorescents–once you sell the bulge of conversion replacements –both incandescent sales and CFL sales will fall off a cliff .
Incandescent bulb sales could be cut in half , because we wo n’t use them any more .
And after we ’ve installed 1.5 billion swirls , we ’ll only be buying perhaps 200 million a year , because they ’re on a six - or eight - year replacement cycle .
Executives at Wal - Mart are already imagining a day when the shelf space for lightbulbs is cut by 30 % or 40 % .
For Wal - Mart , the appeal of swirls is clear , even to GE executives .
“ Wal - Mart sees its customer putting more money in the gas tank , more into electrical bills –their customer is saying , ‘ I need some help , ' ” says Bolsinger .
“ They are very close to that .
If they can help a customer save money in the long haul , that ’s money that comes back to Wal - Mart . ”
Once Wal - Mart decides to make swirls an important product , the appeal for GE also becomes clear .
It ’s the power of the big dog : GE can either help Wal - Mart sell swirls , or some other lightbulb company will .
In either case , GE ’s regular - bulb business shrivels .
“ The business case is pretty clear , ” says Bolsinger .
“ If we do n’t grab the market share of CFLs , we lose . ”
The only way to survive creative destruction , in fact , is to get out in front of the tsunami , to catch the wave .
In the spring , Diane Lindsley changed the way she stocks her 60 feet of lightbulb shelves .
Like other merchants , she has struggled for years with whether to group energy - saving bulbs in their own section for conservation geeks , or to mix them in with regular bulbs in the hope more customers will try them .
Either way , particularly for a shopper schooled by Wal - Mart itself to focus on price , CFLs that cost 10 times what a dependable 60 - watt cost are a hard sell .
advertisement
Inspired by last fall ’s rush of swirl sales , Lindsley moved dramatically to emphasize them on her shelves .
She decided to have it both ways –to group CFLs together and mix them with regular bulbs .
She has made swirls the most prominent bulbs in the store :
They are now on the top two or three shelves , at eye level , with the old - fashioned bulbs on the bottom .
The prominence is eye - catching –three or four sections of shelves , with bright yellow and green packages of GE CFLs .
Horizontally , the swirls form a band of energy savers that stretch down a third of the aisle .
Vertically , each shelf unit is both energy savers and incandescents — 60 - watt - equivalent swirls on top , old - fashioned 60 - watts below .
For bulbs , “ that ’s the most coveted shelf space in the entire store , ” says Bolsinger .
“ It was a bold move on Wal - Mart ’s part to put it there . ”
Lindsley was taking a risk , giving swirls shelf space their sales did n’t quite justify .
She was positioning them prominently to drive sales , and in anticipation of more growth .
An even more dramatic push is coming this month , when Wal - Mart will roll out a lightbulb education center in every U.S. store .
The display , developed with GE , shows 10 categories of lightbulbs , organized by room through a typical home , with a box showing the CFL appropriate in that area , the equivalent incandescent , and the energy savings a customer can reap from switching .
Each category features a warm lifestyle photo of the room in question .
Each box is color - coded to match color - coding on the shelves of CFL bulbs .
For a company that measures sales of its merchandise per running foot of shelf space , giving up 12 feet of stock space to a static display , however entrancing , represents a significant investment .
Lindsley is evaluated in part based on the bulbs she sells , and “ I have to perform , of course , ” she says .
“ I have to have my sales .
I think about it differently .
I think about it daily .
But this is absolutely the right thing to do . ”
This is at least as big a deal for GE .
Between 2004 and 2005 , it tripled its manufacturing capacity for compact fluorescents .
By the end of 2006 , GE will have tripled capacity again .
Anticipating the shift to swirls , it plans to close an incandescent bulb factory in St. Louis .
Making compact fluorescents is expensive and complicated , compared with incandescents , in part because of the electronic controls each bulb contains , and in part because swirls remain partly handcrafted .
To make each spiral , a Chinese worker wearing gloves takes a tube of glass , holds it over an open flame , then wraps the heat - softened tube around a metal form .
The job requires a deft touch so the tube does n’t become flattened while getting its spiral shape .
advertisement
“ For us , ” says Bolsinger , “ the opportunity is to sell enough of them , to get down the [ manufacturing ] cost curve .
We ’re still pretty early in the learning curve . ”
Greater automation would allow GE to both continue to reduce the price of swirls and keep a margin that softens the blow to the incandescent side of the business .
This fall , GE will rebrand its CFLs as “ energy smart ” bulbs–in an effort to give them a clear identity equivalent to “ soft white ” –and launch a major print advertising campaign to support the Wal - Mart push .
Working with Wal - Mart , GE has made its bulb packaging both more dramatic and more explicit–it promises that the 60 - watt equivalent “ saves $ 38 in energy . ”
Spend $ 2.60 , earn $ 38 .
These days , that ’s a great return .
At the Wal - Mart home office , they talk about swirls with a zeal that goes beyond product promotion , as if the bulbs are a pioneering product , a new way of thinking about retailing .
Says Andrew Ruben , Wal - Mart ’s vice president of sustainability : “ We realize that we can influence big things .
Energy usage .
Efficiency .
Dependence on foreign oil .
And we realized that if we ’re really going to move things , it ’s not about our direct footprint–our stores , our offices–it ’s about our supply chain and our customers .
So this is about selling lightbulbs , but it ’s far bigger .
This has huge implications for the world . ”
Chuck Kerby did swap out the ceiling - fan bulbs , at least in most Wal - Marts .
The idea surfaced in November ; it was executed in February .
And Kerby has a clear vision of the future .
“ It ’s certainly possible to see a day when a cartoonist will draw a cartoon with a character having an idea , ” says Kerby , “ you know , with the traditional - shaped incandescent lightbulb going on over the character ’s head–and my grandchildren will look at that and not know what it means .
And that ’s not a bad thing , because we ’ll be living in a much better world . ”

I do n't know .
Xtina is just really starting to rub me the wrong way .
She is n't a legend yet ; and quite frankly I do n't think she will EVER become more than another name mentioned when people are already talking or writing about Mariah or Britney .
At least not until she does something * honest * because that 's the one thing missing from ALL of her albums : honesty .
She 's always forced , fake , and trying too hard to portray some character or image .
There is n't anything particularly unique about her .
Everything that she 's done in her career up to now has been done already .
I think she needs to show more respect to the people who have set the pace and the space for her .
These ARE people like Mariah , Madonna , Britney , and Pink .
No matter how much name - dropping she does of Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday , it 's clear who her REAL inspirations are and that still even comes across on this latest album : all the people she 's dissed .
Aguilera = not an artist , I 'm afraid .
A good singer , but that 's about all there is to Xtina right now .
( And there are a LOT of good singers out there that nobody paid attention to just because they were n't blond and half - naked . )
She has n't set any trends or done anything new .
None of her songs are destined to any kind of memorability or " classic " status .
She even dissed Beyonce too , but that 's pretty much all she is right now : another Beyonce .
Maybe she can dump on Mariah when she 's achieved one - third of the things that Mariah achieved ... in her first 5 years no less ( 10 # 1 's already ) .
Heck , Britney can claim more of a " legend " status than Aguilera can right now .
" Baby One More Time " and " Oops " are damn near iconic for the decade .
So yeah , she 's just really starting to bother me .
Or maybe it's all the tacky red lipstick .

Looks like Xtina has beef with all the people she 's copied .
I 'm just waiting for her to start beefing with Etta James now , lol .
I wrote about how Xtina copies Pink already with the Linda Perry thing , the " oh woe is me " lyrics , the album art and all , so let 's not tread there again .
But among the people Aguilera has made disparaging remarks about are all the people who haveher own music and style .
Did Xtina not talk about how she grew up singing Mariah Carey 's songs ?
And her overdone vocal style does * NOT * come from Etta James or any of her name - dropped legends .
Nope , that 's the Mariah influence right there , where the notes are there just for the sake of being there , lol .
And did Xtina 's first album not tread the same waters that her other former rival Britney Spears popularized with her first album ?
And did her second album not find its inspiration ( and producer ) from Pink 's second album ?
And did her " dirrty " style not rehash what Black R&B and rap perfomers had been doing for the last 10 years at that point : parading around half - naked ?
And what Madonna had done nearly 2 decades before also ?
And not to mention the latest character she 's playing .
Madonna covered that territory already , so did Janet Jackson to a lesser extent .
And the album art again .

The Chinese have just bought another longwall mining system , but instead of the shearer that I had described in the earlier longwall piece these systems will use a plow system to mine the coal .
So I thought I would explain what those machines are , why it is interesting to see the Chinese using them ( and why ) and then perhaps close with a little note on fires underground .
And perhaps have a little comment on EROI thrown in along the way .
The plow also featured in the recent Washington Post story on coal mining .
As I mentioned in summarizing the Conference from last week , it seems as though , whether willingly or not , we are going to be seeing a lot of black coal in our energy future .
I have written a couple of technical talks about coal mining in the past , and , if I can , I ’ll move references to them into The Book later on today , along with the petroleum ones .
( The coal ones are in Chapter 10 , the oil production ones in Chapter 3.2 ) .
So let ’s drop down into my simplified mine model and see what it is I am talking about .
And , since no - one answered my question about the modeling programs , the mine will be empty of workers , and you will have to use your imagination to sense their presence .
Which may , fortuitously , be an indication of the future , since more and more pieces of mining equipment are being automated , or operated remotely , so that manpower is less , and less required .
And this has some benefits beyond just removing people from areas of possible risk .
I was fortunate enough to work with a couple of Dr Charles Hall ’s students over last summer who were looking into EROI issues relating to mining .
The high energy cost to provide the support needed for personnel was particularly striking in some of the situations that they looked into .
And from the EROI point of view , a plow is usually a lot less energy intensive .
Well my model is n’t quite that forward looking , but let ’s start by presuming we have left the surface , and gone down in the cage to the level at which the coal seam lies in the ground .
Since the coal , in general , is thick enough so that people can move around within the coal height , the mine is largely developed by driving parallel tunnels away from the shaft towards the boundaries of the property that is being mined .
( Note that because coal seams can stretch for many miles )
The tunnels run parallel to one another , so that air can be circulated down through some of the tunnels , across the working face , and then back out , through another tunnel , to the shaft that will carry it to the surface .
The tunnels are driven in the same way as coal is mined by Room and Pillar mining .
Figure 1 Overview showing the continuous mining machine ( blue ) loading into a shuttle car
Once the main tunnels have been driven out to the edge of the property , then the coal on either side of them can be recovered .
To mine that coal , secondary sets of tunnels are now offset from what I will call the “ mains . ”
Figure 2
Overview showing how the two sets of side tunnels , forming the gate roads , develop from the main set of drive tunnels that contain the main conveyor belts that will cary the coal back to the shaft .
Once this gets to the edge of the area to be worked , a cross tunnel is driven between the two sets of advancing tunnels , which now form the gates to this cross - tunnel , which becomes the longwall face .
It is into this tunnel that the roof supports are placed , and then a chain conveyor is installed along the tunnel , and the mining machine mounted to the conveyor .
In the previous post this machine was a shearer , with two rotating drums , one at each end , which had metal picks set into them to cut into the coal ..
The drum rotation grinds the coal from the face , generally in pieces smaller than an inch , as the machine pulls itself down the face .
In a plow face , that self - propelled machine is replaced with a machine called , not surprisingly , a plow ( Hobel in German , since this is where the machines were invented ) .
Figure 3
Looking at the coal face with part of the shield canopy removed so that the different pieces of face machinery , including the plow and the face chain conveyor , can be seen .
In contrast with the shearer , the plow is pulled down the coal face by continuous chain attached to a winch mounted at the end of the face .
The teeth of the plow are pushed into the coal by the thrust from the cylinders that are attached to the roof supporting chocks , on the other side of the conveyor .
Every so often , as the plow cuts deeper into the coal , the supports lower the vertical rams , and reverse the action of the horizontal thrusting ram , so as to pull themselves forward into open space behind the plow .
This keeps the immediate roof supported , while that behind the supports falls into the open space , as I have described before .
The plow is thus a much more inert piece of equipment ( though if you have even seen one bash down a face that is not exactly horizontal you might doubt that word ) .
But it has a significant advantage over the shearer , in that , with the body being segmented , individual layers can be removed .
Thus the plow can , more easily , work in thinner coal seams than the shearer can easily be adapted for .
You should note , from the EROI perspective , that the plow does not , usually , break out all the coal by itself , but , as it pulls down the face , so it undercuts the top layer of coal .
And in the type of brittle coal in which the plow works best , that top coal will collapse down onto the conveyor under its own weight .
So why is it interesting that the Chinese are buying more plows .
Well , generally , when you find one coal seam , you will often find a number stacked , one above the other , in a sequence .
Historically the mine owner would look to see which ones were thick enough to be worth mining and the rest would either be left , or would collapse into the waste , and be left as the thicker , underlying seams were mined .
However , by investing in plow systems , these thinner coals can be mined , and taken out before the thicker coal is removed .
In this way more of the total resource is recovered and the thinner seams , which would otherwise be lost and abandoned , since their value will not justify the attempt to return later to recover them .
It is indicative of the thoroughness with which the Chinese ( and Mexicans ) are addressing the different aspects of their need for energy supplies .
The second most scared I have been underground was when , many years ago in Germany , I watched a high - speed plow being pulled down a face that has a roll in it , so that the plow came up off the floor and gouged into the overlying rock roof , generating showers of sparks as it passed .
( Sparks in mines can ignite the methane that is being emitted from the coal , and which , in the right concentrations in the air , can then explode ) .
The majority of the time it is the hot spot left in , usually a sandstone rock , as the cutting pick from a shearer rubs over it , that has both the temperature and the energy to ignite the gas .
The plow can move at up to 3 m/sec , and thus the shoer of sparks can appear ( and did ) very dramatic , but fortunately the seam was not gassy , and they knew much more about what they were doing than I did .
Even so , using machines to mine into rock along a coal face is not only wasteful of energy , but also increases wear , and thus operational costs , and can be a bit more dangerous , depending what that rock is .
Story Highlights • Jay Dobyns went deep undercover in the Hells Angels motorcycle gang
• He claims the ATF is failing to protect him and his family from the Hells Angels
• The ATF says it is reviewing Dobyns ' case
Adjust font size :
MESA , Arizona ( CNN ) --
For nearly two years , Jay Dobyns led a double life .
He rode alongside the Hells Angels , becoming a member of one of the nation 's most feared criminal gangs .
But at the same time , he was working as a federal agent in an effort to bring the Hells Angels down .
Jay Dobyns works for the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , the federal agency responsible for enforcing the nation 's gun laws .
His deep undercover work with the Hells Angels from 2001 - 2003 ultimately helped bring the indictment and trial of 16 gang members and their associates .
As a result , Dobyns was awarded a top cop award by the National Association of Police Organizations .
He also was hailed on America 's Most Wanted as one of the " Good Guys " who brings down the criminals .
But today , just a few years later , Dobyns says that after risking his life on assignment , he has been left vulnerable by the very agency that he proudly served .
( Read Dobyns ' account of faking a murder to get into the Hells Angels )
Feeling abandoned
With his undercover work done and his real identity as a law enforcement agent exposed , Dobyns says the Hells Angels and other gangs enlisted by it came after him , issuing death threats .
Dobyns claims that the ATF -- rather than protecting him -- abandoned him .
( Watch Dobyns explain how he infiltrated the gang )
" There was a murder contract on me and there was what was called a green light list , which was circulating in the prison , which was a list of people that various gangs wanted killed , " Dobyns told CNN .
In response , Dobyns says , the ATF gave him a routine transfer with no special protection , despite his repeated protests .
The ATF could have moved Dobyns and his family under what is known as a " threat policy " -- similar to the kind of protection the government routinely gives witnesses in organized crime cases .
But federal agents who go undercover do n't automatically get a high level of protection , according to Dobyns and other ATF agents CNN interviewed .
" In order to save money , I was told it was n't cost effective , " Dobyns says .
Dobyns says he has moved himself and his family several times to elude those who 've threatened to kill him .
He has filed a claim with the ATF for the emotional stress and financial burden he says he 's had to bear as a result .
( Watch how Dobyns and his family are living in fear )
The ATF responds
In a note to CNN , ATF acting director Michael J. Sullivan wrote that privacy and personnel matters prohibit him from commenting directly on Dobyns ' allegations , but he assured CNN that Dobyns ' allegations are being fully reviewed by the ATF and the Department of Justice .
" [ T ] here is nothing more important to ATF and to me than the safety and protection of our employees and their families .
We at ATF understand that we have a solemn responsibility to protect the people whom we charge to investigate and arrest the country 's most violent criminals , " Sullivan wrote .
But more than a dozen former and current ATF agents interviewed by CNN , many of whom have their own lawsuits , claims and serious concerns , said the ATF is failing to protect its agents .
Charlie Fuller is a 23 - year retired veteran ATF special agent and a former top trainer of undercover agents , who wrote a manual on undercover work , " The Art of Undercover . "
He trained Dobyns and many other top ATF undercover agents .
" What happened to Dobyns is not an isolated incident , " said Fuller .
In many cases , he said , managers do n't thoroughly understand the complexity of the undercover work or how to best work with and manage the agents once they 're back in the real world .
He said agents are seen as troublemakers or retaliated against if they raise complaints or report problems .
" Threats like what Dobyns faced -- this is the most serious thing an ATF agent can face -- the threats against his family , " said Fuller .
" How could they ignore something like that ? "
Asked about Fuller 's claims , the ATF said it would have no further comment for now , saying it would stand on Sullivan 's previous statement .
" As ATF executes its mission to prevent terrorism , reduce violent crime and protect the public , we will continue to place the highest value on ensuring the safety of our employees and their families , " Sullivan said .
This radar map shows the thickness of the south polar layered deposits of Mars ( purple represents the thinnest areas and red the thickest ) .
The dark circle is the area poleward of 87 degrees south latitude , where MARSIS ca n’t collect radar data .
Mars is unlikely to sport beachfront property anytime soon , but the planet has enough water ice at its south pole to blanket the entire planet in more than 30 feet of water if everything thawed out .
With a radar technique , astronomers have penetrated for the first time about 2.5 miles ( nearly four kilometers ) beneath the south pole 's frozen surface .
The data showed that nearly pure water ice lies beneath .
Discovered in the early 1970s , layered deposits of ice and dust cap the North and South Poles of Mars .
Until now , the deposits have been difficult to study closely with existing telescopes and satellites .
The current advance comes from a probe of the deposits using an instrument aboard the Mars Express orbiter .
" This is the first time that a ground - penetrating system has ever been used on Mars , " said the new radar study 's lead author , Jeffrey Plaut of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
" All the other instruments used to study the surface of Mars in the past really have only been sensitive to what occurs at the very surface . "
( NASA 's Mars Odyssey spacecraft also carries instruments designed , among other things , to probe beneath icy polar surfaces . )
Deep probe
Plaut and his colleagues probed the deposits with radar echo sounding , typically used on Earth to study the interiors of glaciers .
The instrument , called the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding , or MARSIS , beams radio waves which penetrate the planet 's surface and bounce off features having different electrical properties .
The reflected beams revealed that 90 percent or more of the frozen polar material is pure water ice , sprinkled with dust particles .
The scientists calculated that the water would form a 36 - foot - deep ocean of sorts if spread over the Martian globe .
" It 's the best evidence that 's been obtained to date for that thickness , " said Ken Herkenhoff , a planetary geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff , Ariz. , who studies the Martian polar regions .
He was not involved in the current study .
Scientists have long known that Mars ' north polar cap is a massive storehouse of water ice , and the current research team says they will use their radar technique to refine past estimates of its thickness and make - up .
Missing water
" These polar ice deposits are by far the largest reservoir of water or water ice that we know of on Mars , " Plaut said .
That 's a lot of water , but not enough to account for the flowing streams thought to meander along Mars ' surface in the past .
" There 's evidence that about 10 times or maybe even 100 times that much water has flowed across the surface of Mars to carve the various channels , the outflow valleys and other features we see in the images and topography data , " Plaut told SPACE.com .
So where 's the rest of the water ?
One idea is that a subterranean plumbing system once ferried loads of water beneath the Martian surface .
Plaut said his team also will search for underground pools with the radar technique .
Martian beach
A Martian water - world is unlikely in the near future , but astronomers have solid evidence that billions of years ago water flowed over the Martian surface .
And recently , evidence has pointed to a warming trend as Mars emerges from an " ice age . "
Scientists think variations in Mars ' orbit and tilt drive the planet 's climate over time , though a few astronomers have speculated about how the Sun 's activity could be partly to blame for warming on several planets .
In addition to warming from the atmosphere , ice - thawing heat could come from the core of Mars , analogous to the plumes of heat that cause volcanic eruptions on Earth .
But evidence from the new radar study suggests the Martian crust is icy cold and rigid .
Dick Cheney 's lawyers agree :
He 's part of the executive branch .
Dems force Cheney to flip - flop on secret docs
Dick Cheney 's office is abandoning a justification for keeping the vice president 's secret papers out of the hands of the National Archives , while asserting a new argument for withholding them .
Officials working for Cheney had tried to claim he is separate from the executive branch , but they will no longer pursue that defense , senior administration officials tell The Politico .
Advertisement
The decision follows a threat by Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( Ill. ) , the No. 3 House Democrat , to try to cut off the office 's $ 4.8 million in executive - branch funding , and a letter from Sen. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass . ) asking for the reasoning behind the argument .
The dispute arose after House Oversight Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman ( D - Calif . ) posted an eight - page letter he had written to Cheney taking issue with what he said was an assertion by the vice president 's office last year that he is " not an ' entity within the executive branch ' and hence is not subject to presidential executive orders . "
The vice president also serves as president of the Senate , a function that is part of the legislative branch .
At issue was an executive order giving the National Archives oversight over the government 's handling of classified information .
David S. Addington , Cheney 's chief of staff and counsel , wrote in a three - paragraph response to Kerry on Tuesday that the executive order on classified national security information does not give the archivists authority over the president or vice president .
Addington said that therefore it " is not necessary in these circumstances to address the subject of any alternative reasoning . "
That amounted to throwing in the towel on the claim that the vice president is distinct from the executive branch , according to administration officials speaking on condition of anonymity , and the White House has no plans to reassert the argument .
Kerry posted Addington 's response on his Senate website , calling the letter " legalistic " and a continued attempt to " duck and dodge on agency scrutiny , classified documents . "
Two senior Republican officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that the rationale had been the view of the vice president 's lawyers , not Cheney himself .
White House spokespeople have been struggling to answer questions about the argument without repeating , amplifying or embracing it .
Blogs , comics and pundits feasted on the neither - fish - nor - fowl argument , with Jon Stewart joking on " The Daily Show " Tuesday night that the vice president may be " half she - wolf . "
Now , a senior administration official tells The Politico : " It 's a moot point to get into executive functions and legislative functions because of the executive order 's intent .
That trumps all , because it is what the president intended . "
Emanuel , who has scheduled a vote on Cheney 's funding for Thursday , said the change makes it clear that the White House " told Cheney that he would have to come up with another excuse -- that this was not sustainable in the public arena . "
Emanuel said the vote is still planned and the new argument means the vice president needs to comply with National Archives requirements .
White House press secretary Tony Snow read from the Addington letter at his briefing on Tuesday but said he was going to leave the constitutional parsing to others .
" The vice president is the president of the Senate , " Snow said .
" It is a wonderful academic question and I 'm just not going to go any further than we 've gone to date . "
Kerry 's office says it has sent Addington a letter with more questions .
A senior Senate aide said Kerry had considered the Cheney contention to be " Orwellian . "
UPDATE : Kerry called the Addington letter " legalistic " and a continued attempt to " duck and dodge on agency scrutiny , classified documents . "
He has posted it on his Senate Web site .
In his original letter , dated Monday , Kerry said : " In the interest of transparency I request the reasoning behind any claims that the Office of the Vice President does not fall under the executive branch .
Additionally , given that the Office of the Vice President has not been issuing reports or allowing inspectors to verify any safeguards , I would like to know what steps the Office is taking to protect classified information . "
" Software testing generally falls under the purview of the quality assurance ( QA ) test team .

The USA trails other industrialized nations in high - speed Internet access and may never catch up unless quick action is taken by public - policymakers , a report commissioned by the Communications Workers of America warns .
The median U.S. download speed now is 1.97 megabits per second — a fraction of the 61 megabits per second enjoyed by consumers in Japan , says the report released Monday .
Other speedy countries include South Korea ( median 45 megabits ) , France ( 17 megabits ) and Canada ( 7 megabits ) .
" We have pathetic speeds compared to the rest of the world , " CWA President Larry Cohen says .
" People do n't pay attention to the fact that the country that started the commercial Internet is falling woefully behind . "
Speed matters on the Internet .
A 10 - megabyte file takes about 15 seconds to download with a 5 - megabit connection — fast for the USA .
Download time with a 545 - kilobit connection , about the entry - level speed in many areas : almost 2½ minutes .
Broadband speed is a function of network capacity :
The more capacity you have , the more speed you can deliver .
Speed , in turn , allows more and better Internet applications , such as photo sharing and video streaming .
Superfast speeds are imperative for critical applications such as telemedicine .
In recent years , communities also have found that good broadband is essential to draw businesses and jobs .
For all those reasons , Cohen says , it is important for policymakers to act now : " In order to maintain our place in today 's global economy — and to create the jobs we need — our government must act . "
The CWA report is based on input from 80,000 broadband users ( less than 5 % of respondents used dial - up ) .
In addition to drawing comparisons with other countries , the report ranks U.S. states on median download speeds .
( Upload speeds are also rated . )
The Federal Communications Commission , which has broad sway over the emerging broadband market , defines " high speed " as 200 kilobits per second .
The benchmark was adopted more than a dozen years ago when still - slower dial - up was the rule .
Cohen says 200 kilobits is not even recognized as broadband in most countries today .
" There is nothing speedy about it . "
The FCC in April opened a proceeding that could result in the redefinition of what can be advertised as " broadband Internet service " in this country .
" We 're asking the question if the definition should be changed , " spokeswoman Tamara Lipper says .
The comment period ended May 31 , and a report from the FCC is likely in the fall .

Please stay on topic and be respectful of others .
Keep the conversation appropriate for interested readers across the map .
A perfect example :
A White House official who attended the meeting , and spoke on condition of anonymity in order to describe details , said Mr. Bush ’s first question to the Democratic leaders was , “ When can you get me a bill ? ”
And , this official said , Mr. Bush told the Democrats that he hoped to ultimately follow several of the guidelines set forth last year in a report by the Iraq Study Group , which called for an eventual draw - down of American troops .
According to the official , Mr. Bush noted that the Study Group , whose co-chairman was his father ’s former political aide , James A. Baker III , had suggested that a temporary troop increase could be a necessary step on the way to an eventual withdrawal .
Let ’s tease apart the insulting stupidity of this reasoning .
Say that I break your leg in three places .
How could you get angry with me ?
Medical doctors break bones all the time .
I could pull out a manual where it says – in plain English – that you sometimes need to break a bone when an old break does n’t set right .
The president obviously does not plan to pull troops out of Iraq .
Maybe he honestly thinks that people are morons , maybe he fails to see the stupidity of his own statement , whatever .
The remarkable thing here is not the president ’s quotidian stupidity but the almost totally counterfactual nature of his claim .
Surging troops now will not only do nothing for a withdrawal that wo n’t happen , but our current troop surge will make a safe withdrawal nearly impossible .
Our army was tired before the “ surge . ”
Even then our commitments were hardly tenable , sustained by rapidly deteriorating equipment and a massive callup of the National Guard and reserves .
Readiness is a real crisis and increasing our troops now will only make it that much worse .
When our “ surge ” winds down the army will need a significant time before America is able to commit new troops abroad for any reason .
The “ surge ” does more than just put off the date that we leave Iraq .
It also ensures that pullout orders will go out to tired troops with worn - out equipment and virtually no hope of reinforcements .
If Iraq remains hot when the inevitable pullout comes , Americans will die because Frederick Kagan convinced the president to spend our last resources on a quixotic troop buildup .
***
To broaden the point , compare this with the mantra that we should invade Iraq because of 9/11 .
Think about what group could possibly have wanted America to invade Iraq as badly as the neocons .
If al Qaeda does n’t ring a bell , it should .
Iraq relieved al Qaeda ’s siege in Afghanistan , threw our resources down an insurgency hole , brought on exactly the public - inflaming occupation of Islamic holy lands that AQ tried and failed to accomplish in Afghanistan , and ( bonus ! ) it saved AQ the chore of knocking over Saddam themselves .
Again the unique Bush gift goes beyond making a plainly stupid argument to some ethereal plane of counterproductive mendaciousness .
A sworn enemy of the United States could not manufacture a Manchurian president - bot that would serve their interests better than our current leadership .

Life on Earth may have announced its arrival billions of years ago with a whistle and a thump , according to planetary scientists .
Experiments by an international team of researchers back a controversial theory that life flourished on Earth after primitive organisms arrived aboard a meteorite , itself gouged from Mars by a giant impact .
The theory supposes that life was able to gain a tentative foothold on the red planet as it cooled down and became more hospitable several billion years ago .
At the time , the planet 's surface was regularly bombarded with rocky detritus from the asteroid belt , knocking clumps of rock and the microbes living on them into space , where the gravity of the sun brought them hurtling towards Earth .
Charles Cockell , at the Open University , who studies microbes in extreme environments , joined a team of German and Russian scientists to test whether microbes could survive the enormous shock of being blasted into space and crash landing on another planet .
They gathered colonies of micro-organisms including cyanobacteria , which live in rocky fissures , lichen , which smother their surfaces , and spores of the hardy bacterium Bacillus subtilis , and sandwiched them between slices of gabbro , a coarse - grained rock similar to that known to make up Martian meteorites .
The researchers then used high explosives to fire a steel plate at the sandwiched organisms and after each shot transferred the microbes to a dish to see if any had survived .
The shocks were equivalent to those suffered by Martian meteorites that have been found on Earth , with pressures of up to 50 billion pascals .
One pascal is equivalent to the pressure exerted by a £ 5 note resting on a surface .
The pressure in a car tyre is equivalent to 200,000 pascals .
To their surprise , the scientists found the lichen and bacterial spores survived all but the most cataclysmic impacts up to 45 billion pascals .
The cyanobacteria survived shocks of up to 10 billion pascals .
The findings support the theory of " lithopanspermia " , which suggests life may be spread from one planet to another aboard lumps of rock that are knocked off the surface .
Writing in the journal Icarus , the scientists state : " These results strongly confirm the possibility of a ' direct transfer ' scenario of ' lithopanspermia ' for the route from Mars to Earth , or from any Mars - like planet to other habitable planets in the same stellar system . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Online video sites that sell shows and movies such as Apple Inc. ’s iTunes will likely peak this year as more programming is made available on free outlets supported by advertising , according to a study released on Monday .

Sales of movies and television shows are expected to almost triple to $ 279 million in 2007 from an estimated $ 98 million last year .
But unless the average consumer begins paying for their online video en masse , growth in sales will likely peter out next year , according to Forrester Research .
“ In the video space , iTunes is just a temporary flash while consumers wait for better ways to get video .
They ’re already coming , ” said Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey , the author of the study , who also called the paid download video market a “ dead end . ”
Forrester estimated that sales growth is not likely to triple or even double in 2008 and beyond , after early adopters and media addicts have already started using the services .
Confusion over different video file formats , difficulties watching downloaded videos on television screens and other technical problems have kept average users from paying for shows online .
Efforts by traditional media distribution companies to make more of their shows available for free on the Internet -- including the Hollywood - backed film service MovieLink , Wal - Mart Stores Inc. ’s service and Amazon.com Inc. ’s Unbox service -- are also working against paid services .
Led by Walt Disney Co.’s ABC.com , TV networks including News Corp .’s
Fox are offering some hit shows online for free .
News Corp. and General Electric Co. ’s NBC
Universal also launched a joint venture to distribute a combined archive of shows over the Internet .
“ Free is going to win , ” McQuivey said .
Cable TV service executives and set top box makers are also seeking to make online videos easier to watch on big TV screens
-- a major topic of discussion at last week ’s cable industry trade show in Las Vegas .
Earlier this year , Time Warner Inc. ’s AOL struck a deal to make its videos available directly on Sony Corp. flat - panel televisions .
Currently , only about 9 percent of online adults have paid to download a program or a movie , the study said .
These people spent an average of $ 14 each to buy videos last year and will likely spend more this year as new online outlets debut .
McQuivey advises media companies to make their content available on all distribution platforms , but pay more attention to those that let users share content within a home network .

We knew it was coming .
Not , as conspiracy theorists imagine , just a few top officials among us , but all of us  and not for weeks or months , but for more than half a century before Sept. 11 , 2001 .
That ’s why , for all the shock , it was , in a sense , so familiar .
Americans were already imagining versions of Sept. 11 soon after the dropping of the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6 , 1945 .
That event set the American imagination boiling .
Within weeks of the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , as scholar Paul Boyer has shown , all the familiar signs of nuclear fear were already in place  newspapers were drawing concentric circles of atomic destruction outward from fantasy Ground Zeroes in American cities , and magazines were offering visions of our country as a vaporized wasteland , while imagining millions of American dead .
And then , suddenly , one clear morning it seemed to arrive  by air , complete with images of the destruction of the mightiest monuments to our power , and ( just as previously experienced ) as an onscreen spectacle .
At one point that day , it could be viewed on more than 30 channels , including some never previously involved with breaking news , and most of the country was watching .
Only relatively small numbers of New Yorkers actually experienced 9/11 : those at the tip of Manhattan or close enough to watch the two planes smash into the World Trade Center towers , to watch ( as some schoolchildren did ) people leaping or falling from the upper floors of those buildings , to be enveloped in the vast cloud of smoke and ash , in the tens of thousands of pulverized computers and copying machines , the asbestos and flesh and plane , the shredded remains of millions of sheets of paper , of financial and office life as we know it .
For most Americans , even those like me who were living in Manhattan , 9/11 arrived on the television screen .
This is why what leapt to mind  and instantaneously filled our papers and TV reporting  was previous screen life , the movies .
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks , the news was peppered with comments about , thoughts about , and references to films .
Reporters , as Caryn James wrote in the New York Times that first day , “ compared the events to Hollywood action movies ” ; as did op - ed writers ( “ The scenes exceeded the worst of Hollywood ’s disaster movies ” ) ; columnists ( “ On TV , two national landmarks look like the aftermath in the film Independence Day “ ) ; and eyewitnesses ( “ It was like one of them Godzilla movies ” ; “ And then I saw an explosion straight out of The Towering Inferno “ ) .
Meanwhile , in an irony of the moment , Hollywood scrambled to excise from upcoming big - and small - screen life anything that might bring to mind thoughts of 9/11 , including , in the case of Fox , promotion for the premiere episode of 24 , in which “ a terrorist blows up an airplane . ”
( Talk about missing the point ! )
In our guts , we had always known it was coming .
Like any errant offspring , Little Boy and Fat Man , those two atomic packages with which we had paid them back for Pearl Harbor , were destined to return home someday .
No wonder the single , omnipresent historical reference in the media in the wake of the attacks was Pearl Harbor or , as screaming headlines had it , INFAMY , or A NEW DAY OF INFAMY .
We had just experienced “ the Pearl Harbor of the 21st Century , ” or , as R. James Woolsey , former CIA director ( and neocon ) , said in the Washington Post that first day , “ It is clear now , as it was on December 7 , 1941 , that the United States is at war .
The question is : with whom ? ”
The Day After
No wonder that what came instantly to mind was a nuclear event .
No wonder , according to a New York Times piece , Tom Brokaw , then chairing NBC ’s nonstop news coverage , “ may have captured it best when he looked at videotape of people on a street , everything and everyone so covered with ash [ and said ] it looked ‘ like a nuclear winter in lower Manhattan . ' ”
No wonder the Tennessean and the Topeka Capital - Journal both used the headline “ The Day After , ” lifted from a famous 1983 TV movie about nuclear Armageddon .
No wonder the area where the two towers fell was quickly dubbed “ Ground Zero , ” a term previously reserved for the spot where an atomic explosion had occurred .
On Sept. 12 , for example , the Los Angeles Times published a full - page series of illustrations of the attacks on the towers headlined : “ Ground Zero . ”
By week ’s end , it had become the only name for “ the collapse site , ” as in a Sept. 18 New York Times headline , “ Many Come to Bear Witness at Ground Zero . ”
No wonder the events seemed so strangely familiar .
We had been living with the possible return of our most powerful weaponry via TV and the movies , novels and our own dream - life , in the past , the future , and even  thanks to a John F. Kennedy TV appearance on Oct. 22 , 1962 , during the Cuban missile crisis to tell us that our world might end tomorrow  in something like the almost - present .
So many streams of popular culture had fed into this .
So many “ previews ” had been offered .
Everywhere in those decades , you could see yourself or your compatriots or the enemy “ Hiroshimated ” ( as Variety termed it back in 1947 ) .
Even when Arnold Schwarzenegger was n’t kissing Jamie Lee Curtis in True Lies as an atomic explosion went off somewhere in the Florida Keys or a playground filled with American kids was n’t being atomically blistered in Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , even when it was n’t literally nuclear , that apocalyptic sense of destruction lingered as the train , bus , blimp , explosively armed , headed for us in our unknowing innocence ; as the towering inferno , airport , city , White House was blasted away , as we were offered Pompeii - scapes of futuristic destruction in what would , post - 9/11 , come to be known as “ the homeland . ”
Sometimes it came from outer space armed with strange city - blasting rays ; other times irradiated monsters rose from the depths to stomp our cities ( in the 1998 remake of Godzilla , New York City , no less ) .
After Star Wars ’ Darth Vader used his Death Star to pulverize a whole planet in 1977 , planets were regularly nuclearized in Saturday - morning TV cartoons .
In our imaginations , post - 1945 , we were always at planetary Ground Zero .
Dystopian Serendipity
Increasingly , from Hamburg to Saudi Arabia to Afghanistan , others were also watching our spectaculars , our catastrophes , our previews ; and so , as Hollywood historian Neal Gabler would write in the New York Times only days after 9/11 , they were ready to deliver what we had long dreamed of with the kind of timing  ensuring , for instance , that the second plane arrived “ at a decent interval ” after the first so that the cameras could be in place  and in a visual language American viewers would understand .
But here ’s the catch :
What came , when it came , on Sept. 11 , 2001 , was n’t what we thought came .
There was no Ground Zero , because there was nothing faintly atomic about the attacks .
It was n’t the apocalypse at all .
Except in its success , it hardly differed from the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center , the one that almost toppled one tower with a rented Ryder van and a homemade bomb .
OK , the truck of 1993 had sprouted wings and gained all the power in those almost full , transcontinental jet fuel tanks , but otherwise what “ changed everything , ” as the phrase would soon go , was a bit of dystopian serendipity for al - Qaeda : Nineteen men of much conviction and middling skills , armed with exceedingly low - tech weaponry and hijacked jets , managed to create an apocalyptic look that , in another context , would have made the special - effects masters of Lucas ’ Industrial Light & Magic proud .
And from that  and the Bush administration ’s reaction to it  everything else would follow .
The tiny band of fanatics who planned Sept. 11 essentially lucked out .
If the testimony , under CIA interrogation techniques , of al - Qaeda ’s master planner Khalid Sheik Mohammed is to be believed , what happened stunned even him .
( “ According to the [ CIA ] summary , he said he ‘ had no idea that the damage of the first attack would be as catastrophic as it was . ' ” )
Those two mighty towers came crumbling down in that vast , roiling , near - mushroom cloud of white smoke before the cameras in the fashion of the ultimate Hollywood action film ( imagery multiplied in its traumatizing power by thousands of replays over a record - setting more than 90 straight hours of TV coverage ) .
And that imagery fit perfectly the secret expectations of Americans  just as it fit the needs of both al - Qaeda and the Bush administration .
That ’s undoubtedly why other parts of the story of that moment faded from sight .
On the fifth anniversary of Sept. 11 , there will , for instance , be no memorial documentaries focusing on American Flight 77 , which plowed into the Pentagon .
That destructive but non-apocalyptic - looking attack did n’t satisfy the same built - in expectations .
Though the term “ ground zero Washington ” initially floated through the media ether , it never stuck .
Similarly , the unsolved anthrax murders - by - mail of almost the same moment , which caused a collective shudder of horror , are now forgotten .
( According to a LexisNexis search , between Oct. 4 and Dec. 4 , 2001 , 260 stories appeared in the New York Times and 246 in the Washington Post with “ anthrax ” in the headline .
That ’s the news equivalent of a high - pitched scream of horror . )
Those envelopes , spilling highly refined anthrax powder and containing letters dated “ 9/11/01 ” with lines like “ Death to America , Death to Israel , Allah Is Great , ” represented the only use of a weapon of mass destruction in this period ; yet they were slowly eradicated from our collective ( and media ) memory once it became clearer that the perpetrators were probably homegrown killers , possibly out of the very Cold War U.S. weapons labs that produced so much WMD in the first place .
It ’s a guarantee that the media will not be filled with memory pieces to the anthrax victims this October .
The 36 - Hour War
Indulge me , then , for a moment on an otherwise grim subject .
I ’ve always been a fan of what - if history and , when younger , of science fiction .
Recently , I decided to take my own modest time machine back to Sept. 11 , 2001 ; or , to be more exact , the IRT subway on several overheated July afternoons to one of the cultural glories of my city , the New York Public Library , a building that  in the realm where sci-fi and what - if history meld  suffered its own monstrous “ damage , ” its own 9/11 , only months after the A - bombing of Hiroshima .
In November 1945 , Life magazine published “ The 36 - Hour War , ” an overheated what - if tale in which an unnamed enemy in “ equatorial Africa ” launched a surprise atomic missile attack on the United States , resulting in 10 million deaths .
A dramatic illustration accompanying the piece showed the library ’s two pockmarked stone lions still standing , guarding a ground - zero scene of almost total destruction , while heavily shielded technicians tested “ the rubble of the shattered city for radioactivity . ”
I passed those same majestic lions , still standing ( as was the library ) in 2006 , entered the microfiche room and began reading the New York Times as well as several other newspapers starting with the Sept. 12 , 2001 , issues .
Immediately I was plunged back into a hellish apocalypse .
Vivid Times words and phrases from that first day : “ gates of hell , ” “ the unthinkable , ” “ nightmare world of Hieronymus Bosch , ” “ hellish storm of ash , glass , smoke , and leaping victims , ” “ clamorous inferno , ” “ an ashen shell of itself , all but a Pompeii . ”
But one of the most common words over those days in the Times and elsewhere was “ vulnerable ” ( or as a Times piece put it , “ nowhere was safe ” ) .
The front page of the Chicago Tribune caught this mood in a headline , “ Feeling of Invincibility Suddenly Shattered , ” and a lead sentence , “ On Tuesday , America the invincible became America the vulnerable . ”
We had faced “ the kamikazes of the 21st century ”  a Pearl Harborish phrase that would gain traction  and we had lost .
A thought came to mind as I slowly rolled those grainy microfiches ; as I passed the photo of a man , in midair , falling headfirst from a WTC tower ; as I read this observation from a Pearl Harbor survivor interviewed by the Tribune : “ Things will never be the same again in this country ” ; as I reeled section by section , day by day toward our distinctly changed present ; as I read all those words that boiled up like a linguistic storm around the photos of those hideous white clouds ; as I considered all the op-eds and columns filled with all those instant opinions that poured into the pages of our papers before there was even time to think ; as I noticed , buried in their pages , a raft of words and phrases  “ preempt , ” “ a new Department of Preemption [ at the Pentagon ] , ” “ homeland defenses , ” “ homeland security agency ”  already lurking in our world , readying themselves to be noticed .
Among them all , the word that surfaced fastest on the heels of that “ new Day of Infamy , ” and to deadliest effect , was “ war . ” Sen .
John McCain , among many others , labeled the attacks “ an act of war ” on the spot , just as Republican Sen .
Richard Shelby insisted that “ this is total war , ” just as the Washington Post ‘s columnist Charles Krauthammer started his first editorial that first day , “ This is not crime .
This is war . ”
And they quickly found themselves in a milling crowd of potential war - makers , Democrats as well as Republicans , liberals as well as conservatives , even if the enemy remained as yet obscure .
On the night of Sept. 11 the president himself , addressing the nation , already spoke of winning “ the war against terrorism . ”
By day two , he used the phrase “ acts of war ” ; by day three , “ the first war of the 21st century ” ( while the Times reported “ a drumbeat for war ” on television ) ; by week ’s end , “ the long war ” ; and the following week , in an address to a joint session of Congress , while announcing the creation of a Cabinet - level Office of Homeland Security , he wielded “ war ” 12 times .
( “ Our war on terror begins with al - Qaeda , but it does not end there . ” )
What If ?
So here was my what - if thought .
What if the two hijacked planes , American Flight 11 and United 175 , had plunged into those north and south towers at 8:46 and 9:03 , killing all aboard , causing extensive damage and significant death tolls , but neither tower had come down ?
What if , as a Tribune columnist called it , photogenic “ scenes of apocalypse ” had not been produced ?
What if , despite two gaping holes and the smoke and flames pouring out of the towers , the imagery had been closer to that of 1993 ?
What if there had been no giant cloud of destruction capable of bringing to mind the look of “ the day after , ” no images of crumbling towers worthy of Independence Day ?
We would surely have had blazing headlines , but would they have commonly had “ war ” or “ infamy ” in them , as if we had been attacked by another state ?
Would the last superpower have gone from “ invincible ” to “ vulnerable ” in a split second ?
Would our newspapers instantly have been writing “ before ” and “ after ” editorials , or insisting that this moment was the ultimate “ test ” of George W. Bush ’s until - then languishing presidency ?
Would we instantaneously have been considering taking what CIA Director George Tenet would soon call “ the shackles ” off our intelligence agencies and the military ?
Would we have been reconsidering , as Florida ’s Democratic Sen .
Bob Graham suggested that first day , rescinding the congressional ban on the assassination of foreign officials and heads of state ?
Would a Washington
Post journalist have been trying within hours to name the kind of “ war ” we were in ?
( He provisionally labeled it “ the Gray War . ” )
Would New York Times columnist Tom Friedman on the third day have had us deep into “ World War III ” ?
Would the Times have been headlining and quoting Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz on its front page on Sept. 14 , insisting that “ it ’s not simply a matter of capturing people and holding them accountable , but removing the sanctuaries , removing the support systems , ending states who sponsor terrorism . ”
( The Times editorial writers certainly noticed that ominous “ s ” on “ states ” and wrote the next day : “ but we trust [ Wolfowitz ] does not have in mind invading Iraq , Iran , Syria , and Sudan as well as Afghanistan . ” )
Would state - to - state “ war ” and “ acts of terror ” have been so quickly conjoined in the media as a “ war on terror ” and would that phrase have made it , in just over a week , into a major presidential address ?
Could the Los Angeles Daily News have produced the following four - day series of screaming headlines , beating even the president to the punch : Terror / Horror ! / ” This Is War ” / War on Terror ?
If it all had n’t seemed so familiar , would n’t we have noticed what was actually new in the attacks of Sept. 11 ?
Would n’t more people have been as puzzled as , according to Ron Suskind in his new book The One Percent Doctrine , was one reporter who asked White House press secretary Ari Fleischer , “ You do n’t declare war against an individual , surely ” ?
Would n’t Congress have balked at passing , three days later , an almost totally open - ended resolution granting the president the right to use force not against one nation ( Afghanistan ) but against “ nations , ” plural and unnamed ?
And how well would the Bush administration ’s fear - inspired nuclear agenda have worked , if those buildings had n’t come down ?
Would Saddam ’s supposed nuclear program and WMD stores have had the same impact ?
Would the endless linking of the Iraqi dictator , al - Qaeda , and 9/11 have penetrated so deeply that , in 2006 , half of all Americans , according to a Harris Poll , still believed Saddam had WMD when the U.S. invasion began , and 85 percent of American troops stationed in Iraq , according to a Zogby poll , believed the U.S. mission there was mainly “ to retaliate for Saddam ’s role in the 9/11 attacks ” ?
Without that apocalyptic 9/11 imagery , would those fantasy Iraqi mushroom clouds pictured by administration officials rising over American cities or those fantasy Iraqi unmanned aerial vehicles capable of spraying our East Coast with chemical or biological weapons , or Saddam ’s supposed search for African yellowcake ( or even , today , the Iranian “ bomb ” that wo n’t exist for perhaps another decade , if at all ) have so dominated American consciousness ?
Would Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri be sitting in jail cells or be on trial by now ?
Would so many things have happened differently ?
The Opportunity of a Lifetime
What if the attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 , had not been seen as a new Pearl Harbor ?
Only three months earlier , after all , Disney ’s Pearl Harbor ( the “ sanitized ” version , as Times columnist Frank Rich labeled it ) , a blockbuster made with extensive Pentagon help , had performed disappointingly at the multiplexes .
As an event , it seemed irrelevant to American audiences until 9/11 , when that ancient history  and the ancient retribution that went with it  wiped from the American brain the actual history of recent decades , including our massive covert anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan , out of which Osama bin Laden emerged .
Here ’s the greatest irony : From that time of triumph in 1945 , Americans had always secretly suspected that they were not “ invincible ” but exceedingly vulnerable , something both pop culture and the deepest fears of the Cold War era only reinforced .
Confirmation of that fact arrived with such immediacy on Sept. 11 largely because it was already a gut truth .
The ambulance chasers of the Bush administration , who spotted such opportunity in the attacks , were perhaps the last Americans who had n’t absorbed this reality .
As that New Day of Infamy scenario played out , the horrific but actual scale of the damage inflicted in New York and Washington ( and to the U.S. economy ) would essentially recede .
The attack had been relatively small , limited in its means and massive only in its daring and luck  abetted by the fact that the Bush administration was looking for nothing like such an attack , despite that CIA briefing given to Bush on a lazy August day in Crawford ( “ Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US ” ) and so many other clues .
Only the week before 9/11 the Bush administration had been in the doldrums with a “ detached , ” floundering president criticized by worried members of his own party for vacationing far too long at his Texas ranch while the nation drifted .
Moreover , there was only one group before Sept. 11 with a “ new Pearl Harbor ” scenario on the brain .
Major administration figures , including Vice President Dick Cheney , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz , had wanted for years to radically increase the power of the president and the Pentagon , to roll back the power of Congress ( especially any congressional restraints on the presidency left over from the Vietnam / Watergate era ) , and to complete the overthrow of Saddam Hussein ( “ regime change ” ) , aborted by the first Bush administration in 1991 .
We know as well that some of those plans were on the table in the 1990s and that those who held them and promoted them , at the Project for the New American Century in particular , actually wrote in a proposal titled “ Rebuilding America ’s Defenses ” that “ the process of transformation [ of the Pentagon ] , even if it brings revolutionary change , is likely to be a long one , absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event  like a new Pearl Harbor . ”
We also know that within hours of the 9/11 attacks , many of the same people were at work on the war of their dreams .
Within five hours of the attack on the Pentagon , Rumsfeld was urging his aides to come up with plans for striking Iraq .
( Notes by an aide transcribe his wishes this way : “ best info fast .
Judge whether good enough hit S.H. [ Saddam Hussein ] at same time .
Not only UBL [ Osama bin Laden ] .
Go massive .
Sweep it all up .
Things related and not . ” )
We know that by the 12th , the president himself had collared his top counterterrorism adviser on the National Security Council , Richard Clarke , and some of his staff in a conference room next to the White House Situation Room and demanded linkages .
( “ ‘ Look under every rock and do due diligence . ’
It was a very intimidating message which said , ‘ Iraq .
Give me a memo about Iraq and 9/11 . ' ” )
We know that by November , the top officials of the administration were already deep into operational planning for an invasion of Iraq .
And they were n’t alone .
Within the Pearl Harbor / nuclear attack / war nexus that emerged almost instantly from the ruins of the World Trade Center , others were working feverishly .
Only eight days after the attacks , for instance , the complex 342 - page PATRIOT
Act would be rushed over to Congress by Attorney General John Ashcroft , passed through a cowed Senate in the dead of night on Oct. 11 , unread by at least some of our representatives , and signed into law on Oct. 26 .
As its instant appearance indicated , it was made up of a set of already existing right - wing hobbyhorses , quickly drafted provisions , and expansions of law enforcement powers taken off an FBI “ wish list ” ( previously rejected by Congress ) .
All these were swept together by people who , like the president ’s men on Iraq , saw their main chance when those buildings went down .
As such , it stands in for much of what happened “ in response ” to 9/11 .
But what if we had n’t been waiting so long for our own 36 - hour war in the most victorious nation on the planet , its sole “ hyperpower , ” its new Rome ?
What if those preexisting frameworks had n’t been quite so well primed to emerge in no time at all ?
What if we ( and our enemies as well ) had n’t been at the movies all those years ?
Movie - Made Planet
Among other things , we ’ve been left with a misbegotten “ billion dollar ” memorial to the attacks of 9/11 ( recently recalibrated to $ 500 million ) planned for New York ’s Ground Zero and sporting the kinds of cost overruns otherwise associated with the occupation of Iraq .
In its ambitions , what it will really memorialize is the Bush administration ’s oversized , crusading moment that followed the attacks .
Too late now  and no one asked me anyway  but I know what my memorial would have been .
A few days after 9/11 , my daughter and I took a trip downtown , as close to “ Ground Zero ” as you could get .
With the air still rubbing our throats raw , we wandered block after block , peering down side streets to catch glimpses of the sheer enormity of the destruction .
And indeed , in a way that no small screen could communicate , it did have the look of the apocalyptic , especially those giant shards of fallen building sticking up like  remember , I ’m a typical movie - made American on an increasingly movie - made planet and had movies on the brain that week  the image of the wrecked Statue of Liberty that chillingly ends the first Planet of the Apes film , that cinematic memorial to humanity ’s nuclear folly .
Left there as it was , that would have been a sobering monument for the ages , not just to the slaughter that was 9/11 but to what we had awaited for so long  and what , sadly , we still wait for ; what , in the world that George Bush has produced , has become ever more , rather than less , likely .
And imagine our reaction then .
Safer ?
Do n’t be ridiculous .

Facebook VIRGINIA BEACH ( AP )  Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani on Tuesday accused former President Clinton of not responding forcefully enough to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing or later terrorist attacks .
The former New York mayor criticized Democrats , accusing them of weakness and naivete in dealing with terrorism .
Giuliani made the comments to about 650 business , corporate and political leaders at Regent University , the conservative Christian college founded by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson .
" Islamic terrorists killed more than 500 Americans before Sept. 11 .
Many people think the first attack on America was on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
It was not .
It was in 1993 , " said the former New York mayor .
Giuliani argued that Clinton treated the World Trade Center bombing as a criminal act instead of a terrorist attack , calling it " a big mistake " that emboldened other strikes on the Khobar Towers housing complex in Saudi Arabia , in Kenya and Tanzania and later on the USS Cole while docked in Yemen in 2000 .
" The United States government , then President Clinton , did not respond , " Giuliani said .
" ( Osama ) bin Laden declared war on us .
We did n't hear it . "
In hindsight , Giuliani said , maybe it's all clearer now , " but now is now , and there is no reason to go back into denial , and that is essentially what the Democratic candidates for president want to do : they want to go back , to put the country in reverse to the 1990s .
Last September , however , Giuliani defended Clinton 's record amid political bickering over which president — Clinton or George W. Bush — missed more opportunities to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks .
" The idea of trying to cast blame on President Clinton is just wrong for many , many reasons , not the least of which is I do n't think he deserves it , " Giuliani said during a stop in Florida .
" I do n't think President Bush deserves it .
The people who deserve blame for Sept. 11 , I think we should remind ourselves , are the terrorists — the Islamic fanatics — who came here and killed us and want to come here again and do it . "
In his comments Tuesday , Giuliani said Democrats would abandon Iraq while giving terrorists the U.S. " timetable for retreat . "
Giuliani remained aligned with President Bush in keeping U.S. forces in Iraq even as two more senior Senate Republicans — Indiana 's Richard Lugar and Ohio's George Voinovich — in the past two days suggested the president 's policy is failing and said he should begin bringing troops home .
" Rudy 's arrogance has gotten the best of him , " the Democratic National Committee said in a one - paragraph response .
" How can a man who failed to prepare New York City for a second attack after the first one , who sent firefighters and emergency workers into Ground Zero without respirators and quit the Iraq Study Group to raise money keep America safe ? "
Speaking at Regent , Giuliani avoided any mention of two issues that put him at odds with conservatives — his support for gay rights and abortion rights .
But he acknowledged the differences indirectly , drawing warm applause from the conservative audience for doing so .
" Do n't expect to agree with me on everything because that would be unrealistic .
I do n't even agree with me on everything , " he said .

" Come and save me tonight , " pleaded Steven Tyler in an Aerosmith tune so sappy it could have been tapped for maple syrup , but the words could well be the rallying cry for webcasters across the country .
Coalitions like SaveNetRadio.org have been petitioning Congress for relief after the Copyright Royalty Board denied an appeal to reconsider its decision earlier this year on Internet radio fees .
Today , two senators rode to their rescue .
Senators Ron Wyden ( D - OR ) and Sam Brownback ( R - KS ) have just introduced the Internet Radio Equality Act of 2007 .
" July 15 , when collection begins on the new royalty fees , literally will be the day the music died , " said the two senators in a joint announcement .
If passed , the bill would overturn the decision of the Copyright Royalty Board and replace it with a rate mandated by Congress — 7.5 percent of total revenues .
This is the rate currently paid by satellite broadcasters like XM and Sirius , but the CRB 's decision meant that small webcasters could actually owe more in fees than they earn in revenue , and some of the fees would be retroactive to 2006 .
" Our bill is about standing up for folks ranging from a small webcaster in a basement in Corvallis to an innovative startup in Beaverton to a new band trying to be heard in Portland to a huge music fan in Coos Bay , " said Wyden , a statement which raises the obvious question : who named all these towns in Oregon , anyway ?
The new bill is a companion to one introduced two weeks ago in the House .
In addition to setting the royalty rate as a percentage of revenue , the Senate bill would eliminate the $ 500 per channel minimum fee and set up a special rules for non-commercial broadcasters like NPR , a vocal critic of the CRB ruling .
Rep. Donald Mazulla ( R - IL ) , a co-sponsor of the House bill , praised the new Senate bill and said that he has received plenty of positive feedback on the legislation .
" Since we introduced our legislation in the House two weeks ago , " he said , " I have been inundated with messages from Internet radio listeners throughout the country thanking me for protecting this wonderful medium .
This issue has ignited a flurry of passion from music lovers throughout our country , and I again thank Senators Wyden and Brownback for their efforts to help keep the music playing on the Internet . "
New Studies Reveal DNA Damage from Anti-Coca Herbicide
By Stephen Leahy
Scientific studies have collected evidence of the negative effects of the glyphosate - based herbicide Roundup on human and animal health .
The chemical is used in aerial spraying to eliminate illicit coca crops in Colombia .
TORONTO , Jun 11 ( Tierramérica ) .- U.S. - funded aerial spraying of suspected coca plantations in Colombia near the Ecuador border has severely damaged the DNA of local residents , a new study has found .
Blood samples from 24 Ecuadorians living within three kilometers of the northern border had 600 to 800 percent more damage to their chromosomes than people living 80 km away , found scientists from the Pontificia Catholic University in Quito , Ecuador .
The border residents who were tested had been exposed to the common herbicide glyphosate — sold by the U.S. agribusiness giant Monsanto under the brand Roundup –during a series of aerial sprayings by the Colombian government begun in 2000 , part of the anti-drugs and counterinsurgency Plan Colombia , financed by Washington .
The Ecuadorians suffered a variety of ailments immediately following the spraying , including intestinal pain and vomiting , diarrhea , headaches , dizziness , numbness , burning of eyes or skin , blurred vision , difficulty in breathing and rashes , says the study , which is to be published in the journal Genetics and Molecular Biology .
But the extensive damage to DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) found in the randomly selected individuals may activate the development of cancer or other developmental effects resulting in miscarriages , according to lead researcher César Paz y Miño , head of human molecular genetics at the Catholic University of Ecuador .
In general , everyone has some level of DNA damage due to exposure to ultraviolet radiation , air pollution , toxic chemicals and other factors .
However , none of the 24 randomly - selected individuals used tobacco , alcohol or non-prescription drugs , nor did they use other herbicides or pesticides that could have caused the extensive DNA damage observed , Paz y Miño told Tierramérica .
The concentration levels of Roundup were measured at more than 20 times the maximum recommended rate and may be the reason behind the genotoxic ( capable of causing genetic mutation ) effect on the exposed individuals , he said .
The blood samples were collected by Spanish doctor Adolfo Maldonado , of the non-governmental Acción Ecológica , which since the beginning of this decade has been studying health , economic and social problems of Ecuadorian populations affected by the aerial herbicide spraying in neighboring Colombia .

A Security System More Lethal Than PMS : The Tampon Taser Gun [ American Inventor Spot ]
Engineers pushed a newly designed , metal shear wall to its limits at a Nov. 20 seismic test at the University of California , Berkeley 's Structural Engineering Research Lab .
The panel proved strong enough for use in California and other earthquake - prone regions throughout the world , researchers said .
The new wall system employs a corrugated metal decking material screwed to metal studs .
Researchers estimate that the new panels are three times stronger than equivalent plywood panels , and twice as strong as comparable metal framing material currently on the market .
The metal panels can be prefabricated and delivered to the construction jobsite , helping lower costs .
It could become an alternative lateral bracing system that is stronger , more flexible and less expensive than traditional bracing systems now used for multi-unit residential buildings .
Engineers at Tipping Mar & Associates , a Berkeley - based structural engineering firm , came up with the concept of the simple , non-proprietary wall system , and UC Berkeley researchers are helping to test and develop the system .
" This will greatly simplify the design of light gauge metal - frame buildings , " said Tipping Mar president Steve Tipping , who oversaw the development of this new class of metal shear wall .
At the UC Berkeley seismic test , researchers demonstrated the ability of the technology to withstand the type of major earthquake expected to occur in the Bay Area , subjecting the panel to 25,000 pounds of force and cyclic displacement .
" This system will lead to important safety improvements in the construction of new homes , as well as provide economical retrofitting solutions for existing buildings , " said Bozidar Stojadinovic , UC Berkeley associate professor of civil and environmental engineering .
" We want this accessible to any contractor who is interested , which is why we are making the final design freely available to the public . "

Gradually , tentatively , the country is groping its way back to sanity .
Yesterday in Toronto , a judge ruled it did n't make any sense to keep a sick , 46 - year - old man who has not been charged with any crime locked up for almost seven years .
Meanwhile , in Ottawa , the opposition majority is set to let two of the most odious provisions of Canada 's illiberal anti-terror laws – enacted in panic following 9/11 – die a richly deserved death .
We have n't gained our equilibrium yet .
Egyptian refugee claimant Mohamed Mahjoub may be able to rejoice now that Federal Court Justice Richard Mosley has allowed him to be detained under house arrest rather than in a special jail built just outside of Kingston .
But there are still two other immigrants there who have been imprisoned for years without charge .
And while many Canadians have belatedly discovered the importance of civil liberties when it comes to these so - called security certificate cases , few are championing 20 - year - old Omar Khadr , a Canadian citizen currently held against all the norms of international law in George Bush 's Guantanamo Bay prison camp .
Which is to say that we have a way to go .
But still , we 've made a start .
Stéphane Dion 's Liberals have acknowledged that they made a gross error in supporting two of the most draconian provisions of the anti-terror laws – the power to jail any citizen without charge and the power to compel individuals , who have not been charged with any crime , to answer police questions .
Unless the Liberals change their minds again , this means that they , along with the New Democrats and Bloc Québécois , will defeat a government motion to extend these two powers past their March 1 expiry date .
This wo n't solve all of the defects of the anti-terror laws .
The legislation continues to give the government sweeping powers to outlaw any organization it wishes – and then treat anyone who has ever been a supporter of such an organization as a terrorist .
The word " terrorist " is defined so broadly that it can include not just those who commit or plan terrorist acts but those who use symbols associated with terrorism .
Wear a Hitler T - shirt and you 're all right .
Replace that with an Osama bin Laden T - shirt and you court trouble .
All of this is part of the overreaction to 9/11 .
Those attacks were real .
But they also made us crazy .
Normally sensible people lost perspective .
An atrocity that was , in global terms , run -of - the - mill ( 9/11 pales beside the Rwandan genocide or , indeed , almost any modern African conflict ) was treated as world defining .
Terrorism , a dirty little crime that is neither new nor glamorous , was accorded a status it did not deserve .
Understandably , the Americans were most affected by this frenzy .
They are only now beginning to untangle the cost of what happens when a great power loses its mind .
In Canada , as always , the stakes were lower , the reaction more muted , the irrationality couched in bureaucratese .
We had our anti-terror laws but , until recently , did n't much use them .
Instead , the Canadian government preferred a section of the immigration act that allowed it to scoop up non-citizens and hold them indefinitely .
A legal provision designed for spies ( it was used successfully last year to arrest and deport a Russian intelligence agent ) , it made no sense when applied to terrorism .
Mahjoub 's case illustrates the point .
It is easy to see why the Canadian security services were wary of him .
He once worked for a Bin Laden agricultural company ; he knew two others believed to be connected to Al Qaeda and then lied about knowing them .
But apparently Mahjoub is not a terrorist .
If he were , the RCMP would have charged him .
Rather , he is someone the government , for reasons it will not divulge publicly , does not want here .
Perhaps the government 's reasons are good ones .
Who knows ?
It offers us no evidence .
What we do know ( and various judges have affirmed this ) is that if he is returned to Egypt he risks torture .
So , except in the most extreme case , we can't send him there .
The Supreme Court has been clear on this .
Nor can we keep him locked up indefinitely without charge .
That 's almost certainly unconstitutional .
In the end , something else has to be done with the Mohamed Mahjoubs of this world .
The Supreme Court , which is due to rule soon on the entire security certificate question , may provide an answer .
Until then , Mahjoub gets some relief .
He gets to wear an ankle bracelet , see his family , walk in his back yard during daylight hours and not be in jail .
It may not be the final answer , but it is a step on the road to sanity .
For him .
For us .
The Postal Service frequently cannot give customers an accurate estimate of when their mail will be delivered , a government report said .
The report , by the Government Accountability Office , said the service ’s delivery standards are out of date .
“ According to the deputy postmaster general , some Priority Mail delivery standards call for on - time delivery of Priority Mail in two days , but it is often physically impossible for U.S.P.S. to meet these standards when that requires moving the mail across the country , ” the report said .
Priority Mail is advertised by the Postal Service as one of its fastest options .
Postmaster General John Potter said updating delivery standards would increase costs that “ would have to be offset by appropriate price adjustments . ”
The other day , two students of mine showed me some of their code .
Part of their task was to fill a two - dimensional matrix using the formula : A[i ] [j ] = 2 * i + 3 * j + 1 ; They showed me an optimization they did to speed up that calculation and I was skeptical .
This article shows this optimization and my thoughts about why it failed .
But let ’s start from the beginning .
The code in question was supposed to look like this :
for ( i = 0 ; i < N ; i++) { for ( j = 0 ; j < N ; j++ ) { A[ i ] [j ] = 2 * i + 3 * j + 1 ; } } [ / c ]
The students did this optimization :
for ( i = 0 ; i < N ; i++) { for ( j = 0 ; j < N ; j++ ) { if ( j == 0 ) { A [ i ] [j ] = 2 * i + 1 ; } else { A [ i ] [j ] = A[ i ] [j - 1 ] + 3 ; } } } [ / c ]
Technically , this is correct .
And yes , it does safe a couple of arithmetic operations , among them many multiplications , which are expensive as many people know .
But if you actually turn this into a program , the second version is about twenty times slower , when compiled with the Intel compiler and optimization level 3 .
Its about the same speed when compiled with gcc - O3 .
I have looked briefly at the assembler code to make sure the whole calculation was not optimized away by the compiler , and it was not .
So why is the code so much slower ?
I see two reasons : First of all , todays architectures do n't like branches .
One wrongly predicted branch and your whole pipeline goes to hell .
Therefore if - clauses do n't help , when you want to be really fast .
Second , although a couple of multiplications are saved , now every calculations has to wait for its predecessor to complete .
If I remember my computer architecture class correctly , there are ways to feed results back into the pipeline without even going through the registers , but I am not sure it does not loose a few cycles in the process .
These are my guesses as to why this optimization has gone so wrong .
Should have taken my advice given in an earlier article to their heart and tested each and every one of their optimizations for effectiveness .
But as I have mentioned multiple times , I am not really a hardware - guy , so maybe I am totally off - base and you know different reasons why this is so slow ?
If yes , please share them here and leave a comment …
Update :
The reason why the program is so slow is clarified in my next post .
In April of 2004 , Kaiser Networks Daily AIDS / HIV Report noted that Randall Tobias , serving as the Bush Administration AIDS Czar , was promoting abstinence and denigrating condoms :
Tobias , who was in Berlin for the Global Business Coalition on HIV / AIDS ' 2004 Awards for Business Excellence , said that promoting abstinence and monogamy are " far more effective " than distributing condoms for preventing the spread of HIV , according to Agence France - Presse .
" Statistics show that condoms really have not been very effective , " Tobias said , adding , " It 's been the principal prevention device for the last 20 years , and I think one needs only to look at what 's happening with the infection rates in the world to recognize that has not been working . "
PEPFAR has been criticized by AIDS advocates for placing " false hopes " on abstinence and monogamy prevention programs , according to Agence France - Presse .
Deputy Secretary of State Randall L. Tobias submitted his resignation Friday , one day after confirming to ABC News that he had been a customer of a Washington , D.C. escort service whose owner has been charged by federal prosecutors with running a prostitution operation .
Tobias , 65 , Director of U.S. Foreign Assistance and administrator of the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) , had previously served as the Ambassador for the President ’s Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief .
That outrageous view held by the Bush administration was widely criticized by thinking people .
Today , ABC News reported that the married Mr. Tobias resigned from his post as Deputy Secretary of State after admitting he was a customer of a DC escort serviceIn a Ted Haggard - like admission , Tobias said he only got " massages .
" Abstinence is for the little people , not the loyal Bushies .

WASHINGTON : New York City is echoing the rock group Pink Floyd 's exhortation " Hey teachers , leave those kids alone . "
Except , the message is aimed at tutors in India involved in distance education of American kids .
In a ruling this week that could jeopardise the fledgling field of long distance education , the NYC Department of Education has said in effect that U.S companies cannot use tutors from India because they cannot comply with laws that require teachers to undergo background checks .
Under current rules , teachers are required to furnish social security numbers and be fingerprinted as part of background checks .
The ruling came after NYC reviewed a case involving an Indian - American owned company that had won a contract to tutor 2000 school children under a federal " No Child Left Behind " program .
The Texas - based company , Socratic Learning Inc , was found to be using 250 teachers based in India , although it claimed they were in Plano , Texas , NYC ’s Department of Education said .
The city has since cancelled Socratic ’s contract worth more than $ 2 million a year .
" Socratic blatantly violated its contract and we are suspending their contract pending further action by the state , " a Department of Education spokesman told the media .
" We will notify parents of any students who enrolled with Socratic Learning this fall they should select a new provider . "
Socratic ’s argument that the tutors in India are insulated from the students and such background checks are as such infructuous failed to impress the authorities who went by the rule that requires strict background verification .
Socratic ' CEO Raj Sobhani told ToI that the company complied with New York State ’s background check requirements , including getting the fingerprints of teachers employed in India ( who went to police stations there to have their prints certified ) .
The FBI in the U.S then endorsed that the print did not match any criminal records .
But there was a catch .
Not only did the NYC insist on teachers being physically present to have their fingerprints recorded , but they were also required to furnish social security numbers .
" How can foreign tutors produce U.S Social Security numbers ?
The whole system simply puts a crimp on distance learning , " Sobhani said .
Socratic ’s submission that student - teacher communications are monitored , in real time , both in New York and in India , and that student test scores had shown much improvement , also did not impress NYC .
The No Child Left Behind law was introduced by the Bush administration in 2002 to arrest declining education standards .
About 40 per cent of seventh class students in America fail in Maths and English exams .
The country is estimated to need about 120,000 teachers annually but barely finds tens per cent of that number amid a clamor about a crisis in the system .
Experts say the 1,200 - page NCLB
Act contains the most far - reaching education reform in the US in 40 years .
Under the NCLB
Act , the schools have until 2014 to meet the 100 per cent proficiency goal .
To do this , the country either needs to train or import a huge number of teachers , or at the very least , employ tutors at a distance .
Because American tutors can charge upwards of $ 40 an hour , and importing teachers is difficult given visa restrictions , many firms have sprung up to outsource teaching to countries such as India in order to meet the demand from cities and county boards struggling to meet NCLB targets .
The Federal government gives about $ 12 billion annually in aid to schools .
Under NCLB law , all students who need to improve their grades in sub-standard schools can apply for supplementary tutoring services .
The services are supplied by outside providers that are vetted by the state and paid for by the city using these federal funds .
In case of NYC , the Department of Education paid Socratic Learning $ 2.4 million last year out of a $ 75 million total paid to such programs .

Chefs have long used a simple trick to differentiate between a raw and hard - boiled egg .
By spinning an egg and watching how it behaves when the spin is disrupted , it 's easy to tell whether its interior is solid or liquid .
Applying a similar test to the planet Mercury , astronomers have found strong evidence that the planet closest to the sun has a fluid core .
The research , led by Jean - Luc Margot , assistant professor of astronomy at Cornell , appears this week on the Web site of the journal Science .
Margot and collaborators conducted a series of observations over five years using a novel technique to detect tiny twists in Mercury 's spin as it orbits the sun .
The twists , called longitudinal librations , occur as the sun 's gravity exerts alternating torques on the planet 's slightly asymmetrical shape .
They found that the magnitude of the librations was double what would be expected for a completely solid body -- but explainable for an object whose core is molten and not forced to rotate along with its shell .
Mercury is thought to consist of a silicate mantle surrounding an iron core , but because small planets like Mercury cool off rapidly , the core should have frozen long ago .
Maintaining a molten core over billions of years requires that it also contain a lighter element , such as sulfur , to lower the melting temperature of the core material .
The presence of sulfur supports the idea that radial mixing , or the combining of elements both close to the sun and farther away , was involved in Mercury 's formation process .
A molten core also gives weight to the idea that Mercury 's magnetic field , which is about 1 percent as strong as Earth 's , is caused by an electromagnetic dynamo .
The researchers used three telescopes -- the NASA / JPL 70 - meter antenna at Goldstone , Calif . ; and the National Science Foundation 's Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia -- to measure slight changes in Mercury 's spin .
The system involved sending a powerful radar signal at the planet , then receiving the signal 's echo , which appeared as a unique pattern of speckles reflecting the roughness of the planet 's surface , at two locations separated by about 2,000 miles .
Measuring how long it took for a particular speckle pattern to reproduce at the two locations ( about 10 seconds ) allowed Margot to calculate Mercury 's spin rate with an accuracy of one part in 100,000 .
The experiment included 21 such measurements , very carefully timed since Mercury and Earth are only in the necessary alignment for periods of 20 seconds at a time .
" Everything has to happen within that 20 - second time window , " Margot said .
Mercury 's spin is a subject the paper 's second author , University of California - Santa Barbara physics professor emeritus Stan Peale , first studied as a graduate student at Cornell decades ago .
In the years since , Peale showed that Mercury 's interior could be characterized in detail if four properties could be determined : the libration amplitude ; the planet 's obliquity , or the inclination angle of its rotational axis in relation to its orbital plane ; and two values called gravitational harmonic coefficients .
Peale 's formula also required that Mercury be in a Cassini state , a stable orbital configuration that characterizes the end of tidal evolution .
Finding those properties from Earth was long thought to be impossible .
But this unusual radar technique ( the method was first proposed to determine the spin rate in the 1960s ; its use for finding the spin orientation was proposed by co-author I.V. Holin about two decades later ) allowed the researchers to measure the planet 's librations and obliquity -- and to show that Mercury is almost certainly in the required Cassini state .
Mercury still has its share of mysteries .
Some may be solved with the NASA spacecraft Messenger , though , launched in 2004 and expected to make its first Mercury flyby in 2008 .
The spacecraft will begin orbiting the planet in 2011 .
" It is our hope that Messenger will address the remaining questions that we cannot address from the ground , " Margot said .

I have been on a bit of a language binge lately .
I have been playing around both with Factor and Erlang .
I 'm greatly impressed with both languages , though for completely different reasons .
If you have n't spent any time with Factor , the best way to describe it is " high - level Forth . "
Forth is a stack - based language that is great for embedded work because you can do a whole lot in a very small footprint .
Forth , like Lisp , is interactive .
Unfortunately ( or perhaps fortunately , if you 're a big Forth fan ) , Forth is fairly low - level in terms of its operation .
Forth likes to think in terms of machine words .
A lot of things like string handling are done with pointers .
When data is stored on the stack , it 's untyped and if you put parameters in the wrong order , it 's easy to blow things up .
In general , if you 're an embedded programmer , Forth rocks .
If you 're an application programmer , I think Forth is the wrong tool .
( Please , Forth people , do n't write to me and tell me that Charles Moore , the creator of forth wrote his own CAD system all in Forth to design Forth machine chips .
I know all that .
Moore is a genius and there are few people in the world that could do what he has done . )
But what would happen if you took some of the ideas that Forth has : interactivity , high - level compiler that travels with the application , implicit stack - oriented parameters in function calls , and married that with some high level data types ?
What if those high - level data types had embedded typing , like Lisp , and so the system could determine when you 're trying to add a number and a string or other type errors ?
Well , you 'd end up with Factor .
Factor is the creation of Slava Pestov , another genius .
Factor runs on just about any OS that runs on x86 and on several different processors under Linux .
Factor has a great GUI development environment that takes some cues from Lisp Machines and CLIM ( think lots of hyper - linked documentation and help , along with presentations ) .
Factor has lots of example code , including such things as a web server on which the Factor web site runs .
Check out the Factor web site for more info .
There is a lot of goodness here .
As good as Factor is , however , I 'm not sure it's my cup of tea for general application programming .
I generally like Reverse Polish Notation ( RPN ) and have always used HP calculators all my life .
That said , I just find it difficult to keep track of stack parameters through a long set of Forth or Factor function calls .
It is n't that working this way is wrong in any sense of the word , but I find that I prefer named parameters where I can attach a description to a value , as in something like Lisp .
So , I decided to look at Erlang .
Erlang was developed by Joe Armstrong at Ericsson to address problems in the telecom field .
Luke Gorrie ( another programming genius ) has been telling me that I should get some Erlang experience for years now .
Luke and I both work in the telecom / datacom field .
Luke was at Bluetail with some of the key Erlang folks and later wound up at Nortel through a series of acquisitions .
I had just left Nortel a while earlier .
Erlang 's big claim to fame is concurrency .
An Erlang program is composed of multiple " processes , " similar in function to OS - level processes , but running in one or more virtual machines .
Processes communicate by message passing .
When the processes are all located in the same VM , this happens very quickly , but the nice thing is that the communication semantics are identical if the processes are running on multiple VMs , possibly on multiple computers .
This makes it very easy to write Erlang programs that run in a distributed fashion .
Erlang is functional and keeps the memory of each process completely separate from the others ( " shared nothing " ) .
This improves the reliability of programs for several reasons .
First , you do n't have to worry about mutable data structures messing you up , violating an assumption without you knowing about it .
Second , processes can't interact with each other except through message passing .
If a process crashes for whatever reason , the other processes around it can generally continue to function until the crashed process is restarted .
And Erlang processes can crash a lot .
This is n't because the programs are necessarily buggy , though that 's one reason , but rather because Erlang actually encourages you to program only for the common case and to crash the moment your program detects any violation of its assumptions .
The theory here is that rather than trying to continue a failed computation , it 's often better for the overall system reliability for a process to give up and let other processes outside the failed process clean up the resulting mess .
This is an interesting philosophy but it has a lot of merit .
Think about your typical PC .
If you 're a Linux user and you encounter a buggy program , how many of you will restart it in order to try to clean up the mess ?
If you have a buggy Windows system , how many of you reboot it ?
And generally , this works .
Erlang simply takes the same idea and applies what we all know intuitively to be true , rebooting often fixes problems , to processes within a larger program .
Now , one of the neat things about Erlang crashes is that they produce a stack trace , much like you 'd have in a Lisp system , such that a programmer is n't left with no data , scratching his head , wondering why the process crashed .
You at least have some data to go on when you start debugging .
Erlang aims to have systems that operate non -stop for years .
To support this , Erlang supports hot code replacement .
So imagine you have the scenario where a customer reports a bug .
Your support person asks the customer to send the log file , in which is the stack trace .
A programmer examines the data and determines a fix .
You recompile the program and send the customer the new version .
The customer loads the new version while the old one is still running and the new version takes over seamlessly , with no downtime .
Yes , Lisp has had many of these same ideas , and Erlang incorporates them .
Erlang is not all a bed of roses .
I do n't like the syntax .
It 's scary to say this , but I really do like and appreciate Lisp sexprs .
Erlang has primitive macros , ala C , but nothing approaching the power of Lisp .
Pet peeve : Modern software reliability is horrible .
I think Erlang at least gets its philosophy right .
It 's built to make highly reliable systems and it has the features to support that goal .
From the get - go , it says , " Okay , we 're going to be building systems that will operate non -stop for years .
Of course we 'll find bugs , but we need ways to be able to debug the system and then introduce changes to it without taking the system down .
Further , bugs should only result in partial failures if at all possible .
Where there are other tasks in the system unaffected by the bugs , they should remain available through the whole problem period . "
There are very few languages that could rise to that challenge .
Lisp and Smalltalk come the closest , I think , but even with those there are issues of corrupted data structures hanging around and causing problems .
I know it 's all in fashion right now , but I 'm starting to contemplate my dream language .
It looks a lot like CL or Scheme , but with some rather nice ideas borrowed from Erlang ( and possibly Smalltalk and maybe even Ruby ) .
In particular , the ability to have large numbers of concurrent processes , with message passing semantics .
Keep the same sexpr syntax as Lisp and leave in all the introspection and meta- programming facilities .
While there have been attempts to merge Erlang and Lisp concepts before , notably with Erlisp ( and another one on the Scheme side whose name escapes me right now ) , I think what 's needed is a ground - up rethink .
Erlisp attempts to capture some of Erlang 's process and message passing ideas in standard Common Lisp .
Unfortunately , most Common Lisps do n't have great multiprocessing capabilities , and none have thought through the " shared none " semantics that Erlang uses to increase reliability of the overall system .
Semantically , in an Erlang system , sending a message to another process always creates a copy ( of course , the copy may be optimized away by the compiler if the semantics are preserved ) .
SETF has all sorts of abilities to trip you up in standard Common Lisp if you are n't careful .
Maybe to spare myself the embarrassment of trying to implement this ( I 'm not a Slava Pestov , a Charles Moore , or a Luke Gorrie ) , I 'll base it on Arc .
As soon as Paul is done , I 'll get cracking on this new thing ...
( Oh , and I 'm not a Paul Graham either . )
If you 're a Republican presidential candidate and you 're a Mormon , and let 's say for argument 's sake that your name is something wacky and slightly effete , like maybe " Mitt , " you might find yourself having to overcome the nation 's not - yet - fully - formed questions about the nature of your religion .
For a Republican primary candidate , that can be a sore spot .
So rather than address the problem directly , and open yourself , your candidacy and your religion up to some uncomfortable questioning , here 's what you can do : freak everybody out with other stuff .
You may already have heard that Romulan Remulak Romney named L. Ron Hubbard 's ( yes , Scientology 's L. Ron Hubbard -- way to throw 'em of the crazy scent there , Mitt ! )
Battlefield Earth as his favorite novel .
But when I asked the other day , " What *& % $@#ing planet is Mitt Romney from ? "
I did n't realize there was an actual answer out there .
Romney , you 'll recall , had made this crackpot claim :
" In France , for instance , I 'm told that marriage is now frequently contracted in seven - year terms where either party may move on when their term is up .
How shallow and how different from the Europe of the past . "
Ana Marie Cox at Swampland locates the planet :
Via The Plank , where they note that the whole seven - year - contract with option to renew is , in fact , a plot point in a novel by fellow Mormon Orson Scott Card . *
* UPDATE : Card 's book with the seven - year marriage contracts ?
It 's called " The Memory of Earth , " and it is a fictionalization of the Book of Mormon set in outer space .

Rice is the staple food for more than three billion people
Most rice plants die within a week of being underwater , but the researchers hope the new gene will offer greater protection to the world 's rice harvest .
Farmers in south - east Asia lose an estimated £ 524 m ( $ 1 bn ) each year from rice crops being destroyed by flooding .
The findings have been published in the science journal Nature .
The team from the University of California , Davis , US , and the International Rice Research Institute ( IRRI ) based in the Philippines says the gene , called Sub1A - 1 , will give the plants greater protection against damaging flooding .
They say it will also offer farmers greater crop protection , especially those who live in vulnerable areas .
Flood risks
Although rice production has doubled over the past 40 years , demand is continuing to grow .
The crop is the staple food for more than three billion people around the globe .
Attempts to breed that tolerance into commercially viable rice failed to generate successful varieties
Dr David Mackill , paper 's co-author
Many rice growing regions in southern Asia are located in low - lying areas that are at risk from flooding during the monsoon season .
Plants submerged in water for longer than a few days are deprived of carbon dioxide and soon wither and die .
Dr David Mackill , from the International Rice Research Institute and one of the paper 's authors , said scientists had been trying for half a century to develop a water resistant crop .
" Several traditional rice varieties have exhibited a greater tolerance to submergence , but attempts to breed that tolerance into commercially viable rice failed to generate successful varieties , " he explained .
Another member of the team , Dr Pamela Ronald from the University of California , Davis , added : " Our research team anticipates that these newly developed rice varieties will help ensure a more dependable food supply for poor farmers and their families . "
Takuji Sasaki , from Japan 's National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences , said the researchers had succeeded where others had failed .
" The particular impact of this study lies in [ the ] accurate and effective introduction of Sub1A - 1 into local rice varieties subject to seasonal flooding . "
The team members said that they were confident that " even more important " discoveries were in the pipeline .
A reader writes :
Keep going on the white lies , Andrew .
Here is one that is propagated by the left and the right :
It is not an occupation of a sovereign country , dear , it is a front in the war an terrorism .
Here is one way to test if you think the occupation of Iraq is at all part of a war on terrorism :
You are the commander in chief .
Your general comes to and says " I think the best tactic to employ in the WOT is to occupy a sovereign country and tie up 66 percent of our military for years enforcing that occupation . "
Would you follow that advice ?
My little brother is in Diyala province right now .
I had to call my Dad and calm him down after the car bombing the other night .
This gives one great clarity .
I ask myself if my brother is in Iraq to fight a war or to enforce an occupation ?
When he tells me what he does all day and the missions he goes on it is very , very clear what he is doing there .
He is there to enforce an occupation .
I challenge anyone to show me any evidence that he , or any of our soldiers , is there to fight a war .
Evidence , not rhetoric .
And saying we are fighting people who were born in that sovereign country and do n't like it occupied does n't count as fighting a war .
That is enforcing an occupation .
When do we start to doubt that we are at war with anyone at all ?
A friend of mine sat me down last night over a glass of wine and made me watch " The Fog of War " , the McNamara documentary that won an Oscar a few years ago .
What it brought home was how the war in Vietnam became a moving target : what we had gone there to stop in the first place had become altered by our presence , until the very notion of what victory or defeat meant became harder and harder to define .
I scoffed at Vietnam comparisons before .
And many are still irrelevant .
But this one is n't : the fog of what we 're doing there and why .
In supporting this war , I did so for a few central reasons : 1 ) the possibility of Saddam handing over WMDs to Islamist terrorists ; 2 ) the removal of an evil tyrant in violation of umpteen UN resolutions ; 3 ) the establishment of some kind of democratic space within the Middle East to counter the cycle of autocracy and Islamism that was becoming a clear and present danger to the U.S .
We have done 1 and 2 - although we discovered that 1 was nowhere near as threatening as we assumed .
But in doing 1 and 2 incompetently , we have made 3 more remote and have transformed the war into one in which the U.S. is almost unilaterally and indefinitely occupying a sovereign Muslim country .
There may be aspects of this that are good .
I have no doubt that Baghdad is more peaceful because of the surge .
I 'm eager to publish photos like the one above to show that not everyone is hostile to the US there , although many obviously are .
Darpa says a soldier 's brain can be monitored in real time , with an EEG picking up " neural signatures " that indicate target detection .
Image : Darpa View Slideshow U.S. Special Forces may soon have a strange and powerful new weapon in their arsenal : a pair of high - tech binoculars 10 times more powerful than anything available today , augmented by an alerting system that literally taps the wearer 's prefrontal cortex to warn of furtive threats detected by the soldier 's subconscious .
In a new effort dubbed " Luke 's Binoculars " – after the high - tech binoculars Luke Skywalker uses in Star Wars – the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is setting out to create its own version of this science - fiction hardware .
And while the Pentagon 's R&D arm often focuses on technologies 20 years out , this new effort is dramatically different – Darpa says it expects to have prototypes in the hands of soldiers in three years .
The agency claims no scientific breakthrough is needed on the project – formally called the Cognitive Technology Threat Warning System .
Instead , Darpa hopes to integrate technologies that have been simmering in laboratories for years , ranging from flat - field , wide - angle optics , to the use of advanced electroencephalograms , or EEGs , to rapidly recognize brainwave signatures .
In March , Darpa held a meeting in Arlington , Virginia , for scientists and defense contractors who might participate in the project .
According to the presentations from the meeting , the agency wants the binoculars to have a range of 1,000 to 10,000 meters , compared to the current generation , which can see out only 300 to 1,000 meters .
Darpa also wants the binoculars to provide a 120 - degree field of view and be able to spot moving vehicles as far as 10 kilometers away .
The most far - reaching component of the binocs has nothing to do with the optics : it 's Darpa 's aspirations to integrate EEG electrodes that monitor the wearer 's neural signals , cueing soldiers to recognize targets faster than the unaided brain could on its own .
The idea is that EEG can spot " neural signatures " for target detection before the conscious mind becomes aware of a potential threat or target .
Darpa 's ambitions are grounded in solid research , says Dennis McBride , president of the Potomac Institute and an expert in the field .
" This is all about target recognition and pattern recognition , " says McBride , who previously worked for the Navy as an experimental psychologist and has consulted for Darpa .
" It turns out that humans in particular have evolved over these many millions of years with a prominent prefrontal cortex . "
That prefrontal cortex , he explains , allows the brain to pick up patterns quickly , but it also exercises a powerful impulse control , inhibiting false alarms .
EEG would essentially allow the binoculars to bypass this inhibitory reaction and signal the wearer to a potential threat .
In other words , like Spiderman 's " spider sense , " a soldier could be alerted to danger that his or her brain had sensed , but not yet had time to process .
That said , researchers are circumspect about plans to deploy the technology .
One participant in last month 's Darpa workshop , John Murray , a scientist at SRI International , says he thought the technology was feasible " in a demonstration environment , " but fielding it is another matter .
" In recent years the ability to measure neural signals and to analyze them quickly has advanced significantly , " says Murray , whose own work focuses on human effectiveness .
" Typically in these situations , there are a whole lot of other issues ( involved ) in building and deploying , beyond the research . "
It 's unclear what the final system will look like .
The agency 's presentations show soldiers operating with EEG sensors attached helmet - style to their heads .
Although the electrodes might initially seem ungainly , McBride says that the EEG technology is becoming smaller and less obtrusive .
" It 's easier and easier , " he says .
But getting the system down to a target weight of less than five pounds will be a challenge , and Darpa 's presentations make it clear that size and power are also issues .
But even if EEG does n't make it into the initial binoculars , researchers involved in other areas say there are plenty of improvements to existing technology that can be fielded .
For example , another key aspect of the binoculars will detect threats using neuromorphic engineering , the science of using hardware and software to mimic biological systems .
Paul Hasler , a Georgia Institute of Technology professor who specializes in this area and attended the Darpa workshop , describes , for example , an effort to use neural computation to " emulate the brain 's visual cortex " – creating sensors that , like the brain , can scan across a wide field of view and " figure out what 's interesting to look at . "
While some engineers are mimicking the brain , others are going after the eye .
Vladimir Brojavic , a former Carnegie Mellon University professor , specializes in a technology that replicates the function of the human retina to allow cameras to see in shadows and poor illumination .
He attended last month 's workshop , but he said he was unsure whether his company , Intrigue Technologies , would bid for work on the project .
" I 'm hesitant to pick it up , in case it would distract us from our product development , " he says .
According to the Darpa presentations , the first prototypes of Luke 's Binoculars could be in soldiers ' hands within three years .
That 's an ambitious schedule , and an unusual one for Darpa , note several workshop attendees , who also say they expect fierce competition over the project .
The list of attendees at the meeting ranged from university professors to major contractors .
Spokespeople for Lockheed Martin and Raytheon both confirmed interest in the program , but declined to say whether they would bid on it .
Once fielded , Darpa indicates the measure of success lies with the military .
According to information the agency provided to industry , initial prototypes would go to Special Forces .
If the military asks to keep the binoculars after the trials , " that 's exactly what you want here , " Darpa wrote .
" That 's success . "
Why all the rush ?
" I have to wonder if they are n't under pressure from Congress to make a contribution ( to the war on terrorism ) , or if DOD is really leaning on them to come up with some stuff , " suggests Jonathan Moreno , a professor of ethics at the University of Pennsylvania , whose recent book , Mind Wars , looks at the Pentagon 's burgeoning interest in neuroscience .
Darpa did not respond to press inquiries about the program .
Despite the fast schedule , McBride , of the Potomac Institute , thinks the idea is doable .
" It 's a risky venture , but that 's what Darpa does , " he says .
" It 's absolutely feasible . "

Story Highlights • Iraqi woman sentenced to hang in killings of 3 relatives
• Woman says she was tortured into confessing a role in the slayings
• New Amnesty International study says many " confessions " are being coerced
• Amnesty , another group are working to commute death sentences of 4 women
Adjust font size :
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Sitting on Iraq 's death row is a 25 - year - old woman convicted in the slayings of three relatives .
She says her husband carried out the killings and fled .
She confessed to being an accomplice , she says , only after being tortured in police custody .
Despite lingering questions about the case , the fate of Samar Saed Abdullah remains the gallows .
" I am innocent , " she told CNN from inside the al - Kadhimiya Women 's Prison in Baghdad .
" The judge did not hear me out .
He refused to hear anything I have to say .
He just sentenced me . "
( Watch Abdullah cry as she tells her story )
According to Amnesty International , such claims are not uncommon in Iraq , which has the fourth - highest execution rate in the world .
Amnesty issued a report last month that concluded sentences in Iraq increasingly follow flawed trials and coerced confessions .
" In many cases , death sentences have been issued following proceedings which failed to meet international fair trial standards , " the report said .
" This represents a profoundly retrograde step . "
The U.S. - led Coalition Provisional Authority abolished capital punishment in Iraq after Saddam Hussein was toppled in 2003 .
But shortly after the government was handed over to Iraqis , the death penalty was reinstated in August 2004 .
Since that time , more than 270 people have been sentenced to death , and at least 100 people -- including Hussein -- have been executed , according to Amnesty .
Four women are currently on death row .
Two of the women have their young children , ages 1 and 3 , with them on death row , Amnesty says .
Tried and convicted in 1 day
Abdullah is among the death - row women .
She is accused of being an accessory to the murder of her uncle , aunt and cousin -- slayings that allegedly were carried out at their family home by her husband .
In the court documents from her trial , she admitted to confessing she had gone to her uncle 's house with her husband with the intent to steal , but she says she made that confession as a result of being tortured .
In reaching its verdict , the court disregarded her testimony on the grounds that her confession was closer to the date of the crime .
She was tried and convicted in a single day , August 15 , 2005 .
" She did n't confess , " her mother , Hana 'a Abdul Hakim , told CNN .
" It was from the beating they gave her .
She was bleeding .
She finally said write what you want , just stop . "
Under Iraqi law , her claim to confessing under torture should have been investigated , but it was n't .
CNN 's repeated queries to the Higher Judicial Council and the Ministry of Justice went unanswered .
" The judiciary is no longer involved , and nothing can be done unless new evidence comes to light , which is unlikely , " her appeals lawyer , Ali Azzawi , said .
Father : I would n't see her if she was guilty
Inside the prison , Abdullah 's voice trembles with fear , her large brown eyes fill with tears and her hands nervously clench .
" Give me life in prison , 20 years .
Anything but this , " she said from the prison 's " sewing room . "
She holds out hope for an appeal , but she does n't know that the appeal has already been rejected .
No one -- not even her own family -- has the heart to tell her the appeals court upheld her death sentence three months ago .
" I could n't tell her , " her mother said .
" I was afraid that she would do something to herself . "
Through her tears , the mother 's agony is palpable .
At this point , she says she 'll take anything for her daughter : life in prison , a lesser sentence .
Anything but the death sentence .
The family says their daughter met her husband , Saif Ali Nur , in the winter of 2004 .
They did n't approve of him at first , but eventually gave the couple their blessing .
Three months later , the mother says , the couple was driving to get gas when Nur suggested they stop at the uncle 's house .
They did just that .
Their daughter was in the kitchen washing dishes when , according to the mother , her husband locked the kitchen door and gunshots rang out .
Nur is alleged to have killed her uncle , aunt and cousin .
Then , the mother says , he held Abdullah at gunpoint demanding to know where the uncle kept money and gold .
" He dragged her , " the mother said .
" Samar kept telling him she did n't know where the money was . "
The husband left with less than $ 1,000 and some jewelry .
The next day , he dumped his wife at the end of her street and threatened to kill her and the rest of her family if she told authorities , the family said .
Abdullah was arrested by Iraqi police that same day .
The court testimony from her trial mirrors the account the mother told CNN .
" If I thought she was guilty , I swear , I would n't go see her .
She would get the punishment she deserves , but this is such a severe sentence , " her father , Saed Abdul Majid , said .
Every Wednesday is gallows day
Amnesty International has appealed Iraqi authorities on behalf of Abdullah and the other three women on Iraq 's death row .
Another group inside Iraq , the Organization of Women 's Freedom in Iraq , is also seeking to save them .
The group 's head , Dalal Rubaie , says they have successfully appealed cases of two women , including one on death row who , she says , confessed after extensive torture .
" She had her fingernails pulled ; she was hung from the ceiling ; they took pictures of her naked while she was hanging ; they cuffed her to a bed and raped her , " Rubaie says .
Rubaie 's organization delivered a letter from the woman that detailed her allegations to the government and made it public on the Internet .
She is now awaiting a retrial while her claim is being investigated .
As for Abdullah , she dreads every Wednesday , never knowing if it will be her last day alive .
Wednesday is execution day in Iraq , when inmates are led unannounced to the gallows .
" I do n't sleep at all on Wednesdays , " she said .
" I stay scared all day . "
She survived today , but there 's always next Wednesday .
In “ Freed After 22 Years , ” Jonathan Casiano and Mark Mueller of the Newark , New Jersey Star - Ledger report on the case of Byron Halsey , from whom it now appears police extracted a false confession to the molestation and brutal murder of two children after he wrongly failed a polygraph examination .
DNA evidence exculpates Halsey and has pointed to the identity of the true perpetrator .
Excerpt :
The police chief said it was the most horrific act of violence he ’d ever seen .
The prosecutor called it “ inhuman , ” suggesting the death penalty was n’t punishment enough for the “ coward ” who committed the crime .
It was November 1985 , and two Plainfield siblings , ages 7 and 8 , had been sexually assaulted , murdered and mutilated .
Amid a high - profile investigation , authorities quickly focused on Byron Halsey , the boyfriend of the children ’s mother .
A 24 - year - old factory worker with a minor criminal record , Halsey failed a polygraph test .
He confessed .
He was tried and convicted , and when a jury spared him from the death penalty , some in the courtroom jeered .
He would spend 21 1 / 2 years behind bars , virtually all of it in solitary confinement for his own protection .
Yesterday , in a stunning reversal , a Superior Court judge threw out Halsey ’s convictions and ordered a new trial after advanced DNA testing — unavailable at the time of the prosecution — showed that the killings might have been carried out by a Plainfield neighbor .
Halsey , who later retracted his confession , was released on $ 55,000 bail yesterday afternoon .
Outside the courthouse in Elizabeth , where a media throng and a crowd of well - wishers waited for him , Halsey tightly hugged his mother and brother and repeatedly thanked God for his release .
“ There ’s more nice people around me now than there have been around here in a long time , ” he said .
Halsey now awaits a decision by the Union County Prosecutor ’s Office on whether it will proceed with a retrial or drop the case , officially exonerating the man once derided by a prosecutor as a “ calculating , evil genius . ”
A spokeswoman for that office said there would be no immediate comment on a decision .
A hearing on the matter is scheduled for July 9 .
In the meantime , Halsey is required to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet .
“ It has taken more than two decades , but DNA has finally revealed the truth in this case , ” said Vanessa Potkin , a lawyer with the Innocence Project , a group that works on behalf of inmates whom it considers wrongfully convicted .
If he is ultimately cleared , Halsey will be the fifth New Jerseyan and 202nd person across the coun try to be exonerated through the use of DNA evidence , according to the group , which is affiliated with the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York .
Appparently , the European Union wants the rest of the world to adopt their rules :
Brussels wants the rest of the world to adopt the European Unionâ€™s regulations , the European Commission will say this week .
A Commission policy paper that examines the future of the Unionâ€™s single market says European single market rules have inspired global standard - setting in areas such as product safety , the environment , securities and corporate governance .
â€ œIncreasingly the world is looking to Europe and adopts the standards that are set here , â€ the paper , seen by the Financial Times , says .
The paper calls on the EU to encourage other jurisdictions to follow suit â€ “ for example by â€œpromoting European standards internationally through international organisation and bilateral agreementsâ€ .
This would not be good news for people who believe in free markets , because the E.U. is hardly what one could call a free market economy :
The two sides have very different regulatory philosophies , with the EU placing a heavy emphasis on consumer protection and environmental legislation while the US tends to promote a more market - based approach .
Some critics of the European approach argue that the Unionâ€™s stance on issues such as GM foods may also reflect a desire to protect the regionâ€™s commercial interests .
In other words , the same “ democratic ” socialism that has been a hallmark of European economies for decades .
Asking the rest of the world to adopt these policies is essentially asking them to join France and Germany in the land of permanent double - digit unemployment .

MORE RELIGIOUS POLITICS
You really have to wonder about the mental state of some of our legislators .
Last week , at a Utah County , District 65 Republican Convention , Chairman Don Larsen submitted a resolution saying that Satan – yes , the chief evil spirit , Lucifer , Beelzebub , the Devil of medieval mythology – has a plan to destroy the United States by means of the stealthy invasion of illegal immigrants !
Larsen , in all seriousness , wants the GOP to oppose the devil′s plan .
Friends , are we in Never - Never - Land , or in the United States of America ?
Can we expect Tinkerbelle to flit in the window at any moment … ?
Larsen′s resolution says :
In order for Satan to establish his " New World Order " and destroy the freedom of all people as predicted in the Scriptures , he must first destroy the U.S… .
The mostly quiet and unspectacular invasion of illegal immigrants does not focus the attention of the nations the way open warfare does , but is all the more insidious for its stealth and innocuousness .
Larsen 's resolution calls for the closing of national borders to illegal immigrants so as to " prevent the destruction of the U.S. by stealth invasion . "
And airspace , too , Larsen , to keep Tinkerbelle out ?
Seriously …
MONTEL′S CYNICISM
Now , it′s obvious that Montel Williams has no way of keeping track of the thousands of pieces of mail he receives , and he′s not responsible for this affront to Hal Bidlack , in non-response to Hal′s earnest letter , which can be seen at tinyurl.com / 22vo6 b .
Here is the postcard , a form answer that says nothing …
Reader Zachery Messer has further evidence that Montel and his organization simply rebuffs any criticism of his program content .
They just ignore any appeal to their ethical sense , which appears to be quite absent .
Zachery writes :
First of all , let me say what a huge fan I am of yours – you 've been a real inspiration to me .
I whole - heartedly support your efforts , and think that the cause you are fighting for is both real and very , very important .
I promised myself I would n't turn this email into a gushing love letter , so I 'll get on with what I intended to bring to your attention ...
I originally emailed all of the following to Robert Lancaster of www.stopsylviabrowne.com but seeing as the three of us have similar interests , I thought you might want to hear of it as well .
About a week ago , on the Junkies radio show , Montel Williams called in to discuss a few of his upcoming shows .
During the course of the show , he was directly asked whether he believes in psychics and specifically in Sylvia , to which he replied that he has stated " a million times " on his show that he does not , and that he does not think that Sylvia has any powers .
I 've included with this email an .mp3 of the clip of the show in question and a word document wherein I 've transcribed portions of the conversation with time marks so you can hear it yourself .
Hope that this is helpful in some way , and keep fighting for this worthy cause .
Here′s a transcript of the excerpt from the ″ Junkies ″ radio show .
It ′s a perfect demonstration of the callous disregard that Montel Williams shows for the emotional security of his listeners , and for the integrity of his show : Host :
We ′re talking to talk show host Montel Williams , and today he′s got psychic Sylvia Browne on .
Can you ask her who′s going to win the NBA finals ?
I need to make some money …
Montel : Yeah , well I ′m trying to make some money too … I might ask her , I′ll do it if …
I might ask her …
I′ll see if she′ll , she′ll give it up .
It ′s really funny she′s ah , she′s not a big sports fan , but she will definitely throw down on personalities and what′s going on people′s relationships in a heartbeat …
Host :
Do you believe in that stuff Montel ?
Be honest .
Montel :
Oh , come on , I′ve said it clearly on my show a million times , I don′t believe in psychics .
You know , I happen to believe that , that for , for whatever reason , this woman has a little bit more intuition than most people I know , but the thing that ′s funny about it , she′s great , she′s a funny character …
Host : Right .
Montel :
She′s funny , she′s hysterical , you look at her , you listen to her , she gives some of the funniest answers , people love her – and hate her !
But you have a right to do either one .
She happens to be on today if you want to love her or hate her , or look at her and just laugh .
Host :
Is she one of those who claims she can talk to the dead , and all that ?
Montel : Umm …she doesn′t claim like she actually talks to them , but she kinda …
Host :
They communicate somehow ?
Montel : Yeah , she communicates .
They pass through .
Now , bear in mind that Montel Williams knows Sylvia Browne is a fake .
He also knows that millions of his listeners accept that her appearances on his shows , validate her claims – because they trust Montel Williams not to deceive them .
No , this is not just a joke , Mr. Williams .
Sylvia Browne is n′t at all ″ funny , ″ except to those who cannot see how vicious and uncaring she is .
The grief and sorrow of your listeners are not personal playthings that CBS Radio handed you for your amusement .
Or hadn′t that occurred to you …?
But why do I waste my time trying to find some integrity in this man ?
He doesn′t care – and right now he and his staff are laughing at the fact that we′re trying to get him to care …
WHAT IS SCIENCE ?
Australian reader Pat Bullman tackles the question , and offers a subtle definition …
My blood boiled as I watched the YouTube video of Arthyr Chadbourne trying to sidetrack criticism of astrology .
( See randi.org/jr/2007-04/042707chop.html#i3 . )
I find it so disheartening to hear people talk about science when they obviously do n't have a clue what it means .
That 's just ignorance and it says a lot about modern western educational systems .
Also , this concept of leaving woo - wooers alone in their beliefs does n't work , simply because they 're the type likely to go out and force their beliefs on others .
I have had a chronic illness for over ten years and I 'm frequently hospitalized .
It seems that every second person who learns of this has a cure for me and is not in the least shy about giving me advice .
I get proffered all sorts of things on what will help .
It comes mainly in two strains , firstly there 's the " it worked for me / friend of mine " or " native peoples have known about it for ages . "
The second approach is that of " I know of [ insert any complementary health practitioner here ] who can fix your problem by using [ insert any complementary health practice here ] .
In both approaches there 's always an underlying theme that " science ca n't explain / does n't / know everything . "
Of course , when you answer that you 're being well cared for by doctors and hospital staff or dare to mention modern medicine or science , or indeed show any other signs of not following their advice , they become indignant .
Some go on the attack and I 've copped on more than one occasion the soul destroyer : " Well , Pat , maybe you do n't want to be cured . ″
It 's all very tiring and depressing , very depressing .
I now try not to let the conversation get this far by short - circuiting the inevitable opinions by asking what they think science is .
The answers have been amazing and this brings me to my next point .
I do n't think people understand what science is .
The answers I′ve received were all over the place , abstract ideas like physicists or chemists , or computers , laboratories , chemicals and equations .
We ′re not talking big numbers of people here , maybe twenty people , but not one gave an answer that resembled an educated definition of science .
I think this goes some way to explain comments like those made by Arthyr Chadbourne when he asked , " What is the science of love ? " or – what you were once asked – " What is the formula for a soul ? "
In my situation , I explain that , to me , science is a process of finding the truth by testing if something works or not , and that I only use methods which have been shown to work under test conditions .
This shuts most people up .
Thanks for reading my ravings and please keep up the good work .
Your commentary is informative and entertaining and in plain ( and proper ) English that any age group can understand .
And then Pat adds : PS : With my condition I suffer from chronic pain , and as part of the ongoing treatment I see a Pain Management Clinic .
One of the standard techniques is what 's called Distraction Therapy .
Basically this involves keeping yourself busy , or distracted , which lessens the effects of pain .
It 's a well - used method .
Knowing this , it amuses me to see reports showing the immediate reduction in pain levels in test subjects through procedures like acupuncture .
Of course they would reduce pain .
Something like acupuncture would make ideal Distraction Therapy , as would Reiki , reflexology , ear candling or aromatherapy .
So would playing with your dog , and it'd be a lot less expensive .
And far more useful and pleasant , Pat !
In my recent very long bout with pain and sleeplessness , I opted to work on mental mathematical calculations – simple four - by - four multiplications and extraction of square roots , as examples – and found the distraction rather effective .
I declined most of the chemicals that were offered me , as much as I could , and I found that to be very satisfying .
Being fed from a bag of what looked like Gatorade via a tube in my arm , got to be part of my routine with the sequence of nurses who tended to me , and I developed comedy routines that somewhat cheered them , and me …
My personal brief definition of ″ science ″ has always been :
An organized method for discovering how the world works , by observation , experimentation , and analysis of results – independently of any biases , needs , or prejudices that might color or alter the conclusions – followed by competent , independent , replication of the findings .
Those findings must be subject to rigorous attempts at falsification , and adjusted to more accurately reflect the reality , if and when necessary …
Or reversed …!
APPROPRIATE ACTION TAKEN
I received a copy of this alarming invitation / announcement from my friend Jerry Mertens , who specializes in behavior analysis at St. Cloud State University , Minnesota .
He′s ever - alert to crapiola :
The SCSU Health & Wellness Committee invites you to attend !
– Electrodermal screening ( EDS ) is a scientific approach to health assessment .
It utilizes the meridian system of the body , along with an FDA - approved testing device .
EDS has been very valuable in helping people regain their energy and health ( i.e. stomach problems , fibromyalgia , fatigue , allergies , sleep disorders , persistent coughs , rashes , etc . )
It also screens the body for weakness and stress due to chemicals , pesticides , heavy metals , parasites , bacteria , viruses , allergic reactions , etc .
Come to this presentation to learn about this cutting edge process to maintain your health !
Presenters : Kathy Hagemeister , Carol Athman & Shanna Seguin , EDS Technicians .
I responded that it all sounded like woo - woo to me , and referred them to tinyurl.com / p7ymc for a similar matter .
Jerry added : I had not even heard of the event advertised .
At a big university in a 45 - minute session , even in a small room just about anything can be done !
Having gone through this with other supposed psychic speakers and events , those giving campus rooms for this kind of thing will defend their position on freedom of speech issues .
One can recite this kind of nonsense , and it is freedom of speech – but say the word " shit " in class and you would think they′d never heard of freedom of speech .
Some good skeptical students were in my office when your e-mail came in , and we will go check it out .
I will email Dr. Terry Polevoy for information about the group .
Also , by chance do you have anything on it ?
Jerry promptly heard from Canadian Dr. Polevoy , who told him :
The presentation at St. Cloud State is purely and simply a scam .
There is no evidence that electrodermal screening does anything claimed in your announcement .
How in the world did your university allow these type of scammers onto your campus in the first place ?
I suggest that your school review its policy in regards to the promotion of fraudulent health practitioners .
It may be interesting for you to review this site for more details : tinyurl.com/3ch67v
- Terry Polevoy , MD
Only a day later , I heard back from Jerry Mertens with this happy news re a notice on the St. Cloud bulletin board : Randi , one of the students with me when your email came in , sent the material off of the skeptic website to a campus health source , and here is the resulting announcement :
The informational presentation about Electrodermal Screening scheduled for May 1st at 12:00 pm is CANCELLED .
Sometimes the skeptic network does pay off .
More than just ″ sometimes , ″ Jerry .
I get a regular stream of mail telling me of how information sources like Canadian Quackery Watch and our good friend Stephen Barrett at quackwatch.org often get the attention of responsible authorities .
We win more than we′re aware of , I think .
THE CLARINS FRAUD REVISITED
Reader Ian MacMillan refers to our item at
randi.org/jr/2007-04/040607mi.html#i7
when he tells us :
There is an online Flash video in which the creator of the Clarins spray , " Doctor " Lionel de Benetti , dresses in a white coat ( scientist chic ) and discusses the spray .
The video contains blather about " DNA arrays " and " energy . "
It can be viewed at clarinsnews.com/expertise3p/video.html
Clarins is a French company founded by Jacques Courts - Clarins .
The full name of the spray is Clarins 3P , which is derived from Poly Pollution Protection , the full name of the product .
There is also a critical article about the spray at quackometer .
net/blog/2007/03/beauty-and-quack_20.html
All in all , there is nothing much new about the Clarins spray , but it is becoming ultra- fashionable to blame all manner of vague aches and pains on electromagnetic sensitivity ( a few years ago it was food allergies ) .
As I pointed out just a few weeks ago here , at randi.org/ jr/2007-03/032307hope.html#i1 , this ″ electromagnetic sensitivity ″ nonsense is a classic example of something that can be easily , quickly , definitively , tested …
But , back to Ian :
Here is a mildly amusing anecdote : During my childhood in the late 1960s – early 70s , there was a shoe shop in my home town of Paignton , Devon which had a pediscope .
This was a device used to produce x-ray images of the bones inside a person 's feet , and it looked something like the attached image .
Nowadays pediscopes are banned because they are considered to be too dangerous , and people are allowed to undergo x-rays only when they are considered to be medically necessary .
The science part can be traced back to Planck 's Law , which states that the higher the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation , the more energy the individual quanta will have .
X - rays have a frequency of around one million , million million Hertz , so the quanta pack quite a punch .
Radio waves have a much lower frequency and are not considered to be a health risk , although there is always room for new research in this area .
One of the depressing things about claims of electromagnetic sensitivity is the lack of double blind testing .
If you blindfolded me and put my hand on a stove , I would soon tell you whether it was turned on or not .
Similar tests need to be carried out when a person claims that electrical appliances and mobile phones give them violent headaches .
Without research of this kind , doctors will look askance at claims of EM sensitivity , since they are usually self - diagnosed .
And Ian adds :
As you probably know , Uri Geller has got in on this act as well .
He holds US Patent # 5,726,383 for a mobile phone radiation shield , see tinyurl.com / ytc7m5 from March 1998 .
By the way , I used the pediscope and lived to tell the tale .
It produced a dim grey image showing the bones inside the feet , and I remember being disappointed on learning that the device had been removed from the shop .
I remember these machines well , to be found in almost every shoe shop .
We kids would mount the small step , stick our feet into the opening at the bottom , look down into the top of the device , and press the button to see a gray - green X - ray image of our feet , and if we got to use a multiple - viewer model , such as that shown here in the illustration , others could look in and see , too , as we wiggled our toes !
Of course , we didn′t know that it was a very unwise action .
It ′s a wonder we didn′t all get mutated appendages .
I assume that all you folks have the usual twelve toes … ?
A WIN IN PHILADELPHIA A huge amount of e-mail arrived following a recent announcement by the city of Philadelphia concerning a law that has been on the books for more than 30 years , making fortune telling " for gain or lucre " a third - degree misdemeanor .
Police alerted the Department of Licenses and Inspections about the law a week or so ago .
How that department could have been unaware of a law that 's been staring them in the face for three decades , is something that I cannot answer .
Let 's just say , they never saw it coming …
As a result , city inspectors shut down more than a dozen psychics , astrologers and tarot - card readers .
They didn′t make arrests or issue fines , but assured the scam artists that if they try to return to work , they will face penalties .
Inspectors have closed 16 shops since last Tuesday and they expect to close more .
Suddenly , these fakers are facing a very unhappy future .
In most cases , unless they 've had a sideline of bank robbery or mail fraud , they′ve nothing else they can do to make a living .
This is a very specialized profession ; for example , when you 're a spoon - bender , and you do n't tap - dance or do accounting , there is little else you can turn to .
Already , there are complaints of discrimination being leveled .
The fortunetellers say that the police are discriminating against gypsies , and one disgruntled out - of - work practitioner noted that earlier critics ″ considered that Jesus was a psychic , a fortune - teller , and they crucified him . "
Well , I do n't think it 'll get that bad , at least not in Philadelphia , but this practitioner went further with his prognostications .
He said , " We might be coming to the end of the world . "
Now , that 's a prediction .
KEEPING UP WITH SCIENCE Reader Drew Vics tells us : I caught a segment of " Ask Dr. Oz " on a recent episode of the Oprah Winfrey Show .
Most of his advice followed common sense , except maybe the one about soaking your feet in tea to cure foot odor ( which I guess could work – hey , I 'm no doctor ) , but he had an interesting suggestion for releasing tension and relaxing the muscles .
It was a massage technique called ″ rolfing . ″
Never heard of that , but apparently you can become certified .
He even had a Certified " Advanced " Rolfer join them on stage .
I guess just being certified is n't always enough , there 's the advanced rolfing to aspire to .
The demonstration looked just like some variation of massage .
While I appreciate the use of massage in physical therapy , or as a tension or stress reliever , is this rolfing really such a big advancement ?
No , Drew .
Dr. Oz is a true woo - woo person , and accepts it all as true , even the ″ Therapeutic Touch ″ nonsense ; he has TT nurses in his operating room , actively running about and evening out ″ human auras . ″
See the entries at randi.org/ jr/021805a.html #1 for his participation in the ABC - TV fiasco I contributed to .
Speaking of ABC - TV , I′ll be coming up next Friday ( May 11th ) on 20 / 20 , dealing with the Peter Popoff scam .
Rolfing is just another way to take money from the naïve .
See skepdic.com / rolfing .html for more information .
JUST FOR FUN ?
Reader Andy Coombs returns me ( ugh ! ) to the Gore brouhaha that I got myself into , with a pertinent observation : Just a quick note about the Al Gore-mention in this week 's newsletter .
I 've read through the comments on the original blog link , and comment number 6 by user Scooter clarifies the issue .
A quick google reveals that in the 10/25/05 Michigan Daily , Gore discussed the same thing .
However , here is how they describe it :
When he brought up a graph showing human population growth over the past 100,000 years or so , Gore at first made light of recent debates over the origins of human life : " You do n't have any new laws here I should know about ? " he quipped before labeling the point at the beginning of the graph " Adam and Eve , " provoking laughter .
But then Gore adopted a more prudent tone , adding , " In all seriousness , I really do not see any conflict between my religious faith and sound science . "
Seems to me this is a more accurate telling of the lecture .
I have attended his Global Warming speech and that is how I remember it also .
And , as the date reveals , this is not a new addition .
It seems to be a standard part of his lecture .
The last phrase describing religious faith and sound science also accurately describes what many scientists feel .
It may not be the way many here feel but it was surely not said in the manner described by the original post .
If that ′s the case , I′ve learned more about politics , techniques of public speaking , and human nature …
MY BOO - BOO Understand , I′m a strictly - amateur astronomer – with a Questar , a 6 - inch Newtonian , and an RFT instrument – but I certainly should have spotted what several readers such as Jon Blumenfeld pointed out to me :
The newly - discovered planet , Gliese 581c , is only 20 light years away , and so could not possibly be in another galaxy , regardless of the sloppy language used by a number of news outlets , including CNN .
If there was another Galaxy that close , we′d all be in a LOT of trouble .
Notably , the closest planet that qualifies as ″ earth - like ″ by the definition applied to Gliese 581c , is Mars .
The rankest amateur should have recognized that a planet only 20 light - years distant , would be in the Milky Way – our galaxy .
I blame it all on CNN and NBC – and my own carelessness .
But both Jon and reader Chris Wilson have an even more important point to make about my thinking - process .
Writes Chris :
The second problem with this item is more subtle .
This is with your reasoning that we are definitely not alone because of the " almost - infinite " number of possibilities in the universe .
Unfortunately , " almost - infinite " is not a term with any mathematical or scientific meaning .
It is a statement about intuition .
Unfortunately , as Richard Dawkins points out , it is precisely the human mind 's poor intuition about very large and very small numbers that often leads the undisciplined astray .
It is the use of intuition rather than strict mathematical reasoning about large numbers that leads creationists to think evolution is not plausible .
While the number of planets capable of supporting life in the universe is vast by standards of human intuition , the chance of us finding life is the product of the number of planets times the probability of life starting given such a planet .
We have no way to know what the probability is , and it could be so low that even multiplied by the number of worlds it is very low .
Intuitively , we are n't used to thinking of such low probabilities , so most people assume that with such a vast number of worlds , the probability of finding life on one must be high .
But that is an intuitive response , not a scientific one .
In fact , our complete lack of knowledge of the probability of life arising given the right planet must compel us to admit a complete lack of knowledge of the probability of any life on any other planet in the universe .
This will not always be so – as we gather data from other planets with Earth - like conditions , we will have data on which to narrow the probability , but until then , any opinion about how likely life is elsewhere in the universe is an unscientific opinion about a scientific subject .
I have two comments here .
First , the use of ″ almost - infinite , ″ though strictly incorrect and ″ fuzzy , ″ is something that the average reader can relate to on what we might call a ″ conversational level . ″
The number of grains of sand on all the beaches in Florida , for example , I would label , ″ almost - infinite , ″ and the number of errors made by all such amateur philosophers as I , would be adequately described in that manner – for all practical purposes – but not technically , strictly , correctly , of course .
Mind you , I won′t get into the matter of ″ aleph ″ infinities , or we′d go mad within an hour …
Yes , there are different degrees of infinity , folks , as I discovered at the age of 19 in George Gamow′s captivating book , ″ One , Two , Three …Infinity , ″ where several different kinds of infinities are discussed .
Aleph Null , I seem to remember , is the number of single numbers , Aleph One is the number of points on a line , Aleph Two is the number of possible lines – which must be greater , because lines consist of points , you see – and so on .
It ′s a study that presents many paradoxes , and makes one mad within an hour , as I just warned you …
When I consider the almost - infinite – there it is again !
– amount of time during which permutations and combinations of elements and compounds have been occurring , the huge range of gravitational , temperature , pressure , and radiation influences , and the corresponding possible number of viable experiments that have taken place , I cannot imagine that a large number of those experiments have not been successful .
Now , though the largest percentage of them doubtless failed to survive their emergence , the number of those that did survive – on the ″ vast … number of planets capable of supporting life in the universe ″ that reader Wilson cites , surely are around , or were until ″ recently ″ – meaning within a few million years of today .
We ′re one of those successful experiments …
So , I weakly beg off on the excuse that the layman will relate my usage to the real world …
BOOK REVIEW REVIEW
A recent review in the Journal of Parapsychology by parapsychologist John Palmer of William Roll′s new book ″ Unleashed , ″ has come to my attention .
I′m surprised to see that Dr. Palmer appears to accept the Tina Resch case as a genuine example of RSPK ( Repeated Spontaneous Psychokinesis ) despite the gaping holes in the account and the firmly demonstrated contradictions in the evidence .
However , that is Dr. Palmer′s choice , for whatever reason ; our previous contacts , where we participated in investigations of certain psychic claims , had shown me a person of more cautious mien .
I′m concerned with the 268 words there that deal with my involvement in the ″ Columbus Poltergeist ″ case .
A very attractive item appeared in the media back in 1984 , when a girl in Columbus , Ohio , reported that genuine poltergeist phenomena were taking place in the presence of a fourteen - year - old girl named Tina Resch .
The Columbus Dispatch newspaper followed the titillating story for a week , during which flying telephones , loud percussive noises , swinging and falling lamps , and other events were plentiful .
Upon investigation , it was discovered that the girl was an adopted child who wanted to discover her true parents , and she was using the media attention to plead for that information .
Every time the media assembled to interview her , she asked them to find that information for her .
Then , a video camera from a visiting TV crew that was inadvertently left running , recorded Tina cheating by surreptitiously pulling over a table lamp while she thought she was not being observed .
Other reported occurrences were shown to be outright inventions of the press or highly exaggerated descriptions of quite explainable events .
Descriptions given by a parapsychologist , William Roll , who specialized in poltergeist investigations and had examined the situation in person , turned out to be of quite impossible sequences .
In 1994 Tina Resch was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of her three - year - old daughter .
It was the culmination of several disastrous marriages and serious psychological problems .
Though the case of the Columbus Poltergeist faded away after a few months and is not now seriously discussed , Roll has now written a book about it .
That book , ″ Unleashed , ″ is the subject of Dr. Palmer′s review , from which I quote : Additional spice was added by the appearance of CSICOP 's erstwhile debunker of things that go bump in the night , James " The Amazing " Randi .
Several days after the news conference , magician Randi held an impromptu press conference of his own in front of the Resch 's home , waving the eternally unclaimed $ 10,000 check he offers to anyone who can show him a psychic event he considers genuine .
As I′ve made very clear to Dr. Palmer and to others , I am not a debunker ; I am an investigator .
If my investigations , by their findings , result in a debunking – and that ′s usually the case , when sufficient evidence is presented to enable any proper examination – that′s the natural outcome of such projects .
I showed up at the Resch home at their invitation , straight from the airport , and was intercepted by the media waiting outside who were expecting me .
I would not categorize that event as ″ holding a press conference , ″ though Dr. Palmer was not there and obviously made an incorrect assumption .
Also , I was not ″ waving ″ any check , since I′d gone to Columbus directly from Tennessee following a lecture date there , and I was not traveling with the check .
Furthermore , and again as Dr. Palmer well knows , any winner of my long - established prize – now at an improved $ 1,000,000 – need not ″ show ″ me anything , nor does my opinion of their claim enter into the matter ; that is all covered in the published rules .
Dr. Palmer continues : He [ Randi ] asked to conduct his own investigation of the case , along with two scientists from a local university .
Joan [ Resch ] was willing to let the scientists in , but Randi 's usual abusive rhetoric dissuaded her from having him join them .
Not true .
I′d been invited there to investigate the matter , and I never met Joan Resch , Tina′s adoptive mother , nor ever spoke to her .
Later , I found out that William Roll himself was already in the house when I arrived on the scene , and he had personally denied me admission , telling the media that he ″ simply didn′t want Randi in there . ″
Seeing how ruthlessly Mr. Roll subsequently manipulated , misreported , and distorted the evidence on the Columbus Poltergeist case , that fear was understandable .
Dr. Palmer continues :
In fact , such behavior makes one wonder if Randi expected and wanted to be denied an invitation .
As the affair actually played out , he was able to make his point and garner the desired publicity without running the risk of seeing something in the house that he might not be able to explain .
The scientists declined to go in alone .
This is not surprising either , as Randi considers scientists to be particularly poor observers , who might not be able to detect fraud if such occurred .
The scientists obviously were brought along solely to add scientific credibility to the escapade .
As I said , I already had the invitation , withdrawn by William Roll .
Dr. Palmer′s facetious suggestion that I feared to find a genuine phenomenon , doesn′t fool anyone .
However , Roll′s fear that I would uncover the trick , was quite genuine .
The scientists , well aware that they could be fooled , turned away when they saw that the event was being orchestrated by Roll .
As for scientists being – in my quoted opinion , here – ″ poor observers , ″ that only applies to scientists who are out of their field of expertise , as I′ve often said .
A perfect example of one scientist who recognized that fact ?
After a demonstration by ″ psychic ″ Uri Geller , a prominent physicist was asked how the trick was done , and he frankly stated , ″ I don′t know , but then , I ′m not a magician , so I don′t know how any of these things are done . ″
That physicist was Nobel Laureate Richard Feynman …
I agree with Dr. Palmer that there was an ″ escapade ″ involved here , but it was the Resch - and - Roll show …
Palmer continues : Randi subsequently appeared on a panel devoted to the case at the 1984 Parapsychological Association Convention , and he later published his conclusions in Skeptical Inquirer ( Randi , 1985 ) .
The latter was essentially a critique of Roll 's investigation and Shannon 's photographs .
Roll and Storey devote several pages in the book to answering Randi 's attack , accusing him of misrepresenting or ignoring facts that did not fit his interpretation .
Dr. Palmer , just where was the evidence in the Columbus Parapsychologist case ?
It certainly was not in the testimony of Shannon , the photographer , who contradicted himself repeatedly , nor in other stories that were told , each discrediting the other , as we found later .
It was in ″ Roll′s investigation and Shannon′s photographs ″ !
I think that′s an excellent reason for me to have critiqued those areas , don′t you think ?
I have not yet seen the Roll book , but I can fully understand why the authors would devote much text trying to escape the damning facts that I produced to show that Tina Resch lied , and that William Roll misrepresented the facts .
A few words should be said here about William Roll′s responsibility in the Tina Resch tragedy .
Roll treated this 14 - year - old child like royalty .
He knew he was on to a hot item that would further his career as a parapsychologist with the media and with his colleagues , and he played that situation all the way .
Tina got to travel , to be interviewed , featured in the media , and believed by millions of fans all over the world .
This was a cause célèbre that promised to equal the previous advent of Uri Geller on the woo - woo horizon , though that promise was soon over .
As a result of this fame , Tina Resch , I think , began to believe that she′d fooled just about everyone , and could continue to do so with impunity .
When that bubble burst , she entered into a series of failed marriages , culminating in the murder of her own child , a crime that got her a life sentence .
Had Roll not been there to cultivate the mess he′d fostered and encouraged , I do not think the tragedy would have reached the culmination it did …
Exclusive to STR
October 31 , 2006
Just in case you 've been too riveted to the pathetic dirty - old - Congressman - chasing - teenage - boys scandal involving U.S. Rep .
Mark Foley , there has been big news of late that superstar journalist Bob Woodward has published a new book , State of Denial : Bush at War Part III .
In an interview promoting his latest tome , he finally came right out and said what someone of his notoriety and stature should have said a long time ago about the bloody and misguided Iraq War :
You know , it ' may be mismanaged . '
It 's been ' poorly executed , ' you see , and ' poor execution ' in the pursuit of a war of occupation in a foreign country , especially because it was driven largely by ' idealism ' and ' the right motives , ' is the 'essence of tragedy . '
So somebody finally came out and told the complete , unvarnished , no -holds - barred truth : Iraq may be a bloody , tragic mess , but it was n't because the hearts of the U.S. government technocrats who planned it were n't in the right place ' they 're just not very good managers , you see .
They clearly have not read Kevin and Jackie Frieberg 's Nuts ! , or else they'd have the current bloodbath in Iraq looking like the Southwest Airlines of wars .
Sarcasm aside , I guess I should commend former Naval intelligence officer Woodward on at least using the term ' tragedy ' in relation to the Iraq War , a term that most of the neocon warmongers would n't dare utter without going into violent spasms .
But if his definition of ' tragedy ' in Iraq is ' poor execution , ' then I would reckon that his new book ' which I must admit I have not read ' would be more fit for post - toilet sanitation than serious historical scholarship .
( Notice that in the interview , Woodward denies that truth has to be the ' first casualty of war ' and then immediately contradicts himself and condones government employment of the ' bodyguard of lies ' as ' sometimes ' being necessary during wartime ' good reason to view anything he says or writes with your bullshit detector turned up a notch . )
A few years back , I once saw Sammy Sosa go to bat against the New York Mets as I sat about seven rows back from home plate at Wrigley Field in Chicago .
Bases were loaded and he was so intent on whacking that ball that it seemed as though he wanted to shred it to bits with his bat ; it was clearly visible that his whole body was one big ball of tension .
He swung good and hard three times , slicing wind without even so much as kissing the ball .
Now that 's ' poor execution . '
Fans may be disappointed and may even get angry when a pro ball player like Sosa strikes out , but who dies ?
Nobody .
How many homes are pummeled , or buildings reduced to rubble ?
None .
How many widows are made by a baseball player 's poor execution of a swing at the ball ?
None .
How many children are orphaned , and how many are blown to bits ?
None .
Judging from Woodward 's choice of terminology , he could just as well be talking about the Cubs vs. the Mets at the bottom of the ninth with bases loaded rather than a long and protracted war that may have resulted in as many as 655,000 more deaths in Iraq than would have otherwise occurred had that conflict never been initiated by the Bush Gang , though the use of newspeak ( or is it doublespeak ? ) by the news media may provide us with a clue as to how the American masses have become so desensitized to the idea of war over the last century or so .
' Poor execution ' is not the tragedy here .
The war itself is the tragedy , a war started by a government , a state , headed by a president who rationalized his and his gang 's criminal actions with blatant lies to his countrymen about alleged WMD , the existence of which could only be verified by the sight of mushroom clouds hovering over American soil , at least according to him and his fawning , bootlicking acolytes .
He and his capos now confess that it looks like there were no WMD in Iraq after all , but what does a few lies resulting in 655,000 deaths matter in comparison to the wonder and splendor of the glorious new socialist democracy that will surely bring blissful freedom to the Iraqi people ?
Those 655,000 dead human beings apparently matter not a whit to the statist class and their cheerleaders .
According to them , the real tragedy here is not an unjust war that has left so many dead and ruined , but that said war was just so poorly executed and managed so incompetently , made all the sadder in that it was borne of ' idealism ' and ' the right motives . '
Makes you kind of wonder :
What exactly is Woodward 's idea of a war that is well executed ?
If he thinks that a war managed competently 'if we may momentarily indulge ourselves in the delusion that waging war can ever be a competent act 'would result in fewer dead innocents , then he is in complete denial of the nature of government and warfare .
If he actually hopes for a ' good war ' that would result in more deaths but that this would be a good thing provided that the deaths were of those who dared to get in the way of the U.S. bureaucrats ' deadly democratic idealism and allegedly pure motives , then he is both delusional and bloodthirsty to boot .
And if he thinks that a well - executed war would result in less terrorism , then he 's just plain ignorant .
Like the revelations of Congressman Foley 's lustful pursuit of young male pages , Woodward 's latest opus is well timed for the mid-term Congressional elections and equally as distracting from the real root issues that so desperately need to be addressed :
The horrific crimes of states against the rest of humanity and the system of delusional , morally bankrupt ideas that provides a superficial moral cover for such crimes .
Whenever this or that scheme of state central planners inevitably flounders and yields disastrous results 'a phenomenon every bit as natural as the sun rising in the east and setting in the west ' the largely government - regulated and cartelized corporate - state news media can always be counted upon to spin such massive failures as being the consequences not of the corrupt and perverted philosophy inherent in statist plans , but as that of the particular individuals charged with executing and managing such plans .
The concept of sending 160,000 or so soldiers to another country on the other side of the world to ' liberate ' its population from totalitarian oppression by means of maiming and killing them should sound to the masses , particularly in this day and age , about as reasonable as bombing a nursing home in order to cure its residents of their various ailments ' followed by the bombers bragging about their noble service to the greater good and expecting the shell - shocked survivors of the massacre to throw rose petals at their feet in eternal gratitude .
Neither proposition makes any sense unless you uphold death and destruction as a reasonable solution to human problems .
That is the mentality of the caveman , the barbarian , and the ancient pagan eager to sacrifice other human beings to his imaginary gods .
And that is statism .
As I write this , the word is that the USS Eisenhower carrier strike force is very close to the Gulf of Hormuz , just off the coast of Iran , or is perhaps already there .
For anyone with even a cursory acquaintance with recent U.S. military history , this very much appears to be preparation for the initiation of yet another senseless war .
If the U.S. attacks Iran ' and I fear that such an attack will come before January '07 if not before the upcoming congressional elections next week 'a major turning point will have been reached .
The delusional and bloodthirsty bizarrocrats in Washington will have plunged this country ever deeper into the abyss of a continually widening regional conflict on the other side of the globe , the costs of which will be staggering .
It 's really a marvel to behold the great U.S. Federal Megastate 's propaganda machine at work .
Even as the U.S. government lines up its well - armed ducks for an eventual attack on Iran , Washington has 'with the help of its puppets and shills in the news media ' successfully focused the world 's attention on North Korea .
Somehow , a country in which much of the population has been starving to death poses every bit as much of a danger to civilization as did Saddam 's Iraq , which to people with an ability to think logically translates as no threat at all .
And yet , North Korea 's flaky leader fires off a nuclear device in his own country and the news media cranks the fearmongering into high gear .
This is not to say that the fact that a goofball dictator has set off a nuclear explosion is not a reason for concern , but it should be viewed in its proper perspective .
Setting aside the pure , unmitigated gall of the U.S. government , the only entity in history to have deliberately attacked civilian population centers with atomic bombs not just once but twice , to presume itself the final arbiter of which foreign governments get to have nukes and which do n't , let 's stop fooling ourselves with the ridiculous idea that Kim Jong - Il is hellbent on nuking our country or any other .
He may be obsessed with the Hollywood fantasy factory , but he's not so lost in dreamland as to risk his own destruction , which would surely be the results of the nuclear retribution that would most likely occur in response to his firing off a nuclear missile at anyone .
The fact of the matter is that Kim had been masterminding an elaborate blackmail scheme by which Americans , through their taxes , were forced by Uncle Sam to finance Kim 's totalitarian socialist regime .
Perhaps Kim would not have had the financial resources to make any nuclear devices if the U.S. government had not sent hundreds of millions of our hard - earned dollars in financial aid to him in the first place .
But then that would have been one less boogeyman in the world that the U.S. government could use to scare its subjects into submission , would n't it ?
Meanwhile , the nuclear - powered Eisenhower and its attendant vessels of mass destruction prepare for a blitz on Iran , unbeknownst to an American public distracted by the cartoonish Kim Jong Il , Mark Foley , the ' mismanaged ' Iraq War and gay marriage .
This would be the third war initiated by the U.S. government in just a little over five years .
This will also be yet another bloodstained lesson showing the whole world why concentrating immense firepower into the hands of a relatively few high priests of central planning is a very , very bad idea .
Preach the obvious evils of statism in this day and age and you 're likely to get a vapid lecture on the alleged importance of voting .
What is needed to save civilization from these bloodthirsty despots is not another trip to the ballot box , but rather the courage to accept a singularly radical truth :
We do n't need government and it would be in our best interests to be rid of it .
It 's an idea whose time has come .
The Earth is neither flat nor the center of the universe , the moon is not made of Swiss cheese and the state is an evil that is wholly unnecessary .
But I suspect that states will live on for quite a few more years yet , perhaps for several more centuries , and it will be because a critical mass of humanity will continue to stubbornly cling to the foundation of statism 's sick philosophy , the fallacy of authority .
Authority is the greatest lie ever perpetrated against the human race .
It is the illusory notion that a group of humans who , regardless of being every bit as flawed as anyone else , should be entrusted with the responsibility of keeping the rest of us protected , paid , fed , sheltered and well medicated in pursuit of some muddled and ill - defined ' greater good ' of the collective whole .
Advocates of such authority - based systems believe that they will be spared the great tasks of thinking and providing for themselves , but implicit in delegating these responsibilities to the authoritarian rulers is conceding to them a legalized monopoly on the initiation of force and violence .
That such a power for this relatively small group of people we call ' government ' inevitably corrupts them and leads them to commit such horrific atrocities as mass warfare has been amply demonstrated time and again throughout human history , but too many people choose to believe the fanciful lie that somehow , no matter how much they continually make things worse , supposedly enlightened bureaucrats are preventing the fire and brimstone that would supposedly fall from the sky without them .
People want to believe this lie so badly that they are utterly blind to the fact that it is this misguided belief that is destroying everything beautiful in this world .
Many Americans have bought into a particularly pernicious version of the authority fantasy called ' democracy . '
This is the belief that authority chosen by the majority should always rule by virtue of the sheer number of people who showed up on a particular day to cast into a ballot box or punch into a computer a choice of slave masters , regardless of whether or not there are others who want to be ruled by any masters at all , let alone those chosen by the majority .
It is the conceit that the greatest number should be allowed to plunder and dictate to the smallest number ' that might makes right , and that the brute force of the mob , rather than ideas , should be the only acceptable currency among a ' civilized ' people .
To propose that the plundering and bullying be waged by the ballot rather than the gun makes democracy no less brutal than any other form of government , contrary to all the claims of benevolence made by its most ardent supporters .
When the war on Iran is launched , catching most of the country by surprise and prompting dissenters to take to the streets and the Internet in protest , Bush may very well be able to fully utilize his newfound power to suspend habeas corpus at his personal whim and jail perhaps thousands of anti-war activists under the false pretext that they give support to terrorists .
Such an act would reveal democratic government for the sham that it is , but the social democrats would no doubt still blather and dither that such governmental actions reveal not any natural defects in the system itself but merely show that those individuals charged with operating the system had ' mismanaged ' it and betrayed it with ' poor execution , ' made all the more tragic in light of their ' idealism ' and ' right motives . '
Bad ideas based on lies and deceit cannot be improved upon by democratic means , and fortunately good ideas ' ideas grounded in truth and reality ' can not simply be voted out of existence .
Tragically , we can expect much more poverty and warfare before enough people wake up to the fact but statism is a bad idea based on fairy tales that inevitably leads to massively destructive consequences no matter who is charged with executing its central planning .
It will finally be relegated to the dustbin of history only if one day people stop consenting to authority - based systems and voluntarily adopt complete and total self - responsibility instead .
That day can't come soon enough .

" As the reputed architect of the war in Iraq , Cheney is viewed as toxic and as the administrations leading proponent of an attack on Iran , he is seen as dangerous .
As long as he remains , according to this thinking , he has the potential to drag down every member of the party in next year 's elections . "
Recalling the time senior Republicans went to the White House to tell Nixon he had to go , she says another group of party elders could do the same now that there is an acceptable replacement for Cheney .
Are you ready ?
Fred Thompson or as she puts it : " everybody loves Fred " and he's a man who could beat the Democrats in 08 .
Not only that , Thompson would give the Republicans a platform for running for the presidency - and the president a way out of Iraq withouth looking like he 's backing down . "
Bottom line : Cheney is scheduled for surgery this summer .
Seems his pacemaker needs new batteries .
" So if the president is willing and Republicans are able , Sally says " they have a convenient reason to replace him : Doctors orders " .
Sounds like somebody other than husband , former Post Editor Ben Bradlee , has been whispering in Sally 's ear .
We all want the evil Cheney gone but this sounds too neat , too easy .
On the other hand , the GOP has proven over and over again they will do whatever it takes to win or steal an election .
So what do you think , Kossacks .
Will Cheney by taken out by his own ?
I can't imagine him releasing the reins of power .
Can you ?
When conservative commentator Ann Coulter called former Vice President Al Gore a " total fag " on national television nearly a year ago , it barely caused a stir .
Coulter 's recent labeling of presidential candidate John Edwards as a " faggot , " however , has triggered a huge response , including a campaign initiated today by a gay rights group and media watchdog to persuade mainstream media outlets to dump her for good .
At least four newspapers have dropped Coulter 's syndicated column , and 40,000 people signed an online petition to Universal Press Syndicate , which distributes her column , demanding that it release her .
Three corporations , including Verizon , stopped advertising on Coulter 's Web site after she made the comment .
This follows recent controversies over the use of the new " f- word " -- as some call it -- by actor Isaiah Washington and an antigay rant by NBA player Tim Hardaway .
Washington apologized and announced he would go to " rehab , " and Hardaway lost endorsements and was penalized by the league .
Coulter wondered on the " Hannity & Colmes " show on the Fox News Channel on Monday about the difference between the reactions this year and last .
Dan Savage , editor of the Stranger , a Seattle alternative news weekly , and author of several books on his life as a gay man , said the reaction to Coulter could indicate a change in how people view gays .
" I always thought we would be reaching a tipping point with anti-gay hate where it will no longer be acceptable , and maybe we are reaching that tipping point now , " said Savage .
Neil Giuliano , the president of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation , the rights group starting a campaign to get Coulter 's voice out of mainstream media , said public opinion about anti-gay slurs is changing because gay and lesbian people are more visible than ever .
" As this happens , those in the overall culture who do n't like that are going to raise their voices and become even louder , and that 's why I think a lot of this is going on , " Giuliano said .
Ronald Butters , a Duke University professor who studies the changing meaning of taboo words in American English , said he does n't think " faggot " has become more or less offensive .
" Words mean what the public takes them to mean , " he said .
" The very reason that there is a furor is a pretty good indication of how insulting that term was . "
Leaders in the gay community said the Coulter fallout could become the prototype for how the public will respond to the use of the term " faggot . "
" People are actually realizing this word hurts and defames an entire group of people , and having people other than ourselves standing with us is very significant , " said Giuliano , whose organization is known as GLAAD .
GLAAD is issuing a " call to action " today to its 40,000 constituents , asking them to contact the heads of cable news organizations and NBC and " call on them publicly to state that they will no longer feature Ann Coulter as an on - air commentator . "
The Human Rights Campaign , another gay and lesbian civil rights organization , started a campaign earlier this week to pressure the Universal Press Syndicate and newspapers that publish Coulter 's words to drop her .
So far , people have sent about 40,000 e-mails through the organization 's Web site .
" It just seems to me the conventional wisdom around Ann Coulter till now has been that the most important thing for anyone to do is ignore her , but I think we have a more serious problem here that we are addressing , " said Joe Solmonese , president of the Human Rights Campaign .
" This word ought to be seen as offensive and dangerous as any hate - based word . "
Conservative gay scholar Andrew Sullivan , who heard Coulter 's comments live , said she uttered it with " malice aforethought . "
But equating it to other slurs is a difficult comparison , Sullivan said .
" Nothing has the power of the n-word , " he said .
Coulter made the offending utterance last Friday at a major gathering of conservatives , where she shared the stage with several Republican candidates for president .
During her speech , a series of jokes about Democrats , Coulter said , " I was going to have a few comments on the other Democratic presidential candidate , John Edwards , but it turns out that you have to go into rehab if you use the word ' faggot . '
So ... I can't really talk about Edwards . "
Coulter has defended her use of the term as a " schoolyard taunt . "
" The word I used has nothing to do with sexual preference ... and unless you 're going to announce here on national TV that John Edwards , married father of many children , is gay , it clearly had nothing to do with that , " Coulter said in an interview this week on " Hannity & Colmes . "
The explanation has not satisfied her critics , including three Republican presidential candidates , Rudolph Giuliani of New York , John McCain of Arizona and Mitt Romney of Massachusetts .
Edwards and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean also criticized Coulter .
And the Shreveport ( La . )
Times on Thursday became at least the fourth newspaper to drop her column out of 35 publications that carried it .
" Today , we move past the rhetoric and unproductive dialogue offered by Ann Coulter , " the newspaper 's executive editor , Alan English , wrote in an announcement on the newspaper 's Web site .
Butters , the Duke professor , called Coulter 's explanation of her use of the word " simply ridiculous and untrue . "
" It is always intended , I think , as a derogatory term of one of the most pernicious sorts , " he said .
Thom Lynch , who leads San Francisco 's Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Community Center , said he does not hear the word used often among gay men .
" It 's not a word people have reclaimed in any sense .
If straight people use it in the same way Ann Coulter did , people will get really angry about it , " he said .
Still , some gay people are skeptical of the condemnation of Coulter .
" I do n't have a problem with people using the word ' faggot . '
I use the word ' faggot ' all the time , " said Seattle 's Savage .
He started a public humiliation campaign against former Pennsylvania Sen .
Rick Santorum , a Republican , after Santorum made derogatory statements about gay men .
But he does not think there should be a campaign to silence Coulter .
" When we start acting like the thought police , it plays into the right - wing paranoia that we are going to force them all to say only nice things about us in public , " Savage said .
" I think we would gain ground faster in the gay and lesbian civil rights movement if we drop the Sally Field act of , ' You like me !
You really like me ! ' "
According to a new brain study , even people who seemed resilient but were close to the World Trade Center when the twin towers toppled on Sept. 11 , 2001 , have brains that are more reactive to emotional stimuli than those who were more than 200 miles away .
That is the finding of a new Cornell study that excluded people who did not have such mental disorders as post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) or major depression .
One of the first studies to look at the effects of trauma on the brains of healthy people , it is published in the May issue of the journal Emotion .
" These people appear to be doing okay , but they may , indeed , be having more sensitive responses to upsetting stimuli , " said Elise Temple , a co-author and assistant professor of human development at Cornell .
More than half the population experiences trauma , which makes people more likely to develop PTSD , depression , anxiety and physical illness later in life , according to other studies .
Also , trauma has been found to make the brain 's emotional processing centers -- particularly the amygdalae , the parts of the brain that judge emotional intensity and make emotional memories -- more sensitive in cases of PTSD .
The findings suggest that events that trigger shock , fear and horror that are within a normal range -- may cause similar changes in the brain that traumas do .
Victims may experience lingering symptoms ( bad dreams , jumpiness , thinking about the incident and avoiding the site of the trauma ) , but they are not severe .
However , the kinds of changes that these traumas cause in the brain , the researchers suspect , create vulnerability to developing future mental disorders .
Specifically , the Cornell researchers found that three years after Sept. 11 , 2001 , the amygdalae were most sensitive in those who were close to the World Trade Center .
These individuals tended to still experience lingering symptoms that were not severe enough to be diagnosed as a mental disorder .
Those with lingering symptoms showed significantly more sensitive emotional reactions in the brain when stimulated by photographs of fearful faces .
" Our study suggests that there may be long - term neural correlates of trauma exposure , even in people who have looked resilient , " said lead author Barbara Ganzel , Cornell M.S. ' 99 , Ph.D. ' 02 , a postdoctoral researcher in human development at Cornell .
" Up until now , there has been very little evidence of that . "
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging to see how people 's brains responded to photographs of fearful versus calm faces , the scans of 11 people who were within 1.5 miles of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 , 2001 , were compared with those who were living more than 200 miles away at the time ; none of the subjects had psychiatric disorders .
" We know that looking at fearful faces in normal adults tends to activate the amygdalae relative to looking at neutral faces , " said Ganzel .
" So we were looking to see if people who have had a very bad experience would have more response to this relatively mild everyday stimulus . "
Indeed , the amygdalae of those who were close to the twin towers were significantly more activated than that of others , even when other factors were controlled for in the analysis .
" People who had experienced traumas that left them with more lingering symptoms were the ones who had higher activity in their fear centers , " said Temple .
" We think that the World Trade Center experience was traumatic enough that it left them with hyperactive amygdalae . "
Other co-authors include B.J. Casey , director of the Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology at the Weill Cornell Medical College ; Henning Voss , a physicist at the CitiGroup Biomedical Imaging Center in New York City , where the fMRI scanning took place ; and Gary Glover of Stanford University , who developed the fMRI techniques used .
BARAGA , Mich . 
" Where did the water go ? " asks Ted Shalifor , manager of a marina and campground on Lake Superior 's Chippewa Indian Reservation .
The water on Lake Superior is so low that he could n't put his docks in the water this year .
Where he used to see water , he now sees sandbars .
Lake Superior , the world 's largest freshwater lake , has dropped to its lowest level in 81 years .
The water is 20 inches below average and a foot lower than just a year ago .
The dropping levels have had serious environmental and economic consequences .
Wetlands have dried up .
Power plants run at half capacity .
Cargo ships carry partial loads .
Boaters struggle to find a place to dock .
The changes can be seen all along the 2,800 - mile shore of Lake Superior , the coldest and deepest of the Great Lakes .
The water has receded , sometimes 50 feet or more , from its normal shoreline .
Lake Huron and Lake Michigan are at low levels , as well , although not quite as extreme .
Researchers at the University of Minnesota and elsewhere study whether Lake Superior 's low water levels are a result of global warming .
The average water temperature of Lake Superior has risen 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1979 .
A drought and warm weather are the immediate cause of the drop in water levels .
In the past year , precipitation was 6 inches less than the average of 31 inches .
The lake 's southern shore had a green Christmas in 2006 .
The ice and snow pack that usually cover the lake arrived late , allowing water to evaporate .
" It 's been a long time since we 've been this low , but it has happened , " says Tim Calappi , a hydraulic engineer for the Army Corps of Engineers , which tracks water levels .
" We still think this is within the range of what 's normal , but we have to wait and see . "
Superior is n't the only prominent North American lake or reservoir at a severely low level .
Lake Mead near Las Vegas and Lake Powell on the Utah - Arizona border are about half full .
Florida 's Lake Okeechobee recently set a record low .
Many people living near Lake Superior do n't buy drought or warm weather as the reasons for dropping water levels — a conspiracy theory is more popular .
They say Lake Superior was drained through the St. Mary 's River to raise the levels of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan .
" It 's like the tide went out and did n't come back , " says Dan Alexander , a commercial fisherman in Baraga .
" We know what it is .
They drained the lake . "
The water is so low he had to find a new place to dock his 38 - foot boat .
Calappi says it 's a myth that the Army Corps drains Lake Superior to help other lakes with presumably more powerful benefactors .
He says the amount of water that flows out of Lake Superior is established by an international agreement with Canada .
The water flow is regulated by how much water is permitted to pass through hydroelectric plants on the St. Mary 's River , which connects Lake Superior and Lake Huron and , indirectly , Lake Michigan .
The Edison Sault Electric power plant in Sault Ste. Marie , Mich. , will operate at less than 50 % capacity this year because its water flows have been slashed as a result of the low lake levels , the company said .
That pushed the company to buy high - cost power elsewhere and increase rates .
Other problems :
• Cargo ships run partly empty , especially those that carry heavy materials such as coal and iron ore .
On a recent trip , the 1,004 - foot freighter James R. Barker had to leave 7,000 tons of coal behind , so the boat would draft 26 feet under water , instead of 29 feet .
" We need more rain , and we need more dredging , " says Robert Dorn , senior vice president of Interlake Steamship Co. , which owns the ship .
Adolph Ojard , executive director of the Duluth ( Minn . )
Seaway Port Authority , says cargo ships have lightened loads about 5 % .
For ships averaging $ 6 a cargo ton and making 40 trips a year , that amounts to about $ 1 million in lost revenue per ship , he says .
• Large beds of wild rice that grow in wetlands have gone dry .
Wild rice beds in the Kakagon Slough of Bad River in Wisconsin have been hit particularly hard .
• Recreational boaters find fewer berths everywhere along Lake Superior .
Smaller boats compete for fewer spaces .
Owners of big boats not suitable for shallow water are sometimes forced to move on or spend the night in deeper waters .
In Marquette , Mich. , the water is so low , the city had to build two - step stairs for people to walk down to their boats .
The landings are supposed to be level with the boats .
" It 's a mess .
There 's not much to tell people with deep - keeled sailboats other than , ' There 's no place for you anywhere , ' " says Hugh Leslie , parks and recreation director in Marquette ( pop. 20,714 ) , the largest Michigan town on the lake .
' We 're not really beach people '
In Marquette , boulders line the shore to prevent waves from washing out Lakeshore Boulevard .
Today , the lake is more than 50 feet from the road .
The receding water has created wide swaths of scenic beach , but even this has created problems .
Changing currents at South Beach in Marquette carved a 4 - foot crevice in the popular family beach .
" It cut the beach in half and exposed drainage pipes , " Leslie says .
Elsewhere along Lake Superior , the beaches are wider than usual but they are n't expected to attract larger crowds .
Because of the cold , " here in Duluth , we 're not really beach people , " says Ann Norris of the city 's Parks and Recreation Department .
Scott Brossart , engineer for the Army Corps in Duluth , says some dredging will be done to make the commercial channels in Lake Superior ports a little deeper .
In Washington , Congress is considering more money for dredging .
But the corps does n't work in recreational harbors .
" We 're getting requests to dredge from everywhere this year , but I have to tell them we do n't do that , " Brossart says .
Away from shore , Lake Superior is doing fine .
A 19 - inch drop does n't make a big difference in a lake that is 1,330 feet at its deepest .
The fishing has never been better .
Alexander says he 's catching huge amounts of trout and whitefish .
For now , he 's waiting , like everyone else , for the water to rise .
" It seemed normal last October , " Shalifor says .
" Then it dropped and never came back . "

As we 've mentioned before , Sony - BMG has been using copy - protection technology called XCP in its recent CDs .
You insert your CD into your Windows PC , click " agree " in the pop up window , and the CD automatically installs software that uses rootkit techniques to cloak itself from you .
Sony - BMG has released a " patch " that supposedly " uncloaks " the XCP software , but it creates new problems .
But how do you know whether you 've been infected ?
It turns out Sony - BMG has deployed XCP on a number of titles , in variety of musical genres , on several of its wholly - owned labels .
EFF has confirmed the presence of XCP on the following titles ( each has a data session , easily read on a Macintosh , that includes a file called " VERSION.DAT " that announces what version of XCP it is using ) .
If you have one of these CDs , and you have a Windows PC ( Macs are totally immune , as usual ) , you may have caught the XCP bug .

Several other Sony - BMG
CDs are protected with a different copy - protection technology , sourced from SunnComm , including :
My Morning Jacket , Z
Santana , All That I Am
Sarah McLachlan , Bloom Remix Album
This is not a complete list .
So how do you recognize other XCP - laden CDs in the wild ?
Tip - off # 1 : on the front of the CD , at the left - most edge , in the transparent " spine " , you 'll see " CONTENT PROTECTED " along with the IFPI copy - protection logo .
A few photos make this clearer .
Tip - off # 2 : on the back of the CD , on the bottom or right side , there will be a " Compatible with " disclosure box .
Along with compatibility information , the box also includes a URL where you can get help .
The URL has a telltale admission buried in it : cp.sonybmg.com/xcp .
That lets you know that XCP is on this disc ( discs protected with SunnComm have a different URL that includes " sunncomm " ) .
If you have n't been infected yet , to protect yourself from XCP in the future , disable " autorun " on your Windows PC .
Once you have done so , however , these CDs may not be accessible under Windows unless you have specialized ripping software installed ; these CDs are encoded in a way that intentionally confuses standard Windows CD drivers .
For a smarter audio grabber for Windows , you may want to consider using Exact Audio Copy , which reportedly can read these CDs if you have turned off autorun and avoided infection by XCP .
Every few years , Jakob Nielsen takes websites to task with a Top Ten Web Design Mistakes article .
Although things have clearly improved since the original 1996 list , I 'm particularly concerned that in the competitive frenzy to get all JavaScripted up for Web 2.0 , we may be defeating the very simplicity that made the web so popular .
Nielsen shares this concern :
This year 's list of top problems clearly proves the need to get back to Web design basics .
There 's much talk about new fancy " Web 2.0 " features on the Internet industry 's mailing lists and websites , as well as at conferences .
But users do n't care about technology and do n't especially want new features .
They just want quality improvements in the basics : text they can read ;
content that answers their questions ;
navigation and search that help them find what they want ;
short and simple forms ( streamlined registration , checkout , and other workflow ) ; and
no bugs , typos , or corrupted data ; no linkrot ; no outdated content .
Anytime you feel tempted to add a new feature or advanced technology to your site , first consider whether you would get a higher ROI by spending the resources on polishing the quality of what you already have .
Most companies , e-commerce sites , government agencies , and non-profit organizations would contribute more to their website 's business goals with better headlines than with any new technology ( aside from a better search engine , of course ) .
Of course , Web 2.0 is n't just JavaScript .
But according to Paul Graham , JavaScript is one of the three key characteristics that define Web 2.0 :
One ingredient of its meaning is certainly Ajax , which I can still only just bear to use without scare quotes .
Basically , what " Ajax " means is " Javascript now works . "
And that in turn means that web - based applications can now be made to work much more like desktop ones .
In fact the new generation of software is being written way too fast for Microsoft even to channel it , let alone write their own in house .
Their only hope now is to buy all the best Ajax startups before Google does .
And even that 's going to be hard , because Google has as big a head start in buying microstartups as it did in search a few years ago .
After all , Google Maps , the canonical Ajax application , was the result of a startup they bought .
I 've visited quite a few Ajax sites that committed the cardinal sin of the web : they broke the back button .
Nothing demonstrates an utter disregard for the user quite like breaking the back button does .
Going " back " is the second most common user activity after clicking a hyperlink .
Did n't we learn our lesson with < frame > ?
Frame based layouts are so widely reviled for their address bar and back button breaking ways that they have been banished to freak - in - a - sideshow status .
And yet when an Ajax app breaks the back button , it 's no big deal , it 's an acceptable side - effect of all that cool client - side processing ?
Well , it is a big deal , and it is n't acceptable .
I hate to single out everyone 's favorite whipping boy , but it 's the most recent example :
Visit http://www.live.com
Click the Add Content link Search for anything ; I used " news " Now click the back button
I do n't care how many fancy client - side features your site has -- if you break the back button , you broke the internet for your users .
I can't emphasize this enough .
A big part of the web 's ease of use is basic visibility -- if you can see it , you can click it .
Nothing hidden .
Nothing up our sleeves .
But the minute you throw a drop - down menu on your page , you 've broken that contract with the user .
That 's why drop - down menus do n't belong on the web .
And yet we can't seem to get away from the damn things .
Amazon , of all places , has an incredibly annoying DHTML menu on their home page .
Just mouse over the " See All 32 Product Categories " tab .
Is it really necessary for this tab to spawn an aggravating DHTML javascript popup , complete with its own click - interrupting animation ?
It 's disconcerting to accidentally mouse over this area and have a popup blasted in your face .
Why not just let me click the link and see the categories , like every other web page I 've ever visited ?
Worse , many sites ' implementations of drop - down menus are erratic and inferior to the menus in the operating system .
Consider the 3leaf site : why can't I click on the Services menu , while all the others are clickable ?
Why does n't the pointer change to indicate that I 'm clicking on a hyperlink ?
The future of drop - down menus is uncertain even in Windows ; shoehorning a marginal GUI convention on today 's web is asking for trouble .
Better to avoid these problems altogether by ditching drop - down menus entirely .
Shaun Inman 's site , which was inexplicably nominated for a best - designed bloggie award , is truly painful to visit .
It reads like a laundry list of Nielsen 's complaints :
The font is tiny by default , on both IE and Firefox
Visited links are shown in unreadable strikeout font
Crazy , confusing top and bottom navigation slide - out panels
Shaun Inman seems to be a well - regarded web designer -- should n't he know better ?
Or is it the Web 2.0 kool - aid ?
If that 's what it takes to get a bloggie design award , I 'm sure hoping this guy starts a blog , because he 's a shoo - in for 2006 .
I do n't want to turn this into a rant session , so I 'll stop here .
Clever JavaScript on your web page does not exempt you from good web design .
Instead of spending all this time exerting maximum cleverness to transcend the weakesses of the web medium ,
It might be a better idea to play to the web 's strengths -- such as speeding up how fast your pages load , or avoiding recent ill - advised design trends .
And whatever you do , do n't break the freaking back button .
And what should , and will , the US and the rest of the world do ?
After cleaning up a messy coffee stain and vainly trying to log onto TOD , what to do ?
Tomorrow morning , as you are starting your first cup of coffee , you turn on the morning news to “ In a surprise announcement last night , King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia announced that Saudi Arabia would not be able to increase oil production .
He urged conservation by oil importing nations .
Reaction has been … ”
Every responsible government will immediately raise gasoline taxes ( this excludes the United States of America ) .
Switzerland will investigate how their 31 billion Swiss franc Alp Transit and related railroad improvements might be speeded up , completing the shift of freight from truck to ( hydro ) .
electric rail .
Completion by 2020 does not seem quite so comfortable as it did yesterday .
German standards for insulation in new construction are adopted and the push for more geothermal heat is intensified .
Debate about a new nuclear plant starts anew .
Basically , Switzerland just speeds up along the path that they were already on .
Thailand will add wind turbines in the south to their Laotian hydroelectric projects and create a 95 + % renewable electrical grid .
They will pay the contractors building their extensive elevated Urban Rail system in Bangkok bonuses for completion ahead of schedule , the plans for more Urban Rail lines on the drawing board will be started ahead of schedule and streetcars will be built in smaller Thai cities and towns .
Aid to small farmers to install manure fed bio - gas reactors for cooking gas and to fuel small tractors will be quadrupled and the national rail network will be improved and electrified with plans for expansion .
Electrical assist bicycles and tricycles will be promoted as alternatives to motorcycles .
Basically , Thailand just speeds up along the path that they were already on .
And what of the USA ?
I would suggest the following measures , divided into when the conservation effects will first become significant ( most will grow in significance over time ) and not when they are first implemented .
I would advocate only measures that improve Global Warming or at least , make it no worse .
I also see a North American natural gas crisis shortly after Peak Oil , so massive shifting from oil to natural gas is a poor strategy .
However , there will be increased use of Natural Gas and Propane / Butane for transportation and this will require reduced natural gas use for generating electricity , and less NG as well as Propane / Butane for water heating and space heating in order to make available light hydrocarbons for transportation .
Immediate Savings –
National 50 mph speed limit for the next decade ( likely to be renewed unless things turn out “ better than expected ” ) .
Increase fuel tax on airlines for improved Air Traffic Control ( higher taxes > less used )
Reduce mass transit fares via federal subsidy , especially off - peak ( a dime ? )
Put a 50 % federal tax on all tolls , increasing tolls and commuting costs .
Reduce sports events parking and set up remote Park & Ride lots ( some in near by cities ) .
A federal tax of 30 % on private paid parking lots .
( Higher parking fees increase car pooling and transit use ) .
Media campaign to promote walking , bicycling , taking transit and car pooling .
Also promote 4 day work week ( 4 x 10 hours instead of 5 x 8 hours or even alternating 4 and 5 day weeks , 9 hours / day ) .
Short Term Savings ( 1 to 4 years in the future )
Enact a federal gasoline tax that increases at 3 cents / month for 25 years .
The funds will be used to steadily reduce payroll taxes and Medicare premiums , depending upon the prior year gas tax receipts .
Minimal initial pain due to taxes , but this will motivate people to start making long term structural changes .
Stop all new highway construction projects except HOV lanes
Enlarge bicycle parking and bike lanes , taking street traffic lanes in some cases .
Increase CAFÉ by 50 % immediately coupled with Gas Guzzler taxes on any new vehicle under 27.5 mpg ( modest tax at 27 mpg , prohibitive at 18 mpg ) .
Further increases in CAFÉ 4 years later .
Have the US Gov’t assist the merger of GM & Ford , as it once assisted Chrysler .
Add a federal “ Gas Guzzler ” tax to license tag renewals to speed scraping of oversized SUVs .
Etc .
Revoke authorization for all Bus Rapid Transit projects not actively under construction .
Either rework as streetcar or electric trolley buses or postpone for a decade .
Build more vehicles for existing Urban Rail lines on a crisis “ 3 or 4 shift ” basis .
Many more rail cars for Amtrak as well but on a slightly less urgent and more economic basis .
Increase incentives for ground source ( ' geo - thermal ' ) heat pumps to replace oil and natural gas heat .
( Air source along the Gulf Coast ) .
Encourage localities to require for new construction .
Low cost federal funding for a fraction of the cost is one option .
Increase incentives for solar water heating and require it in some cases for new construction ( such as rental units ) .
Low cost federal funding for a fraction of the cost is one option .
Continue incentives for tankless gas and propane water heaters .
Require rental units to replace hot water heaters with tankless , solar or heat pump hot water heaters .
Require minimum energy efficiency on new rental unit construction .
A federal tax of $ 200 / space / year for commercial parking lots , increasing to an inflation adjusted $ 1,000 / space / year .
This will speed changes in our urban form to a more energy efficient form and provide funds for tax cuts and spending initiatives elsewhere .
Extend the wind and other renewable tax credits several years into the future with a slow phase out instead of the current abrupt cut - off ( the risk of abrupt cut - off inhibits building new wind turbine factories ) .
The subsidy during the Phase out period can be increased later as events warrant .
An 80 cent tax on each incandescent bulb .
Intermediate Savings ( 5 to 12 years in the future )
Start construction ASAP ( within 1 to 3 years ) of “ on - the - shelf ” Urban Rail plans listed in appendix .
Any freight railroad that electrifies will be exempt from property taxes .
This will also encourage additional infrastructure .( more tracks , better signals , more grade separation ) since the railroads will not have to pay property taxes on improvements .
Perhaps tax credits or low interest loans ( via federal guarantees ) for electrification and capacity increases .
Amtrak can allocate $ 2 billion / year to freight railroads that will increase capacity via tracks and signals that will , in turn , speed Amtrak trains .
Require that rental units meet certain energy efficiency standards before being sold ( an idea borrowed from Germany ) .
This may lead to a faster change in our urban form .
Work with Hawaii , Puerto Rico , Alaskan villages and small islands to reduce oil used for electrical generation .
Improved Air Traffic Control reduces aviation fuel use by 3 % or so .
Long Term Savings ( 13 to 50 years in the future )
Stop all new highway construction , including HOV lanes and remove selected urban highways .
Build a network of semi-High Speed Rail lines that service both passengers ( at say 125 mph top speed , 110 mph average speed ) and express freight at 100 mph on electrified rail lines .
Encourage , via property tax exemptions , tax credits and low interest loans the development of long distance HV DC transmission lines and pumped storage as long as these projects are linked to renewable generation ( mainly new wind turbines ) .
Explore bio-sources to replace selected petrochemical feedstocks .
Install electric trolley buses on heavy bus routes that are not appropriate for streetcars or light rail .
Add a “ risk premium ” to federally funded or guaranteed mortgages that are more than 1 mile from a stop or station for electrified transportation ( rail or bus ) .
The above is a diverse set of government led actions , the free market will respond in a variety of ways to both higher oil prices and government actions .
Are any of these bad ideas with negative unintended consequences ?
What other actions can be made at a government policy level ?
And should you skip breakfast and go immediately to the nearest gas station and fill up the car ?

The Bush Administration continues to maintain that its war in Iraq , and its adventures anywhere else , are aimed at ending worldwide terrorism .
But such a feat is not only impossible , it is absurd .
Terrorism is a crime , not a war .
Terrorism is committed by gangs of criminals u2014 not soldiers representing a sovereign government .
And no one in his right mind can believe that our government can eliminate every criminal gang in the world .
If our government could do that , why would n't it start with the drug gangs that terrorize areas of Washington , D.C. ?
What a perfect opportunity for the politicians to demonstrate their crime - fighting abilities .
On October 4 , 2001 , I wrote :
Because the September attacks were a crime , the government ’s job is to locate and bring to trial any perpetrators who did n’t die in the attacks .
If some of them are located in foreign countries , our government should request extradition u2014 not threaten to bomb the foreign country if we do n’t get our way .
I was criticized by some people , who asked , " But what if all the u2018 criminals ' are n't caught "
And yet , here we are four years later , tens of thousands of people have died , and still not all the criminals have been caught regardless .
Osama Bin Laden not only has n't been apprehended , he is n't even talked about anymore .
As I said in 2001 :
If not all the criminals are found and brought to trial , it does n’t mean that bombing innocent people would have brought the criminals to justice .
So why do the politicians talk about a War on Terrorism that makes no sense ?
Because it opens the door to all sorts of aggressions against foreigners and Americans .
And it allows the politicians u2014 most notably the leading members of the Bush administration u2014 to pose as noble warriors against enemies that are really only Strawmen .
Charley Reese , in a recent LewRockwell.com article , quoted Dick Cheney as claiming a U.S. pullout from Iraq would leave it in the hands of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , Osama Bin Laden , and / or Ayman al - Zawahiri .
Charley points out that " Zarqawi is a Jordanian , not an Iraqi ; he has been denounced by his tribe and his family ; and he has killed more Iraqis than Americans .
It is just a matter of time before some Iraqi drops a dime on him and he 's packed off to Islamic hell . "
But he 's a worthy Strawman , a bogey man , whose name is worth a hundred million dollars or more in Congressional appropriations .
Charley goes on , " As for bin Laden and his Egyptian adviser , they are u2014 assuming they 're still alive u2014 hiding out in some cave or rat- infested village in the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan .
They could not control a small town , much less a country of 25 million people of which neither of them is a native . "
As we all know , the U.S. government has since World War II been financing and arming various foreign dictators u2014 such as Saddam Hussein , Manuel Noriega , the Shah of Iran , and others u2014 only to denounce and attack them once they become wealthy and aggressive enough to be worthy Strawmen .
It 's also true that the U.S. government has financed and armed various opposition groups that supposedly represent the opportunity to topple the mean old dictators .
Often these groups oppose each other , and engage in violence against one another .
But no matter , the object of our government is to be doing something to fight a Strawman .
Robert Dreyfuss , in another excellent LewRockwell.com article , catalogs a number of the groups that opposed Saddam Hussein and are now battling for control of Iraq .
There is far more than the Iraqi National Congress .
The strongest groups are SCIRI ( the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution ) , Al Dawa ( The Islamic Call ) , SCIRI 's paramilitary arm , the Badr Brigade , the Muslim Brotherhood , represented by IIP ( the Iraqi Islamic Party ) u2014 not to mention Al - Qaeda .
The first three originated and are based in u2014 guess where u2014 Iran .
In fact , SCIRI was founded in 1982 by Ayatollah Khomeini .
Today these groups are fighting each other as much as they 're fighting Iraqi insurgents , Americans , or Iraqi civilians .
They regularly practice torture , assassinations , and other dastardly deeds upon one another .
They are fighting to become the rulers of the new Iraq u2014 the " democracy " that George Bush claims to be creating .
Is this what 2,000 Americans and tens of thousands of Iraqis have died for ?
Is this what $ 200 billion dollars has financed ?
Is this why we have given up so much of our freedom ?
And whoever wins the battle to rule Iraq will eventually become Strawmen against whom the Bush administration can get on its horses and ride off to protect us .
There is no War on Terrorism .
There is only a War on Strawmen , a War on Shadows , a War on Fantasies u2014 allowing George Bush to do whatever he , or his advisors , choose to do .
It is time to quit pretending that the War in Iraq serves any purpose relating to world peace , democracy in the Middle East , the first line against terrorism , or any other salutary goal .
It is simply part of the War on Strawmen .

The Best of Harry Browne
One of the most endearing and memorable of Sesame Street ‘s Muppet characters has experienced a bit of an epiphany regarding his eating habits in recent years as the lovable , blue - furred Cookie Monster has been mastering the fine art of moderation with regard to his favorite food .
Yet he has not given up cookies entirely , nor are there plans for him to do so — whatever the rumors to the contrary , he is and always will be the Cookie Monster .
Examples :
This actually came up in Physics class — somehow something was said to prompt another kid to remark that Sesame Street ’s popular Cookie Monster was renamed to the “ Veggie Monster ” to be more politically correct and to cut down on obesity in America .
Another co-worker put up a petition to save Cookie Monster from being kicked off Sesame Street for being fat .
I had heard that they were just changing his diet to include healthy foods and not just cookies but she is insisting that they are removing him from the show .
In 2005 Sesame Street began to focus more strongly on delivering positive health messages to children , a process that involved introducing segments on the values of good nutrition , exercise , and proper sleep habits into the program .
It also involved expanding Cookie Monster ’s diet to encompass other foods beyond just his beloved cookies .
His newfound nutritional awareness was expressed in his new anthem , “ A Cookie Is a Sometime Food ” ( which was modeled upon the Porgy and Bess song , “ A Woman is a Sometime Thing ” ) .
Cookie Monster still eats cookies , just not nearly as many of them as he once did , and he is now also seen eating and enjoying fruit .
As to the reasons behind the shift towards a more healthy lifestyle for this rascally Muppet , Cookie Monster is , after all , the idol of many a wide - eyed tot , so Sesame Street ‘s producers hope that altering his diet will incline his young audience to take a healthier path themselves .
Says Sesame Street producer Carol - Lynn Parente : “ Childhood obesity is an epidemic .
We feel we have a responsibility to do what we can to address it . ”
That means fewer cookies for the venerable blue - furred spokescreature and more fruit .
Yet rumors that he has forsworn cookies entirely or has been transformed into the Veggie Monster ( or Carrot Monster ) are false .
In August 2006 , when NBC Today co-host Matt Lauer questioned Cookie Monster about the change in his eating habits , the googly - eyed spokescreature directly addressed the rumor and disclaimed it :
Cookie Monster : Me like fruit .
Matt Lauer :
And there you have it .
Cookie Monster likes fruit , and not cookies .
Monster : No !
You members of the media blow story way out of proportion !
Me still like cookies !
Lauer :
Then why fruit ?
Monster :
Why not fruit ?
It delicious !
And healthy .
Me still eat cookies , like me world - famous for doing , but now me eat other things , too .
In October 2006 , PBS Viewer Services supplied this response to e-mail from viewers concerned about the demise or renaming of Sesame Street ’s glutton :
Thank you for writing to PBS .
We always enjoy receiving feedback from our viewers and fans .
The educational goal of SESAME STREET is to help prepare children for school and to put them on a positive trajectory for life .
Childhood obesity is a serious health concern in this country and the producers of SESAME STREET decided to include this important subject in their curriculum .
While they have chosen to use the power of SESAME STREET to teach children about healthy foods and other important healthy habits , they have no plans to change Cookie Monster ’s name or his wonderful , compulsive personality which our viewers have grown to love .
Cookie Monster will continue to obsess over his adored favorite : the cookie , but he now also eats fruits and vegetables .
Thank you again for your email .
We appreciate your concern for SESAME STREET and hope you and your family continue to enjoy the wide variety of programs available on your local PBS station .
While rumors about Cookie Monster ’s being replaced with Veggie Monster or Carrot Monster also exist in the offline world , in cyberspace their flames were further fanned by the presence of an online petition proposing a boycott of Sesame Street until the show did away with Veggie Monster and returned Cookie Monster to the air .
The petition presented matters as if they had already come to pass , which was n’t the case : there was n’t any Veggie Monster to be sent packing , and Cookie Monster was still very much a part of the show ( and indeed would continue to be ) .
Yet raw emotion was not to be denied , so a few thousand people signed the petition anyway .
Cooler heads might have dismissed the rumor under the premise that it would not make sense for Sesame Street to replace a beloved and extremely marketable character .
Besides , the concept of a Veggie Monster who so lusted for his favorite foodstuffs that he would go on legume - pillaging rampages is seriously flawed : unlike cookies ( which are often vigorously defended ) , veggies do n’t need to be taken by force .

How stupid can you be ?
The limits are never quite passed , there is always more stupidity when it comes to Diebold and the e-voting companies in general .
However , you might want to know that nothing like that could ever happen in Riverside County , because we use Sequoia , and they are impenetrable ( or spelling to that effect ! ) .

Diebold may be a lot of things , but dumb ai n't one of 'em .
They 've had several years of experience using these machines in actual elections .
They know that the only way anyone can prove that the machines were rigged , is to audit them .
They also know that Congress , the courts , and State and local elections officials have set things up so that the Diebold candidate can be sworn in before any audit can take place , after which there is no way to remove them from office .
( See CA50 case info elsewhere on this site . )
Since there is no chance at all of them getting caught before the damage is done and it is too late to change the results , they have no reason at all not to make it as easy as possible for people to do the damage .
And in the unlikely event that they get taken to court for negligence , the possible penalties would be no more than an infinitesimal fraction of their profits , which is an acceptable business expense .
C'mon , people , you know the score .
Diebold elects the candidate , the candidate then makes the laws and appoints the judges to protect Diebold from liability , and Diebold continues to elect more candidates .
But it is n't just Diebold or proprietary vendors .
Open source software can also be hacked without leaving a trace ( google Chuck Herrin and check his " archives " page for details ) .
As long as we have machines counting our votes , our votes wo n't count .
The only way to ensure that we get the candidates we vote for , is to get rid of the machines and have hand - counted paper ballots at the precincts , with full citizen oversight including videotaping of the entire process .
It also happens to be the least expensive way to hold elections .
It is fun , as an academic exercise , to prove that there was election fraud in 2000 and 2004 , as so many people have done .
But last time I checked , Bush was still in office .
People say he 's dumb too .
Maybe .
But if his stock portfolio was on microfiche , I wonder if a professional weightlifter could benchpress it .

Anyone can pick a lock , just need some ( different size ) cut up steak knives and something to cause tension .
A simple search for " lockpicking " +" pdf " shows a whoping amazing amount of hits for anyone wanting to learn .
A key that is photographed is a simple matter to recreate !
Easier that pin tumbling ( where you " tumble the pins " and tension bar ( so you can turn the lock once all the pins are lined up / or down . )
Faster too !
The simple fact that these kind of tools are illegal to posess , deters nobody , e.g. they 're already going to commit a crime why should they care the tools are illegal ?
I 'd have to agree that EVM's ( Electronic Voting Machine Manufacture 's ) know exactly what they are doing .
They are genius !
They have taken over the will of the people .
Anyone catch the other article by John Gideon about An Illinois Representative doing a study for online voting by 2010 !!!
I wonder how many times that US representative 's SERVERS have been cracked !?
They 're probably still using HTML mail for god sake .
My current state of mind on this issue .
Just when you get done painting one side of your Truck , the CORPORATE US representatives are again throwing rocks at the other side again .
I feel like these corporate bastards are the equal to occupying the United States .
How much more of this are we going to put up with ?
Oh that 's right , people still do n't understand electronics has no place in our elections , because they are not aware of the problem , because the corporate media will not open their mouths .
What we all need is a giant grassroots wrench to put into these corporate interests gears .
Once and for all , end it for them .
Make metal shavings out of them .
I sure hope I hear something BIG come from Debra Bowen pretty soon .
I am tired of this war on our constitutional right to vote .
I HATE THE CORPORATE MEDIA !
HATE !!!

I used to be a locksmith --- software engineer now --- and I can tell you that security is security and that the my locksmithing past has been highly informative when it comes to writing secure code .
... and to see that key ...
O.M.G. ... and to hear they had a picture of it on the web ...
O.M.F.G...
These guys obviously do n't know crap about security .
A child can pick that type of lock with a couple paper clips .
You can buy this type of lock in bulk for under a dollar each --- they are n't a secure lock , they 're a convenience lock .
Any locksmith worth his salt can look at that picture , name the keyway , and punch out an exact duplicate with a key clipper .
This is corporate neglegence and these people should be prosecuted .
Neglegent in posting that picture , and even more neglegent in choosing to use that type of cheap lock on these devices .
To those that do n't understand software and software security , and all the experiments and tests and blackbox 's claims and etc. :
I would take this as physical evidence that Diebold either does n't understand or care about basic security on these devices .
If they cut corners ( or just plain screwed up ) on security for the device 's hardware itself , I would highly doubt they did a much better job securing the software running inside .

Well , yes ... assuming that the election workers actually treated the breached seals as a matter of security .
But then , as you well know by now , election workers across the nation have been told repeatedly in the past to ignore breached seals .

The reality is " yes they have gotten away with ignoring things like that " ... repeatedly .

cv I stand corrected .
And yeah I was gonna say paperclip and nailfile ; o )
But , this is a pattern with electronic voting machines .
The fact remains you can not validate the electronic signals inside the box 24/ 7 .
( You can't validate the actual chips inside the box either , they could be specially crafted in the doping process )
Therefore you can not validate the vote , and if you can't validate the vote , then you have denied people their constitutional right to vote .
A hammer is about the only thing I can think of to fix this problem .
But that is a felony .

Great work reporting , and always nice to see Diebold get a solid nut - kicking from us mere proles .
OTOH , nothing does more to harm your cause than the constant " oh my , are n't we the only people in the world who know and / or care about this " crowing .
Plenty of people know about Diebold 's disgraceful " security " , and their suspicious political dealings with the Republican party , and the fraud during the last two US presidential elections - it's all over the net , and finally the mainstream media is beginning to wake up and pay attention ( where doing so would n't unduly compromise their corporate interests , naturally ) .
However , nothing makes it easier for people new to the issue to dismiss your writing as the rabid frothings of a conspiracy nut like the constant " poor little me " or unnecessarily - smug comments like " subsequently ignored by all media except for The BRAD BLOG , natch " .
If you want to be taken seriously , tone down the unprofessional smugness and write like a professional - recognise the pioneering work being done by other online groups like Black Box Voting , and stop claiming al lthe credit for yourself .
People need to hear what you 're saying , but the way you say it ruins your chance of being taken seriously .

You guys have no idea what you are talking about !
That key is not to the TSX touchscreen voting unit at all .
That is an old key used in the Accu-vote OS ( Optical Scan ) machine .
The optical scan machines use paper ballots .
I work for an Election Commission in TN .
We have had optical scan machines since 1998 , way before touchscreen voting was even around I have an Accu-vote TSX key sitting right in front of me right now .
It looks nothing like it .
You can't just walk up to a touchscreen and open the memory card compartment mess with it .
The memory cards that contain the ballot information leave the election commission preprogrammed and have a security encryption key of 16 letters and numbers long .
Unless the security key programmed from the memory card matches the security key on the Touchscreen the touchscreen will not even read the memory card .
I know touchscreen units from top to bottom , it 's my job , it 's what I make a living doing .

Replying to Shadowslay : First , the folks at Princeton used the key on the Diebold AccuVote TS ( paperless , touch - screen ) machine .
Furthermore , I can independently confirm that the same key is used for every AccuVote TSx ( touch - screen w/ so - called " paper trail " ) as well .
Next , while I do n't know if the key also opens the AccuVote OS ( op - scan ) as you suggest , it would hardly surprise me .
Since you claim to be a pro with these things then , certainly you also know then that the AccuVote OS is as hackable ( if not more so ) than the TS series .
( The HBO documentary Hacking Democracy covered the hack of a Diebold OS system in Leon County , FL in Dec. 2005 which flipped the results of a mock election without leaving a trace behind ) .
As to the encryption that is or is n't used on the various systems , the encryption used on the TS is different from the TSx .
Furthermore , passwords to the systems are usually the default " 1111 " and finally , since you 're an insider and your note suggests you 're familiar with the 16 character encryption key you mention , what 's to stop you from rigging an entire election with that access to your county 's voting machines ?
Appreciate your comments , Nathaniel .

I disagree with comment # 38 .
I formerly worked for a local Board of Elections and worked quite closely with these exact machines .
Although I could never be 100 % sure , that photo certainly looks like the key I remember using .
Additionally , that article was correct ... there is one key for all machines nationwide .
Inside this compartment is a PCMCIA card which holds both the election data and the tabulated results .
So far as his comment of " Unless the security key programmed from the memory card matches the security key on the Touchscreen the touchscreen will not even read the memory card . "
I am unsure of that .
I am pretty sure in testing we swapped PCMCIA cards from one machine to another without issue .
Perhaps they have only one encryption key .
PCMCIA cards from Micro Center would not work , cards bearing the key would .
That is worth drilling down on .

You are assuming that Diebold actually implemented the encryption correctly , and history says " probably not " , and you 're assuming a hack would have to go through the encryption to get at the code ... and again Diebold 's history says " probably not " .
http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com has several articles on precisely that subject , and they illustrate that Diebold 's security claims for the encryption are pretty much irrelevant to preventing an actual hack .
" I know touchscreen units from top to bottom , it 's my job , it 's what I make a living doing .
You people need to do some research before you start spreading negative rumors around . "
We do .
Princeton did .
Have you ?
Aside from reading EVM vendor handouts , that is ?
" If you have any questions regarding security please email me at
nathanielfoster@boxbe.com
I will be more than happy to ease your security concerns . "
Yes .
" Easing security concerns " might be in your interest .
But if you 're an election worker then your job is ensuring ballot security .
Your job is not blindly defending Diebold while trying to PR spin another of their disasters at the expense of honesty with your voters .
After all , you can't rely on Diebold to do your job for you ... as they sure as hell have n't shown any intrest in ensuring ballot security .

Does anyone here even know of anyone who has , or heard of someone specific who has done this ? "
Google " Hursti Hack " and " Princeton Virus Video " " Did everyone here with a witty comment even vote in 2004 or for any other state / local elections ? "
Nah .
We are n't concernined with voting .
Why do you ask ?
" We should all stop trying to make up ridiculous stories and fairy tales . "
We are trying to put a stop to it , but for now the e-voting corporations insist on telling the same old ridiculous stories and fairy tales .
" Until someone can give me an exact person / place / time this happened , its all bullsh*t . "
Google " Hursti Hack " and " Princeton Virus Video "
And the " corporate media " everyone is referring to is overwhelmingly liberal .
For you to accuse the liberal media of not exposing scandal is irresponsible and make you hypocrites .

Time to play whack - a- mole with Valeriob ! :
We should all stop trying to make up ridiculous stories and fairy tales .
Until someone can give me an exact person / place / time this happened , its all bullsh*t .
Good plan !
Think of all the money we could save on bank vaults and homeland security and stuff if we just waited for the bank to be robbed before installing security .
The fact that Electronic Voting Machines have been shown , in no uncertain terms , to be hackable in dozens of ways which would likely never be discovered , is hardly either " ridiculous " or a " fairy tale " .
Unless you consider dozens of computer science and security experts from Princeton University to Johns Hopkins to UC Berkley to NYU 's Brennan Center of Justice , or reports from the GAO , NIST , NASED Baker / Carter National Election Reform Comm .
( okay , an imperfect example ) , or the actual live hacks performed by computer experts from Harri Hursti to Dr. Hugh Thompson to Dr. Michael Shamos , et al to be " ridiculous " .
Then you are truly living in the all - spin world of Bill O'Reilly .
And the " corporate media " everyone is referring to is overwhelmingly liberal .

" the " corporate media " everyone is referring to is overwhelmingly liberal . "
That 's a common misconception .
I believe that you are parroting comments .
The people you hear that from know how effective that lie is .
It is an easy deception of conflation .
Faces on TV are probably what some would call liberal but more actually are people who would vote Democrat ( if they vote and some do n't to maintain objectivity ) .
They are probably not " liberal " on say , gun control .
Anyway , any college graduate is more likely to vote Democrat so ANY profession is " liberal . " if you squeeze the numbers hard enough .
Whereas the owners and managers of those organizations are deeply tied to ( Sorry , I have no better way to put it ) the military / industrial complex .
The confusion comes here :
The MOST powerful corporations ( oil , pharmaceuticals , so on ) are not supportive of the majority of the Democrat 's platform .
Yet , as enlightened worldly types ( such as the Cheneys ) they are highly tolerant of being gay ( for example ) .
When you listen to Rush L. and such , they confuse liberalism ( government getting out of your face : pro-gun , pro-gay , pro-choice ) with the platforms of the two major U.S. parties .
The Dems are not liberal on many issues .
The Reps are liberal leaning on many issues .
Wealthy people ( anti-tax ) love the Republican party and USE the religious dupes ( a preselected gullible audience * ) to get their agenda 's through --- their own kids get abortions in other countries or live as gay couples in enlightened wealthy communities .

There are five main sources of corporate media .
Wikipedia lists ( ABC , CBS , NBC ) and ( I add FOX , AND PBS ) all of which do not serve the public interest !
I know this because I do a show on Public Access Public access television is one type of PEG access , short for Public , Educational , and Governmental , the three traditional structures of access within a municpality .
The fact remains , Corporate Media does not serve the public interest .
The big Telcos would like to see Public Access disappear .
But that 's a whole other can of worms that slowly attempting to rot PEG tv by not playing by the existing franchising rules .
They say it 's not fair to them , while I 'd say removing the Public 's First amendment right is unfair as well .
There 's other spins on this , but that 's my opinion .
As far as Liberal Media or Conservative media goes I think your trying to confuse issues about Media Bias .
Basically you are using a term that some psyop dingbat has used .
As far as cracking electronic voting machines , I say to you :
Prove these machines have not been cracked !
Anyone with the knowledge of the physics of electronics knows that this is an abusive technology that can not be validated because of the physics of electricity itself .
As far as witty comments go , a lot of concerned citizens and nice folks have been fighting this war on our constitutional right to vote for many years now .
I consider myself a voter rights advocate and I personally am at my wits end , literally one event away from totally snapping .
I do n't like oath breakers , and have had it with the destruction of our constitution .
You should be glad that there are other folks around that have a cooler head than myself .
I personally wo n't tolerate anything but the total removal of electronics from the election process .
e.g. From end to end .
I 've crpssed paths with you before , either here or on DU a couple years ago , I Know what your doing , " stirring the pot "
It 's a good tactic , but your not going to get far here .
Folks here are hip to these games .
And clearly if you were being honest ( which you were not ) with your questions you yourself are the hipocrit in that you say you have n't heard these issues before , yet it's the " liberal media " ( your words not mine ) that would expose them .
I 'll just straighten this out , forget liberal media , think CORPORATE MEDIA .
The CORPORATE MEDIA HAS NOT SHOWN THE PUBLIC THESE ISSUES OR IT WOULD BE TOP OF THE NEWS EVERY NIGHT .
Furthermore , not just these stupid ass keys , but the whole of all the sum of the parts of all these electronic voting machines , tabulators , networks , and digitized data is the cause of all our constitutional problems , including the war in Iraq and these unvalidatable , vulnerable systems , networks and devices are the greatest national security issue this country has ever seen in history .

This kind of corrupt nonsense seems to be running rampant throughout our government , not just in the voting process .

You could n't ... without a hacksaw
The old lever machines could be compromised 1 by 1 ... and this was known , the methods known , and everyone could watch out for those methods , and a compromised machine could be identified by inspection .
E-voting machines , being computers running Windows , can be hacked en masse by an exceptionally wide variety of means by just compromising one machine somewhere in the chain of custody ( whenever there even is a chain of custody given the haphazard security surrounding e-voting machines ) , the methods are not especially obvious except to those who deal with computers , and the evidence of tampering can be made to disappear tracelessly after the election is over .
BTW , calling all shills ...
Whatever happened to the shill line that ran " Diebold will be getting out of the elections business soon so please stop talking about these amazingly egregious security lapses ! "
It was nice dream ... but of course Diebold has no intention of ever letting go of the near - infinite money and power granted by owning an e-voting disenfranchise , right ?

The so - called music channel left music behind as a sole platform some time ago , instead relying on reality and lifestyle shows to draw in young audiences .
But it nonetheless remains in the business of zeitgeist .
In a sense , the change in the musical ecosystem reflects broader challenges .
Not that long ago , a band fought its way to a major label contract , benefited from commercial radio play and then , finally , a video on MTV .
But this system has been disrupted by entertainment ’s new iterations , and now most bands no longer ride a vertical axis to the top .
There are various workarounds to the popular music monolith — online file - sharing , viral marketing , niche sites and social networks help bands market their music from one person to another .
It is all well and good that OK Go , the band - as - music - video - sensation , chose to premiere its video “ Do What You Want ” on “ Total Request Live , ” MTV ’s once - dominant afternoon show , but it is worth remembering that OK
Go emerged to begin with from YouTube , where its goofy treadmill video became a cult classic .
In a sense , MTV , which once decided what was worthy , is responding to a more powerful consumer algorithm .
( Ms. Norman points out that OK Go did not start selling a significant amount of music until the band began appearing on MTV . )
The disintegration of mass has made for difficult times at MTV Networks , although there are bright spots .
VH1 continues to hum with a heady mix of “ celeb reality ” like “ Flavor of Love ” and shows like “ Best Week Ever ” that annotate the present with the ease of a well - written blog .
VH1 does not bear MTV ’s burden of serving as a generational touchstone , so it can program whatever happens to be working .
The organizational changes at the network signal that even MTV can learn some best practices from other members of the corporate family .
Marketers
I spoke to said that it was the once - dowdy VH1 that seemed to have the fresher ideas .
And Comedy Central , which lacks both the legacy and the baggage that MTV carries , is very much of the moment , lead by a skeptic - in - chief , Jon Stewart .
“ MTV has come in and out of vogue , like most cutting - edge brands , ” said Tim Spengler , chief activation officer of Initiative , a media buying firm .
“ But they have done a great job of being in vogue more often than not .
The changes that they announced seem a lot more like the redeploying of assets to digital platforms that are growing faster . ”
Tomball plant honored to make Purple Hearts Plant honored to make Purple Hearts
Firm in Tomball does many medals , most hand - painted
Tom Tucker , owner of Tomball 's Graco Awards , holds a revered Purple Heart , Thursday , which was manufactured by his company .

A small manufacturing plant in Tomball owes much of its success to a product nobody wants .
The 60 or so employees at Graco Awards make Purple Hearts , among other medals , primarily for the U.S. government .
Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have increased demand for the medals , which are presented to troops wounded in combat and to the survivors of those killed on the battlefield .
But Tom Tucker , who bought Graco Awards three years ago , says the medals are always big sellers — either to veterans of previous wars seeking replacements or wholesalers who service military bases .
" We have always had trouble keeping Purple Hearts in stock , " Tucker said .
" Before the war , during the war , it 's just always a high - demand item . "
Tucker , a former Army captain , does n't need publicity to sell his product , and he rarely even lets outsiders into his unassuming 3,000 - square - foot plant .
But , with the approach of Memorial Day , he gave the Houston Chronicle a tour .
The first thing a visitor notices after entering the plant is the strong epoxy aroma .
Along a hallway hang displays of Graco - made medals , including obscure campaign medals issued for the Spanish - American War and National Guard medals for each state .
Vietnam War ribbons
Tucker leads the way to a work area where tables are loaded with ribbons , packing boxes and other materials .
Vietnam
War medals , tucked into small plastic bags , are piled high on one table .
The medals , which all had the same yellow ribbons , need to be packed into boxes for shipment to meet a pressing deadline , Tucker said .
Onward through a dingy white door are three women stationed at tidy work areas , where they hand - paint and apply finishing touches to nearly all of the medals that leave the plant .
It 's intricate work that requires magnifying lenses to paint the tiny details , such as the small green leaves that surround George Washington 's red-and - white family crest on the Purple Heart .
Rebecca Aguilar just finished a tray of 24 combat - infantry badges .
She applied the light - blue background around the central rifle .
The three - year Graco worker said she can paint 200 Purple Hearts an hour .
Those medals , in particular , take more time than most .
Her supervisor 's son , David Lowder , wears at least two medals made by Graco on his Navy uniform .
" He has the War on Terror Service medal , " said Janette Harper , the sailor 's mother and a 10 - year Graco employee .
" We 're the only ones who have done those contracts , so it definitely came from here . "
On the wall above Aguilar 's desk are yellowed newspaper clippings about those awarded Graco medals , including one recent article about a Medal of Honor recipient .
" Most of the people who have been here for any length of time just love what we do , " Harper said .
From Harper and Aguilar 's office , Tucker makes his way to a back area where men work behind table saws to churn out plaques , trophy bases and other products .
5,000 pounds of brass
Tucker then heads through a storage area where packaged boxes are ready for shipment .
He points out coils of brass from which the Purple Hearts and other medals are made .
The company goes through 5,000 to 10,000 pounds of brass each month , he said .
Tucker 's tour pauses at what appear to be ordinary baking pans , loaded with bronze medals , stacked on the factory floor .
The back side of the unfinished medals bear the engraved words " For Military Merit , " and the mounting points on the face await the application of George Washington 's gold - plated image and the hand - painted details .
Along the way , Tucker sometimes coyly declines to answer questions that might reveal closely guarded trade secrets .
There are no over - the - shoulder views of the Purple Heart in production .
It 's a patriotic enterprise that Tucker does not take lightly .
" At the end of the day , we can actually say we 've made a difference , " he said .
" The men and women who serve this country , they earn these awards .
We 're just really proud to be part of that process . "

The prototype for a revolutionary new general - purpose computer processor , which has the potential of reaching trillions of calculations per second , has been designed and built by a team of computer scientists at The University of Texas at Austin .
The new processor , known as TRIPS ( Tera - op , Reliable , Intelligently adaptive Processing System ) , could be used to accelerate industrial , consumer and scientific computing .
Professors Stephen Keckler , Doug Burger and Kathryn McKinley have been working on underlying technology that culminated in the TRIPS prototype for the past seven years .
Their research team designed and built the hardware prototype chips and the software that runs on the chips .
“ The TRIPS prototype is the first on a roadmap that will lead to ultra-powerful , flexible processors implemented in nanoscale technologies , ” said Burger , associate professor of computer sciences .
TRIPS is a demonstration of a new class of processing architectures called Explicit Data Graph Execution ( EDGE ) .
Unlike conventional architectures that process one instruction at a time , EDGE can process large blocks of information all at once and more efficiently .
Current “ multicore ” processing technologies increase speed by adding more processors , which individually may not be any faster than previous processors .
Adding processors shifts the burden of obtaining better performance to software programmers , who must assume the difficult task of rewriting their code to run well on a potentially large number of processors .
“ EDGE technology offers an alternative approach when the race to multicore runs out of steam , ” said Keckler , associate professor of computer sciences .
Each TRIPS chip contains two processing cores , each of which can issue 16 operations per cycle with up to 1,024 instructions in flight simultaneously .
Current high - performance processors are typically designed to sustain a maximum execution rate of four operations per cycle .
Though the prototype contains two 16 - wide processors per chip , the research team aims to scale this up with further development .

From Python to PLT Scheme
Philippe Meunier and Daniel Silva
Abstract :
This paper describes an experimental embedding of Python into DrScheme .
The core of the system is a compiler , which translates Python programs into equivalent MzScheme programs , and a runtime system to model the Python environment .
The generated MzScheme code may be evaluated or used by DrScheme tools , giving Python programmers access to the DrScheme development suite while writing in their favorite language , and giving DrScheme programmers access to Python .
While the compiler still has limitations and poor performance , its development gives valuable insights into the kind of problems one faces when embedding a real - world language like Python in DrScheme .

Story Highlights • Governor says resources are strained because of war
• Death toll rises to 11
• Ammonia leak prompts police to evacuate half of town
• More severe weather possible across the central Plains
Adjust font size :
GREENSBURG , Kansas ( CNN ) --
Federal officials arrived Monday in ravaged Greensburg to survey the damage caused by the weekend 's tornado - packed storms .
Kansas Gov. Kathleen
Sebelius expressed concern that rescue and recovery efforts were being strained because much of the needed equipment has been sent to Iraq .
" When the troops get deployed , the equipment goes with them .
So here in Kansas about 50 percent of our trucks are gone .
We need trucks .
We are missing Humvees , we 're missing all kinds of equipment that could help us respond in this kind of emergency , " she said .
The weekend 's storms killed 11 people in Kansas -- including nine deaths in Greensburg , one in Stafford County to the northeast and one in a separate storm in Ottawa , Kansas .
Previously , officials said 10 people died in Greensburg , but authorities said they had apparently counted someone twice , according to City Administrator Steve Hewitt .
Hewitt also said a man reported to be a survivor found in the rubble had actually returned to the town to retrieve some papers and was not rescued .
Storm destroys resources needed for recovery
Search and rescue efforts were continuing after Friday 's mile - wide twister with winds of 205 mph leveled most of the town .
Sebelius said city and county trucks were destroyed in the storm .
" National Guard are our first responders .
They do n't have the equipment they need to come in , and it'll just make it that much slower , " she said .
( Watch the governor talk about the lack of equipment )
The National Guard has said for years that it is short of equipment at home because of deployments to Iraq .
" We were n't fully equipped with all the resources we need before the war started , " said Maj .
Gen .
Tod Bunting of the Kansas National Guard , and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan " further depleted us . "
Lt. Col. Eric Peck of the Kansas National Guard said in addition to being short transportation equipment , they also are short of front - end loaders and other heavy vehicles that can move debris .
He said the Guard troops are providing security , generators and water .
They 're also moving debris , but not as fast as they could if they had a full complement of equipment .
White House spokesman Tony Snow said Monday the National Guard has stockpiles of equipment stashed around country for emergencies .
" The administration is doing whatever it can .
If there 's a need for equipment , it will arrive . "
Feds pledge to help
U.S. Sen . Sam Brownback , R - Kansas , said the area was " a total disaster . "
" It is a difficult thing to see and I 'm sure a much more difficult thing to live through , " he said .
( Watch as town tries to cope after tornado )
Brownback , Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator David Paulison and congressmen from the area joined Sebelius and local officials in Greensburg to pledge as much federal assistance as needed .
Paulison said FEMA has trailers ready to come into the area for temporary housing as soon as locations are found to put them .
" It 's horrendous , " Paulison said of the devastation , " some of the worst I 've ever seen .
It 's pretty much total destruction . "
FEMA , he said , will " assist the state and assist the local community to get this community back on its feet . "
Bunting said in some ways the damage is worse than Hurricane Katrina , because the entire city is in ruins .
" There 's no place to go to stage to rebuild , " said Bunting , a nearly 30 - year veteran of the Guard .
" We 'll have to create that . "
Gov. : Kansans are resilient
Despite the stretched resources , Sebelius was confident Greensburg would rebuild .
( Watch treetops sheared off amid a flying American flag )
" Kansans are resilient , " she said , echoing a depiction of Midwesterners offered by other state and federal officials in the wake of the devastation .
" We have an opportunity to rebuild an entire rural community , " Sebelius said , adding that the " eyes of America are on us . "
The city should have a plan to get water and power restored within 24 hours , making trailer hook - ups feasible , according to Sebelius , a Democrat .
Hewitt said he will focus on re-establishing the town 's government .
" I 've got employees that have lost their homes .
I 've lost my home .
We 're going to bring people back .
We got to get reorganized , we got to build our government back up , we 've got to be a leader , we 've got to help folks get together and begin that process . "

Residents were allowed to return to the town of 1,500 to inspect their property until 6 p.m.
Monday , but visiting privileges were suspended for about half of the town after an ammonia leak from a railroad tank car prompted authorities to evacuate the area as a precaution .
Authorities said the tanker containing about 14,000 gallons of ammonia had overturned in the storm , and the leak began when workers tried to right it .
Severe weather lingers
Forecasters predicted that more severe weather was possible Monday elsewhere across the central Plains .

In addition to the devastation in Greensburg , parts of Oklahoma were reeling from twisters that hit Saturday night .
One person died from that storm in the northern town of Ottawa , Kansas .
The Oklahoma town of Sweetwater , about 225 miles south of Greensburg , was hit hard by a twister that severely damaged a high school and other buildings Saturday .
( Watch a 360 - degree look at the devastation that twisters left behind in Greensburg )
Larry Ruthi , meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Dodge City , Kansas , told CNN on Sunday that the tornado that struck Greensburg on Friday night was an EF - 5 , the highest level in a classification system used by the National Weather Service , and had estimated winds of 205 mph ( 330 kph ) .
The damage path at its widest point was about 1.7 miles ( 2.7 kilometers ) , and it tracked for 22 miles ( 35 kilometers ) .
( Watch an aerial view of the devastation )
The tornado moved at an average speed of about 20 mph ( 32 kph ) and took about 15 to 20 minutes to wipe out the town , he said .

The ability to reflect on one ’s knowledge was thought of as an exclusively human ability , but it seems that other primates can engage in meta-cognition as well , say researchers from Columbia ’s Primate Cognition Laboratory .
The work , detailed in Psychological Science , was designed to show that a monkey could express its confidence in its answers to multiple - choice questions about its memory based on the amount of imaginary currency it was willing to wager .
The experiment was derived from the observation that children often make pretend bets to assert that they know the answer to some question .
“ We designed a task to determine if a non -human primate could similarly learn to express its confidence about its knowledge by making large or small wagers , ” explained researcher Lisa Son .
In the experiment , the monkeys were trained to play a video game that would test their ability to remember a particular photograph while also allowing them to make a large or a small bet .
Ultimately , this wager would reflect the monkey ’s perception of their memory accuracy .
The results demonstrated that there was a strong correlation between high - risk bets and correct responses , and between low - risk bets and incorrect responses .
“ The pattern of the monkeys ’ bets provided clear evidence of their ability to engage in meta-cognition , an ability that is all the more remarkable because monkeys lack language , ” noted Columbia ’s Herbert Terrace .
The results may have implications beyond our understanding of primate behaviors .
“ Our results are of general interest because non-verbal tests of the type used in this and other experiments on animal cognition can be adapted to study cognitive abilities of infants and autistic children , ” said Terrace .

Rickard Falkvinge , leader of the Swedish " Pirate Party "
MP3s for the people ?
The Pirate Party , a new Swedish political party first publicized in January , wants to legalize sharing music , movies , and other copyrighted content using the Internet .
What may seem like a doomed effort by a small group of idealists is attracting significant media attention , in part due to a recent police raid on The Pirate Bay , an extremely popular BitTorrent tracker ( see Wikinews coverage ) .
The Pirate Bay allows people to download content listed in its database using the BitTorrent protocol ( including the latest Hollywood movies or computer games ) and has gained something of an international cult status , in part for its public and irreverent responses to legal threats received from copyright lawyers of major corporations .
The site was reopened days after the raid on Dutch servers ( but is now back in Sweden again ) .
Rickard Falkvinge , leader of the Pirate Party , argues that regardless of the legal outcome in the case , the web site demonstrates that copyright law in its current form is not sustainable .
Adopting the moniker of the maligned " Internet pirates " , the party argues for drastically limiting the scope and enforcement of copyright law , abolishing patent law , and protecting privacy in what it sees as a " control and surveillance society " .
The party is hoping to garner enough votes in the September election to become a small but important faction in the next Swedish parliament .
Rickard Falkvinge found some time in between interviews and party work to answer our questions .
There are rumours that the Swedish government was indirectly acting on behalf of the U.S. MPAA in shutting down the site .
Do you feel that your government is beholden to U.S. interests ?
Oh , the MPAA said so themselves in a press release , it 's more than a rumor .
Check their press release " Swedish authorities sink Pirate Bay " .
[ Ed. : see below ]
And yes , this particular fact has caused something of an uproar in Sweden .
It 's widely believed that Swedish authorities were more or less ordered by a foreign power to act forcefully against an entity that was in , at worst , a legal gray area according to Swedish law .
The raid must have boosted your recognition .
How many members do you currently have , and how successful has your fundraising effort been so far ?
Our member count is at 6540 , no , 6541 , no wait , 6543 ... well , you get the picture .
Our members register themselves on our website after paying the membership fee electronically , which helps reduce our admin load considerably .
Fundraising brought in 108,000 SEK [ Ed. : approx .
14,700 USD or 11,600 EUR ] , enough to buy 3 million ballots , which is some kind of at - least - we 're - not - starving minimum .
We 're not full , but we 're not starving , either .
Following the raid on the Pirate Bay , we have received another 50 K in donations .
My sincere thanks to everybody who wants to help out ; we are now looking into getting more ballots to make sure we do n't run out on election day .
( 10 million ballots was our initial full - score aim . )
Do you think you will be able to cover future expenses such as radio and television ads ?
Following the raid on the Pirate Bay , and our tripling of the member roster , we do n't need advertising .
We 've been mentioned almost every news hour across all channels on national television in the last week .
Also , the established parties have now started to turn , following our success .
Parties representing almost half of the elected parliament are now describing today 's copyright situation as not working .
They still do n't understand why , though , they are just echoing what we say without understanding what the words mean .
We 'll get around to teaching them — them and the voters alike .
This might be hard for people not following the Swedish media to grasp , but we have made a big splash .
Today , our Minister of Justice was quoted as saying that he 's open to changes to copyright laws that would make file - sharing legal , with the headline " Bodström ( his name ) flip - flops about file sharing . "
Immediately underneath were the Pirate Party 's comments to his suggestions .
Let 's take that again : when a minister makes a statement about file sharing , media calls us for comments , and publishes them next to that statement .
That 's how big we have become since the raid on the Pirate Bay .
The Minister of Justice later denied having made that statement to the press that reported it .
We will never be able to pay for television ads , the way I see it .
Unless a very wealthy donor comes on stage .
( If any such person is reading this , we have planned how to spend up to $ 375,000 in a cost - efficient way up until the elections , on the chance that donations appear .
That spending does still not include any TV ads . )

Are you aware of similar initiatives in other countries ?
Some are trying , but none have achieved the necessary momentum and critical mass that we have .
We expect that momentum to happen once we get into Swedish Parliament and show that it can be done .
[ Ed. : A United States variant of the party was recently launched .
See also : Intellectual property activism category on Wikipedia ]
The name " Pirate Party " seems to identify the party with what is currently defined as a crime : piracy of software , movies , music , and so on .
Will a name like " Pirate Party " not antagonize voters , given that the label is so negatively used ?
How about potential allies abroad who argue for a more balanced copyright regime , such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation or Creative Commons ?
Oh , it is a crime .
That 's the heart of the problem !
The very problem is that something that 20 % of the voters are doing is illegal by punishment of jail time .
That 's what we want to change .
Where the established parties are saying that the voters are broken , we are saying it 's the law that is broken .
Besides , it 's a way of reclaiming a word .
The media conglomerates have been pointing at us and calling us pirates , trying to make us somehow feel shame .
It does n't work .
We wear clothes saying " PIRATE " in bright colors out on the streets .
Yes , we are pirates , and we 're proud of it , too .
Also , the term is not that negative at all in Sweden , much thanks to the awesome footwork of the Pirate Bureau ( Piratbyrån ) , who have been working since 2003 to educate the public .
If you are elected , and have the opportunity to become part of the next government of Sweden , do you intend to focus only on the issues in your platform ( IP law and privacy ) ?

Join our maiden voyage September 17 . "

Our current plan is to support the government from the parliament , but not be part of it .
If we 're part of it , that means we get a vested interest to not overthrow it , which puts us in a weaker position if they start going against our interests .
Overall , our strategy is to achieve the balance of power , where both the left and right blocks need our votes to achieve a majority , and then support the issues of whichever government that agrees to drive our issues the strongest .
Basically , we sell our votes on other issues to the highest bidder in exchange for them driving ours .
Have you already made any contacts in Swedish politics ?
Contacts ...
I 'm not sure what you mean .
Several of us have been shaking hands with some of the established politicians , particularly in the youth leagues , if that 's what you mean .
I was thinking along the lines of exploring possible modes of cooperation with established political parties — are you already taken seriously ?
We are taken seriously by most of the youth leagues and by at least one of the represented parties .
In particular , which is what counts , we are now taken seriously by national media .
However , we can't tie contacts that explore modes of cooperation quite yet — since our strategy depends on holding the balance of power , we need to not express a preference for whom we'd like to cooperate with , or we 'd put ourselves in a weaker bargaining position .
What is your position on moral rights , as recognized by European Union copyright laws : the right of attribution , the right to have a work published anonymously or pseudonymously , and the right to the integrity of the work .
Do you think these rights should be preserved ?
We safeguard the right to attribution very strongly .
After all , what we are fighting for is the intent of copyright as it is described in the US constitution : the promotion of culture .
Many artists are using recognition as their primary driving force to create culture .
Publishing anonymously or pseudonymously happens every day on the Internet , so no big deal there either .
The right to integrity , however , is an interesting issue .
We state that we are for free sampling , meaning you can take a sound that I made for my tune and use it in your own tunes , or for that matter , a whole phrase .
That 's partially in line with today 's copyright law on derivative works ; as long as you add your own creative touch to a work , you get your own protection for the derivation .
We want to strengthen that right .
You might want to consider the alternative .
In the 50s and 60s , a lot of rock and roll bands started doing covers of old classical music .
This would almost certainly have been considered to violate the integrity of the original artist — and was considered to do so by many — but in the eyes of many others , it was instead great new culture of a previously unseen form and shape .
So I do n't have a definite answer on the integrity issue .
While I am leaning towards the promotion of new culture taking precedence over a limitation right , there may be unconsidered cases .
Do you feel that trademark law is adequate as it is ?
Yes .
We have not seen any hidden costs to trademarks that outweigh the benefits of reducing transaction costs on a market where seller and buyer are not personally acquainted .
How do you intend to deal with EU treaties which define certain legal frameworks for the protection of intellectual works ?
What can they do ?
Fine us ?
Send us an angry letter ?
Come on , countries need to think more like corporations .
If the fine is less than the cost to society , which it is in this case , then the right thing to do is to accept the fine with a polite " thank you " .
Actually , national media just called me about this very question ; the Department of Justice has stated that we can't allow file sharing , as it would break international treaties .
My response was that it is more important to not have 1.2 million Swedes criminalized , than it is to avoid paying a penalty fee .
Do you think that weaker intellectual property laws would lessen the amount of products released in Sweden by foreign companies , such as Hollywood studios ?
As long as they believe that they will have a revenue here that exceeds the cost of operations , they will keep coming here .
Anything else would be wrong from a corporate standpoint .
Besides , you need to remember what we are doing is to change the map according to what reality looks like .
We do not want to change people 's behavior .
We want to change the law so it reflects what the world actually looks like .
So , as they apparently make a profit today , I expect that to continue .
Falkvinge at a demonstration in Stockholm on June 3 , following the raid on the Pirate Bay
Do you feel that the music industry in its current form will still be needed in a world where non-commercial copying is permitted ?
It 's not so much if they are needed where non-commercial copying is permitted , rather if they are needed when they 're not necessary any more to be the middle man between consumer and artist .
The music industry will lose its current chokepoint , because they do n't add any value to the end product any longer .
They will probably survive as a service bureau for artists , but they will not be able to control distribution .
It 's actually quite simple : if they get their act together and provide a service that people want to buy , they will remain .
If not , they will vanish .
Today , they have legislated that people must buy their service regardless of whether it adds value or not , and that 's not gonna hold in the long term .
Why fight against intellectual property laws , instead of focusing your energy on creating freely licensed content , such as Creative Commons films or open source software ?
I want to raise the issue a level , to show that it 's not about payment models or what level of control the copyright holder chooses to exert over his or her work .
Let me put it this way : we have achieved the technical possibility of sending copyrighted works in digital , private communications .
I can send a piece of music in e-mail to you , I can drop a video clip in a chat room .
That technology is not going away , leaving us with two choices .
So — if copyright is to be enforced — if you are to tax , prohibit , fee , fine , or otherwise hinder the transmission of copyrighted works in private communications , the only way to achieve that is to have all private communications constantly monitored .
It 's really that large .
Also , this is partly nothing new .
We 've been able to do this since the advent of the Xerox copier — you could photocopy a poem or a painting and put it in a letter in the mail .
Again , the only way to discover or stop that would have been for the authorities to open all letters and check their content .
So we 're at a crossroads here .
Either we , as a society , decide that copyright is the greater value to society , and take active steps to give up private communications as a concept .
Either that , or we decide that the ability to communicate in private , without constant monitoring by authorities , has the greater value — in which case copyright will have to give way .
My choice is clear .
The Pirate Bay was shut down and re-opened days later on a Dutch server .
According to a Swedish newspaper report , traffic has doubled since then .
How long do you think the cat and mouse game will continue ?
Until one of two things happen :
The authorities realize they can't enforce laws that require monitoring all private communications , especially given the large international level of grassroots support , or [ they ] actually start monitoring all private communications .

The last few times I ’ve taught project management , I ’ve explained that multi-project context switching wastes time .
The project managers agree with me .
But then they ask the question , “ How do I explain this to my management ?
They refuse to believe me .
Managers , especially senior managers , do n’t believe context switching wastes time because all they do is context switch .
Senior managers frequently have several projects in the air , most of them waiting for input from other people .
But that ’s not how technical projects work .
Most of the time , technical people are not in wait states , but can continue to work productively on projects .
Senior managers do n’t understand or remember that the work technical people perform is substantively different from the work they perform .
So to reach managers and convince them that context switching is a bad idea , make sure you speak their language .
First , set the stage by explaining how technical work is different from management work .
Next , help your manager determine the relative priority of each piece of work .
Finally , block out the work , and keep your management apprised of the status .
Technical work is different from management work
Here ’s one example I ’ve used when explaining how technical work is different from management work .
Assume you work for a bank , and you have three post - release fixes to complete .
One fix is for the branches , for a particular type of new accounts .
One fix is to change the format of particular data you send to the Federal Reserve .
And the last fix is in the reporting software that the branches use to report a variety of measures to headquarters .
You ’re the technical lead for a group of four other people ( a total of five people ) , and each fix will take two calendar weeks to complete .
That ’s a cost of ten person - weeks for each fix , a total of 30 person - weeks .
Because the fixes are in unrelated systems , you ca n’t batch any of them together .
If you perform the work for each fix serially , at the end ofsix weeks , you ’ll have all three fixes ready .
( see Figure 1 . )
Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5 Weeks 6 Start Fix 1 Finish Fix 1 Start Fix 2 Finish Fix 2 Start Fix 3 Finish Fix
Figure 1
If you context switch , the best case is the first fix is finished at Week5 .
The best case assumes that each person working on a fix spends the entire week working on a particular fix .
Between each week is a bit of time context switching to remember the state of the fixing .
In my experience , it ’s more that the first fix would not be ready until about week seven , the second fix at week nine and the third at about week eleven — if not later ( see Figure2 ) .
Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5 Weeks 6 Week 7 Week 8 Start Fix 1 Start Fix 2 Start Fix 3 Work on Fix 1 Finish Fix 1 , Work on Fix 2 Finish Fix 2 Work on Fix 3 Finish Fix 3
Figure 2
But that just represents the pressure on the technical staff .
Do n’t forget the pressure on senior management .
In this example , in between their meetings , presentation development , document review , voice mail , and more meetings , three people are calling your VP and leaving urgent voicemails , emails , or stopping by your VP ’s office .
Stacy represents the Federal Reserve auditor .
She says , “ I really need that fix for the Fed , and I need it right away .
Your guys are working on my fix , right ? ”
Betty represents the branch managers .
She ’s left your VP several emails and voicemails , each saying “ Another call from a branch manager .
This problem is costing us a fortune in back - office support to create those accounts with those workarounds . ”
And Dan , the CFO , represents the Board when he says , “ We need the data from the branches .
And we need it before the end of the quarter , so we can get ready for the end - of - quarter financials . ”
Your VP is under tremendous pressure to fix all of these problems at the same time .
So , first explain how you work , and how working on one fix at a time will get one customer off your VP ’s back .
Now , help your VP determine the relative priority of each fix .
Determine Relative Priority for Each Project
Each of these three fixes is critically important to the welfare of this organization .
And , because there are a limited number of people , management will have to choose a relative priority for each fix .
One question I like to ask about priority is , “ What are the consequences to the organization if we select this project first ? ”
Then I ask the same question as we review the project list .
Typically , I ask about consequences and risks in terms of regulatory issues , loss of customers , revenue , and ongoing operations costs .
Your organization might rank these issues in a different order or modify this list .
Then I ask about the data that says this project is urgent .
When I worked with this client , we called Stacy and asked about the auditor ’s needs for the data .
S tacy was being proactive , but the real deadline was another quarter away .
Next , we called Dan , and asked , “ Would you rather save this much money in back - office work or receive the branch reports ? ”
Of course , Dan said both , and we explained he had a choice of one .
If he did n’t make the choice , we would .
He chose saving money in the back - office , a choice that surprised both my client and me .
I ’ve been in situations where we really did need to have three things done at virtually the same time .
In that case , we staffed each fix with its own project staff , and stopped working on new development work .
Now we have three projects in priority order : fix the accounts , then the reports , and finally implement the data format changes .
Keep Management Apprised of Status
As you proceed with your projects , make sure you maintain progress on each project .
Since you ’re not context switching , it ’s easier to do that , especially on smaller projects like fixes .
Report your progress to management periodically , so they understand you are making progress .
Some of you may be saying , “ Well , now I know how to do this for small projects .
But I ’m managing three big projects , all with the same thirty people .
Each project is a year long .
How the heck do I stop context switching on these projects ? ”
Extend the risk analysis for larger projects
First , perform risk analysis for all of the projects , developing a list of projects in relative priority .
For larger projects , your management may not be able to or willing to define the relative priority for each project using the issues of regulation , loss of customers , loss of revenue , enhancement of revenue , or reducing operations costs .
Two projects may appear quite similar .
In that case , either consider how you prioritize projects ( which may be out of your control ) or consider changing how you develop projects ( in your control ) .
Consider moving to iterations for projects that appear to have the same priority
One technique I ’ve used is to move to month - long iterations when two projects are competing for the same people at the same time .
Even after attempting risk analysis , if my management still can’t make a decision , I either assign half the people on one project and half to the other , or I select one project .
Either way , everyone works on their assigned project for one month , and shows some visible progress .
Then I ask management to look at the progress we ’ve made .
One technique to accomplish this is to implement by feature .
If no one looks at the demo or our visible progress , I stop work on that project and move everyone to the other project .
If management reviews our progress , I verify that this project is still the highest priority , and continue work .
If I ’ve staffed both projects with half the people , and management is happy about our progress , we continue with that staffing .
Otherwise , if this is enough project work on this project for now , we move to the other project .
Context switching at a one - month boundary is n’t great , but it ’s better than the alternatives .
But in order for this to work , you need to show demo-able software .
It does n’t have to be release - able , but people outside your project have to be able to see your progress .
Stop the madness
Context switching is insanity , because it guarantees everything will be late .
You do n’t have to live with multi-project context switching .
It requires an understanding of the differences in work between technical people and management .
You may need to lead the risk analysis and ordering of projects .
And when you ’ve selected a project and started working , make sure you can show people your progress at reasonable time periods .
It ’s hard work to stop multi-project context switching .
But the rewards are worth it .

BAGHDAD ( AP ) 
A wall U.S. troops are building around a Sunni enclave in Baghdad came under increasing criticism on Saturday , with residents calling it " collective punishment " and a local leader saying construction began without the neighborhood council 's approval .
The U.S. military says the wall in Baghdad is meant to secure the minority Sunni community of Azamiyah , which " has been trapped in a spiral of sectarian violence and retaliation . "
The area , located on the eastern side of the Tigris River , would be completely gated , with entrances and exits manned by Iraqi soldiers , the U.S. military said earlier this week .
But some residents of the neighborhood , which is surrounded by Shiite areas , complained that they had not been consulted in advance about the barrier .
" This will make the whole district a prison .
This is collective punishment on the residents of Azamiyah , " said Ahmed al - Dulaimi , a 41 - year - old engineer who lives in the area .
" They are going to punish all of us because of a few terrorists here and there . "
" We are in our fourth year of occupation and we are seeing the number of blast walls increasing day after day , suffocating the people more and more , " al - Dulaimi said in an interview .
U.S. and Iraqi forces have long erected cement barriers around marketplaces and coalition bases and outposts in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities such as Ramadi in an effort to prevent attacks , including suicide car bombs .
But the Azamiyah project appears to be the biggest effort ever to use a lengthy wall in Baghdad to break contact , and violence , between Sunnis and Shiites .
The U.S. strategy for stabilizing Iraq now involves persuading Iraqis to live in peace and support their democratically elected government and launching a security plan in the capital that calls for 28,000 additional American troops and thousands of Iraqi soldiers .
On Saturday , one American soldier was killed and two were wounded by a roadside bomb southwest of Baghdad , the military said .
A separate roadside bombing , in Diwaniyah about 80 miles south of the capital , killed a Polish soldier late Friday .
Khalid Ibrahim , 45 , said the Americans were working hard to divide Baghdad 's neighborhoods — something he said he was n't sure was a good thing .
" This is good if it is temporary , to help the area with security problems .
But if this wall stays for the long term , it will be a catastrophe for the residents and will restrict our movements , " said Ibrahim , an Azamiyah resident who works at the Interior Ministry .
The U.S. military says it began building the barrier April 10 .
AP Television News footage from the site on Saturday showed small concrete blocks , piles of dirt and coils of barbed wire on a main street .
Eventually , the military said , the wall will be three miles long and include sections as tall as 12 feet .
Community leaders said Saturday that construction began before they had approved an American proposal for the wall .
" A few days ago , we met with the U.S. army unit in charge of Azamiyah and it asked us , as a local council , to sign a document to build a wall to reduce killing and attacks against Iraqi and U.S. forces , " said Dawood al - Azami , the acting head of the Azamiyah council .
" I told the soldiers that I would not sign it unless I could talk to residents first .
We told residents at Friday prayers , but our local council has n't signed onto the project yet , and construction is already underway . "
Asked about the Azamiyah wall , Interior Ministry spokesman Brig .
Abdul - Karim Khalaf said there would be " some limitations on more than one neighborhood inside Baghdad . "
" There will be no isolation of any neighborhood .
There will be limitations on the movement of people through specific routes , so that terrorists cannot avoid being searched , " he said .
In other violence Saturday , two bullet - riddled dead bodies were discovered in Musayyib , about 40 miles south of Baghdad , police said .
One of the bodies was found floating in the Euphrates River , and the other was discovered in a deserted area .
Both victims had their hands and legs bound , and showed signs of torture , police said .
A bomb left on a bus exploded in Baghdad 's Sadr City neighborhood , killing at least three people and gutting the vehicle , police said .
Gunmen stormed a house in Kirkuk , 180 miles north of Baghdad , killing a mother , father and their two teenage daughters , police said .
The victims were Kurds who had received death threats from militants , witnesses said .
In other violence Saturday , a roadside bomb killed the mayor of Musayyib , about 40 miles south of Baghdad , police said .
One of his bodyguards was also killed , and four others were wounded , they said .
Australian Defense Minister Brendan Nelson paid an unannounced visit to Iraq and met with Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki to discuss the coalition 's efforts to improve security in cities such as Baghdad , the government said .
Australia has about 1,400 troops in and around the country .
Al - Maliki and Nelson met at the prime minister 's office in the capital 's heavily fortified Green Zone , and al - Maliki " underlined that Iraqi forces are unified in battling terrorists and outlaws , and are now fighting shoulder to shoulder throughout Iraq , " especially in hard - hit areas such as Baghdad and the provinces of Anbar , west of the capital , and Diyala , to the northeast , a government statement said .

" It 's had a massive impact because it 's just so convenient , " said Philippe Kahn , a tech industry maverick whose other pioneering efforts include the founding of software maker Borland , an early Microsoft competitor .
" There 's always a way to capture memories and share it , " he said .
" You go to a restaurant , and there 's a birthday and suddenly everyone is getting their camera phones out .
It 's amazing . "
If Kahn feels a bit like a proud father when he sees people holding up their mobile phones to snap pictures , there is good reason :
He jury - rigged the first camera phone while his wife was in labour with their daughter .
" We were going to have a baby and I wanted to share the pictures with family and friends , " Kahn said , " and there was no easy way to do it . "
So as he sat in a maternity ward , he wrote a crude program on his laptop and sent an assistant to a RadioShack store to get a soldering iron , capacitors and other supplies to wire his digital camera to his mobile phone .
When Sophie was born , he sent her photo over a cellular connection to acquaintances around the globe .
A decade later , 41 per cent of American households own a camera phone " and you can hardly find a phone without a camera anymore , " said Michael Cai , an industry analyst at Parks Associates .
Market researcher Gartner Inc. predicts that about 589 million mobile phones will be sold with cameras in 2007 , increasing to more than 1 billion worldwide by 2010 .
Mix in the internet 's vast reach and the growth of the YouTube generation , and the ubiquitous gadget 's influence only deepens and gets more complicated .
So much so that the watchful eyes on all of us may no longer just be those of Big Brother .
" For the past decade , we 've been under surveillance under these big black and white cameras on buildings and at 7 - Eleven stores .
But the candid camera is wielded by individuals now , " said Fred Turner , an assistant professor of communications at Stanford University who specialises in digital media and culture .
The contraption Kahn assembled in a Santa Cruz labour - and - delivery room in 1997 has evolved into a pocket - friendly phenomenon that has empowered both citizen journalists and personal paparazzi .
It has prompted lawsuits - a student sued campus police at the University of California Los Angeles for alleged excessive force after officers were caught on cell - phone video using a stun gun during his arrest ; and been a catalyst for change - a government inquiry into police practices ensued in Malaysia after a cell - phone video revealed a woman detainee being forced to do squats while naked .
On another scale , parents use mobile phone slideshows - not wallet photos - to show off pictures of their children , while adolescents document their rites of passage with mobile phone cameras and instantly share the images .
One of the recipients of Kahn 's seminal photo email was veteran technology consultant Andy Seybold , who recalled being " blown away " by the picture .
" The fact that it got sent wirelessly on the networks those days - that was an amazing feat , " Seybold said .
Kahn 's makeshift photo - communications system formed the basis for a new company , LightSurf Technologies , which he later sold to VeriSign .
LightSurf built " PictureMail " software and worked with mobile phone makers to integrate the wireless photo technology .
Sharp was the first to sell a commercial mobile phone with a camera in Japan in 2000 .
Camera phones did n't debut in the US until 2002 , Kahn said .
Though Kahn 's work revolved around transmitting only digital still photographs - video - related developments were created by others in the imaging and chip industries - his groundbreaking implementation of the instant - sharing via a mobile phone planted a seed .
" He facilitated people putting cameras in a phone , and he proved that you can take a photo and send it to someone with a mobile phone , " Seybold said .
Kahn , 55 , is well aware of how the camera phone has since been put to negative uses : sneaky shots up women 's skirts , or the violent trend of " happy slapping " in Europe where youths provoke a fight or assault , capture the incident on camera and then spread the images on the web or between mobile phones .
But he likes to focus on the technology 's benefits .
It 's been a handy tool that has led to vindication for victims or validation for vigilantes .
As Kahn heard the smattering of stories in recent years about assailants scared off by a camera phone or criminals who were nabbed later because their faces or their license plates were captured on the gadget , he said , " I started feeling it was better than carrying a gun . "
And though he found the camera - phone video of the former Iraqi dictator 's execution disturbing , Kahn said the gadget helped " get the truth out . "
The unofficial footage surreptitiously taken by a guard was vastly different from the government - issued version and revealed a chaotic scene with angry exchanges depicting the ongoing problems between the nation 's factions .
Kahn also thinks the evolution of the camera phone has only just begun .
He would n't discuss details of his newest startup , Fullpower Technologies , which is in stealth mode working on the " convergence of life sciences and wireless , " according to its website .
But , Kahn said , it will , among other things , " help make camera phones better . "

Unrealized Capital Gains – An Overlooked Cost of Mutual Funds
I received my 1099 - DIV today from Oakmark Funds and was unpleasantly surprised when I saw $ 1,013 of total capital gain distributions .
I always look at management fees when considering a fund but have n’t really examined tax implications , probably because most of our investments are in 401k , 403b , or IRAs .
I ’ll have to start paying more attention to this in our taxable investments .
Tax Liability
I found a good explanation by Jason Fitchner of how investors incur capital gain distributions even without selling any shares of a fund .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
“ An individual owns 1,000 shares in Mutual Fund ABC , which were purchased for $ 10 per share ( for a total cost of $ 10,000 ) .
The shares of the mutual fund represent ownership , or various rights to capital assets , in the mutual fund .
In the course of the mutual fund ’s normal buying and selling of securities , any assets that are sold by the mutual fund at a price in excess of that at which they were purchased creates a realized capital gain and a tax liability .
If Mutual Fund ABC realizes capital gains of $ 1 per share , the individual investors are responsible for the tax liability even if they themselves have n’t “ realized ” or exchanged their shares for money .
Even though the gains are reinvested , this is considered to be a realized gain to the mutual fund company .
The tax liability is passed - through to the individual shareholders even though this is an unrealized gain to the shareholders of the mutual fund .
Even if individual shareholders do nothing more than buy and hold mutual fund shares , they could still be hit with a potentially large tax liability due to the distribution of gains from their mutual funds .
Shareholders are then forced to either sell assets to pay the tax liability , or divert funds from other sources .
This creates an opportunity cost to the shareholder and can result in lost economic gain due to compounding . ”
Appreciation vs. Taxes
Taxable distributions can cut into your overall earnings .
Even though my investment in the fund appreciated around $ 1,500 in 2006 , I have total capital gain distributions of $ 1,013 .
I wo n’t necessarily realize the gains from this appreciation because the fund ’s value could go down again before I sell .
However , I definitely have at pay the taxes .

With only a brief preview of its new iPhone , Apple has yanked the rug from under the rest of the industry .
The talking heads desperately need to something to say .
Here 's what they 'll all be saying , and why they 'll be wrong .
Myth 1 : the iPhone is missing EVDO ( or some other high end feature ) which will stifle adoption .
Yes , it 's true : home engineers will spout all sorts of ideas that the iPhone " should have had " or " desperately needs " to be competitive .
None of that matters however .
The iPhone is intended as a mass market product , not a niche product that is interesting , but ultimately impractical , overpriced , and not quite ready yet .
The latest bleeding edge of features would n't dramatically improve the device , but would jack up its price and kill its opportunity to find a large audience .
Contrast the 1994 Newton .
Apart from being a magical tablet , it did n't have much mass market appeal at its $ 900 price point .
Palm demonstrated ( many years later ) that gadget users might pay $ 300 for a PDA , but nobody has been able to sell any mass market , handheld entertainment device for well above $ 600 .
More recent examples :
• The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 both appear to be priced too high ; sales of both are below expectations .
• Microsoft 's Origami handheld / tablet devices did not sell at all at its awkwardly high price point .
• Cheaper , more practical devices , from the PS2 to the Wii to the iPod , have all been selling like hot cakes .
Myth Two : The iPhone is priced too high .
It needs a 2 GB version for $ 299 lacking phone features .
It is true that the iPhone is n't cheap , but it 's also not expensive when compared to similar phones , which ... are n't yet available .
Like myth number one , this idea rests on the assumption that prices are infinitely scalable along a regular incline .
They are not .
If you eat in a restaurant , you can't order half a meal for half the price , even if you 're not very hungry .
That 's because prices are set in a complex balance .
Simple bulk food can be purchased by the pound , but when you start substituting or carving up a finished product designed to sell as a menu item , the costs of accommodating your changes can end up being higher than the actual cost of materials .
It ’s the high price of integration .
Leaving the restaurant and entering the engineering lab : it makes increasingly less sense for Apple to offer multiple versions of the iPhone .
Currently , there are only two : 4 GB for $ 499 and 8 GB for $ 599 .
Apple wants you to buy the 8 GB version , but is accommodating a larger market by offering a 4 GB version .
By offering a huge variety of smaller or otherwise limited versions , Apple would start giving up sales for lower price points , without any upside .
In other words , a 2 GB version , or a version without phone features , would bleed from the market for higher end iPhones , and trade away those profits for increasingly fewer new adopters .
It ’s the law of diminishing returns .
That would also convert the iPhone from being a groundbreaking new device into a more anemic one with less power .
If all iPhones have at least 4 GB , it means developers do n't have to target a 2 GB unit as the lowest common denominator .
To shatter one final straw : the iPhone is priced and featured to sit in the existing iPod lineup without contention .
Currently , the iPod Nanos and 5G iPods overlap slightly .
How exactly would an iPhone minus the phone , or minus some other features , not destroy this balance ?
Where would it fit ?
Shuffle $ 79 Ultra small and simple
Nano $ 149 - $ 249
Very small and thin
5G iPod $ 249 -$ 349
Hard drive based , with large capacity
i Phone $ 499 - $ 599 Phone and Internet features
Myth Three : The iPhone should be sold unlocked , not tied to Cingular service .
In speculating about Apple 's phone offerings , I suggested that Apple could sell a phone device either as an MVNO ( acting as a business front by reselling another cellular provider 's service ) or as an unlocked device ( which buyers could take to any service provider ) .
Instead of either path , Apple signed up an exclusive deal with Cingular .
The exclusive deal likely gave Apple bargaining power in subsidizing the phone .
It also provided Apple with leverage for supporting features specific to the iPhone .
For example , Apple could prod Cingular into making changes to its network to support the iPhone 's visual voicemail , which presents messages like emails rather than forcing the user to navigate through them while listening on the phone .
Going exclusively with Cingular also allowed Apple to deliver one universal phone using GSM .
I had earlier pointed out why that would result in a more efficient and elegant model for Apple , which tends to focus on building a single product that can be sold in multiple markets .
In relation to Cingular , it also allows Apple to provide a more integrated product with specialized features , and keep things simple in order to deliver a solid product .
All of these reasons support an exclusive provider .
So why is n't Apple likely to sell an unlocked version ?
Shortly before the iPhone ’s release , Dean Hall , a seven year software engineer for Motorola , explained in an email the limited usability of an unlocked phone :
" When a phone is unlocked it loses its privileges on a provider 's data network .
An unlocked phone can make GSM calls and send basic SMS .
No MMS , no Internet , no iTS .
Apple would either have to reverse engineer a method to gain access to the data network ( unlikely as most data networks require SSL - level security to access ) or it would have to offer something different . "
By ‘ something different , ’ Hall referred to WiFi or some other data service .
" Going with an unlocked device would be the path of greater disruption and I hope Apple takes that route because I despise the US mobile phone business model , " he said .
What Apple ended up doing , of course , is a mix of both : linking the phone service to a single provider to get tight integration with advanced features , but also offering WiFi and Bluetooth services for data service when available .
Apple reps say the new iPhone will automatically use WiFi whenever it ’s available , and use EDGE when a WiFi network is n't .
But as Hall points out , even if Apple were to sell the iPhone unlocked ( or users were able to unlock it without authorization ) , the unit would only be able to make basic calls .
It could n't do remote web , push IMAP , visual voicemail , and various other services that are key features of the device .
[ update : Removing the subsidy lock on a mobile phone to create an “ unlocked phone ” is not necessarily a barrier to using MMS and Internet services , particularly in markets outside the US .
More information is presented in Readers Write About iPhone , 3G Wireless Networks . ]
Of course , it would also cost hundreds more without Cingular subsidizing it under a two year contract , pushing it out of the reach of many buyers .
By linking the phone to a contract , Apple can offer more value than it could selling it at full retail .
Other expensive devices , from the Newton to high end Palm and WinCE devices , have all not sold well .
Myth Four :
The iPhone software is a closed model , therefore the sky is falling .
In Device Problems
In Search of a Solution , I presented a few problems with existing phones and PDAs .
In addition to poor and inconsistent interfaces , existing phones suffer from software platform problems .
Some have unique platforms for programs ( such as Verizon 's BREW ) that end up only offering expensive junk games , while others have third party development ( such as Palm and WinCE / Windows Mobile ) which tends to result in being insecure and unstable because the various apps that get loaded are prone to crash the system .
As I predicted , the iPhone will use a software model similar to the iPod , although the new iPhone runs a version of Mac OS X , not the same system as the earlier iPods .
This closed model solves several problems .
• First , it creates a viable platform for developers , who can actually sell a product instead of simply trying to subsist in a tiny market on shareware donations .
• Second , by creating a viable market , it allows developers to sell in quantity at a lower price .
Apple targeted iPod games at $ 5 each ; for comparison , typical Palm games are easily $ 20 . •
Third , it ensures that junkware , adware , spyware , and malicious viruses can't put themselves on the iPhone .
• Fourth , it allows Apple to enforce a standard of quality so that third party software does n't turn the iPhone into a device known to crash or be riddled with security problems .
Panic mongers who think that the iPhone needs to be a hobbyist development tool should take a good look at the state of development for Palm and WinCE before recommending a similar mess for Apple .
Myth Five : The iPhone is just a phone with features lots of other phones already have .
This will be popular among the Thurrott crowd , who like to downplay innovation by saying something vaguely similar has already been done .
Yes , the iPhone is a phone , but you 'd have to be a complete moron with zero vision to look at it and say “ it 's been done before . ”
Key features are not only shockingly well presented , but will be difficult to even copy .
• The multitouch screen is n't innovative because it's a touch screen ; it 's new because it offers a finger gesture system that just makes sense and is intuitive .
• Visual voicemail is obvious in retrospect , but nobody in the last half decade of phone development at Palm or Microsoft thought to fix the problem .
•
Ever use an existing phone 's web browser ?
Apple has demonstrated the difference between a placeholder product and a well executed one that actually works .
“ At the risk of playing into the hype of the iPhone , seeing is believing with this device . ”
-- Gene Munster , Piper Jaffray
“ It ’s not just candy .
These are entirely useful , new ways to use your phone . ”
-- Mike McGuire , Gartner
“ This product could not have been done two years ago and come to market the way that it has .
Yes , I know other devices can do a lot of what the iPhone can do but that ’s like saying there ’s a lot of other music players out there as well . ”
-- Michael Gartenberg , Jupiter Research
Myth Six : Cisco owns the iPhone name , which presents an impossible conundrum of epic proportions .
First of all , who cares what this is called ?
Apple could call it the Apple Phone .
It could call it " French Canadian Genitalia " or even " the Hebrew Profanity " and still sell it .
Nobody is looking for a product named the iPhone , they 're looking for Apple 's iPhone that works as it was demonstrated .
Second , trademarks are only useful if they are protected .
That 's why Cisco is falling all over itself to issue a flurry of press releases indicating that Apple will be agreeing to pay it for use of the name .
However , the iPhone name is n't associated with Cisco 's Linksys products , its associated with Apple .
Further , Cisco has been sitting on the name for years without using it , which would n't help its rather fragile case for owning the term .
If Cisco had built a reputable brand upon the iPhone name ( which it only recently applied to a Linksys VoIP phone set ) then it might seem reasonable that Apple should pick another name or license the term .
But it has n't .
Cisco used the name like a submarine patent in an attempt to hijack interest surrounding Apple 's mobile phone .
Anyone unglued about the name of this product is seriously logic impaired .
It does n't even matter in the slightest .
Myth Seven : Apple will need to port iLife 07 to Windows in order to have a photo viewer for PC users .
Okay , so I 'm scraping the barrel with this one , but this was an actual argument presented about the iPhone .
Yes there is no iPhoto for Windows , but no Apple wo n't solve the problem .
There was a good business reason for porting QuickTime and iTunes to Windows .
There is not one for porting iPhoto , or any other applications that add unique value to the Mac .
This idea becomes more absurd when considering that Windows users already have a number of photo apps , including Google Picasa , Adobe Photoshop Album , and the basic photo app built into Windows .
How many of those users would even want to move to iPhoto ?
Myth Eight :
An integrated battery is a significant problem for users
“ Apple ’s bothersome tradition of non-user - servicable batteries continues .
There ’s no reason to do this , frankly , aside from the kind of implied ‘ we ’re aesthetic obsessives ’ claim that Apple still gets away with . ”
-- Rob Beschizza , Wired
Frankly , Mr. Beschizza , it is obvious why you write for aesthetic obsessive magazines rather than engineer actual products .
But thanks for continuing the bothersome tradition of repeating the complaints of yesterday ’s wags .
The iPod ’s integrated battery did n't prevent 70 million people from buying one , nor did it prevent a variety of cheap replacement services -- including do it yourself kits -- from appearing .
In contrast , after a couple years of Palm Treo 650 ownership , I can report that the only reason I 've pulled the battery is to recover from frequent crashes or when fiddling with unnecessarily complex firmware updates .
I pretty much hate my Palm Treo , but I really liked my Palm V and Vx , both of which had a sleek integrated battery that gave me no fits at all .
With an integrated battery the Treo would at least be less of a brick .
Having an extra battery to swap in makes sense on a laptop , but does not make sense for a phone , particularly one that has standard external battery packs that can be used via its dock connector .
Myth Nine : OMG Scratches
This has become the top battle cry of Microsoft slaves .
One of the top three features of Microsoft 's iPod Killer was that “ it did n't scratch like the iPod . ”
Well , it turns out that iPods only scratch when you scratch them .
Apple could probably offer a fancier PSP like screen with a turtle wax coating more resistant to scratching , but guess what ?
Everything wears , in direct proportion to how well it ’s taken care of by its user .
Prior to going on a trip , I bought a plastic shell for a 5G iPod I brought with me .
I found that the shell just made things worse , by trapping dust and etching up the iPod inside the shell .
Had I simply kept it in a pocket , or applied a protective film instead , it would likely have not been scratched at all .
My Treo has a screen that has n't been scratched up at all , largely because I religiously keep it separate from any keys or loose change in my pocket .
Compare the Zune , which has a cheap looking plastic Tupperware - like lid that looks crappy around the edges almost immediately , even in minimal wear on display in stores .
Scratches ?
That ’s the wear indicator feature .
Myth Ten : Apple can't figure out how do do a phone .
In addition to CNET 's Michael Kanellos , whose lame attempts to antagonize were profiled in Apple iPhone Rumors Off the Hook , Palm CEO Ed Colligan also insisted that Apple would be out of its league in making a phone .
" We ’ve learned and struggled for a few years here figuring out how to make a decent phone , ” Colligan said .
“ PC guys are not going to just figure this out .
They ’re not going to just walk in . ”
Yes , Apple just walked in and noticed you were incompetently selling the same old crap with slight hardware improvements over the last half decade , and decided to kick you out .
Hey Palm : do n't let the door hit you on the way out !

You and me , me and you , lots and lots , for us to do
By Sean Coughlan
BBC News Magazine
Bill Clinton told the Labour conference to get into ubuntu .
Eh ? Ubuntu .
That was what Bill Clinton told the Labour party conference it needed to remember this week .
" Society is important because of Ubuntu . "
But what is it ?
Left - leaning sudoku ?
U2 's latest album ?
Fish - friendly sushi ?
No , it 's a word describing an African worldview , which translates as " I am because you are , " and which means that individuals need other people to be fulfilled .
The former president , husky - voiced and down - home with the delegates , gave it a folksy flavour , describing it in terms of needing to be around others to enjoy being ourselves .
ubuntu , noun .
Humanity or fellow feeling ; kindness [ Nguni ] .
Collins English Dictionary
" If we were the most beautiful , the most intelligent , the most wealthy , the most powerful person - and then found all of a sudden that we were alone on the planet , it would n't amount to a hill of beans , " said Mr Clinton .
The word comes from the Bantu languages spoken in southern Africa - and is related to a Zulu concept - " umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu " - which means that a person is only a person through their relationship to others .
And it 's entered the political lexicon through the political changes in South Africa .
Archbishop Desmond Tutu , in his book No Future Without Forgiveness , says : " Ubuntu is very difficult to render into a Western language ...
It is to say , ' My humanity is caught up , is inextricably bound up , in what is yours . ' "
Decline
In his definition , it means that there is a common bond between people - and when one person 's circumstances improve , everyone gains and if one person is tortured or oppressed , everyone is diminished .
Ubuntu chic - thong name - checking Ubuntu open - source software Mr Tutu 's identification with ubuntu has given rise to the idea of " ubuntu theology " - where ethical responsibility comes with a shared identity .
If someone is hungry , the ubuntu response is that we 're all collectively responsible .
There is a spiritual as well as practical dimension to this - with ubuntu reflecting the idea that we 're part of a long chain of human experience , connecting us to previous and future generations .
Ubuntu has also entered the language of development and fair trade - with campaigners using the word in aid projects for Africa in ways that suggest this will be an African solution for African problems .
Ironically , says Rob Cunningham , Christian Aid 's programme manager for South Africa , just as the word is taking off in Western society the values it embodies are in decline in the land of its origin .
" In my conversations with partner organisations and the communities they work with , and among older people , there 's a deep sense of loss of ubuntu , " says Mr Cunningham .
" To me , it means sitting down in a Zulu hut in KwaZulu - Natal sharing scarce food and a brew and a few stories . "
There are ubuntu education funds , ubuntu tents at development conferences , ubuntu villages , an ubuntu university - and it's now the name of an open - source operating system .
Expect to hear more from ubuntu in the future .
Add your comments on this story , using the form below .
Ubuntu is an excellent traditional as well as modern Africa worldview .
The concept has a powerful meaning and potential to transform the world into one of better understanding and respect for every human being - it is about treating others as we would to be treated .
It is about a sense of sharing , belong and togetherness including the fact that no human being is an island .
Thanks Bill for the timely advice to Labour and the world .
Dr. Kennedy Lweya , Haywards Heath
No man is an Island and a tree cannot make a forest so the saying goes in Bini , Edo state of Nigeria .
I strongly agree with former President Clinton in the use of the word Ubuntu .
Let us be our brothers ' keeper .
The fortunate should lend a helping hand to the unfortunate .
Unity is strength .
Omorodion Osula , Boston , USA
The essence and depth of ' ubuntu ' as a concept lies in the age - long African philosophy and practice of communalism and shared objectives .
You are your neighbours ' keeper .
With the emergence of ' western civilization ' we are increasingly becoming individualistic and competitive .
Capitalism and the philosophy of every person for himself is a challenge for ubuntu .
We are all extricably linked and if you buy into the philosophy of ubuntu then I have your back and you have mine .
I am because you are - togetherness is it .
Lawrence Mba , Toronto , Canada " Umuntu " is a concept that the west struggles to grasp .
People in the West are so individualistic , whereas in Africa its all about community .
In Africa you cannot seperate yourself from your community .
For example , I am from Highfield , Harare Zimbabwe , and I grew up knowing about 95 % of my neighbors , all the way up to six streets down .
I am now a student in the USA and I hardly know the people that stay next door .
Muchengetwa Bgoni , Missouri , USA Ubuntu is at the heart of the South African truth and reconciliation process .
The term Ubuntu , according to Tutu , has perhaps its equivalent in Western world : ¿ I think therefore I am . ¿
The Ubuntu version of this same concept would be translated as ¿ I am human because I belong .
I participate , I share .¿
Ubuntu embraces the worst in the other with the awareness that I would have done the same evil if I were in their shoes .
It comes from the grim realisation that in as much as people are capable of doing good , there is always a danger of an evil force that works at various levels possessing people and making them do things that they would not normally do .
Dawit Yehualashet , Ethiopian in Goshen , IN , USA Was n't it his wife who said , also from an African proverb , " It takes a village to raise a child " ?
Maybe it all depends how you define Ubuntu !
Anthony J. Ipie , La Paz I prefer
Thatcher 's folksy speech .
' There is no such thing as society . '
I wonder if Clinton referenced ubuntu to Hillary after his heavy dose of it whilst president .
Dylan , London Bill Clinton says get into Ubuntu , just a second I 've CD with it on in my bag .
Yup here it is " Ubuntu - linux for human beings " .
Bill Gates ai n't going to like this .

Can you picture yourself walking into the neighborhood pharmacy with prescriptions for ecstasy ( MDMA ) and psilocybin ?
If MAPS ( Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies ) has its way , the days of prescription psychedelics may not be too far away .
For those who know the history of psychedelic research , this eventuality has been a long time coming .
But others — who may only be familiar with the intense emotions and activities around the " War On Drugs " over the past several decades — may be surprised to learn how much progress MAPS has made .
Jag Davies is the Director of Communications for MAPS , a non-profit research and education organization that assists scientists to design , obtain approval for , fund , conduct and report on research into the healing and spiritual potentials of psychedelics and marijuana .
He joined Steve Robles , Jeff Diehl and myself on The RU Sirius Show Let it be said that Mr. Davies has the patience of a saint ( and a sense of humor ) .
Despite the fact that we were unable to resist the urge to crack drug jokes throughout , Jag managed to convey vast quantities of important information about psychedelic research .
We should all drink a toast !
You have some good news about marijuana research .
Why do n't you share some of that stuff with us ?
Sure .
We just found out on February 12 that a DEA administrative law judge ruled in favor of MAPS in our lawsuit against the DEA.
MAPS would like to design and fund and do the FDA clinical trials necessary to get marijuana approved as a prescription medicine .
It 's never been put through the FDA clinical trials to see if it meet the standards for safety and efficacy of any other drug under certain conditions .
The reason that has n't happened is because the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) has a monopoly on the supply of research - grade marijuana .
It 's the only Schedule 1 controlled substance where the federal government has a monopoly on the production .
So what MAPS has been trying to do for the past six years is start an independent medical marijuana production facility .
We 're working with professor Lyle Craker , who 's the director of the medicinal plant program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst .
He had no history of working with marijuana , but he 's a very well rounded botanist .
In 2001 , we sent NIDA an application , and first they took a year to tell us they had lost it .
Their primary strategy is delay .
( Laughs )
And then they took another three years to reject it .
And when they reject an application , there is a formal process where you can request a hearing with a DEA Administrative Law Judge .
But the DEA 's power is so unchecked that even once the ruling is decided in your favor , they can reject it .
So there was this two - year hearing .
We were represented by the ACLU and some Washington D.C. law firms .
And the case took about two years for the judge to rule on our side .
But now the DEA can still decide whether to accept or reject the recommendation .
So there 's still a lot more work to be done .
But it was an 87 - page recommendation .
The judge rebuked all of the DEA 's arguments and explained why NIDA needs to stop obstructing legitimate scientific research .
So it 's very exciting .
The DEA is famous for ignoring their administrative judges .
I remember their Administrative Judge made a strong ruling against making Ecstasy Schedule One in the ' 80s .
And they proceeded to completely ignore it .
The DEA is the Politburo of America .
It sounds like you guys are trying to unhook a little Catch 22 there .
You can have marijuana experiments , but you can't have the marijuana to do the experiments .
Yeah .
Well , you can't do FDA - approved research without the legal supply , and the only legal supply for research would come from NIDA .
So once you get a study approved by the FDA , then you have to go through an entirely separate review process , through NIDA and PHS ( Public Health Service ) , which is part of Health and Human Services .
They have three to six months to respond .
By contrast , the FDA has thirty days to respond .
And there 's no formal appeals process .
So they basically can arbitrarily decide what they want to do .
Is it MAPS policy that marijuana should only be available through a prescription ?
Not in the long - term .
Our long - term goal is to regulate all drugs for different uses , because we do n't think drug prohibition works .
It 's not sound public policy .
But our strategy for the foreseeable future — at least for the next five to ten years — is working only on these medical cases , because that 's what the public is most comfortable with .
It 's really a strategic decision .
But we do n't think marijuana should be illegal for recreational purposes either .
But the problem is — going through agencies like NIDA is kind of like being in Germany in 1939 and asking Hitler for Passover off .
I mean , they 're beyond resistant — they 're hostile .
But Congress does control their funding .
So if there was a major political push from Congress … if they felt that there was really going to be a political backlash ...
In 1989 , DEA Administrative Law Judge Francis Young recommended that marijuana be re-scheduled to Schedule 3 .
And they did n' tdo it .
But that would have been much more drastic measure than what we 're trying to do .
We 're just trying to get them to allow for a research supply .
What we 're asking for is so conservative , really .
Are these DEA judges appointed ?
How do they get in their positions ? :
They 're appointed by the Department of Justice .
The DEA is part of the Department of Justice .
There does n't seem to be much percentage in being reasonable about pot for a politician .
Even though a lot of people smoke marijuana , there does n't seem to be a lot of people who feel strongly about it as an issue at the national level .
I always say it needs to be " Datelined " to appeal to the public .
Say somebody like Bob Dole is begging for medical marijuana while he 's rotting away from cancer .
You guys got support in this recent case from the Senators from Massachusetts — Ted Kennedy and John Kerry .
And we all know about John Kerry .
( OK , we do n't .
But I 've heard rumors that Kerry still tokes . ) :
Which explains how he fucked up in the last election .
I love pot , but … : " Whatever , man .
It 'll all work itself out . " ( Laughter ) : " I 'm not gonna let him kill my buzz . " ( Laughter ) We got 38 representatives to sign on to a letter of support before the judge made the ruling .
We 're headed for a bigger sign - on support letter in the Senate and we 've got a few months to formulate a political response .
In the '80s when Francis Young made his recommendations , there was hardly any political support .
The only organization doing any work was NORML , and they were small and had some issues .
There 's much more of an infrastructure now behind all of these different drug policy organizations that are going to help us .
And there are already 160 congresspeople that voted in favor of the Hinchey Medical Marijuana Amendment .
And there 's a former conservative Republican representative that is going to be lobbying in support of this case .
I can't say who it is .
We can't announce it for about a month .
( Laughs ) I can't say anything .
Bingo ! ( Laughter ) We got it first !
Is n't it the case that everybody is taking all these high - grade mood - altering pharmaceuticals now — all the anti-depressants — stuff that really has a strong effect on your daily functioning .
So it seems like it's a little bit more difficult to be against even the study of marijuana as a possible prescription substance .
Yeah , it 's like people are used to the concept . : … of " dosing , " basically .
As a culture , we 're pretty conscious of chemical mind alteration .
Let 's move on to ecstasy .
We 're going to do one drug at a time .
Should 've done that first !
It takes too long to kick in , man .
So a while back , MAPS got approval for a study in MDMA - assisted psychotherapy .
Where are we at with that ?
It 's almost over .
They 've treated 15 out of 20 patients .
It 's very slow .
There are lots of pre-conditions for the study because it 's such a controversial substance .
But the results are ridiculous .
Their CAPS score — ( CAPS is the Clinician Administered PTSD [ post - traumatic stress disorder ] Scale ) is about five times higher than in treating chronic treatment - resistant patients with Zoloft .
It 's very likely that we 're going to be able to go on to do our next set up studies —
Phase III studies .
And there are a whole other slew of studies that are sort of copying this one that we 're doing in a bunch of other places like Switzerland , and Israel , just to be sure .
So does it look like MDMA is going to become something that 's used pharmaceutically ?
After careful analysis , we decided that MDMA is probably the most likely of any psychedelic drug to get approved .
First of all , it has a very gentle sort of pharmacological profile .
But the other reason is sort of interesting .
People ask us , " Why do n't you try MDE or MDA , drugs without the same cultural connotation . "
It would be easier politically .
But because it was so demonized by the government in the 1980s and 1990s , there has been hundreds of millions of dollars of research done into its risks .
So they 've done all the work for us !
You mentioned a comparison to Zoloft , the implication being that MDMA could be an effective anti-depressant .
The difference is that MDMA is not used on a daily basis .
That 's why there 's not a profit incentive .
But what would the prescription be — once a month ?
Or ten sessions ?
They did n't dose them daily in the study ?
No , not at all .
They do about 15 regular psychotherapy sessions .
And then with two or three of them , depending on the study , there are sessions where the person takes either a placebo or the MDMA .
It 's very methodologically rigorous .
It 's double - blind and you do n't know if you got the placebo or not .
With something like Ritalin , you have to keep taking it every day or every week or whatever .
With MDMA , or a psychedelic drug that you use in conjunction with therapy , which is how we 're trying to get it approved , you would only use it maybe five times at the most .
So the incentive to make money is n't there .
What kind of dosage did they use ?
Was it comparable to a street hit ?
Actually , it 's a bit larger than a street hit .
It 's 125 milligrams pure .
And then we actually got approval about halfway through the study to make a couple of changes .
One of them was to take a booster dose , basically , although we call it a " supplemental " dose .
They take another 60 milligrams about an hour and half into it .
You 're not calling it " a bump " ?
( Laughter )
It 's been easier to do studies in Europe for a while , has n't it ?
I seem to remember that stuff was happening in one of the Scandinavian countries in the early '90s .
There 's been work in Switzerland , although not with psychotherapy .
And we just got a study that 's already ongoing in Switzerland with MDMA - assisted psychotherapy for post - traumatic stress disorder .
And then there 's another study that 's about to get approved this year for LSD - assisted psychotherapy for end - of - life anxiety .
And that would be the first LSD psychotherapy study , or the first real study looking at LSD 's benefits at all , anywhere in the world .
Most of the countries in Europe do n't have a drug war at the level of intensity that we have here .
There have been some experiments allowed , and there have been various levels of drug decriminalization in a lot of countries .
In Amsterdam and London , you can buy mushrooms quasi-legally .
So why are n't we hearing about how their societies have been changed by the relative freedom to experiment with psychedelic drugs ?
Why are n't we hearing , " Wow .
Look at what 's happening here .
Everybody 's so enlightened !
" Well , things are better .
At least as far as drug prohibition - related harm goes , it 's a lot better .
Their prison populations are incredibly lower .
But I think more people use marijuana and psychedelics in the U.S. than in those countries .
Just because they 're legal , that does n't mean more people are using them .
A few days ago , I saw an item in the newspaper which said that people are now abusing more prescription drugs than illegal drugs in America .
That 's a result of the war on drugs .
Yeah , vastly many more people die every year from prescription drugs in America than from illegal drugs , even despite the harm that 's caused by all the misinformation about illegal drugs . : I 've heard that Spain was doing some Ecstasy research .
The first MDMA - assisted psychotherapy study in the world was sponsored by MAPS and approved in 2001 in Madrid .
It started but was shut down by the Madrid anti-drug authorities after there were positive reports in the press .
There 's nothing worse than good news to the medical establishment .
We 've been trying to start a study up there again .
In the mean time , we 've got studies approved in Charleston , South Carolina , at Harvard , in Switzerland , and in Israel .
So we think it 's a bit more politically feasible now .
Spain might be able to swallow it … so to speak .
I interviewed ( MAPS President ) Rick Doblin about a decade ago about the relationship between MAPS and the FDA .
And there was a loosening up about psychedelic research within the FDA that had n't occurred since the 1960s .
It started actually under Bush I in the ' 80s and continued under the Clinton administration .
Has the relationship with the FDA changed ?
The FDA continues to be very supportive .
Since 1990 , the FDA has been supportive of our protocols .
The problems have really come more from the DEA and NIDA .
In order to do any study , you need approval from the DEA to have a schedule 1 license to actually possess the drug for the study .
It 's usually been the DEA that has held everything up , because the FDA is more based around science , and the DEA is based more around criminal justice and law enforcement .
Very few people know that in the middle of all the drug hysteria , the FDA had started to allow these kinds of experiments to begin .
It 's kind of amazing .
When I skim the MAPS site , I see all this stuff about approved protocols and activities that are going to lead up to tests , and then maybe an occasional test .
But has there been any results ?
Well , yeah , there have been some results .
We finished the Phase I MDMA studies .
There 's three phases to FDA approval .
The Phase I studies are the safety studies , and those took quite a long time .
The Phase II studies are n't finished yet , though .
And we did studies with vaporizers and marijuana .
For example , we found that water pipes are worse for your lungs than smoking a joint .
When that news came out I just about cried .
We 've done all sorts of background research too .
We did survey studies about LSD and cluster headaches and about what happens when you hook people on Ayahuasca up to EEGs .
The background research sort of assembles the literature needed to get these drugs approved as prescription medicines .
That 's really our main focus — getting the drugs approved rather than just doing basic science .
The big news item last year was about results from psilocybin experiments conducted at John Hopkins .
A New York Times headline read : " Mushroom Drugs Produce Mystical Experiences . "
Next they 'll be telling us that bears shit in the woods . : " Beans cause gas in humans .
"
You guys were n't directly involved in this one , right ?
No , we did n't sponsor that study .
That study was amazing .
This team of researchers has a different approach than MAPS .
They kept their entire protocol secret and kept it totally hidden from the media right until the day of publication .
This was sort of basic background science research on mystical experiences .
And they actually used grant money from NIDA for the study .
NIDA disavowed the study afterwards .
The former director of NIDA , Bob Schuster , wrote one of the commentaries for it .
He said it was great .
He loved it , but of course the current director of NIDA could n't go along with that .
So they sort of issued a rebuke saying , " Do n't listen to this .
" Do you hear about this a lot ?
Has this changed the culture around moving this work forward ?
It was all over the media .
Yeah , I think it definitely helped legitimize psychedelic research .
They were basically doing one of Timothy Leary 's studies from the early 1960s over again .
It was the follow - up on a study that was done in the 1960s called " The Good Friday Experiment " where they gave psilocybin to divinity students at a chapel somewhere in Boston .
And they had them fill out all these questionnaires and asked them about whether or not they had any mystical experiences .
They found that most of them had the most mystical experience of their lives .
So the John Hopkins Study actually sort of repeated that same methodology with a new group of subjects who were n't familiar with the drug .
But they were n't divinity students were they ?
No , I think they were a more general population .
On this show a few weeks ago , we were talking about Ibogaine as a cure for heroin addiction .
What data do we have now about Ibogaine ?
We have a study approved that 's just starting right now .
It has full government approval in Vancouver .
Ibogaine is illegal in the U.S. , but it 's legal in Canada and Mexico .
So we 're sponsoring an observational case study of patients treated at the Iboga Therapy House in Vancouver .
No one 's actually done the long - term follow - up research to see whether – six months or two years later — people relapse into using opiates or not , and whether they relapse in a way that 's dangerous .
All we have at this point are various anecdotal reports .
We 're doing a similar study at a clinic in Mexico .
It lasts , like , 24 to 36 hours .
The last 12 hours people report feeling sort of physically paralyzed .
It 's a very intense experience so you have to really want to do it to do it .
If you think Ayahuasca is not fun ... The government has n't really had to fight it off because it has n't spread recreationally .
I heard a story on " This American Life " about a guy who was administering Ibogaine treatments to junkies that he knew , because he himself had been a junkie .
And it was underground .
He was n't a doctor .
He did n't have any medical training .
He just started a program and tried to develop it but somebody died under his treatment .
And he kind of went off the deep end because he felt so guilty about encouraging this guy to take Ibogaine who died .
Is Ibogaine dangerous ?
Compared to other psychedelics , it does interact badly with certain dangerous pre-conditions because it lasts for so long .
People with heart problems should n't take it — people with really high blood pressure .
But there are tons of people like that all around the country – these sort of underground therapists who have been practicing with Ibogaine .
A lot of the people support MAPS .
They want to be able to use it above ground as part of their practice .
Unfortunately , this guy was n't even a therapist or anything .
He was just kind of an ex-junkie who'd gone straight and wanted to …... help his friends .
How many of those people would have died from heroin overdoses ?
Speaking of dangerous drugs , I was watching cable news one day when one of those screen crawls went by , and it said something like " Research finds low doses of ketamine effective for depression . "
Do you know anything about this ?
Yeah .
A study that was funded by the National Institute on Mental Health showed very promising results for ketamine as an anti-depressant .
I think the media portrayal was a bit over - optimistic because Ketamine has its drawbacks – some people see drawbacks in daily dosing because it can cause dependence .
But then again , so do the psychiatric drugs that are being approved today .
And ketamine was showing much better results than those .
Do you know what the dosage level was on those experiments ?
I know it was very low .
They were functioning doses , not K - Hole doses .
Most other psychedelics we study do n't have ... like , no one 's ever died from an LSD overdose . :
And believe me .... ( Laughs ) I 'm sure some people have tried !
Do you ever watch the TV show " House " ?
This doctor is always taking all kinds of drugs .
He 's a vicodin addict for one thing .
On one episode , he gives himself a cluster headache and then injects acid to cure it .
The show is actually very smart about drugs .
Anyway , what 's up with LSD and psilocybin as a cure for cluster headaches ?
I 'll give you a bit of background .
Cluster headaches are a type of migraine that lasts for weeks at a time .
They 're really difficult to treat .
I 've read that up to a fifth of people with cluster headaches end up committing suicide because it 's so difficult to treat and so painful .
A few years ago , people started noticing that taking threshold doses of psilocybin and LSD at regular intervals would break their cluster headache cycle .
And it was the only thing that would do it .
So we did a survey study that 's finished and now there 's a study that 's been approved at Harvard .
So all these people who would n't use psychedelics otherwise have been using the drug to treat their cluster headaches .
Do they feel any psychedelic effect ?
Yeah , some people do it in slightly sub-psychedelic doses but it can still have the effect .
Do they start believing in UFOs ?
( Laughs )
As software developers , we 're great at communicating with computers .
But we 're typically not so great at communicating with other people .
Esther Schindler 's recent interview with Steve McConnell illustrates how this aspect of our personality tends to work against us :
Marketers , sales staff , and upper management all tend to be better negotiators than technical staff , so when marketing ( or whoever ) says " get it done , " technical staff ends up losing that negotiation .
But it is n't really the technical staff that loses .
The business loses , because it sets up a situation in which it pretends for months or years that it can do something that it can't .
We present our best estimates , but we are n't assertive enough to stand up for them .
Because we do n't fight for our estimates , we get negotiated down to an untenable position :
Executives and managers tend by nature to be more assertive than rank - and - file technical staff , which is not a problem .
The problem is that they assume , incorrectly , that technical staff will be assertive with them if they need to be , and that is n't the case .
Technical staff often feel that they 're being very assertive , but an objective observer would probably say the technical people cave in far too easily .
Business executives with non-technical backgrounds do n't have any objective ability to judge the analytical validity of an estimate , so they probe the person they 're talking with to see where they hit that person 's point of discomfort , and they make an assessment based on that .
Technical people who do n't push back hard enough , soon enough , are implicitly sending a message that they can do more than they really can .
When I talk with executives , I emphasize that they need to account for the fact that technical people are intimidated by them .
Most executives assume the people around them are as assertive as they are , but that is n't true – there 's a reason that they 're executives !
Assertiveness does n't have to mean loudmouthed and obnoxious .
Nor is assertiveness " getting all up in someone 's face " .
Assertiveness is , quite simply , the ability to convey your position to others as an equal participant in the conversation .
Dr. John Welford explains :
To be assertive is not , as some people imagine , to be overbearing and aggressive , but to be straightforward , open and honest .
It means that you relate well to people , able to express your needs freely , take responsibility for your feelings and stand up for yourself when necessary .
In conflict situations you seek , where possible , to reach a ' win - win ' outcome , in which the needs of all parties are fully acknowledged .
I 'm reasonably assertive , to the point that I 've found myself interceding on behalf of my teammates .
But I really should n't do that .
I should encourage them to stick up for themselves , instead .
If you 'd like to be more assertive , I recommend starting with Dale Carnegie 's classic book How to Win Friends and Influence People .
Dale 's central thesis is truly timeless : show a genuine interest in the people you meet , and you 'll find it reciprocated tenfold .
It 's the kind of book you should re-read every year , and it 's short enough to make that possible .
Beyond the Carnegie book , it 's clear that being technologically savvy is n't enough .
It 's important to cultivate your negotiation skills and assertiveness , too , if for no other reason than to avoid being easy meat at your next salary review .
One of my friends took the initiative to sign up for a public speaking class .
Improv classes would also work .
What are you doing to improve your assertiveness ?
Tornado Ravaged Greensburg , Kansas : Kansas Mutual Aid Relief Workers forced out of city by policeSaturday May 19 , 2007by Dave StranoOn Saturday May 19 , five members and volunteers affiliated with KansasMutual Aid , a Lawrence based class struggle anarchist collective , made thetrek back to Greensburg to again help in relief efforts in the tornadoravaged city .
A week earlier , four KMA members had traveled to Greensburgon a fact finding mission to assess the situation there .
What KMA membersfound was a militarized , entirely destroyed city where relief efforts weremoving tragically slow .
Today 's trip back to Greensburg by KMA members and volunteers was intendedto solidify the bonds we had created in the first trip , and establish abase of operations for future relief efforts .
KMA spent the morningworking on a house with members of AmeriCorps , and then proceeded to meetwith contacts with the Mennonite Disaster Services .
We then headed out of town to a church just outside of city limits that wewere told would be a place we could probably set up a base camp for ourwork .
The church had been converted into a fire station by the state , sowe continued down the road and met a farmer who was willing to work withus and let us use his land .
Soon after meeting the farmer , we were approached by officers with the Dickinson County Sheriff 's Department .
After a brief exchange , theofficers left , and we were told to report to the Kiowa County Emergency Response Command Post to receive official permission to set up our base ofoperations .
We were notified that if we did not do so , we would riskhaving our operation ceased by the state .
Two of our delegation went to the Command Post , while the other three ofus went to the County Courthouse to pick up som water and provisions beingoffered by the Red Cross .
While we were picking up water and food , I wasapproached by an Olathe Police Officer named Ty Moeder who knew my faceand identity .
I was ordered to take my hands out of my pockets and followthe officer to a side street " to avoid making a scene " .
I and the other people with me followed the officer , and were repeatedlyordered to keep our hands out of our pockets , where they could be seen bythe officer .
Soon more officers approached , as well as at least one memberof the Kansas Bureau of Investigation , and some people from FEMA .
Surrounded by agents of the state , we were ordered to produce ouridentification .
When I asked the police why we were being detained , Officer Moederresponded " We need to check to see if you are affiliated with theanarchists . "
At this moment , our remaining two comrades approached to seewhat was happening .
They were detained as well , and made to produce theiridentification .
Officer Moeder asked how we had gotten in to the city .
" We drove in , " someone replied .
" They were n't supposed to let you in at the road block , " responded Moeder , seemingly frustrated and perplexed by that answer .
" They even gave us a day pass to drive in and out , " we shot back .
A waiting game ensued for the next several minutes , with more officersapproaching , now numbering almost fifteen .
A Lawrence police officerapproached , and was ordered to take photos of the car we had driven thatwas parked down the street .
Officer McNemee from the Lawrence PoliceDepartment took extensive photos of the car , even of the inside contentsof the vehicle .
Officer Moeder ordered me to step away from the rest of the relief workersand speak with him .
" You 're being ordered to leave and not return .
This is not negotiable , not appealable .
You can't change it .
If you return you 'llbe arrested on site .
And believe me , you do n't want to push that rightnow .
This system is pretty messed up , and you would n't be issued bail .
You 'd disappear in the system .
" I asked repeatedly what we had done and why we were being ordered to leavethe city .
" You 're part of a dangerous anarchist group that will only drainour security resources , " he responded .
" We 've been monitoring your websiteand e-mails , we know what kind of agenda you have .
" " So this is about our political beliefs ? " I asked .
" No , " he responded .
" This is about you being federal security threats .
Kansas Mutual
Aid is not welcome in this city , end of story .
I know youare going through legitimate means to work in the city , and you 're storyseems picture perfect , but we know who you are , and you 're not allowedhere .
"
We were ordered back into our car and escorted out of the city by severalpolice vehicles with their lights flashing , and left just outside thecity .
We returned to Lawrence just moments ago , unhindered in our resolve toprovide support to the people in the disaster area .
We will continue towork in whatever capacity we can in the areas around the city that we maystill be allowed into , and provide support to those entering the city .
The area is a police state , to be certain .
Police and Law Enforcement fromacross Kansas and the country are making the rules about everything .
Relief workers were banned from Greensburg today because of theirpolitical beliefs and work against oppression and tyrannical statecontrol .
A longer , more in depth update with an announcement for future action willcome soon .
Please spread this story far and wide .
In love and solidarity , Dave StranoKansas Mutual Aid

Marlowe Treit was driving his dream car -- a flawless 1985 Lamborghini Countach -- on a road through the Aurora Airport last spring when something went horribly wrong .
A Cessna had collided with Treit 's black Lamborghini , slicing into the exotic car and badly mangling one side .
The front propeller churned up the driver 's side of Treit 's prized car -- the one he bought in 1998 as a 60th birthday present to himself after spending two years looking for the perfect model .
Treit walked away from the collision without any injuries , but his car has n't been driven since .
He estimates the crash did about $ 100,000 in damage .
And what about that Cessna ?
Turns out a trio of FBI agents were in the plane , which was leased by the feds .
Two of the federal agents , John Jeffries and Robert Brockmeyer , were co-piloting the plane that day in May 2006 , according to federal court filings .
The agents were on a " familiarization flight , " according to the National Transportation Safety Board 's report on the incident .
One of the agents wrote in a report filed with the NTSB that the plane was " moving down the taxiway about to enter our hangar area , moving at about a fast walk and crossing a narrow inner taxiway perpendicular to us when the aircraft crunched to a sudden stop .
" Out the left side window of the aircraft I saw a small black sports car dart from under the prop moving to my left , gushing fluid , " the unidentified agent wrote .
Treit , a licensed pilot , says he had the right of way and that the pilot should have spotted him .
Treit , who lives in Aurora and owns a business at the small airport , this month filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government , accusing the pilots of negligence .
He is asking for $ 105,500 in damages .

A spokeswoman for the FBI 's Portland field office declined to comment about the incident , citing the lawsuit .
The NTSB concluded that Treit and the agents shared blame for the wreck .
Investigators said both failed " to maintain an adequate visual lookout and their failure to see and avoid one another . "
Treit describes the accident below :

When I started my first " real job , " I did n't realize how many situations I 'd find myself in that were utterly different from most of what I 'd encountered before .
On top of learning the tasks specific to the job , I had to navigate office politics , figure out what it meant to be " professional , " and make decisions about these things on the fly with only my intuition to guide me .
I made a few mistakes while I figured it out , but eventually I learned to survie , thrive , and make my boss love me .
While I 'm still no expert , what I offer here are solutions to common problems that have worked for me .
Note :
These suggestions will be particularly relevant to entry - level positions , but could be useful at other times , as well .
Make Your Boss Love You When You 've Finished a Project
Let him know you 're thinking about the future .
Either ask him , " So , what 's next ? " or let him know you 'll be needing some time to get things together before he approaches you with the next project .
Something like , " I 'm getting ready for the next project .
Could we talk about it in an hour / this afternoon / tomorrow / next week after I tie up some loose ends ?
I 've been focusing on getting this done but want to make sure I have n't let anything fall through the cracks . "
Both approaches let him know that you 're focused on what is best for the company , and the second also makes you look responsible while also taking a short break .
Make Your Boss Love You When She 's Pointing Out Little Mistakes
Remember that pointing out your small mistakes is part of her job , and it may be as distasteful to her as it is to you .
If the criticism is particularly difficult for you to hear , remember to breathe before you say anything .
A deep breath or so , when done surrepitiously , can give you the strength to respond calmly .
Then , if it 's appropriate , defend yourself .
If her criticism is just , nod as she speaks .
Tell her , " Thank you for showing me how you would prefer this to be done / how this should be done / whatever . "
If she persists , or is talking to you about something for the Nth time , say , " This seems to be something that you want me to work on / I should work on .
Are there any resources available to help me improve ? "
Whether you need to be on time , make the webpage load faster , or something else , it 's hard for a boss to fault an employee who wants to change .
If she points you in a direction , follow through !
Make Your Boss Love You When You 're Swamped and He Wants You to Do More
Be honest about what you can do .
Most supervisors appreciate hearing when their people are overworked and stressed .
If he likes up front , honest people , say , " You know , I 'd be happy to take that on , but realistically I wo n't be able to get to it until I finish with X , Y , and Z . Will that work for you ? "
He may take it to someone else , or he may give it to you , but either way he knows what he 's looking at .
If he 's going to lay it on you no matter what you say , try , " I 'll take that on .
Right now , I 'm working on P , D , and Q .
Where does this fall in priority relative to those ? "
With this , he knows where he stands and what you have on your plate , and he can determine when you get to it .
Make Your Boss Love You When You 've Made a Big Mistake
If you can't fix it before she would find out , be the first to let her know .
Swallow the butterflies and make your weak knees walk to her office ( or write that email ) .
Most of the time she 's going to find out anyway , so you 're only prolonging the agony and creating a ton of anxiety for yourself if you do n't tell her .
Your poise and honesty will also make an impression , even if she 's upset and there are consequences .
At the very least , she 'll have a positive sense of your integrity for any future recommendations .
And you might save your job .
Make Your Boss Love You When You 're Interviewing for a New Job
In a few companies , interviewing for a new job is considered tantamount to treason .
If you work for one of those companies , keep your search under the table , but do n't lie if you 're asked directly .
You might be asked to leave , but they wo n't be able to fault your integrity in a recommendation .
But if you work for most companies ( or , at least , most of the ones I 've experienced / heard about ) , just be honest .
If you 're valuable where you are , you would be surprised how many times your boss will do all she can to get you a counter - offer .
If she can't or if she has some other motivation to not re-hire you , she will appreciate not being blind - sided when you turn in your notice .
Google code search : A vulnerability hunters dream October 7 , 2006
Posted by Imran Ghory in Computer Security
Google code search : A vulnerability hunters dream ?
– well maybe not , but if a hacker wants to compromise random machines rather then particular targets then Google ’s making finding new exploits ever easier .
Google ’s latest search tool has made it incredibly easy to take one particular vulnerability which has a fairly recognizable signature and search vasts amounts of code for it .
And to prove it here are some examples :
( Some of these are derivative of various suggestions posted on reddit )
For starters lets have a look for programs that run setuid / setgid and copy strings from environment variables without even verifying the lengths ( hence providing an easy buffer overflow exploit ) :
In a similar vain code that takes an environment variable passed to it by a web - browser before sticking it in an SQL query ( thus allowing SQL query injection attacks ) :
How about code which uses the unsafe chmod command ( chmod is bad due to non-atomicity , code normally checks the file has some properties first before chmoding it – however due to the fact that the checking is a separate operation from the chmoding a hacker could replace the file with a symlink after the check but before the file has been chmod – hence allowing them to change the permissions on arbitrary files ) :
Or a similar race condition which can be used to create havoc , this time the mktemp ( ) function – which creates a temporary file with a predictable name ( so what happens if someone else gets there first with a symlink … . ) .
I think the scariest so far is the number of mid-to - large size projects which show up for this following search ( where an input is read from a file into a fixed size buffer without a limit being put on the amount of data being read in ) :
And somewhat more lightheartedly a look at all the programmers that are hard - core traditionalists when it comes to crypto :
So there you have it – vulnerabilities galore and just from a few minutes work .

Have n't played any of the games , so I had to rely on what little reference I could find .
Had to use a somwhat jaggy laptop mouse , so the rocky texture worked to my advatige I guess .

Happy New Year everybody !
Two new vitamin D studies using a sophisticated form of analysis called meta- analysis , in which data from multiple reports is combined , have revealed new prescriptions for possibly preventing up to half of the cases of breast cancer and two - thirds of the cases of colorectal cancer in the United States .
The work was conducted by a core team of cancer prevention specialists at the Moores Cancer Center at University of California , San Diego ( UCSD ) , and colleagues from both coasts .
The breast cancer study , published online in the current issue of the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , pooled dose - response data from two earlier studies – the Harvard Nurses Health Study and the St. George ’s Hospital Study – and found that individuals with the highest blood levels of 25 - hydroxyvitamin D , or 25 ( OH ) D , had the lowest risk of breast cancer .
The researchers divided the 1,760 records of individuals in the two studies into five equal groups , from the lowest blood levels of 25 ( OH ) D ( less than 13 nanograms per milliliter , or 13 ng / ml ) to the highest ( approximately 52 ng / ml ) .
The data also included whether or not the individual had developed cancer .
“ The data were very clear , showing that individuals in the group with the lowest blood levels had the highest rates of breast cancer , and the breast cancer rates dropped as the blood levels of 25 - hydroxyvitamin D increased , ” said study co-author Cedric Garland , Dr.P.H .
“ The serum level associated with a 50 percent reduction in risk could be maintained by taking 2,000 international units of vitamin D3 daily plus , when the weather permits , spending 10 to 15 minutes a day in the sun . ”
The colorectal cancer study , published online February 6 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine , is a meta - analysis of five studies that explored the association of blood levels of 25 ( OH ) D with risk of colon cancer .
All of the studies involved blood collected and tested for 25 ( OH ) D levels from healthy volunteer donors who were then followed for up to 25 years for development of colorectal cancer .
As with the breast cancer study , the dose - response data on a total of 1,448 individuals were put into order by serum 25 ( OH ) D level and then divided into five equal groups , from the lowest blood levels to the highest .
“ Through this meta - analysis we found that raising the serum level of 25 - hydroxyvitamin D to 34 ng / ml would reduce the incidence rates of colorectal cancer by half , ” said co-author Edward D. Gorham , Ph.D .
“ We project a two - thirds reduction in incidence with serum levels of 46ng / ml , which corresponds to a daily intake of 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 .
This would be best achieved with a combination of diet , supplements and 10 to 15 minutes per day in the sun . ”
Vitamin D3 is available through diet , supplements and exposure of the skin to sunlight , or ultraviolet B ( UVB ) .
In the paper , the researchers underscored the importance of limiting sun exposure such that the skin does not change color ( tan ) or burn .
For a typical fair - skinned Caucasian individual , adequate vitamin D could be photosynthesized safely by spending 10 to 15 minutes in the noontime sun on a clear day with 50 percent of skin area exposed to the sun .
Darker skinned individuals may require more time in the sun , such as 25 minutes .
For people with photosensitivity disorders , or anyone with a personal or family history of nonmelanoma skin cancer , any amount of extra sun exposure would be inadvisable .
The meta -analysis on colorectal cancer includes data from the Women ’s Health Initiative , which had shown in 2006 that a low dose of vitamin D did not protect against colorectal cancer within seven years of follow - up .
However , the researchers wrote , the meta - analysis indicates that a higher dose may reduce its incidence .
“ Meta - analysis is an important tool for revealing trends that may not be apparent in a single study , ” said co-author Sharif B. Mohr , M.P.H .
“ Pooling of independent but similar studies increases precision , and therefore the confidence level of the findings . ”

Make Your own Tire Sandals
Adapted from Participating in Nature : Wilderness Survival and Primitive Living Skills
I 'm hard on shoes .
It 's not uncommon for me to go through half a dozen pairs of shoes , or more , each year .
I maintain an active lifestyle , hiking , playing , camping , and working .
Water wears out a shoe quicker than anything else .
A few trips in and out of the creeks , puddles , and swamps , and they just come unglued .
If I do not happen to dissolve my shoes in water , then I wear out the soles on gravel .
It has always amazed me that tire companies can manufacture a tire and warranty the tread for some 50,000 miles , yet I can wear out the sole on any ordinary shoe in less than a year .
How come we cannot buy a shoe with a 50,000 mile warranty ?
Really , I have never been quite satisfied with conventional shoes , and it's not just because I wear them out so easily .
Mostly it is because I do a lot of camping , and ordinary shoes have a lot of drawbacks for this type of lifestyle .
For one thing , I tend to rot my feet out each summer .
Shoes are like incubators , holding in the dirt and sweat at warm temperatures , and culturing all kinds of fungus and bacteria .
Walking through a little bit of water once or twice a day just compounds the problem , making it nearly impossible to dry out the shoes .
My feet even rot when I take care of them , washing and drying my crusty socks each day .
While I am at it , I have other complaints too .
You see , I do a lot of primitive camping , building my own shelters , starting fires without matches , gathering wild foods -- that sort of thing .
To me this type of camping is a way of getting close to nature , by participating in nature , instead of merely camping in it .
I like to touch nature , and I feel so removed in a pair of ordinary shoes .
I go barefoot as much as I can , but like most people , I have tender feet -- because I do n't go bare foot all the time .
Moccasins are ideal for camping , at least to a point .
I can really feel the earth through them , and it has a profound psychological on me , making me feel so much more in tune with my surroundings .
The trouble with moccasins is they wear out -- fast .
It takes me about eight hours of physical labor to tan a deer hide , several more hours to stitch a pair of moccasins , and generally one or two days of hiking to wear the first hole in them .
The holes always start at the toughest points on your foot , so they are not initially a problem .
You can get several more days of hiking in before you have to stitch in a new sole .
Still , that is not a very long time at all .
I have heard that some Native Americans carried multiple pairs of moccasins on journeys and spent each evening around the campfire fixing them .
I may practice primitive camping , but I also have to face the modern realities of the clock .
My camping trips are typically short , and full .
I always have a lot of things I want to do while I am out .
Fixing my moccasins every day is not one of them .
To solve that problem , I have tried over the years many marriages between buckskin and rubber to make lasting soles on my moccasins .
The " paint - on " sole , a mixture of ground up tires and Barge Cement glue , does not work all that well .
It helps , but even that wears through quite quickly under harsh conditions , and the rubber coating makes it difficult to dry out the leather of the moccasins .
More so , they are not very patchable once a hole gets started .
I have also tried working with the " crepe soles " , a thick sheet of rubber cement that you can buy , cut , and glue to the bottoms of shoes .
The problem I had with these is that my foot no longer stayed in the right place on my moccasins .
My foot was typically sliding off the back edge of the sole .
After all these life - long problems with shoes , I was ecstatic to learn of something that actually did work .
My friend Jack Fee and I were preparing to go out on a three - week expedition in the mountains .
He made a new backpack for the trip , and I made some new moccasins .
The best idea I had left to try for protecting the soles was a mixture of pine pitch , charcoal , and dried manure .
I figured I could easily dope a little fresh material on the soles each night at camp to keep them from wearing out .
I thought I was on to something , and the finished sole even looked good .
Unfortunately , I wore completely through the pitch in two short city blocks , on a test run .
I was out of a plan before we had even begun our expedition .
Jack then told me a story about Indians from Mexico coming to the United States and winning foot races in sandals cut from tires .
I 've been interested in using tire soles before , but it seemed like I would have to glue or stitch the tire to the moccasins .
I had reason to doubt that it would work .
I also once had a pair of tire sandals , made in Mexico , where the leather lacing was nailed to the tire soles .
Those came apart within a couple of days .
Jack had never seen the tire sandals that were reportedly used by the Mexican Indians , but decided to see what he could do anyway .
I have to say I was quite impressed with the final product , a sort of Teva - style sandal .
I was most impressed with the fact that there was no glue , and no stitching or strapping on the bottom of the sole where they would be exposed to the ground .
Instead he cut the sole with some side tabs out of the tire as one contiguous piece .
The first model was a little crude in appearance , but was amazingly comfortable .
I too had to make a pair for the expedition .
The field tests of our sandals were quite exciting .
The tire sandal and moccasin combination meant we had " modular " shoes .
We wore both the moccasins and the soles when hiking , and then just one or the other around camp .
We could use just the moccasins for stalking , or just the tires for walking in water .
We climbed 10,000 foot peaks twice and generally just put on the miles .
I did not wear socks , and never washed my moccasins , but my feet were in healthy condition for the duration of the trip -- a first for me .
We did find that we would get blisters if we wore just the tires for any significant hiking , but we seemed to have no problems when the tires were worn in combination with moccasins , or with a couple pairs of heavy socks .
I was amazed at how comfortable these sandals were , particularly because I once wore conventional hiking boots on a 500 mile walk across Montana , with severe blistering for the first 250 miles of the trip .
Our new type of footwear gave me a freedom and comfort I had been searching for for a decade .
Our prototype sandals were crude , but effective .
Since then , I have developed the idea some more , into the tire sandals shown in these pictures .
The most significant modification was the addition of the tab at the very back of the sandals .
That tab is not normally necessary , except in water .
Without it your feet tend to slide forward off the front of the soles when the tires are wet .
That back tab holds your foot securely in place .
I also added the rubber buckles , and did away with the rope and buckskin ties of our early models .
Also for our prototypes we just traced around a pair of conventional Tevas onto a tire , and started from there .
I have since developed a system for creating a pattern to match your own foot .
Plan on spending most of an entire day making your first pair .
You will get faster as you make more .
Making Your Tire Sandals
First , place either foot in the center of a large piece of paper , at least an 8 1/2 x 14 .
Trace around your foot , being careful at all times to keep the pencil straight up and down .
Next make a mark on each side , directly down from the point on your ankles ( A ) ( see pattern at the end of this web page ) .
Also make a mark at the point along the inside of your foot , directly back from your big toe ( B ) .
Remove your foot from the pattern .
Now sketch a bigger outline around the tracing of your foot .
Add about 3/8 inch for the toes and sides , but not to the back .
Then use a ruler and bisect the pattern lengthwise , extending the line three inches past the heel .
This serves as a guide to help you sketch the rear tab accurately .
Now connect the marks you made by your ankles ( A ) , extending a line three inches beyond each side of the pattern .
These tabs will be sketched in front of this line .
Also draw a line for the front tabs , extending from the single mark ( B ) across the pattern , perpendicular to the line that bisects the foot lengthwise .
The positioning of all these tabs is quite variable , and you can choose to move them forward or back , or at angles to one another , and all usually work , although the arrangement I have suggested may work more consistently .
Problems usually arise with the front set of tabs .
When at angles across the pattern they can twist a little and dig into your foot .
If the tabs are moved forward or back then the edges can dig into that point ( B ) on the inside of your foot .
That point is more pronounced on some people 's feet than on others .
Now sketch in the five tabs , as shown on the pattern .
These tabs are sized width - wise for 3/ 4 inch wide strapping , and should be made according to the approximate dimensions I 've written in on the pattern , regardless of how big or small the foot .
If anything you might make some adjustments length - wise , adjusting for particularly large or small feet .
Finally , sketch in the holes that you will cut out to thread the strapping through .
This just helps you remember to cut them the right direction when you get to that stage .
Cut the pattern out , and it can be used for both sandals , assuming your feet are fairly similar to one another .
As for tires , I would recommend truck tires , rather than car tires .
The " corner " of any tire , where the sidewalls and tread come together , is always much thicker than the rest .
You can work with that thickness in the tabs of the sandals , but not in the sole itself .
Pickup tires are typically wide enough to work with , and you can make about three pair of sandals from one tire .
Most importantly , always use tires that do not have steel cables running through them .
All tires have some kind of fibrous reinforcement in them , typically nylon or rayon threads .
Most of the newer tires also have a layer of steel cables , which is not workable at all .
Still , there are a few billion of the older tires around without steel cables , so you should not have to look too far to find some .
Just look on the sidewalls of the tire and it will be printed there how many plies of nylon , rayon , or steel are imbedded in the rubber .
We used simple utility knives to cut out our first sandals .
Doing it this way you can trace around the pattern on the outside of the tire and start cutting .
However , I must say this is very laborious and not much fun .
It is hard work , and you could easily slip and cut yourself with the utility knife .
Along the way I have discovered that it is much easier and more enjoyable to cut tires using sharp wood chisels or a bandsaw .
To do the chisel or bandsaw method you must first remove a section of tire .
This allows you to run the piece through the bandsaw , or to put it on a wooden block , where you can chisel from the inside out .
A circular saw works fairly well for cutting tires , except that it creates a lot of blue - black smoke , and binds frequently .
Cut out a piece that is at least a half inch longer than your pattern , and save as much of the sidewalls as you reasonably can .
These are useful later for making the buckles .
Do not try cutting through the inner edge of the tire , which has an imbedded steel band to fit the tire snug against the rim .
Now , trace the pattern on the inside of the tire , being certain that the pattern is centered and straight on the tire .
Even a slight 1 /2 inch angle along the length of a sandal can cause problems when you wear it .
I 've done separate tests , cutting out the sandals with chisels and with a bandsaw , and the bandsaw method is only a little faster .
A good set of wood chisels works just fine if you do not have the bandsaw .
I would suggest making only one sandal at a time , and completing it .
Finish the one and try it on ; you might think of some modifications to improve the next one .
Few of my pairs of sandals are exactly identical , as I usually find some new idea to try on that second sandal .
The next step , after cutting out the sandal , is to thin the four side tabs .
The tabs are generally cut from that " corner " on the tire , where there is a thick lump of tread .
These are easiest to thin on a bandsaw .
You can , however , do a crude but adequate job by cutting the lump down with some careful chiseling or with a sharp knife .
Thin down as close as you can to the nylon / rayon plies , without actually cutting any of them .
This step is not easy by any method I have found , and I typically leave 1/8 to 1/4 inch of rubber covering the plies , for a total thickness of up to half an inch .
That is still quite thick , but thin enough to work .
Now , to make the tabs flex upward , take a razor blade and slice straight into the tread of the tire at the joint where the tab attaches .
Slice in all the way until the plies inside are exposed .
Be careful not to cut into those fibers .
Chisel out each of the eyelets , where the strapping will be threaded through .
For this I use a 1 inch chisel and a 1/4 inch chisel .
Be careful to not cut too close to the edge .
If you break out the side of a tab , then you generally have to start all over .
Also cut a set of buckles from the sidewalls of the tire .
These are easy to do .
For strapping , I use a sort of a nylon harness strapping , available at farm and ranch supply stores .
3/4 inch wide strapping works well with the one inch slots .
Cut pieces that are extra long , you can trim them off after you thread them through .
Use a match , and melt the end of the nylon strap to secure the threads .
To do the back strap , thread through the hole marked point ( C ) on the pattern and stitch an inch or so of the strap back on itself .
Thread around through the other eyelets , through the buckle , through the other hole on the first tab , and once again through the buckle .
The front strap should be threaded through the buckle , through both eyelets , and back through the buckle again .
This system is a little hard to adjust , but once set , I find I can slip my foot in and out , without having to tighten or loosen them .
The finished sandals should be comfortable to wear , although you may need to do some fine - tuning to get them right .
For any serious hiking you should wear a couple heavy pairs of socks , or moccasins , or bring along some moleskin .
Hi ,
Just read your interesting article on making sandals out of rubber tires .
We did that in Germany after WW2 because there were no shoes one could buy for years .
As a 14 year old I made a pair that I wore all year ( hiking all over the Alps and over glaciers in them during summer vacation ) , from 1946 to 1949 , when one was able to buy a pair of real shoes once again .
The straps were cut from my old worn out " Lederhosen " .
They were inserted into slits sliced into the sides of the sole ( below the fabric belt ) , and fastened with twine that we threaded through holes melted into the rubber with a needle that was heated in a flame .
That was not necessary if one had a big enough needle , or pliers to force the needle through .
To secure the straps even better , we made some rubber cement by soaking some gum rubber in gasoline until the rubber was dissolved - took about three days , if I remember correctly .
We did n't have utility knives so I used an old hacksaw blade that I honed to a razor edge .
All that probably wo n't interest you , but the way we cut the rubber was so easy :
We used plain water to lubricate the cut .
Once there is water in the cut the knife cuts like butter !
Be careful , I slipped and sliced through the tops of three fingers .
( Want to see my scars ? )
When I looked at the pictures of your sandals I saw that you left tabs from the sidewalls to attach the straps .
That is much better than our method and left me wondering if one could make some ' boots ' out of a properly sized tire ?
That would have been much nicer for wear in the snow !
We never considered that , because the man , who sold the tire pieces on the black market , had already cut the sides off .
He punched discs out of tires to make bicycle tires ( for those who were lucky enough to still have a bike . )
You bought enough of the discs , drilled or burned holes in the center , and ran a sturdy fence wire through the holes .
To mount these ' tires ' one twisted the fence wire until it was tight enough take up any slack .
It was a very hard ride , especially on the old cobblestone roads , but it was better than walking for some people .
Thanks for the entertaining reading , I 'll revisit your info !

CRIMES AND CORRUPTIONS OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER NEWS http://twitter.com/mparent77772
May 20 , 2007 — jao
Some weeks ago , as a way to give a serious try to the PLT environment , i wrote my first ( and only so far ) PLT package , MzFAM , a File Alteration Monitor for MzScheme .
MzFAM consists of a set of PLT - scheme modules providing utilities to monitor and react to filesystem changes .
It exports a high - level interface consisting of monitoring tasks that run as independent threads and invoke callback procedures each time a file alteration is detected .
These high - level tasks are implemented using either Linux ’s FAM / Gamin monitors or , in systems where it is not available , a pure Scheme fall - back implementation .
( A native implementation for BSD systems , based on the kevent / kqueue system calls ( see also this nice article to learn more ) , is on the works . )
As you ’ll see in the link above , i took the time to ( try to ) write a decent user manual , using tex2 page ( which is included in the PLT distribution , but can be used as a standalone program ) , a nice tool to write HTML manuals using TeX markup and , if you ’re so inclined , embedded Scheme directives .
MzFAM ’s implementation served me as an introduction to a couple of wonderful Scheme libraries , both of them authored by Eli Barzilay .
In the first place , i needed a foreign function interface to access FAM ’s C library .
Eli’s FFI is just a piece of beauty : aided by the magic of dlopen and friends , one can access C libraries without writing a single line of C code .
See , for instance , this wrapper of the kevent / kqueue system calls , which will hopefully work as a non-trivial example while you read the FFI manual .
Will Farr has also put the FFI to pretty good use recently .
MzFAM has to choose at run time among several underlying implementations of the monitoring , and i’ve used generic functions to fulfil this need .
No rocket science here : run -of - the - mill polymorphism is enough , but i took the chance to play with the second of Eli ’s jewels , namely , his implementation of CLOS for Scheme , Swindle .
Now , Scheme object systems are a dime a dozen , and many of them claim some degree of resemblance to CLOS , but Swindle is , by a long stretch , the closest to the real thing i’ve used–why , there ’re even some syntactical spots where it is actually nicer than CLOS itself , and is the only ( besides Dorai Sitarm ’s ScmObj )
Scheme object system i know of that provides before / after / around advising .
Swindle also comes with a fairly complete MOP implementation , and i’m looking forward to using it after reading Andreas Paepcke ’s book on CLOS ( which , incidentally , i bought after reading its freely available chapter 3 , User - Level Language Crafting : Introducing the CLOS Metaobject Protocol ( PS ) ) .
All that said , please do n’t take MzFAM as a good example of putting CLOS to work : i’m just a beginner .
Finally , let me mention another nice PLT feature i’ve used ( although this one is not , as far as i know , an Eli ’s hack ) : the PLaneT Package Repository .
Extremely convenient , and a breeze to setup , both from the user ’s and the developer ’s perspective , and yet another reason for giving PLT a serious try .
Happy monitoring !
1 . What is Lojban ?
Lojban ( pronounced ``LOZH - bahn '' ) is a constructed language .
Previous versions of the language were called ``Loglan '' by Dr. James Cooke Brown , who founded the Loglan Project and started the development of the language in 1955 .
The goals for the language were first described in the open literature in the article ``Loglan '' , published in Scientific American , June , 1960 .
Made well - known by that article and by occasional references in science fiction ( most notably in Robert Heinlein 's novel The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress and computer publications , Loglan and Lojban have been built over four decades by dozens of workers and hundreds of supporters , led since 1987 by The Logical Language Group ( who are the publishers of this book ) .
There are thousands of artificial languages ( of which Esperanto is the best - known ) , but Loglan / Lojban has been engineered to make it unique in several ways .
The following are the main features of Lojban :
Lojban is designed to be used by people in communication with each other , and possibly in the future with computers .
Lojban is designed to be neutral between cultures .
Lojban grammar is based on the principles of predicate logic .
Lojban has an unambiguous yet flexible grammar .
Lojban has phonetic spelling , and unambiguously resolves its sounds into words .
Lojban is simple compared to natural languages ; it is easy to learn .
Lojban 's 1300 root words can be easily combined to form a vocabulary of millions of words .
Lojban is regular ; the rules of the language are without exceptions .
Lojban attempts to remove restrictions on creative and clear thought and communication .
Lojban has a variety of uses , ranging from the creative to the scientific , from the theoretical to the practical .
Lojban has been demonstrated in translation and in original works of prose and poetry .
2 . What is this book ?
This book is what is called a ``reference grammar ' ' .
It attempts to expound the whole Lojban language , or at least as much of it as is understood at present .
Lojban is a rich language with many features , and an attempt has been made to discover the functions of those features .
The word ``discover '' is used advisedly ; Lojban was not ``invented '' by any one person or committee .
Often , grammatical features were introduced into the language long before their usage was fully understood .
Sometimes they were introduced for one reason , only to prove more useful for other reasons not recognized at the time .
By intention , this book is complete in description but not in explanation .
For every rule in the formal Lojban grammar ( given in Chapter 21 ) , there is a bit of explanation and an example somewhere in the book , and often a great deal more than a bit .
In essence , Chapter 2 gives a brief overview of the language , Chapter 21 gives the formal structure of the language , and the chapters in between put semantic bones on that formal flesh .
I hope that eventually more grammatical material founded on ( or even correcting ) the explanations in this book will become available .
Nevertheless , the publication of this book is , in one sense , the completion of a long period of language evolution .
With the exception of a possible revision of the language that will not even be considered until five years from publication date , and any revisions of this book needed to correct outright errors , the language described in this book will not be changing by deliberate act of its creators any more .
Instead , language change will take place in the form of new vocabulary ---
Lojban does not yet have nearly the vocabulary it needs to be a fully usable language of the modern world , as Chapter 12 explains --- and through the irregular natural processes of drift and ( who knows ? ) native - speaker evolution .
( Teach your children Lojban ! )
You can learn the language described here with assurance that ( unlike previous versions of Lojban and Loglan , as well as most other artificial languages ) it will not be subject to further fiddling by language - meisters .
It is probably worth mentioning that this book was written somewhat piecemeal .
Each chapter began life as an explication of a specific Lojban topic ; only later did these begin to clump together into a larger structure of words and ideas .
Therefore , there are perhaps not as many cross-references as there should be .
However , I have attempted to make the index as comprehensive as possible .
Each chapter has a descriptive title , often involving some play on words ; this is an attempt to make the chapters more memorable .
The title of Chapter 1 ( which you are now reading ) , for example , is an allusion to the book English As We Speak It In Ireland , by P. W. Joyce , which is sort of informal reference work about Hiberno - English .
``Lojbanistan '' is both an imaginary country where Lojban is the native language , and a term for the actual community of Lojban - speakers , scattered over the world .
Why ``mangle ' ' ?
As yet , nobody in the real Lojbanistan speaks the language at all well , by the standards of the imaginary Lojbanistan ; that is one of the circumstances this book is meant to help remedy .
3 . What are the typographical conventions of this book ?
Each chapter is broken into numbered sections ; each section contains a mixture of expository text , numbered examples , and possibly tables .
The reader will notice a certain similarity in the examples used throughout the book .
One chapter after another rings the changes on the self - same sentences :
will become wearisomely familiar before Chapter 21 is reached .
This method is deliberate ; I have tried to use simple and ( eventually ) familiar examples wherever possible , to avoid obscuring new grammatical points with new vocabulary .
Of course , this is not the method of a textbook , but this book is not a textbook ( although people have learned Lojban from it and its predecessors ) .
Rather , it is intended both for self - learning ( of course , at present would - be Lojban teachers must be self - learners ) and to serve as a reference in the usual sense , for looking up obscure points about the language .
It is useful to talk further about Example 1.1 for what it illustrates about examples in this book .
Examples usually occupy three lines .
The first of these is in Lojban , the second in a word - by - word literal translation of the Lojban into English , and the third in colloquial English .
The second and third lines are sometimes called the ``literal translation '' and the ``colloquial translation '' respectively .
Sometimes , when clarity is not sacrificed thereby , one or both are omitted .
If there is more than one Lojban sentence , it generally means that they have the same meaning .
Words are sometimes surrounded by square brackets .
In Lojban texts , these enclose optional grammatical particles that may ( in the context of the particular example ) be either omitted or included .
In literal translations , they enclose words that are used as conventional translations of specific Lojban words , but do n't have exactly the meanings or uses that the English word would suggest .
In Chapter 3 , square brackets surround phonetic representations in the International Phonetic Alphabet .
Many of the tables , especially those placed at the head of various sections , are in three columns .
The first column contains Lojban words discussed in that section ; the second column contains the grammatical category ( represented by an UPPER CASE Lojban word ) to which the word belongs , and the third column contains a brief English gloss , not necessarily or typically a full explanation .
Other tables are explained in context .
A few Lojban words are used in this book as technical terms .
All of these are explained in Chapter 2 , except for a few used only in single chapters , which are explained in the introductory sections of those chapters .
4. Disclaimers
It is necessary to add , alas , that the examples used in this book do not refer to any existing person , place , or institution , and that any such resemblance is entirely coincidental and unintentional , and not intended to give offense .
When definitions and place structures of gismu , and especially of lujvo , are given in this book , they may differ from those given in the English - Lojban dictionary ( which , as of this writing , is not yet published ) .
If so , the information given in the dictionary supersedes whatever is given here .
5. Acknowledgements and Credits
Although the bulk of this book was written for the Logical Language Group ( LLG ) by John Cowan , who is represented by the occasional authorial ` `I '' , certain chapters were first written by others and then heavily edited by me to fit into this book .
In particular : Chapter 2 is a fusion of originally separate documents , one by Athelstan , and one by Nora Tansky LeChevalier and Bob LeChevalier ; Chapters 3 and 4 were originally written by Bob LeChevalier with contributions by Chuck Barton ; Chapter 12 was originally written ( in much longer form ) by Nick Nicholas ; the dialogue near the end of Chapter 13 was contributed by Nora Tansky LeChevalier ; Chapter 15 and parts of Chapter 16 were originally by Bob LeChevalier ; and the YACC grammar in Chapter 21 is the work of several hands , but is primarily by Bob LeChevalier and Jeff Taylor .
The BNF grammar , which is also in Chapter 21 , was originally written by me , then rewritten by Clark Nelson , and finally touched up by me again .
The research into natural languages from which parts of Chapter 5 draw their material was performed by Ivan Derzhanski .
LLG acknowledges his kind permission to use the fruits of his research .
The pictures in this book were drawn by Nora Tansky LeChevalier , except for the picture appearing in Chapter 4 , which is by Sylvia Rutiser .
I would like to thank the following people for their detailed reviews , suggestions , comments , and early detection of my embarrassing errors in Lojban , logic , English , and cross-references : Nick Nicholas , Mark Shoulson , Veijo Vilva , Colin Fine , And Rosta , Jorge Llambias , Iain Alexander , Paulo S. L. M. Barreto , Robert J. Chassell , Ivan Derzhanski , Jim Carter , Irene Gates , Bob LeChevalier , John Parks - Clifford ( also known as ``pc ' ' ) , and Nora Tansky LeChevalier .
Nick Nicholas ( NSN ) would like to thank the following Lojbanists : Mark Shoulson , Veijo Vilva , Colin Fine , And Rosta , and Iain Alexander for their suggestions and comments ; John Cowan , for his extensive comments , his exemplary trailblazing of Lojban grammar , and for solving the ``manskapi '' dilemma for NSN ; Jorge Llambias , for his even more extensive comments , and for forcing NSN to think more than he was inclined to ; Bob LeChevalier , for his skeptical overview of the issue , his encouragement , and for scouring all Lojban text his computer has been burdened with for lujvo ; Nora Tansky LeChevalier , for writing the program converting old rafsi text to new rafsi text , and sparing NSN from embarrassing errors ; and Jim Carter , for his dogged persistence in analyzing lujvo algorithmically , which inspired this research , and for first identifying the three lujvo classes .
Of course , the entire Loglan Project owes a considerable debt to James Cooke Brown as the language inventor , and also to several earlier contributors to the development of the language .
Especially noteworthy are Doug Landauer , Jeff Prothero , Scott Layson , Jeff Taylor , and Bob McIvor .
Final responsibility for the remaining errors and infelicities is solely mine .
6. Informal Bibliography
The founding document for the Loglan Project , of which this book is one of the products , is Loglan 1 : A Logical Language by James Cooke Brown ( 4th ed. 1989 , The Loglan Institute , Gainesville , Florida , U.S.A . )
The language described therein is not Lojban , but is very close to it and may be considered an ancestral version .
It is regrettably necessary to state that nothing in this book has been approved by Dr. Brown , and that the very existence of Lojban is disapproved of by him .
The logic of Lojban , such as it is , owes a good deal to the American philosopher W. v.O. Quine , especially Word and Object ( 1960 , M.I.T. Press ) .
Much of Quine 's philosophical writings , especially on observation sentences , reads like a literal translation from Lojban .
The theory of negation expounded in Chapter 15 is derived from a reading of Larry Horn 's work The Natural History of Negation .
Of course , neither Brown nor Quine nor Horn is in any way responsible for the uses or misuses I have made of their works .
Depending on just when you are reading this book , there may be three other books about Lojban available : a textbook , a Lojban / English dictionary , and a book containing general information about Lojban .
You can probably get these books , if they have been published , from the same place where you got this book .
In addition , other books not yet foreseen may also exist .
7. Captions to Pictures
The following examples list the Lojban caption , with a translation , for the picture at the head of each chapter .

Two police officers pleaded guilty Thursday to manslaughter in the shooting death of a 92 - year - old woman during a botched drug raid last fall .
A third officer still faces charges .[.. ]
The charges followed a Nov. 21 " no - knock " drug raid on the home of Kathryn Johnston , 92 .
An informant had described buying drugs from a dealer there , police said .
When the officers burst in without warning , Johnston fired at them , and they fired back , killing her .
Fulton County prosecutor Peter Johnson said that the officers involved in Johnston 's death fired 39 shots , striking her five or six times , including a fatal blow to the chest .
He said Johnston fired only once through her door and did n't hit any of the officers .
That means the officers who were wounded likely were hit by their own colleagues , he said .[..]
Assistant U.S. Attorney Yonette Sam - Buchanan said Thursday that although the officers found no drugs in Johnston 's home , Smith planted three bags of marijuana in the home as part of a cover story .
The case raised serious questions about no -knock warrants and whether the officers followed proper procedures .

The city of Durango will soon be powered by 100 % renewable energy ( we believe that wind power will be used ) .
Green power currently constitutes about 10 % of city power purchases .
The extra the city pays for green energy will add about $ 120,000 a year to its electrical bill officials said .
But the extra cost will be offset by an energy audit aimed at cutting power consumption .
With the wind power option , electric customers pay $ 1.25 per block of 100 - kilowatt - hours in addition to their regular rate .
The extra that consumers pay for their power funds investment by power producers in alternative - energy sources such as hydropower , solar and wind .
But electricity from all sources flows on the same line .
In 2006 , Durango used almost 8.15 million kilowatt - hours of power at a cost of $ 779,000 .
Portland has also said it will soon be using 100 % renewable power . :: Via Durango Herald
As you may already know , I ’m a big fan of stack - based languages such as Forth , functional languages such as Haskell and reflexive languages such as Smalltalk .
You can imagine how happy I was when I discovered Factor a few days ago : it combines all those aspects .
Today , a friend sent me someone email signature and asked me if I could decipher it :
01101001001000000110011001110101011000110110101101100101011001000010 00000111100101101111011101010111001000100000011011010110111101101101 00001101000010100110000101101110011001000010000001101110011011110111 01110010000001100110011011110111001000100000011110010110111101110101
As any programmer on the Earth would have , I immediately assumed that those were ASCII codes printed in binary format .
I had a Factor interactive shell opened in one of my windows , so I cut and pasted the whole string ( surrounded by quotes ) and entered :
8 group [ bin > ] map > string print
and the cleartext version appeared instantly .
All in all , it took me around 20 seconds to uncover the original text using Factor .
How does this work ?
Factor is a stack - based language , meaning that data are put onto a stack and words ( equivalent of functions in other languages ) use the data on the stack and put results there .
Factor is a ( dynamically ) typed language : complex data can be pushed onto the stack , while untyped languages such as Forth can only push numbers there .
Writing the string pushes it on the stack .
Using
8 group
takes the string on the top of the stack , considers it as a sequence ( a succession of characters ) , group them by eight and returns an array of strings of length 8 .
At this point , there is only one element on the stack : an array of eight - characters - long strings .
Then
[ bin > ]
pushes another element on the top of the stack : a quotation ( the equivalent of a lambda expression in functional languages ) , which is a block containing code .
The bin > word consumes one string from the stack and pushes back a number which is the value represented by the string in binary .
For example , the expression
" 01101001 " bin >
will push the value 105 on the stack , as 01101001 in binary represents 105 in decimal .
map
takes a sequence and a quotation .
It represents the classical map operation in functional languages : it applies the quotation to every element of the sequence and gathers the results in a new sequence .
As a consequence , each eight - characters - long string gets transformed into its decimal representation .
At the end , we end up with a single element on the stack , which is an array containing all the ASCII codes of the sentence .
> string
transforms a sequence of ASCII codes into the corresponding string .
Then
print
is similar to C’s puts and prints the string on the standard output and adds a newline at the end .
The content of the unencrypted text itself is not important ; my point is that Factor is very compact and its stack - oriented nature helps writing concise and clear programs .
For example , here is one of the many possible implementations of the reverse functionality : it takes a string from the stack and lets its ASCII representation in binary onto the stack .
[ > bin 8 CHAR : 0 pad-head ] [ append ] map-reduce
I ’m sure that you ’re thrilled to know that “ Hello , world ! ” encodes as

The average American motorist is driving substantially fewer miles for the first time in 26 years because of high gas prices and demographic shifts , according to a USA TODAY analysis of federal highway data .
The growth in miles driven has leveled off dramatically in the past 18 months after 25 years of steady climbs despite the addition of more than 1 million drivers to the nation 's streets and highways since 2005 .
Miles driven in February declined 1.9 % from February 2006 before rebounding slightly for a 0.3 % year - over - year gain in March , data from the Federal Highway Administration show .
That 's in sharp contrast to the average annual growth rate of 2.7 % recorded from 1980 through 2005 .
CUTTING BACK : Drivers begin to look ' outside the box '
" You have demographic shifts , traffic congestion and increased gas prices , " says Ed McMahon , senior research fellow at the Urban Land Institute , a non-profit group that promotes innovative development .
" For the first time in recent history , the rate of vehicle miles traveled is not increasing at the rate it was for 25 years .
It 's having an effect and is changing in subtle ways the way people think about their driving . "
The nation has not seen such stagnant growth in driving since 1981 , when the USA staggered through an oil shortage and a recession .
Gas prices reached an all - time high of $ 3.223 in March 1981 when adjusted for inflation in today 's dollars .
During the past 18 months , the nation 's population and workforce have grown by just over 1 % a year , so an annual gain of 0.3 % indicates a decrease in miles per person .
" Thirty - five to 40 % of personal miles traveled is work commutes , " says Bill Veno , director of global refined products for Cambridge Energy Research Associates , a Boston - based energy consulting firm .
" If you continue to grow the employment base , that would tend to push ( miles driven ) upwards . "
Americans are driving about 200 million to 300 million fewer miles a day than they would be if the annual growth rate of 1.9 % from 2000 - 2005 had continued .
Factors contributing to the slowdown : • Soaring gas prices .
Seven of 10 Americans are combining trips and taking other steps to reduce driving , according to a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll May 4 - 6 .
Don Harrison , 32 , of Indianapolis , no longer visits his relatives across town on the weekend ; he saves gas by simply calling them .
• Expanded public transportation .
More people took public transit last year than at any time in 49 years .
" We 're seeing suburban locations create new transit systems , " says William Millar , president of the American Public Transportation Association .
" They 're expanding into areas that never thought they needed transit because they could do everything by car . "
• Slower growth of minority and women drivers and the aging of the population .
Except for African - Americans , minority groups drive at high rates , and the annual growth in women drivers has slowed , says Alan Pisarski , an expert on commuting patterns .
Also , he says , people on average drive less after age 55 .
• Demographic shifts that de-emphasize the need to drive .
Many Americans , particularly young , upwardly mobile singles , are moving downtown and revitalizing cities .
" ( They ) do n't have to live the way of the Ozzie and Harriet model — two parents , suburban , who drive to the city , " McMahon says .

Columnist : Authoritarianism can happen in United States Michael Roston
Published : Monday February 19 , 2007 Print This Email This
In an excerpt from his forthcoming book , Salon columnist Joe Conason says that the changes in political power set in motion by President George W. Bush have brought the United States closer to a future in which authoritarianism is possible .
Conason warns that for the first time since Nixon , Americans have " reason to doubt the future of democracy and the rule of law in our own country . "
The excerpt comes from Conason 's new book It Can Happen Here : Authoritarian Peril in the Age of Bush .
Conaston states up front that the idea of an American slide into authoritarianism is not based in any paranoia , but comes because the current president " has repeatedly asserted and exercised authority that he does not possess under the Constitution he swore to uphold . "
Conason says there is growing public anxiety and anger about the Bush administration 's use and abuse of power .
Two events that have particularly raised public concern are " the misbegotten , horrifically mismanaged war in Iraq [ and ] the heartless mishandling of the Hurricane Katrina disaster . "
He notes that " we do not know the full dimensions of the scandals behind Iraq and Katrina , because the Republican leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives abdicated the traditional congressional duties of oversight and investigation . "
Their unwillingness to take on the President on these issues was due to an acquiescence with authoritarianism , he writes .
He says the " style " of the Bush regime is seen in its " almost casual contempt for democratic and lawful norms ; an expanding appetite for executive control at the expense of constitutional balances ; a reckless impulse to corrupt national institutions with partisan ideology ; and an ugly tendency to smear dissent as disloyalty . "
Conason does n't believe that the 2006 turnover of the Congress to Democratic control will be enough to push back against Bush 's authoritarian turn .
He points to the Senate 's narrow Democratic majority as a major obstacle to checking the White House .
The question he asks is , " In the era of terror alerts , religious fundamentalism , and endless warfare ... whether we are still the brave nation ... or whether our courage , and our luck , have finally run out . "
The full excerpt can be read after viewing an advertisement at Salon 's website .
During a recent discussion with some colleagues about which technology to choose for a project I mentioned the importance of tool support , particularly around the IDE .
I found myself surprised by the wide range of opinions about the importance of tools .
Not about the specifics of whether IDEA was better than Eclipse or VS2005 with Resharper , but about how much importance should be given to tool consideration when choosing a development technology .
Let ’s say the team has free reign about language choice and has narrowed the decision to Java or Ruby .
Both languages are known to the majority of the team .
At this point , for a modern project process ( lightweight / agile ) I would factor in the team size and strongly advocate Java if the team had more than about 3 to 4 developers , justified purely by the superior team support capabilities of IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse .
By which I mean their code exploration and refactoring capabilities .
This is where the arguments start .
Er. This is where this particular argument starts .
A typical response might be , “ as an experienced developer , while I find automated refactorings useful , I do n’t need them and certainly would n’t let my technology decision be swayed by whether a flashy IDE exists .
That ’s just laziness .
Developers were refactoring by hand years before refactoring IDEs existed .
The improved productivity and less lines of code required with Ruby outweighs any time saved from a few keyboard shortcuts . ”
This is n’t a bad counter - argument .
For an individual developer working alone .
With sole access to a codebase that I wrote entirely myself , I ’d generally agree .
I might disagree with the implication that the time saved by the keyboard shortcuts is n’t that significant .
I ’d love to see a study done where a team had to refactor a codebase and add a feature with a modern IDE compared to another team doing the same thing with Emacs .
Moving on – the point that this response misses is that there is a team working on the code not just one developer .
I believe the value of automated code modification and exploration increases as a function of team size .
Why should this be ?
With increasing team size there is an increase in communication overhead and achieving a shared understanding becomes harder and takes longer .
Each new member added to a team has an exponential effect on the number of lines of communication .
What does this mean ?
It becomes increasingly likely that decisions and assumptions made in the early stages will be found to be sub-optimal as the project progresses and the team learns .
Code wo n’t be in quite the right shape or quite the right place .
The domain model will need to evolve and change .
A larger team implies a larger system and therefore more code .
It will become very unlikely that everyone in the team knows where everything in the code is .
Duplication can creep in .
For all these reasons a larger team will necessarily need to explore and change the code as the project progresses .
Without automated support even changing a method name for improved understanding becomes a fraught task .
In a dynamic language automated support is even more important as there is no compile stage to tell you if you forgot to change one of the callsites .
With sufficient test coverage this risk is reduced but never eliminated .
So what will generally happen is that changes that should be made are n’t made as the effort is too high .
Humans build tools .
It ’s one of our most defining characteristics .
We build tools to magnify our physical strength and our mental faculties .
There ’s a reason flint axes have been replaced by chainsaws .
We should never underestimate the importance of good tools to achieving productivity .

Many interesting comments on my last musings about IPC .
Each and every one of them look very nice and have their application area , go and have a look !
These found a weak spot in my heart though :
Candygram is Erlang style message passing .
Very stunning , but to my liking a little bit too much Erlang - like .
Nevertheless I was impressed .
The delegate module was probably the closest to what I was describing .
And I 'm surprised it 's not better known .
Lastly I can't keep my mind off pylinda .
From the moment I started to read about it I fell in love with it .
It is Erlang - like enough to satisfy me and also has a huge potential even to talk to other languages .
I 'm not sure yet how it 's API looks as I 'd want to do things like running the server as part of the main process ( and it being a private server as well then ) etc .
It got me excited allright .
All this is well though , but I 'm not sure I made my main point very clear last time ( and fear losing it here in the noise too , I must be a bad writer ) .
Namely , non of this is in the stdlib ( yes , xmlrpc is ) .
I do think there is a need for a good and yet simple pythonesque IPC module in the stdlib .
When building cluster or grid systems it seems reasonable to me to stray outside of the stdlib ( for now at least ) .
But for simple SMP a module should be making it's way into the stdlib by now IMHO .
Given by what I 've seen so far - but beware , I have n't used any of these yet - delegate seems like the best suited candidate .
It may need some updating , I can imagine it benefitting from the subprocess module for example , but I certainly think something like it should live in the stdlib .

Disney lawyers ' heads must be spinning over this one .
A movie posted on Stanford University 's site called " A Fair (y ) Use Tale " mashes up all your Disney favorites to humorously and effectively explain copyright law .
The ten minute movie , directed by Eric Faden , came out of Stanford University 's Fair Use Project Documentary Film Program .
Stanford 's Fair Use Project–to which Stanford Law professor , Copyright guru , Creative Commons advocate and Wired writer Lawrence Lessig contributes –was founded last year to " support to a range of projects designed to clarify , and extend , the boundaries of fair use in order to enhance creative freedom . "
And , well , the movie is damn sure creative , and certainly seems to take the boundaries of fair use about as far as they can go .
The mashup cuts up and splices audio from more Disney movies than I could begin to list ( or even identify ) to explain the intricacies of copyright law and the fair use doctrine .
It takes the works of " the very folks we can thank for nearly endless copyright terms " and flips them to argue against longer copyrights and attacks on fair use .
It leads to some beautifully surreal moments , often highly recursive , with the characters of The Jungle Book and The Lion King asking questions such as " what is the public domain ? " or proclaiming " fair Use is not a right ; fair use is only a legally defensible position , and this is not fair ...
The point is if fair use actually works then movies like this one will have legal protection . "

霊能師や占い師はみんな詐欺師である。実際彼らの手口は、それほどバリエーション豊かなものではなく、いくつかの基本的なテクニックの組み合わせに過ぎない。詐欺師の手口については、本日記でも何度か取り上げてきたが、複数の日付に分散して参照しにくくなってきたため、この辺でまとめておきたい。まとめの都合上、文章の一部は過去のエントリーの再掲となっている。ご了承いただきたい。
霊能師、霊媒師、占い師、超能力者、宇宙人や高次元存在とのコンタクティー、チャネラー、新興宗教教祖等々が人を騙す手口は大別して、ホットリーディング（hot reading）とコールドリーディング（cold reading）に分けられる。
この答申に明記されているように、テレビ局は信じてはいけない内容だと明確に認識した上で番組制作を行っているのだ。信じる方が馬鹿なのである。
信じてしまう視聴者もいるということを念頭に置きながら、悪い影響が出ないよう配慮して制作している。今後も常識の範囲を考えながら慎重な番組作りを続けていきたい。
調べでは、男子生徒の部屋の机上に遺書のようなメモがあった。霊界の話を紹介するテレビ番組を家族と見たことに触れて「絶対におれは生まれ変わる。もっとできる人間になってくる。家族のみんな忘れないでいて。必ず会いに来る。ホントにゴメン
サヨナラ」と書かれていた。
その上、 「 控室にスタッフから “ ご主人か奥さまかどちらかで結構なんですが、昔、頭を打ったことありませんか？”なんて電話も。夫が“５歳くらいの時に階段から転げた”というエピソードを披露したら、江原さんは本番で、さも今、霊視で見えたかのように“ご主人、頭を打ったことありませんか”って真顔で言うんです。呆れました」。
90 年代に活躍した 宜保愛子 は 1993 年 12月30 日 に 日本テレビ で放映された 宜保愛子 特番『新たなる挑 戦Ⅱ』において、ロンドン塔において透視を行い、不遇な最後を遂げたロンドン塔の王子達の哀れな末期の姿を物語った。しかし、後の検証により、彼女が告げた透視は 夏目漱 石 の「倫敦塔」の描写と不自然なまでに一致しており、小説の描写の引用であったことが明らかになっている。彼女はロンドン塔の歴史を調べることさえせず、小説からア イデア を借用したのである。これに関しては、『
新・トンデモ超常現象60の真相 』に詳細が記載されている。
コールドリーディング （cold reading ）
コールドリーディング（cold reading）とは、外観を観察したり何気ない会話を交わしたりするだけで相手のことを言い当て、相手に「わたしはあなたよりもあなたのことをよく知っている」と信じさせる話術のことを指す。シャーロックホームズの推理と同じである。大体5分も話せばその人が神経質なのかおおざっぱなのか、内向的なのか外向的なのかかなりの部分が分かる。後はちょっとずつ相手の情報を引き出しながら、修正していけばよいのだ。
マルチプルアウト ( multiple out ) そこで役に立つのがマルチプルアウト ( multiple out ) である。マルチプルアウトとはどのようにでも解釈できる曖昧な言い方のことを指し、ノストラダムスの大予言が典型例と言われる。血液型性格判断や占いの結果は非常に漠然とした曖昧な言葉で語られる。
次の性格分析はフォアの実験で利用されたものだが、あなたに当てはまっているだろうか？
あなたは他人から好かれたい、賞賛してほしいと思っており、それにかかわらず自己を批判する傾向にあります。また、あなたは弱みを持っているときでも、それを普段は克服することができます。あなたは使われず生かしきれていない才能をかなり持っています。外見的には規律正しく自制的ですが、内心ではくよくよしたり不安になる傾向があります。正しい判断や正しい行動をしたのかどうか真剣な疑問を持つときがあります。あなたはいくらかの変化や多様性を好み、制約や限界に直面したときには不満を抱きます。そのうえ、あなたは独自の考えを持っていることを誇りに思い、十分な根拠もない他人の意見を聞き入れることはありません。しかし、あなたは他人に自分のことをさらけ出しすぎるのは賢明でないと気付いています。あなたは外向的・社交的で愛想がよいときもありますが、その一方で内向的で用心深く遠慮がちなときもあります。あなたの願望にはやや非現実的な傾向のあるものもあります。
これを性格分析の結果だとして与えると、大部分の被験者が自分の性格を正確に描写していると回答する。上記の文章には「傾向がある」「するときもある 」「ものもある」といった断定を避けた表現が多用されており、「他人から好かれたい」「内心ではくよくよしたり不安になる」「真剣な疑問をもつことがある」等誰にでも当てはまるようなマルチプルアウトな言葉で構成されていることがよく分かるだろう。
A Joplin , Missouri man filed a federal lawsuit last week against MySpace for violating his " freedom to use the social networking site in peace . "
Brian Mora alleges in hiscomplaint ( .pdf ) that MySpace deleted his account twice , in October and November , on the false grounds that he 'd violated the MySpace terms of service .
In truth , he says , he was kicked off the site " because an administrator ... simply disliked something displayed on the petitioner 's profile . "
His case is filed in U.S. District Court in the Western District of Missouri .
Mora 's seeking a court order to force MySpace to stop interfering with his " freedom of lawful speech and expression " as well as his support of certain , intriguingly - unnamed political candidates .
Elsewhere , in a message board post , Mora vows that when he wins his suit and owns MySpace - parent company News Corp. he 'll move Fox News ' coverage further to the right .
__Update : __ Listening
Post reports that MySpace just added the following sentence to its terms - of - service :
" MySpace expressly reserves the right to remove your profile and / or restrict , suspend , or terminate your access to any part of MySpace Services if MySpace determines , in its sole discretion , that you pose a threat to MySpace and / or its Users . "

DaimlerChrysler Sells US Subsidiary Cerberus Buys Controlling Stake in Chrysler
DaimlerChrysler has been trying to rid itself of its loss - making US subsidiary for months .
Now it has finally struck a deal with Cerberus Capital Management .
The brain needs rest to function
Army researchers found soldiers struggled to make snap decisions in emotionally charged situations after being deprived of sleep for two nights .
The authors say this could be important for other professions , including doctors , who have broken sleep and need to make quick decisions in a crisis .
The US work is published in the latest edition of the journal Sleep .
Lack of shut-eye
It is well established that poor sleep can impair many functions , including concentration and memory .
Some people say they need as little as three hours of sleep in every 24 hours to feel rested , while others need 11 hours .
Experts generally advise people get about eight hours of solid sleep per night to be on top form .
Lead researcher Dr William Killgore , of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research , stressed that the findings did not mean that sleep deprivation leads to a decline in " morality " or in the quality of moral beliefs .
" Our results simply suggest that when sleep deprived , individuals appear to be selectively slower in their deliberations about moral personal dilemmas relative to other types of dilemmas , " he said .
Sluggish judgement
The dilemmas used in the study were hypothetical scenarios , rather than actual events .
The researchers asked 26 healthy soldiers to judge whether a given course of action would be " appropriate " or " inappropriate " in each of the test situations , ranging from minor inconsequential ones to serious dilemmas where the decision could theoretically harm another person .
In general , the soldiers found it harder to perform the task when they were sleep deprived and had been awake continuously for 53 hours .
Some even changed their view of what was morally acceptable after they had been awake for two days .
The US military currently is investigating how little sleep soldiers can safely get by on and whether drugs can help them to stay alert for longer without sleep .
Unsafe
Neil Stanley of the British Sleep Society said : " We know that being tired impairs judgement generally .
This work suggests it affects moral judgement too .
" You react differently and situations can escalate .
Your emotions can be out of kilter and you are either close to tears or a zombie . "
He said there was a worrying trend towards a 24 - hour society , with people burning the candle at both ends .
" We should not accept tiredness as a normal state , " he said .
He said the longest stint ever recorded was a person who went 11.5 days without sleep .
Sleep deprivation is exceedingly common , not just among shift workers .
Allen Davey , director of the British Snoring and Sleep Apnoea Association , estimates at least a quarter of people in the UK do not get enough sleep because a family member snores .

The first test of the new US strategy towards its recalcitrant neighbours will come next week when the EU meets to agree a united approach to relations with Cuba .
The " common position " will set out a policy for engagement with the Havana administration and is binding on member states .
The threat is of a shift towards a diplomatic freeze , or even sanctions against the Caribbean island .
Those of us who have observed Cuba 's social system remain perplexed by the following contradiction : that the determination to " make poverty history " attracts strong support from the EU in principle , yet when a country takes steps to ensure the concept becomes reality , a disapproving silence ensues .
This has been demonstrated in Cuba , Venezuela , Bolivia and even Argentina .
Cuba is the only country in Latin America that does not receive assistance from international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , which are supposed to contribute to the development of third world countries .
It is also the only nation on the continent with whom the EU has not signed a cooperation agreement .
Yet social advances continue , underpinned by moderate but consistent economic growth .
The UN recently announced that Cuba is the only country in Latin America that has no malnutrition .
The World Health Organisation reports that the Cuban doctor - patient ratio is 1:170 , better than the US average of 1:188 .
In addition , WHO has commended Cuba for outstanding literacy levels and rates of infant mortality and life expectancy that outstrip Washington DC - despite 45 years of an illegal economic blockade imposed by successive US administrations .
Cuba 's international activities also deserve recognition .
It is operating humanitarian missions in 68 countries and , in 2005 alone , 1,800 doctors from 47 developing countries graduated in Cuba under a free scholarship scheme .
Yet western governments - including our own - offer little acknowledgement of these achievements .
The Foreign Office explains it " cannot have normal relations with Cuba " due to human - rights concerns .
Amnesty International claims that 72 prisoners of conscience are detained in Cuban jails , an allegation rejected by the Cuban government , which argues that all were tried and found guilty of being in the pay of an enemy power - the US .
The International Red Cross has meanwhile reported that up to 40,000 people are detained by coalition forces in Iraq without charge .
If we are to promote the eradication of poverty and greater global cohesion , there must be a sense of justice and mutual respect .
Our government should promote exchanges with nations like Cuba and see what we can learn from one another .
Scope exists for cooperation in biotechnology .
Vaccine exports from Cuba doubled last year and clinical trials in several countries established Cuba as a world leader in cancer research and treatment .
It must be hoped that the EU will resist US pressure , despite the tendency of countries like Poland and the Czech Republic to rush to do Washington 's bidding .
More than 170 MPs have signed a Commons motion calling for an independent positive approach to Cuba in the Brussels negotiations .
They recognise that there is much to gain from cooperation with Latin America but , as recent history reminds us , much to be lost from policies of isolation .

As the head of a project that wants to take hi-tech into the developing world , Nicholas Negroponte has had to get used to criticism .
Over the past two years the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) initiative , a scheme aimed at building low - cost computers for education in developing countries , has been attacked many times .
Its detractors include rival technology companies , aid workers and African politicians .
But last week Negroponte 's composure finally broke as he lashed out at Intel for what he called a " predatory " attempt to damage the not - for - profit scheme .
The object of his fury was Intel 's Classmate PC , a rival laptop from the chipmaking giant with a similar sales pitch .
Negroponte accused Intel of capitalising on his work , and said the Silicon Valley giant was deliberately underpricing the Classmate to put extra pressure on OLPC .
" Intel should be ashamed of itself , " he told CBS News .
" It 's just - it 's shameless . "
OLPC 's machine , the XO - 1 , is often dubbed the " $ 100 laptop " .
It currently costs $ 175 ( £ 88 ) , although Negroponte says this can be reduced to around $ 100 as more are manufactured .
Under the hood it has innovative power - saving features , cutting - edge long - distance wireless networking capabilities and runs the open source Linux operating system .
Intel 's Classmate lacks some of those abilities , but has a faster processor and can run Linux or Windows XP Embedded , a stripped - down version of the Microsoft operating system .
It costs $ 285 , though Intel is bullish about getting the price below $ 200 .
Cutting edge
The advent of such competition means that some countries previously behind OLPC are now considering their options .
Brazil , for example , was set to order millions of XO - 1 machines , but is now considering buying the Classmate - or another system - instead .
Nigeria , Pakistan and Thailand are also wavering .
Despite the perception that the One Laptop product is both technically superior and better - intentioned , its officials are concerned that the technology industry 's giants are using their power to stop it from becoming a success .
" OLPC has the best power management ever built , better Wi-Fi and connectivity than anywhere else , a display that 's four times better than anything on a laptop today , " says Walter Bender , the initiative 's president of software and content .
" There 's no comparison between OLPC and other products - but there is a lot of pressure on governments to stick with a known quantity . "
Intel denies that it is deliberately targeting One Laptop .
However , the company has been one of the most vocal critics of the project in the past .
Although sniping has come from many parts of the computing industry - including from Bill Gates , who advised potential buyers to " get a decent computer " instead - it was Craig Barrett , the Intel chairman , who really stuck the knife in .
" Mr Negroponte has called it a $ 100 laptop - I think a more realistic title should be the $ 100 gadget , " Barrett told reporters in 2005 .
His predictions for the machine were scathing .
" The problem is that gadgets have not been successful ... it turns out what people are looking for is something that has the full functionality of a PC .
We work in the area of low - cost , affordable PCs , but full - function PCs , not handheld devices and not gadgets . "
Given Barrett 's scepticism it seems something of a U - turn for Intel to be fervently pushing its own equivalent .
The company , however , rejects claims that it is being hypocritical .
" Craig referred to One Laptop Per Child as a gadget in 2005 , when they first unveiled it , " says Agnes Kwan of Intel .
" They have come a long way since ; back then it was low performance and he fairly referred to it as a gadget .
Now we 're all working to the same vision , even if we are going about it in different ways . "
Kwan also denies that Intel is deliberately undercutting its own prices in order to push OLPC out of what it had now decided was a lucrative market .
" That is not true , " she says .
" We are not selling Classmate below cost price - we are striving for a sustainable model . "
It is not the first time that Intel has been accused of using its near monopoly to overpower rivals - for example , it is being investigated by the European Commission over allegations of anti-competitive behaviour .
AMD , Intel 's only major rival and the company which supplies the chips inside the XO - 1 , did not waste an opportunity to go on the offensive .
" What we have here is an infinitely powerful monopoly metaphorically threatening to break the kneecaps of a non - profit if it does n't ' get in line ' , " wrote AMD spokesman Michael Silverman in a letter published on the Barron 's website .
But the fact remains that despite huge interest from governments , OLPC has struggled to make a breakthrough with definite orders .
Bender , a former director of the Media Lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , says technical progress has been lightning fast - but that the main hurdle now is bureaucracy .
" The situation is that we 're asking governments to do something new and different - to not stick with the status quo , and try something new .
There is an unbelievable amount of misinformation that 's been circulated , but we 're going to keep pushing . "
Lofty ambitions
Neither he nor Intel will rule out working together in the future , but he stressed that the project must not be suffocated by commercial competitors if it is to deliver on its lofty ambitions .
" This is not about a philosophy .
For example , the power requirements of Classmate just are n't viable in many of these places , period .
It 's not about there being a better way that you can do this - it 's the only way .
In the long run , we 're thrilled that Intel 's taking this marketplace seriously ... but I just want to make sure it 's real ; that there 's sustained interest , and that the prices are going to keep coming down instead of starting to go up because shareholders demand it . "

Scientists have made one of the most important fossil finds in history : a missing link between fish and land animals , showing how creatures first walked out of the water and on to dry land more than 375 m years ago .
Palaeontologists have said that the find , a crocodile - like animal called the Tiktaalik roseae and described today in the journal Nature , could become an icon of evolution in action - like Archaeopteryx , the famous fossil that bridged the gap between reptiles and birds .
As such , it will be a blow to proponents of intelligent design , who claim that the many gaps in the fossil record show evidence of some higher power .
Richard Dawkins , the evolutionary biologist , said : " Our emergence on to the land is one of the more significant rites of passage in our evolutionary history , and Tiktaalik is an important link in the story . "
Tiktaalik - the name means " a large , shallow - water fish " in the Inuit language Inuktikuk - shows that the evolution of animals from living in water to living on land happened gradually , with fish first living in shallow water .
The animal lived in the Devonian era lasting from 417 m to 354 m years ago , and had a skull , neck , and ribs similar to early limbed animals ( known as tetrapods ) , as well as a more primitive jaw , fins , and scales akin to fish .
The scientists who discovered it say the animal was a predator with sharp teeth , a crocodile - like head , and a body that grew up to 2.75 metres ( 9ft ) long .
" It 's very important for a number of reasons , one of which is simply the fact that it 's so well - preserved and complete , " said Jennifer Clack , a paleontologist at Cambridge University and author of an accompanying article in Nature .
Scientists have previously been able to trace the transition of fish into limbed animals only crudely over the millions of years they anticipate the process took place .
They suspected that an animal which bridged the gap between fish and land - based tetrapods must have existed - but , until now , there had been scant evidence of one .
" Tiktaalik blurs the boundary between fish and land - living animal both in terms of its anatomy and its way of life , " said Neil Shubin , a biologist at the University of Chicago , and a leader of the expedition which found Tiktaalik .
The near - pristine fossil was found on Ellesmere Island , Canada , which is 600 miles from the north pole in the Arctic Circle .
Scientists from the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia , the University of Chicago , and Harvard University led several expeditions into the inhospitable icy desert to search for the fossils .
The find is the first complete evidence of an animal that was on the verge of the transition from water to land .
" The find is a dream come true , " said Ted Daeschler of the Academy of Natural Sciences .
" We knew that the rocks on Ellesmere Island offered a glimpse into the right time period and were formed in the right kinds of environments to provide the potential for finding fossils documenting this important evolutionary transition . "
When Tiktaalik lived , the Canadian Arctic region was part of a land mass which straddled the equator .
Like the Amazon basin today , it had a subtropical climate and the animal lived in small streams .
The skeleton indicates that it could support its body under the force of gravity .
Farish Jenkins , an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University said : " This represents a critical early phase in the evolution of all limbed animals , including humans - albeit a very ancient step . "
Tiktaalik also gives biologists a new understanding of how fins turned into limbs .
Its fin contains bones that compare to the upper arm , forearm and primitive parts of the hand of land - living animals .
" Most of the major joints of the fin are functional in this fish , " Professor Shubin said .
" The shoulder , elbow and even parts of the wrist are already there and working in ways similar to the earliest land - living animals . "
Dr Clack said that , judging from the fossil , the first evolutionary transition from sea to land probably involved learning how to breathe air .
" Tiktaalik has lost a series of bones that , in fishes , covers the gill region and helps to operate the gill - breathing mechanism , " she said .
" The air - breathing mechanism it had would have been elaborated and having lost the series of bones that lies between the head and the shoulder girdle means it 's got a neck , it can raise its head more easily in order to gulp the air .
" The flexible robust limbs appear to be connected with pushing the head out of the water to breathe the air . "
H Richard Lane , director of sedimentary geology and palaeobiology at the US National Science Foundation , said : " These exciting discoveries are providing fossil Rosetta stones for a deeper understanding of this evolutionary milestone - fish to land - roaming tetrapods . "
A cast of the fossil goes on display at the Science Museum in South Kensington central London today .
Since 9/11 , some security experts have pushed the idea that peer - to - peer alert systems that rely on openness and the crowd can save lives , particularly when centralized communications and decision - making break down .
That argument is back in force following Monday 's mass slayings of 32 people at Virginia Tech .
As the carnage unfolded , eyewitnesses IM 'd terrifying firsthand accounts to their friends , some of which appeared on blogs and MySpace within minutes of the shootings .
Yet students complained that the first official word they heard about a killer on campus came a full two hours after two students were shot to death in a nearby dorm , just as their suspected attacker opened fire again in an academic building on the other side of campus .
" The kids demonstrated that in a disaster , we will use whatever tools are at hand to communicate , " says W. David Stephenson , who has been advocating for innovative and collaborative disaster tools since the World Trade Center terror attack .
" It adds up to the stark reality that the first incident should have resulted in an immediate lockdown , and the second round of shooting – unless there 's something that has n't been reported yet – should never have happened . "
As the nation comes to grips with the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history , debate will turn inevitably to gun control , youth alienation and video - game violence .
Emergency responders , meanwhile , will be asking tough questions about tactics and technology .
Why , given the ubiquity of SMS - enabled cell phones and the growing popularity of social networking and communication tools like Twitter and dodgeball.com , did it take so long for news to reach students that class had been canceled and that students should stay in their dorm rooms ?
Next - generation emergency - alert systems have sprouted up across the country , aiming to bring better information and decision - making to disaster scenes .
New York City 's planned 911 system would allow callers to send in cell - phone pictures and videos ; Portland , Oregon 's Connect & Protect system combines ad -hoc and centralized information sharing ; and SquareLoop 's technology enables emergency messages to be sent to any phone in a given geographic area , according to Stephenson .
In its own slow way , the federal government has responded to lessons learned from Sept. 11 and Hurricane Katrina and in the fall , Congress passed the Safe Port Act that lassos cell - phone companies into becoming a nationwide SMS alert system .
The system is one of many relying on the Common Alerting Protocol , or Cap , that allows officials to write an alert once in a specially designed format and then send it out through multiple distribution technologies .
The Federal Communications Commission will begin the federal rulemaking process on the new network some time in the fall , meaning the system wo n't be rolled out until sometime in 2008 at the earliest .
Some colleges are also exploring new emergency alert methods .
The University of California at Berkeley relies on tried - and - true alert - warning horns to broadcast an emergency , but recently launched a beta test of a wikilike technology called People Locator that can be used during a disaster as a centralized bulletin board .
Anyone can leave a message or post information , while those with UC - Berkeley online credentials can leave an official message , such as their status after an earthquake .
Emergency officials can mine the tool for relevant information , such as where students suspected to be exposed to radiation now are .
The issue is only partly about technology , experts say .
Regardless of the system used , effective response often boils down to tough human decisions about when to use the system , and how .
Virginia
Tech officials have defended their actions , saying they had reason to believe the shooter had left the campus , so they saw no reason to cancel classes for the 25,000 full - time students .
" It 's so tricky to talk about at this point – there 's so much we do n't know , but in general the most common mode of failure ( in notification technology ) is the failure to use it in a timely fashion , " says Art Botterell , a longtime specialist in disaster and technology who is sympathetic to the officials ' plight .
" There is always the question of what kind of capability you have , but the part of the process that is hardest is the decision - making . "
Some wonder whether a distributed disaster - communication system – using tools such as a disaster - ready wiki , presence - registering networks and a 911 service that shares information two ways – might have performed better .
" I think there is a generational gap between the way the announcement was broadcast and the way 20 - year - old students communicate , " says Eric Bonabeau , a network analysis expert and CEO of Icosystem , who argues that Virginia Tech should have been more attuned to college students ' habits .
" We are working on understanding how the emergence of smart swarms can be shaped in crisis situations by giving people tools to communicate such as wikis and ad - hoc alert networks – and encouraging them to do so rather than limiting communications , which seems to be any administration 's first instinct .
The information might be redundant but is often of surprisingly good quality thanks to self - and mutual - policing mechanisms . "
Botterell , who is on a committee that is helping the FCC craft the rules , supports the new system and disaster - response innovations in general , but cautions that no technology is a magic wand .
" If you look at what we know about how human beings make decisions , you can't just give them one message – it's not like command and control , " Botterell said .
" People need a web of corroboration , and we are seeding that word - of - mouth mesh because ultimately that 's where decisions are made .
" People look at the eyes of their peers and that 's where decisions are made . "

The father of Madonna 's adopted orphan has dismissed as a lie the singer 's claim on TV that his wife and other children died of AIDS .
Yohane Banda , 32 , whose wife died aged 25 after giving birth to 13 - month - old David , says he will now have to live with the stigma .
The African peasant farmer also denied the superstar 's allegation that he had never visited his son at the orphanage , to which he was entrusted at the age of two weeks .
Speaking on the Oprah Winfrey Show last week , Madonna , 48 , said when she met David at the orphanage in Malawi she was told his mother and three siblings had died of AIDS , while his father 's whereabouts were unknown .
But Mr Banda , who lives in the village of Lipunga , close to the border with Zambia , said : " She never went for an HIV test and she died in Zambia at her parents ' house , so how could anyone know if that is what she died of ? "
The clinic she attended when she became ill during pregnancy had diagnosed anaemia , he added .
Later , when she was admitted to hospital in Malawi , he was told she had a physical condition that made childbirth very risky .
Mr Banda insisted he had two other children - not three as Madonna was told - one of whom had died of malaria , while the other died suddenly at 18 months from an unknown cause .
Neither was HIV positive as far as he knew .
Mr Banda said he was worried that if people believed Madonna 's claims , they would stigmatise him .
In the TV interview , Madonna said David had been abandoned by his family .
" No one from his extended family had visited him since he arrived , " she told Oprah .
But Mr Banda insisted this was also " a lie " , adding : " I visited David many times , too many to count . "
The baby was also visited by his grandmother , while Mr Banda 's brother , Profera , " saw him almost every day , sometimes twice a day " .
Despite his anger at the slurs , Mr Banda refused to blame Madonna and instead accused the orphanage of giving her " false information " .
However , an official at the Home of Hope Orphan Care Centre insisted : " We gave her no such information , " and instead pointed the finger at Malawi's Ministry of Gender and Child Welfare .
Meanwhile , although David has been in the UK for less than two weeks , Madonna has introduced him to her Kabbalah faith .
The move is likely to upset Mr Banda , who was told his son was going to " a very nice Christian lady " .
Madonna took the toddler to the Friday night Shabat ceremony at the Central London Kabbalah Centre , and invited other children to " come and play with baby David " .
The boy even wore the Kabbalah red string bracelet , believed by followers to ward off evil spirits .

These five projects have been selected among the 35 proposals submitted by 25 students .
This has n’t been an easy task for the mentors , because the good proposals were many and the competition fierce .
I ’d like to thank all the students who applied , and invite all of them to propose us a project for the 2008 edition of the Summer of Code .
But in the end Squeak could get more than just this five projects : I have been contacted by a couple of students who are still interested in working on their proposed projects , either under the SummerTalk banner , or just in their spare time .
Again , I ’d like to thank all the students and the mentors involved in this effort for all the work they ’ve done .
Thanks , guys !

Rich nations seeking to cut climate change have this in common : they lie .
You wo n't find this statement in the draft of the new report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which was leaked to the Guardian last week .
But as soon as you understand the numbers , the words form before your eyes .
The governments making genuine efforts to tackle global warming are using figures they know to be false .
The British government , the European Union and the United Nations all claim to be trying to prevent " dangerous " climate change .
Any level of climate change is dangerous for someone , but there is a broad consensus about what this word means : two degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels .
It is dangerous because of its direct impacts on people and places ( it could , for example , trigger the irreversible melting of the Greenland ice sheet and the collapse of the Amazon rainforest ) and because it is likely to stimulate further warming , as it encourages the world 's natural systems to start releasing greenhouse gases .
The aim of preventing more than 2C of warming has been adopted overtly by the UN and the European Union , and implicitly by the British , German and Swedish governments .
All of them say they are hoping to confine the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to a level that would prevent such a rise .
And all of them know that they have set the wrong targets , based on outdated science .
Fearful of the political implications , they have failed to adjust to the levels the new research demands .
This is n't easy to follow , but please bear with me , as you cannot understand the world 's most important issue without grappling with some numbers .
The average global temperature is affected by the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
This concentration is usually expressed as " carbon dioxide equivalent " .
It is not an exact science - you cannot say that a certain concentration of gases will lead to a precise increase in temperature - but scientists discuss the relationship in terms of probability .
A paper published last year by the climatologist Malte Meinshausen suggests that if greenhouse gases reach a concentration of 550 parts per million , carbon dioxide equivalent , there is a 63 - 99 % chance ( with an average value of 82 % ) that global warming will exceed two degrees .
At 475 parts per million ( ppm ) the average likelihood is 64 % .
Only if concentrations are stabilised at 400 parts or below is there a low chance ( an average of 28 % ) that temperatures will rise by more than two degrees .
The IPCC 's draft report contains similar figures .
A concentration of 510 ppm gives us a 33 % chance of preventing more than two degrees of warming .
A concentration of 590 ppm gives us a 10 % chance .
You begin to understand the scale of the challenge when you discover that the current level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere ( using the IPCC 's formula ) is 459 p pm .
We have already exceeded the safe level .
To give ourselves a high chance of preventing dangerous climate change , we will need a programme so drastic that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere end up below the current concentrations .
The sooner this happens , the greater the chance of preventing two degrees of warming .
But no government has set itself this task .
The European Union and the Swedish government have established the world 's most stringent target .
It is 550 ppm , which gives us a near certainty of an extra 2C .
The British government makes use of a clever conjuring trick .
Its target is also " 550 parts per million " , but 550 parts of carbon dioxide alone .
When you include the other greenhouse gases , this translates into 666 ppm , carbon dioxide equivalent ( a fitting figure ) .
According to last autumn 's Stern report on the economics of climate change , at 650 ppm there is a 60 - 95 % chance of 3C of warming .
The government 's target , in other words , commits us to a very dangerous level of climate change .
The British government has been aware that it has set the wrong target for at least four years .
In 2003 the environment department found that " with an atmospheric CO2 stabilisation concentration of 550 ppm , temperatures are expected to rise by between 2C and 5C " .
In March last year it admitted that " a limit closer to 450 ppm or even lower , might be more appropriate to meet a 2C stabilisation limit " .
Yet the target has not changed .
Last October
I challenged the environment secretary , David Miliband , over this issue on Channel 4 News .
He responded as if he had never come across it before .
The European Union is also aware that it is using the wrong figures .
In 2005 it found that " to have a reasonable chance to limit global warming to no more than 2C , stabilisation of concentrations well below 550 ppm CO2 equivalent may be needed " .
But its target has n't changed either .
Embarrassingly for the government , and for leftwingers like me , the only large political entity that seems able to confront this is the British Conservative party .
In a paper published a fortnight ago , it called for an atmospheric stabilisation target of 400 - 450 ppm carbon dioxide equivalent .
Will this become policy ?
Does Cameron have the guts to do what his advisers say he should ?
In my book Heat , I estimate that to avoid two degrees of warming we require a global emissions cut of 60 % per capita between now and 2030 .
This translates into an 87 % cut in the United Kingdom .
This is a much stiffer target than the British government 's - which requires a 60 % cut in the UK 's emissions by 2050 .
But my figure now appears to have been an underestimate .
A recent paper in the journal Climatic Change emphasises that the sensitivity of global temperatures to greenhouse gas concentrations remains uncertain .
But if we use the average figure , to obtain a 50 % chance of preventing more than 2C of warming requires a global cut of 80 % by 2050 .
This is a cut in total emissions , not in emissions per head .
If the population were to rise from 6 billion to 9 billion between now and then , we would need an 87 % cut in global emissions per person .
If carbon emissions are to be distributed equally , the greater cut must be made by the biggest polluters : rich nations like us .
The UK 's emissions per capita would need to fall by 91 % .
But our governments appear quietly to have abandoned their aim of preventing dangerous climate change .
If so , they condemn millions to death .
What the IPCC report shows is that we have to stop treating climate change as an urgent issue .
We have to start treating it as an international emergency .
We must open immediate negotiations with China , which threatens to become the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases by next November , partly because it manufactures many of the products we use .
We must work out how much it would cost to decarbonise its growing economy , and help to pay .
We need a major diplomatic offensive - far more pressing than it has been so far - to persuade the United States to do what it did in 1941 , and turn the economy around on a dime .
But above all we need to show that we remain serious about fighting climate change , by setting the targets the science demands .

The mystery surrounding a snake that undergoes a spectacular colour change has been solved by ANU ecologists who have found that the skin of the green python – which begins life either bright yellow or red – transforms to blend into a new habitat as the snake gets older .
Dr David Wilson and Dr Robert Heinsohn from the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies at ANU , with Professor John Endler of Exeter University , solved the mystery after a three year study radio - tracking the green python at Cape York Peninsula .
“ Animals sometimes change colour during their lives , but none as dramatically as the green python of northern Australia and New Guinea .
It has puzzled evolutionary biologists for decades , ” Dr Heinsohn said .
“ This beautiful reptile is popular in the pet trade because it hatches either bright yellow or red , but eventually turns emerald green .
It turns out there is a very good reason for this dramatic change . ”
For the study , published this week in the scientific journal Biology Letters , the researchers radio - tracked a large number of juvenile and adult pythons and analysed their colours using advanced spectrophotometry .
To their surprise , they found that the brightly coloured youngsters live in a completely different habitat to the older snakes .
The juveniles remained outside the rainforest where they hunted small prey such as skinks and cockroaches , whereas the adults moved into the rainforest canopy to hunt rodents and birds .
The juvenile yellow and red colour allows them to blend in remarkably well with the multi-coloured leaves and grass at the forest edge .
The adult green allows them to hide from their predators as they hunt for birds and rodents in the canopy .
“ It was only when we established the total divergence in behaviour of the juveniles and adults that we could begin to understand their remarkably different colours .
“ It takes a year before the young ones are large enough to catch bigger prey like birds .
They then shed their skins , change to green , and move inside the rainforest to try their luck off the ground .
“ Drab juveniles are the norm in the animal world , but the brightly coloured young of green pythons are unique .
They are helping us to understand where the bright and beautiful colours seen in nature come from and how they are maintained , ” Dr Heinsohn said .

Stevens : Smoking pot akin to drinking during prohibition Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday June 27 , 2007 Print This Email This
In his dissent on a recent free - speech case , Justice John Paul Stevens wades into the war - on - drugs debate , comparing modern - day pot smokers with " otherwise law - abiding patrons of bootleggers and speakeasies , " during the prohibition era .
Stevens , who the Washington Post notes turned 87 on April 20 , said the current climate surrounding the war on drugs " is reminiscent of the opinion that supported the nationwide ban on alcohol consumption when I was a student . "
The Supreme Court this week ruled against an Alaska student who displayed a " BONG HiTS 4 JESUS " sign at an event outside his high school , and Stevens wrote the dissent for the four justices who believed the student 's free - speech rights should be protected .
" Today the actions of literally millions of otherwise law - abiding users of marijuana , and of the majority of voters in each of the several States that tolerate medicinal uses of the product , lead me to wonder whether the fear of disapproval by those in the majority in silencing opponents of the war on drugs , " Stevens wrote .
Most debate over the efficacy of the war on drugs focuses on government crackdowns on users of medical marijuana , for whom the drug eases chronic pain .
But in comparing pot smoking to social drinking , Stevens suggests that the drug could be legalized in all cases .
In his opinion , Stevens insists " no one seriously maintains that drug advocacy ... can be prohibited because of its feared consequences . "
Later , Stevens observes the shift in Americans ' views on alcohol since the 1920s and 30s .
" While alcoholic beverages are now regarded as ordinary articles of commerce , their use was then condemned with the same moral fervor that now supports the war on drugs , " Stevens writes .
In a 2005 case , Stevens wrote for the court 's 6 - 3 majority that upheld the federal government 's right to prosecute medical marijuana patients in states that have legalized medical use of the drug .
But his opinion was based strictly on Congress 's ability to regulate interstate commerce , and that opinion included mention that credible research showing marijuana could be medically effective would " cast serious doubt " on the government 's classification of the drug as a Schedule I narcotic .
And he all but encouraged the advocates to take their argument directly to Congress .
“ We came back , we tried , ” he said .
“ It ’s really draining , and at a certain point you sit down and you say , ‘ We do n’t have to go through this . ’ ”

As a city in flux , New Orleans remains statistically murky , but demographers generally agree that the population replenishment after the storm , as measured by things like the amount of mail sent and employment in main economic sectors , has leveled off .
While many poorer residents have moved back to the city , the “ brain drain ” of professionals that the city was experiencing before the storm appears to have accelerated .
Some say the overall effect is negligible .
Greg Rigamer , a demographer who has done work for the city , said that the lack of housing had constrained the recovery , but that many residents remained fully committed to the city .
“ The pattern in is certainly stronger than the pattern out , ” Mr. Rigamer said .
But in December , the number of houses on the market peaked at a high not seen since the late 1980s , while the number of sales has trended downward since last June , according to data tracked by the Brookings Institution in Washington .
Statistics kept by commercial moving companies show a net loss to New Orleans .
Employers say they have raised salaries for skilled workers .
One oft - cited survey by the University of New Orleans found that a third of residents , especially those with graduate degrees , were thinking of leaving within two years .
Susan E. Howell , who conducted the survey , cautioned that the sample was small and that the poor were underrepresented .
There are indications that low - income New Orleanians — those who will need the most help from a cash - strapped city — are making their way back , despite a lack of affordable housing , piling into relatives ’ homes and trailers .
U - Haul , the rental company that is more affordable than commercial movers , has had more inbound trucks than outbound , according to the company ’s records , and the number of public school children and new applications for food stamps in Orleans Parish are rising .
In Houston , a task force that helps Hurricane Katrina residents resettle has paid more than $ 1 million in moving expenses for 350 families returning to New Orleans .
More than 11,000 poultry died of the virus in Shijiping village near Yiyang city , the Agriculture Ministry said .
Some 53,000 birds have since been culled and officials say that the outbreak is now under control .
China 's last reported case was in March , when chickens died at a poultry market near the Tibetan capital , Lhasa .
There were no reports of human infection in the latest outbreak .
A total of 15 people have died in China from the H5N1 virus and millions of birds have been culled .
Officials are working to vaccinate billions of domestic poultry by the end of May in preparation for the northward migration of wild birds in the summer , Xinhua news agency has said .
Since the H5N1 virus emerged in South East Asia in late 2003 , it has claimed more than 180 lives around the world .
Indonesia has been hardest hit , with more than 70 deaths .
Scientists fear the virus could mutate to a form which could be easily passed from human to human , triggering a pandemic and potentially putting millions of lives at risk .
pH Manifesto pH : a parallel Haskell Arvind ( MIT ) Lennart Augustsson ( Chalmers ) Jamey Hicks ( Motorola MCRC ) Rishiyur Nikhil ( DEC CRL ) Simon Peyton Jones ( Glasgow ) Joe Stoy ( Oxford ) John Williams ( IBM research )
This note describes pH , a parallel variant of Haskell [ 1 ] .
It is also an invitation to join this effort .
Why pH ? pH is an attempt to draw together the lazy functional community ( as represented by Haskell ) and the dataflow community ( as represented by Id and Sisal ) .
By sharing a large common language base ( Haskell ) , we hope that we will find it easier to share ideas and implementations , exchange programs and reduce harmful diversity .
Application programmers will find it easier to grapple with only one syntax and type system .
We do not seek uniformity .
There are clear differences between pH and traditional Haskell .
But having a common framework will allow us to highlight and study these differences more easily than when the languages involved differed more widely .
We hope that pH will become a collaborative effort , as the Haskell language itself is , rather than being associated with any one research group .
If enough people are interested , we will form some kind of committee and mailing list to steer the language .
If you are interested in joining in the development of pH , or just want to comment on it , send email to pH@abp.lcs.mit.edu .
If you would like to subscribe to the pH mailing list , send email to pH-request@abp.lcs.mit.edu .
What is pH ?
pH is all about parallelism .
There is more than one approach to parallel implementations of functional languages .
For example , it is possible to exploit the implicit parallelism of a Haskell program by concurrent evaluation of the arguments of strict operators .
The absence of side effects ensures that this concurrent evaluation cannot change the result .
Strictness analysis techniques widen the scope of this idea , by allowing parallel evaluation of any strict function argument .
Further , it is possible to provide programmer annotations to indicate sub-expressions which should be evaluated in parallel , even when the compiler cannot prove that the value of all the sub- expressions will be required .
Unlike similar annotations in imperative languages , the annotations can only affect termination , and not the results ( if any ) .
All these approaches take * demand - driven * evaluation as the starting point : in the absence of annotations , expressions are evaluated only if their value is sure to be required .
An alternative approach is to use a * parallel * evaluation order : that is , all redexes are reduced in parallel , not merely those whose results are sure to be needed .
This strategy also implements non-strict semantics , provided that no redex has its evaluation delayed indefinitely .
A parallel evaluation strategy is followed by the Id programming language [ 2 ] , in which any redex not in the body of a conditional or lambda abstraction will be reduced .
pH is a variant of the Haskell programming language which follows
Id 's parallel evaluation strategy : pH = Haskell syntax and type system +
Id evaluation strategy
In practice , implementations of pH are unlikely to guarantee that every redex will eventually be reduced , which in turn may mean that some programs fail to give a result and terminate when they would do so in " traditional " Haskell .
However , if pH gives a proper ( non-error , non- bottom ) result for a particular program , then so does " traditional " Haskell , and , these results are the same .
I - structures Both Haskell and Id provide arrays , constructed using array comprehensions .
But sometimes array comprehensions are n't quite what you want .
So Id provides I - structures as the " nuts and bolts " through which array comprehensions are implemented , and which can also be used by the sophisticated programmer to implement other encapsulated functional data structures .
I - structures are interesting in their own right : via type declarations they can also be used to allow arbitrary data structures with assignable " holes " in them .
However , each of these holes can be filled at most once .
I - structures are closely related to * logic variables * and are used in similar manner in languages like KL / 1 and Strand .
I - structures depend critically on a precise specification of the evaluation strategy --- specifically , it must be easy to tell just what will be evaluated and what will not .
Id 's parallel evaluation strategy makes this question easy to answer , in contrast to a demand - driven strategy where it is hard to say just what will get evaluated .
( The notion of a control block in an Id program , that is , a group of statements that is guaranteed to be completely executed once initiated , corresponds closely to similar notions in imperative languages . )
I - structures preserve determinacy ( aka the Church - Rosser property ) but do not allow duplication ( and hence free - wheeling substitution ) of unevaluated expressions , since single assignments may thereby become multiple assignments , which are forbidden .
pH adopts I - structures .
( Historical note .
The introduction of array comprehensions has done much to eliminate the need for explicit I - structure programming , so that I - structures are now much less prominent in Id programs than they used to be .
Nowadays , I - structures are mainly used by the compiler in desugaring of array and list comprehensions , library code , or in certain performance - critical loops which , for example , generate two arrays at once .
They are also used extensively as a way to express complex constructs in more primitive forms . )
State and assignment Purely - functional languages deliberately lack assignment , though this leads to a lack of expressiveness which is sometimes trying .
Strict ( almost ) - functional languages , such as SML or Scheme , often re-introduce assignment , but at the cost of specifying a precise sequential evaluation order for all programs , even when it would not otherwise be required .
Introducing state into non-strict functional languages is an active area of research ( e.g. monads , mutable abstract data types ) , but these approaches come mostly at the cost of imposing some sequentiality , in order to preserve a well - defined functional semantics .
Id demonstrates an alternative approach , based on M - structures , which does not come at the cost of ubiquitous sequentiality .
It does n't come for free either -- there is a substantial semantic cost -- but M- structures allow one to express some parallel algorithms which simply cannot be expressed without them .
Proper programming with M- structures requires more fine grain control over the default evaluation order of Id .
This is achieved through the use of local barriers , that is , sequencing of a group of statements , in Id .
M-structures lose determinacy .
pH adopts M-structures , but we recognize that they are still immature .
We hope , that with some experience , a more disciplined use of M- structures will evolve and will be more tractable semantically .
Language structure pH is a layered language : pH( F ) is the purely - functional subset of pH .
Its main addition to Haskell is for - and while - loops .
For example , one could compute the sum of the integers between 1 and n like this : let sum = 0 in for i <- [ 1..n ] do next sum = sum + i finally sum Loops are purely functional , and can easily be translated into a tail recursive function .
Ability to group statements for sequential execution is also part of pH ( F ) , and may be used for resource control .
pH ( I ) adds I - structures to pH ( F ) .
pH ( M ) adds M-structures to pH ( I ) .
Full pH is the same as pH ( M ) .
Stricter versions of pH :
It is well known that it is often more difficult to compile non-strict languages efficiently than the corresponding strict languages .
Thus it also makes sense to explore another dimension : making pH stricter in different ways .
Three variants immediately come to mind :
Make function applications strict ;
Make all data structures strict ; Both of the above .
All these variants should affect only the termination and not the answers produced .
However , for pH ( M ) , these variants would also reduce the set of possible solutions .
Pragmas and Other Annotations :
We expect that there will be a common set of pragmas as well as implementation - specific sets of pragmas for efficient compiling of pH on a variety of architectures .
In particular , we expect to introduce storage layout pragmas in the spirit of HPF ( High Performance FORTRAN ) , to ease the compilation on distributed memory machines .
Each dialect of Haskell may have different pragmas , but their correct use should not affect the result of the un- pragma 'd program .
Implementations : Initial implementations of pH will come from Arvind 's group at the MIT Lab for Computer Science , and from Nikhil at the DEC Cambridge Research Lab .
These implementations would rely on Haskell front ends produced by other groups .
Ultimately , they will replace their authors '
Id implementations and tools .
Mechanical translators from
Id to pH will be easy to create --- the process is little more than transliteration .

Enmity runs deep between arch - foes Iran and Israel .
And that confrontation complicates the lives of Iranian Jews , who make up the largest community of Jews in the Middle East outside the Jewish state .
Iran 's Jews are buffeted by inflammatory rhetoric from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad about " wiping Israel off the map " and denying the Holocaust , and a politically charged environment that often equates all Jews with Israel and routinely witnesses the burning of the " enemy " flag .
But despite what appears to be a dwindling minority under constant threat of persecution , Iranian Jews say they live in relative freedom in the Islamic Republic , remain loyal to the land of their birth , and are striving to separate politics from religion .
They caution against comparing Iran 's official and visceral opposition to the creation of Israel and Zionism with the regime 's acceptance of Jews and Judaism itself .
" If you think Judaism and Zionism are one , it is like thinking Islam and the Taliban are the same , and they are not , " says Ciamak Moresadegh , chairman of the Tehran Jewish Committee .
" We have common problems with Iranian Muslims .
If a war were to start , we would also be a target .
When a missile lands , it does not ask if you are a Muslim or a Jew .
It lands . "
The continuous Jewish presence in Iran predates Islam by more than a millennium .
One wave came when Jews sought to escape Assyrian king Nebuchadnezzar II around 680 BC ; others were freed from slavery by Cyrus the Great with the conquest of Babylon some 140 years later .
Anti-Semitism historically ' rare '
Historically , say Jewish leaders , anti-Semitism here is rare , a fact they say is often lost on critics outside , especially in Israel , where many Iranian Jews have relatives .
Still , the Jewish community has thinned by more than two - thirds since Iran 's 1979 Islamic revolution , to some 25,000 ; the largest exodus took place soon after the Islamic Republic was formed , though a modest flow out continues .
" Our problem is that the Israel issue is not solved , and that affects us here , " says one Iranian Jew who asked not to be named .
But that does not affect every Iranian Jew .
Surgeon Homayoun Mohaber measures his nationalism in blood , and bits of metal – the kind of support that Iranian Jews say has defined their small community 's ties to Iran .
During the Iran - Iraq
War of the 1980s , as an Iranian military surgeon , Dr. Mohaber conducted more than 900 frontline operations , was himself wounded , and gave blood twice to save fellow Iranian soldiers .
Today , in his Tehran clinic , he keeps a jar full of bullets and shrapnel fragments , extracted during the war from wounded soldiers .
" The relations between Jews and Muslims , between 70 million Muslims and 30,000 Jews , are very good , " says Mohaber .
" In Israel , the situation for Iranian Jews is quite misunderstood . "
" [ The Islamic regime ] made very good respect for me all the time , and did not care about my religion after the revolution , " says Mohaber , who avoided a general purge of Jews from the officer ranks after Iran 's 1979 Islamic revolution .
But some episodes have shaken those who remain .
In 1999 , charges of spying for Israel were brought against 13 Jews in Shiraz and Isfahan , sparking a new exodus and widespread fear .
Amid a welter of international criticism , 10 of those charged were handed sentences – later shortened – that ranged from four to 13 years in prison .
Jews in Tehran at the time told the Monitor of their fears that " Zionist groups connected with the US " were hurting their cause by using the issue against Iran .
Today , all 13 are free , and remain living in Iran .
" The effect [ of the Shiraz cases ] was very bad , " recalls Mohaber .
" But they have rectified it .
I think it was a political case between Iran and Israel . "
Fine line between faith and politics
The saga underscored the delicate line Iranian Jews draw daily between their religion and politics .
Outside Iran , " they think our condition is very bad , living as a minority in a religious country , with law based on Islamic law , " says Mr. Moresadegh , of the Jewish Committee .
He notes " some difficulties , " including restrictions on government employment , but says that Mr. Ahmadinejad 's questioning of the Holocaust , while very unwelcome , " has no effect on our daily life . "
The president 's fierce anti-Zionist speeches culminated with Iran hosting a controversial Holocaust conference last December .
" It is quite clear that a bunch of Zionist racists are the problem the modern world is facing today , " the president said in his Iranian New Year message on March 21 .
They aim " to keep the world in a state of hardship , poverty , and grudge and strengthen their rule .
The great nation of Iran is opposed to this inhuman trend . "
The Iranian Foreign Ministry recently facilitated a day - long visit to significant Jewish sites in Tehran for the diplomatic corps .
Privately , Iranian officials said the event was designed to reassure Iranian Jews , after unease over the December conference .
Jewish leaders portrayed themselves as ordinary Iranians , facing the same problems and with the same aspirations for their nation .
" The Jewish community was probably one of the first [ minority groups ] to join in with the revolution , and in this way gave many martyrs , " Maurice Motamed , holder of the one seat set aside for Jews in Iran 's 290 - seat parliament , told the diplomats .
" And after that , during the eight years of the imposed [ Iran - Iraq ] war , there were many martyrs and disabled given to Iranian society . "
" Every revolution is followed by some issues , problems , and restrictions [ on minorities ] , " said Mr. Motamed .
" Fortunately , all these effects have been completely removed in the last ten years . "
The diplomatic tour – with a number of Foreign Affairs Ministry officials – visited a Jewish school , a home for the elderly , a community center , and one of 100 synagogues left from Iran , during Friday Sabbath prayers .
" We have obviously had migration out of Iran , " says Afshin Seleh , a teacher of Jewish heritage with a white yarmulke skullcap , who says he loses two to three students per year in classes of up to 30 .
Upon the walls of the Jewish school are portraits of revolution leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , and Iran 's current supreme religious leader .
" There have been different voices [ coming ] from the government , so people felt unsafe , " says Mr. Seleh .
" But our existence here has always been separate from politics in Iran , and we always had peaceful coexistence with the Muslim community . "
Part of that coexistence has been gratitude for the Dr. Sapir Hospital , a Jewish charity hospital that would have closed years ago , but for subsidies from Jews inside and outside Iran , doctors say .
During the 1979 revolution , the hospital refused to hand over those wounded in clashes with the security forces of the pro-West Shah Reza Pahlavi .
Ayatollah Khomeini later sent a personal representative to express his thanks .
Ahmadinejad , too , has made a $ 27,000 donation .
Still , the Iran - Israel standoff has spilled over into many avenues of life here , with varied results for Iranian Jews .
Strong anti-Zionist undercurrents developed in Iran – and across the Middle East – since Israel 's creation in 1948 .
Those views came to a boil in Tehran after the 1967 war , when Israel crushed Arab foes and occupied the West Bank , Gaza , and Sinai .
That war marked a turning point in Iranians ' attitudes toward the Jewish state , and sometimes toward Iranian Jews .
During the Asian Cup final in 1968 ( which Iran won , 2 - 1 ) Iranian fans wore eye patches and chanted abusive slogans , to mock the Israeli defense chief Moshe Dayan .
According to published reminiscences , " some homes of Jews in Tehran were attacked and set on fire . "
In a match - up between Iran and Israel in the final of the 1974 Asian Games in Tehran , protesters against Israel , members of then - shadowy Islamic groups , prepared to attack the Israeli soccer team .
" Our aim and dream , " recalls Ezat Shahi , identified as a " revolutionary fighter " in recently published memoirs , " was to create an event similar to the 1972 Munich Olympics , when the Israeli team was taken hostage by Palestinian gunmen from " Black September , " in a standoff that left 11 Israeli athletes dead .
Security measures forced protesters to scale back those plans , but rioting broke out that night .
" On that night , [ the authorities ] couldn‚t prevent people from doing what they wanted , " says a witness who asked not to be named .
" As soon as Israel expanded its power [ in the 1967 war ] and oppressed the Palestinians , even the liberal part of Iranian society started to call them Zionists . "
Those flames , encouraged by Islamist groups that would play a key role in the 1979 revolution , helped define the Islamic Republic 's opposition to Israel – but not necessarily to Iranian Jews .
" There is always [ talk ] outside the country that religious minorities are under pressure , " says Mr. Motamed .
" It is important to say that what people say about minorities is completely wrong , "
" Jews here have great Iranian roots – they love Iran , " says chairman Moresadegh .
" Personally , I would stay in Iran no matter what .
I speak in English , I pray in Hebrew , but my thinking is Persian . "

I noted to him that he and other advocates of the patent system are also silent when it is pointed out to them that if they advocate a patent system on wealth - maximization grounds , it is incumbent on them to demonstrate that the patent system is a net benefit–and that no study to date has done so ( as noted in There ’s No Such Thing as a Free Patent ) .
Since I do n’t expect a serious reply from him , I ’ll just reprint a version of the letter to him here :
Greg ,
I find your comments here interesting –when you criticize patent lawyers for their “ silence ” on the isuse of how far principles of patent law can / should be stretched to cover traditionally non-patentable subject matter such as music .
You write , “ when your arguments address such fundamental issues , you are obligated to write about the implications of your argument . ” and “ Here are two questions .
If you ca n’t answer them , you should n’t be practising IP law …. ” and “ It is unethical for patent and copyright lawyers to ignore the growing overlap , and growing clashes , of their two fields of law .
It betrays both the progress of science and their clients ’ interests . ”
Now , I am not sure I agree with your views of ethics and obligations : you give no rationale to support your contention that these types of ethical duties exist ; you merely assert it , as if it is obvious .
An argument that there is such a duty would be interesting to read–I ’d be curious to see you attempt it .
But in any event , what I ’m writing you about is it seems to me there is some inconsistency on your part .
You recently posted about the study that “ software patents have NO NO NO bad effect on industry ” ; I emailed you that this is a weak defense of patents –they do n’t do much damage .
I noted that “ Even if this is true it does nost showpatents are worth the cost–or that there are no costs . ”
Now , you replied :
“ True , but in general .
I am glad to argue with you whether or not all patents are worth the cost ( across industries ) , or that there are no costs associated with patents ( across industries ) .
Because of the sparse data for a complicated econometrics questions ( and the lack of data of business without patents ) , these questions are legitimate . ”
You said you were glad to argue this –yet you refuse to really do so .
Are n’t you doing something as bad as the patent bar you accuse above , when you refuse to accept the implications of your views , or to accept the burden of attempting to provide a justification for something that you support ?
In particular , let me ask you : First , do n’t you agree that most people who argue in favor of patents do so on at least implicit ground that the patent system is “ worth it , ” that is , that we get benefits from it ( increased innovation and disclosure , etc. ) that are greater than the costs of the system ?
Second , do n’t you think the burden of proof is on them to show that there is some kind of net benefit ?
Third , do n’t you agree that this has not been done ?
Show me some study showing the magnitude of the benefits , and costs .
You admit above that my questions are legitimate , and that there is “ sparse data for a complicated econometrics questions ( and the lack of data of business without patents ) ” .
So do you agree with this ?
So where is the argument put forth by the defenders of the patent system ( such as you ) that the patent system is worth it ?
Where is a genuine effort to even point to some study that purports to show this ?
Is it even possible to show it ?
After al , the costs are clearly large and non-trivial ; the benefits are unknown and not clearly demonstrable .
So if you claim the system is justified on the basis of a net benefit–wealth generation–and if it has not been shown , and maybe cannot be shown … does n’t this imply we should not have the system until this can be shown ?
Why the silence from advocates of the patent system when this is pointed out ?
( Recently , patent attorney Dennis Crouch pointed out some example of a “ patent success story ” ; when I pointed out that for it to be a success , it would have to be shown that the benefits he notes are greater than the costs , he basically conceded this point .
( See my discussion of this in “ A Patent Success Story ? ” ) .
Further , as I noted in my post Miracle–An Honest Patent Attorney ! , I had a letter in IP Today , in which I responded to the comments of a patent attorney to the effect that “ the patent system is necessary for there to be invention and innovation . ”
I explained in the letter that
“ There is … no conclusive evidence showing that the purported benefits of the patent system–extra innovation induced by the potential to profit from a patent ; earlier - than - otherwise public disclosure of innovation –exceeds the significant and undeniable costs of the patent system … .
Is the patent system “ worth it ” ?
Who knows ?
Apparently no one does .
It seems to follow that we patent attorneys ought not pretend that we do . ”
I received in response an email from a respected patent attorney , a senior partner in the patent department of a major national law firm , who conceded my point :
Your letter responding to Joe Hosteny ’s comments on Patent Trolls nicely states what I came to realize several years ago , namely , it is unclear that the U.S. Patent System , as currently implemented , necessarily benefits society as a whole .
Certainly , it has benefited [ Hostey ] and his [ partners ] and several of their prominent clients , and has put Marshall , Texas on the map ; but you really have to wonder if the “ tax ” placed on industry by the System ( and its use of juries or lay judges to make the call on often highly complex technical issues that the parties ’ technical experts cannot agree on ) is really worth it .
Of course , anyone can point to a few start - up companies that , arguably , owe their successes to their patent portfolios ; but over the last 35 years , I have observed what would appear to be an ever increasing number of meritless patents , issued by an understaffed and talent - challenged PTO examining group , being used to extract tribute from whole industries .
I have had this discussion with a number of clients , including Asian clients , who have been forced to accept our Patent System and the “ taxes ” it imposes on them as the cost of doing business in the USA .
I wish I had the “ answer ” .
I do n’t . )
So , Greg , let me ask you : why are you silent ?
Why are patent attorneys silent when , after making the robotic claim that we need a patent system to encourage innovation , someone points out to them this means they need to show a * net * benefit , and that this has not been done ?
Do n’t you think your criticism of patent attorneys for being silent about the patentability of music also applies to you and to any other advocate of IP who refuses to seriously engage on the very justification he implicitly appeals to ?

More bad art / physics law at the PTO / IPO – In re Nuijten
The Intellectual Property Owners ( IPO ) just filed an amicus brief to the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit ( CAFC ) in a case , In re Nuijten .
Nuijten is an engineer working for Philips ( the assignee ) trying to patent a new type of watermarked signal .
One of the claims is to the signal itself , which the PTO examiner and his colleagues , and then the PTO Board of Appeals , rejected , because signals are intangible manufactures , not physical , and therefore not patentable .
This is such total nonsense physics that everyone at the PTO associated with this decision should be fired immediately for such an idiotic betrayal of science .
Anything that satisfies Maxwell ’s Equations is physical .
I am sick and tired of such blatant ignorance of physics at the PTO .
Which is what IPO nicely argues in its amicus brief to the CAFC .
In a brief just posted to the IPO Web site ( www.ipo.org), IPO argues first that manufactures do n’t have to be tangible in the first place , so it does n’t matter whether signals are physical or not .
They then argue that even if the law required this , it is very very very very basic physics that signals are physical and thus tangible .
I excerpt some of their arguments below .
Their brief is a very nice read , …. except .
Except that everyone at IPO involved with writing this brief should be reduced to associate level for inept thinking .
The brief was written by IPO President Marc Adler , IPO Amicus Brief Committee chair Richard Phillips , and two lawyers from Covington and Burling – Roderick McKelvie and Peter Swanson .
Why should they all be demoted for ineptness ?
While the PTO in its ignorance betrays science , these four lawyers in their ineptness betray art , which like it or not , is for the most part is patentable in all aspects .
FOR YOU DO NOT WRITE A SERIOUS BRIEF ARGUING THAT SIGNALS ARE PATENTABLE AS IS WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF MUSIC SIGNALS .
Music is fundamentally one type of signal .
At a minimum , there are the acoustical physics aspects of music signals , and more interestingly , there are the neurophysical aspects of music signals .
Music is a music signal .
If IPO truly believes what it wrote in the brief , then IPO fully supports the patenting of music ( assuming one can describe music in accordance with 35 USC 112 ) .
Flash News !!!!
IPO fully supports the patenting of music .
IPO wisely cites Stephen Kunin ’s great article on the patentability of signals , which I mentioned some time ago in PATNEWS .
Yet like Stephen , IPO is silent on patenting MUSIC signals .
Why this fear of discussing such an interesting concept – patenting music signals ?
For if music signals are patentable , this practice will greatly affect many of the clients of these lawyers .
Are music signals – signals ?
For example , some of the board of directors of IPO listed on the amicus brief are Q. Todd Dickinson of GE ( which has an entertainment division ) , Bart Eppenauer of Microsoft ( heavily involved with entertainment ) , Jack Haken of Philips ( involved with entertainment ) who is also the appellate lawyer in this case , and Richard Lutton of Apple Computer ( which is trying to redefine the music marketplace ) .
Did it not occur to any of these highly paid lawyers to consider that for IPO to make this argument in this brief is for IPO to also agree that music is patentable , which would affect all of their businesses if the CAFC rules in favor of Nuitjen ?
I mean , many of these people get PATNEWS , and I have addressed this issue in the past – the growing patentability of music and movies after Lundgren ( www.bustpatents.com/sec101/musicelr.pdf).
Briefs such as IPO ’s in this case just further reinforce my arguments and this new trend .
So why the silence from all of these lawyers ?
It makes no sense .
Now I know that lawyers will say – you only argue the specific issues of the case ( except if you are writing briefs for IBM ) , but when your arguments address such fundamental issues , you are obligated to write about the implications of your argument .
And the implication of the IPO argument is that music is patentable .
Yet IPO is still too cowardly to even discuss such an implication at its meetings .
Heck , I doubt IPO even has a copy of my book , Patenting Art and Entertainment ( Nolo ) , at its headquarters .
Here are two questions .
If you ca n’t answer them , you should n’t be practising IP law .
1 ) If signals are patentable , and music is a signal , then is music patentable as a useful article of manufacture ?
IPO ’s brief + the physics of music ==== > YES ?
2 ) If music is patentable as a useful article of manufacture , and useful articles are not copyrightable , then is music uncopyrightable ?
IPO ’s brief + the physics of music + copyright caselaw ==== > YES ?
It is unethical for patent and copyright lawyers to ignore the growing overlap , and growing clashes , of their two fields of law .
It betrays both the progress of science and their clients ’ interests .
========
Some excerpts from IPO ’s brief :
[ The PTO Board of Appeals ] affirmed the rejection of the signal claims , concluding that signals per se are not patentable subject matter .
Id at 7 .
In reaching this conclusion , the Board found that these claims are not directed to signals with physical properties , such as electrical or electromagnetic
signals .
At a minimum , PTO Board activities should be suspended until it can be confirmed that ALL of the judges understand the basics of modern science .
Some are too ignorant of science to be involved with any decisions involving science .
Electrical or electromagnetic signals are not physical ?
That is complete nonsense .
Maxwell ’s Equations are one of the most fundamental and beautiful physical equations in this history of mankind , and Maxwell ’s Equations goven electromagnetic signals .
Electromagnetic signals are not physical ?
Then go stick your head in a microwave oven , or your hand in a laser beam .
John Doll , you are a physicist – please take a bat and go around the PTO smacking anyone who does n’t believe signals are physical .
I am tired of some judges pretending that they understand science while making decisions involving science ( which is why copyright caselaw involving 17 USC 102 mostly nonsense bullshirt ) .
I am also tired of judges in copyright cases ignoring the basics of patent law .
In addition , the Board had found that the category of manufactures is limited to tangible articles .
It then assumed that electrical signals per se are intangible energy and not tangible items .
“ Intangible energy ” ?
That is an infinitely nonsensical phrase .
Hey buttheads on the PTO Board – ever hear of ….. Einstein , and his special theory of relativity , E = mc^2 and all that , which the PTO loves citing in its 101 arguments without realizing that what it means is that energy and matter , PHYSICAL matter , are the same thing .
I want these Board members fired immediately , rehired , and then fired again .
IPO then starts attacking the various arguments of the Bored of Appeals .
IPO first starts with a platitude it does n’t fully believe :
As this case demonstrates , new advances in science and technology often blur once - clear boundaries , such as the line between tangible and intangible things .
Yes IPO , I agree , and one of the blurred boundaries that science and engineering are eliminating is between art and science , opening up all of the world of art to patenting , including music signals .
Now to the heart of IPO ’s strong argument :
Something is tangible if it is “ able to be perceived as materially existent ” .
Webster ’s dictionary .
In general , an electrical signal is a flow of electron that varies over time .
Hey IPO , electromagnetic waves are signals as well – photons are physical - do n’t use the word “ general ” here .
Also physical signals can be made of phonons , electron holes , spins , etc. IPO needs to learn some modern physics .
Electrons are physical particles that have mass , and they are both measureable and detectable .
Their flow , which forms the electrical signal , is also measurable and detectable .
Accordingly , an electrical signal , as a flow of electrons , meets the definition of tangible since it is able to be perceived as materially existent .
Sadly , IPO is silent on the Bored ’s “ intangible energy ” argument , since it would have been a good opportunity to clarify the role of Special Relativity in 101 arguments – that energy and matter are the same thing .
The board of directors of IPO really needs to have a physicist .
In the 21st century , PTO ( and EPO ) judges should not be making such stupid mistakes of physics .
All members of the PTO Board of Appeals should be required to take CLE sources in the fundamentals of physics and mathematics .
And in the 21st century , IPO should not be engaged in such cowardly thinking where it argues that all signals are patentable , which should presumably include music signals .
If you ca n’t think and make the big thought arguments , you should n’t be making the big bucks .
As a first step towards enlightenment , IPO should buy a copy of my book , Patenting Art and Entertainment , for all of its board of director members .
So should all PATNEWS readers who already have n’t :-)

On a recent ski vacation in Utah , my daughter and I took a breather from the slopes one day to do some exploring .
We decided to take our excursion to a place in American history , Promontory Summit , Utah .
Promontory is not a place you just happen to run across .
Located northwest of Salt Lake City and north of the Great Salt Lake , Promontory is literally in no -man 's - land of the western plains .
This isolated spot on the map is the place where the railroads of the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific met completing the transcontinental rail line .
What was to be a walk through American history trivia for my daughter and me , turned out to be an economic lesson in the absurdity of government subsidies .
After perusing the railroad artifacts inside the Promontory museum and taking the obligatory picture of the spot on the rail line where the Golden Spike was driven , we set out approximately three or four miles east to a spot where our self - guided walking tour would start .
The Big Fill Trail allows you to walk along a mile and a half of railroad grade that was created by both the Central Pacific moving east from Sacramento and the Union Pacific moving west from Omaha .
It has been well noted in history that these two railroads were given land grants , low interest - rate loans , and direct subsidies by the federal government .
The subsidies were graduated according to the difficulty of the terrain being traversed with $ 16,000 paid for construction over an easy grade and up to $ 48,000 for grades in the mountains .
Additionally , changes to the Pacific Railroad
Act allowed payment of subsidies for grading which could extend as far as 300 miles ahead of the tracks being laid .
At the second stop on the trail , the perverseness caused by the subsidies was in full view .
At that moment we were standing on the grade built by the Central Pacific and there less than fifty yards below was the grade built by the Union Pacific .
The grades did not meet but ran parallel to each other and had continued that way for 250 miles — almost a year 's work .
It was also noted in the guidebook that the work camps for the two groups were literally separated by a hillside .
It was now apparent to my daughter , laughing out loud , that these two railroads had no intention of meeting .
The purpose of grading and laying tracks was not to meet the demand for transcontinental passenger service , but simply to collect , risk - free of any market forces , the federal subsidies .
Any doubt about this conclusion would be quickly erased up ahead at the tour stop overlooking Spring Creek Ravine .
The Central Pacific constructed a " big fill " of earth to span their portion of the ravine so track could be laid safely upon the ground .
Below the " big fill " the Union Pacific spared neither time nor safety by constructing a rickety - wooden trestle across the gulch .
The trestle , which was 85 feet high and 400 feet long , was so flimsily built that one reporter suggested , " It will shake the nerves of the stoutest hearts of railroad travelers when they see what a few feet of round timbers and seven - inch spikes are expected to uphold — a train in motion . "
Of course the trestle was not meant to uphold a passenger train ; it was built to transfer the money from Washington to the coffers of the Union Pacific Railroad .
It also became clear that the treacherous route taken by the Central Pacific blasting through the Sierra Nevada Mountains was more of a matter of financial begging than passenger convenience .
Eventually the powers in Washington DC realized what was taking place and ordered the two railroads to link up at Promontory Summit which was ceremoniously achieved on May 10 , 1869 .
What happened next is almost totally absent from our history texts .
Because of the poor manner in which the rail lines were laid , work began almost immediately to reconstruct the entire project .
Three years after the celebrated meeting at Promontory Summit the Union Pacific Railroad was bankrupt .
Here we are 138 years later with many people still believing in the economic virtues of subsidies from farm programs to energy development .
It makes me smile to know that there is at least now one fifteen - year - old girl , with the image of parallel grades in her mind , who sees the fallacy of it all .
CVS Logs and ChangeLogs
Here are some tips on writing CVS log messages so they work as ChangeLog entries too .
todo : more cvs-log - oriented discussion is needed
These are excerpted and paraphrased from Jim Blandy 's somewhat longer essay " Maintaining the ChangeLog " , included later on this page and also highly recommended .
Writing Log Entries ===================
Certain guidelines should be adhered to when writing log messages :
Make a log entry for every change .
The value of the log becomes much less if developers cannot rely on its completeness .
Even if you 've only changed comments , write an entry that says , " Doc fix . "
The only changes you need n't log are small changes that have no effect on the source , like formatting tweaks .
Log entries should be full sentences , not sentence fragments .
Fragments are more often ambiguous , and it takes only a few more seconds to write out what you mean .
Fragments like ` New file ' or ` New function ' are acceptable , because they are standard idioms , and all further details should appear in the source code .
The log entry should name every affected function , variable , macro , makefile target , grammar rule , etc , including the names of symbols that are being removed in this commit .
This helps people do automated searches through the logs later .
Do n't hide names in wildcards , because the globbed portion may be what someone searches for later .
For example , this is bad : ( twirling_baton_ * ) : removed these obsolete structures .
( handle_parser_warning ) : pass data directly to callees , instead of storing in twirling_baton_ *.
Later on , when someone is trying to figure out what happened to `twirling_baton_fast ' , they may not find it if they just search for " fast " .
A better entry would be : ( twirling_baton_fast , twirling_baton_slow ) : removed these obsolete structures .
( handle_parser_warning ) : pass data directly to callees , instead of storing in twirling_baton_ *.
The wildcard is okay in the description for `handle_parser_warning ' , but only because the two structures were mentioned by full name elsewhere in the log entry .
There are some common - sense exceptions to the need to name everything that was changed : * If you have made a change which requires trivial changes throughout the rest of the program ( e.g. , renaming a variable ) , you need n't name all the functions affected .
*
If you have rewritten a file completely , the reader understands that everything in it has changed , so your log entry may simply give the file name , and say " Rewritten " .
In general , there is a tension between making entries easy to find by searching for identifiers , and wasting time or producing unreadable entries by being exhaustive .
Use your best judgement --- and be considerate of your fellow developers .
For large changes or change groups , group the log entry into paragraphs separated by blank lines .
Each paragraph should be a set of changes that accomplishes a single goal .
Independent changes should be in separate paragraphs .
It helps to start out each group with a sentence or two summarizing the change .
One should never need the log entries to understand the current code .
If you find yourself writing a significant explanation in the log , you should consider carefully whether your text does n't actually belong in a comment , alongside the code it explains .
Here 's an example of doing it right : ( consume_count ) : If `count ' is unreasonable , return 0 and do n't advance input pointer .
And then , in `consume_count ' in `cplus - dem.c ' : while ( isdigit ( ( unsigned char ) * * type ) ) { count *= 10 ; count += ** type - ' 0 ' ; /* A sanity check .
Otherwise a symbol like `_Utf390_1__1_9223372036854775807__9223372036854775 ' can cause this function to return a negative value .
In this case we just consume until the end of the string .
*/ if ( count > strlen ( * type ) ) { * type = save ; return 0 ; } This is why a new function , for example , needs only a log entry saying " New Function " --- all the details should be in the source .
The above is taken from a longer essay by Jim Blandy , " Maintaining the ChangeLog " , reproduced here :
Maintaining the ChangeLog =========================
A project 's ChangeLog provides a history of development .
Comments in the code should explain the code 's present state , but ChangeLog entries should explain how and when it got that way .
The ChangeLog must show : * the relative order in which changes entered the code , so you can see the context in which a change was made , and * the date at which the change entered the code , so you can relate the change to outside events , like branch cuts , code freezes , and releases .
In the case of CVS , these refer to when the change was committed , because that is the context in which other developers will see the change .
Every change to the sources should have a ChangeLog entry .
The value of the ChangeLog becomes much less if developers cannot rely on its completeness .
Even if you 've only changed comments , write an entry that says , " Doc fix . "
The only changes you need n't log are small changes that have no effect on the source , like formatting tweaks .
In order to keep the ChangeLog a manageable size , at the beginning of each year , the ChangeLog should be renamed to " ChangeLog - YYYY " , and a fresh ChangeLog file started .
How to write ChangeLog entries
------------------------------
ChangeLog entries should be full sentences , not sentence fragments .
Fragments are more often ambiguous , and it takes only a few more seconds to write out what you mean .
Fragments like ` New file ' or ` New function ' are acceptable , because they are standard idioms , and all further details should appear in the source code .
The log entry should mention every file changed .
It should also mention by name every function , variable , macro , makefile target , grammar rule , etc. you changed .
However , there are common - sense exceptions : * If you have made a change which requires trivial changes throughout the rest of the program ( e.g. , renaming a variable ) , you need n't name all the functions affected .
*
If you have rewritten a file completely , the reader understands that everything in it has changed , so your log entry may simply give the file name , and say " Rewritten " .
In general , there is a tension between making entries easy to find by searching for identifiers , and wasting time or producing unreadable entries by being exhaustive .
Use your best judgement --- and be considerate of your fellow developers .
Group ChangeLog entries into " paragraphs " , separated by blank lines .
Each paragraph should be a set of changes that accomplish a single goal .
Independent changes should be in separate paragraphs .
For example : 1999-03 - 24 Stan Shebs < shebs@andros.cygnus.com >
* configure.host ( mips- dec- mach3 * ) :
Use mipsm3 , not mach3 .
Attempt to sort out SCO - related configs .
* configure.host ( i[ 3456]86-*-sysv4.2* ) :
Use this instead of i[3456]86-*-sysv4.2MP
and i[3456]86-*-sysv4.2uw2 *. ( i[ 3456]86-*-sysv5* ) : Recognize this .
* configure.tgt ( i[ 3456]86-*-sco3.2v5 * , i[ 3456]86-*-sco3.2v4* ) : Recognize these .
Even though this entry describes two changes to `configure .
host ' , they 're in separate paragraphs , because they 're unrelated changes .
The second change to `configure . host ' is grouped with another change to `configure . tgt ' , because they both serve the same purpose .
Also note that the author has kindly recorded his overall motivation for the paragraph , so we do n't have to glean it from the individual changes .
The header line for the ChangeLog entry should have the format shown above .
If you are using an old version of Emacs ( before 20.1 ) that generates entries with more verbose dates , consider using `etc / add - log.el ' , from the GDB source tree .
If you are using vi , consider using the macro in `etc / add- log.vi ' .
Both of these generate entries in the newer , terser format .
One should never need the ChangeLog to understand the current code .
If you find yourself writing a significant explanation in the ChangeLog , you should consider carefully whether your text does n't actually belong in a comment , alongside the code it explains .
Here 's an example of doing it right : 1999 - 02 - 23 Tom Tromey < tromey@cygnus.com >
* cplus-dem.c ( consume_count ) : If `count ' is unreasonable , return 0 and do n't advance input pointer .
And then , in `consume_count ' in `cplus - dem.c ' : while ( isdigit ( ( unsigned char ) * * type ) ) { count *= 10 ; count += ** type - ' 0 ' ; /* A sanity check .
Otherwise a symbol like `_Utf390_1__1_9223372036854775807__9223372036854775 ' can cause this function to return a negative value .
In this case we just consume until the end of the string .
*/ if ( count > strlen ( * type ) ) { * type = save ; return 0 ; } This is why a new function , for example , needs only a log entry saying " New Function " --- all the details should be in the source .
Avoid the temptation to abbreviate filenames or function names , as in this example ( mostly real , but slightly exaggerated ) : * gdbarch.[ch ] ( gdbarch_tdep , gdbarch_bfd_arch_info , gdbarch_byte_order , {set,}gdbarch_long_bit , {set, }gdbarch_long_long_bit , {set, }gdbarch_ptr_bit ) : Corresponding functions .
This makes it difficult for others to search the ChangeLog for changes to the file or function they are interested in .
For example , if you searched for `set_gdbarch_long_bit ' , you would not find the above entry , because the writer used CSH - style globbing to abbreviate the list of functions .
If you gave up , and made a second pass looking for gdbarch.c , you would n't find that either .
Consider your poor readers , and write out the names .
ChangeLogs and the CVS log --------------------------
CVS maintains its own logs , which you can access using the `cvs log ' command .
This duplicates the information present in the ChangeLog , but binds each entry to a specific revision , which can be helpful at times .
However , the CVS log is no substitute for the ChangeLog files .
* CVS provides no easy way to see the changes made to a set of files in chronological order .
They 're sorted first by filename , not by date .
* Unless you put full ChangeLog paragraphs in your CVS log entries , it 's difficult to pull together changes that cross several files .
* CVS does n't segregate log entries for branches from those for the trunk in any useful way .
In some circumstances , though , the CVS log is more useful than the ChangeLog , so we maintain both .
When you commit a change , you should provide appropriate text in both the ChangeLog and the CVS log .
It is not necessary to provide CVS log entries for ChangeLog changes , since it would simply duplicate the contents of the file itself .
Writing ChangeLog entries for merges
------------------------------------
Revision management software like CVS can introduce some confusion when writing ChangeLog entries .
For example , one might write a change on a branch , and then merge it into the trunk months later .
In that case , what position and date should the developer use for the ChangeLog entry --- that of the original change , or the date of the merge ?
The principles described at the top need to hold for both the original change and the merged change .
That is : *
On the branch ( or trunk ) where the change is first committed , the ChangeLog entry should be written as normal , inserted at the top of the ChangeLog and reflecting the date the change was committed to the branch ( or trunk ) .
*
When the change is then merged ( to the trunk , or to another branch ) , the ChangeLog entry should have the following form : 1999-03 - 26 Jim Blandy < jimb@zwingli.cygnus.com >
Merged change from foobar_20010401 _branch : 1999-03-16 Keith Seitz < keiths@cygnus.com > [...]
In this case , " Jim Blandy " is doing the merge on March 26 ; " Keith Seitz " is the original author of the change , who committed it to `foobar_20010401 _branch ' on March 16 .
As shown here , the entry for the merge should be like any other change --- inserted at the top of the ChangeLog , and stamped with the date the merge was committed .
It should indicate the origin of the change , and provide the full text of the original entry , indented to avoid being confused with a true log entry .
Remember that people looking for the merge will search for the original changelog text , so it 's important to preserve it unchanged .
For the merge entry , we use the merge date , and not the original date , because this is when the change appears on the trunk or branch this ChangeLog documents .
Its impact on these sources is independent of when or where it originated .
This approach preserves the structure of the ChangeLog ( entries appear in order , and dates reflect when they appeared ) , but also provides full information about changes ' origins .

In a number of ways , The Atomic Bazaar is a very disturbing book .
Written by William Langewiesche — who served for years as a national correspondent for the Atlantic Monthly , in which this material first appeared — it exposes the secret progress of nuclear weapons proliferation over the past few decades .
Based on extensive investigation of licit and illicit nuclear technology ventures , it provides a dismaying portrait of how national rivalries , supplemented by human greed , are producing an ever more dangerous world .
Langewiesche begins by taking a look at the nuclear issue that most frequently grabs the attention of the communications media and of the American public : the prospect of terrorists acquiring nuclear weapons .
Somewhat reassuringly , he does not think it likely that they will obtain such weapons on their own .
Although he provides a frightening picture of rotting , lightly - guarded nuclear weapons facilities in Russia , surrounded by sullen , desperate local citizens , he considers a commando - style raid there by terrorists unlikely to succeed .
International smuggling of highly - enriched uranium out of Russia is a better bet , he concedes , especially given the country ’s porous southern borders .
Nevertheless , as he remarks , " The construction of a bomb is not a casual project , " and might well be discovered by snooping neighbors or the authorities , even in chaotically governed nations .
Thus , he concludes , the odds are stacked against a would - be nuclear terrorist .
Terrorism , however , does not constitute the greatest nuclear danger .
Washington , London , and New York , Langewiesche argues , " are unlikely anytime soon to suffer a nuclear strike — though certainly the possibility exists .
More at risk for now . . . are the cities of the nuclear - armed poor , particularly on the Indian subcontinent , and in the Middle East . "
In the past few years , millions of Indians and Pakistanis twice came close to nuclear annihilation , and " this is the world in which increasingly we live , of societies . . . that are weak and unstable but also nuclear - armed . "
Pakistan , particularly , Langewiesche notes , " is the great proliferator of our time . "
And this , in turn , owes much to the work of Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan .
Trained as a metallurgist , Khan began his career as a nuclear proliferator in the mid-1970s , when he returned to Pakistan from employment in the Netherlands .
Drawing upon stolen nuclear designs , he dramatically built up Pakistan ’s nuclear facilities through the Khan Research Laboratories , which produced highly enriched uranium , the fissionable material necessary for Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons , and designed the warheads and missiles to deliver them .
Along the way , Khan became a sort of demigod in Pakistan , living in luxury , accepting awards of every kind ( including six honorary doctoral degrees , 45 gold medals , and three gold crowns ) , and , as Langewiesche notes , " holding forth on diverse subjects — science , health , history , world politics , poetry , and ( his favorite ) the magnitude of his achievements . "
In fact , Khan was not an independent operator , for his nuclear activities received the lavish support of the Pakistani government .
Langewiesche observes that Khan ’s budget " was apparently unlimited .
Eventually he hired as many as ten thousand people , " and " also launched a massive shopping spree in Europe and the United States . "
Given his government ’s largesse , Khan could offer two or three times the going rate for nuclear - related products manufactured by corporations in more industrially advanced nations — products which they happily provided .
Khan ’s importance to the Pakistani regime reached an apparent zenith in 1998 , when it exploded its first atomic bombs .
Shortly after a technician pushed a button and proclaimed " Allah - o - Akbar " ( God is great ) , a fierce nuclear explosion shook the test mountain , shrouding it in dust .
Pakistan had become a nuclear nation .
By this point , Khan was dealing on a much larger stage .
Eager to enhance his considerable personal fortune , he sold vital nuclear information and material to the governments of Libya and Iran .
During the 1990s , he also worked out a deal with the North Korean regime , in which that government provided him with missile prototypes ( which were then modified and produced at the Khan Research Laboratories ) and he provided that government with centrifuge prototypes and advice on uranium enrichment and procurement .
Ultimately , these arrangements led to Khan ’s downfall .
With Khan ’s extensive nuclear sales operations revealed by the Libyan government , the U.S. government demanded that Pakistan ’s dictator , General Pouvez Musharraf , take action against him .
Although Musharraf and other Pakistani officials were deeply complicit in Khan ’s activities , the general arranged to have Khan make a formal confession on television in which he accepted the sole blame for them .
" I also wish to clarify , " Khan stated on that occasion , " that there was never ever any kind of authorization for these activities by the government . "
As a reward for Khan ’s willingness to take the heat , Musharraf pardoned him .
But the general kept Khan under house arrest in one of his mansions , where he would remain out of sight , out of mischief , and out of reach of independent inquiries .
For Langewiesche , the moral of this sad story of corruption and the dispersal of nuclear weaponry is not to abandon efforts at nuclear nonproliferation , but to find " the courage in parallel to accept the equalities of a maturing world in which many countries have acquired atomic bombs , and some may use them . "
But much of his evidence can also support a different conclusion — one pointing to the failure of nuclear - armed nations to live up to their responsibilities .
Time after time , as Langewiesche shows , the U.S. government — despite repeated warnings from U.S. intelligence agencies — was content to ignore Khan ’s operations because of the assistance Pakistan could provide to U.S. military ventures .
For example , starting in 1979 , the U.S. government drew upon Pakistan as a base for anti-Soviet operations in Afghanistan .
Beginning in 2001 , it cozied up to Pakistan to secure that nation ’s cooperation in subduing Al Qaeda and the Taliban in that same country .
In these circumstances , the U.S. government found it relatively easy to accommodate itself to Pakistan ’s role as a nuclear nation and , for a time at least , as a nuclear Wal - Mart .
Furthermore , as Langewiesche concedes , much of motivation for building the Bomb among Third World leaders was based on their resentment at the world ’s nuclear two - tier system : nuclear weapons for some nations and no nuclear weapons for them .
There was , as he writes , " a moralistic rejection of the discriminatory nuclear order . "
For all his venality , Khan shared this sense of grievance .
" I want to question the bloody holier - than - thou attitudes of the Americans and the British , " he wrote in the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel , in 1979 .
" Are these bastards God-appointed guardians of the world to stockpile hundreds of thousands of nuclear warheads , and have they God - given authority to carry out explosions every month ? "
By contrast , if Pakistanis " start a modest programme , we are the satans , the devils . "
Although Khan exaggerated the numbers of nuclear warheads possessed by the U.S. and British governments , he did not exaggerate their national arrogance .
Of course , coupling the abandonment of nuclear weapons by the nuclear nations with the renunciation of nuclear weapons by non-nuclear nations is the bargain that was struck under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 .
If we want nuclear safety , it is more likely to come in that form than in the form of further nuclear proliferation .
But moving in the direction of this kind of equal playing field — a nuclear - free world — requires that the nuclear powers accept the responsibility to fulfill their treaty commitment to their own nuclear disarmament .
Until that happens , we can expect what Langewiesche predicts : further nuclear proliferation and a heightened danger of nuclear war .

A PALEO - ECONOMIC PALATE CLEANSING SIDEBAR BEFORE WE MOVE TO TRANSPORTATION
A recent article in the Economist points out that comparative advantage also works at our most basic level of trade ( male / female ) and was of historical significance :
In existing pre-agricultural societies there is , famously , a division of food - acquiring labour between men , who hunt , and women , who gather .
And in a paper just published in Current Anthropology , Steven Kuhn and Mary Stiner of the University of Arizona propose that this division of labour happened early in the species ' history , and that it is what enabled modern humans to expand their population at the expense of Neanderthals .
TRANSPORTATION
Transportation as % of total energy use - Click to Enlarge
In the 1960s transportation accounted for about 23 % of all energy expended in the USA - now the figure is approaching 28 % .
The yellow line ( almost on top of the pink line ) shows of the transportation , 99 % of it is oil ( there is some electrical , natural gas and coal usage ) ( 3 ) .
We are really dependent on oil !
The following two graphs show the energy efficiencies of various modes of transportation first for people and then for goods .
This first graph is from Richard Heinberg 's book " The Oil Depletion Protocol " and is based on data from Britain ( which Richard tells me is fairly universal ) :
MegaJoules per passenger - Click to Enlarge
As can be seen , the bicycle is the most energy efficient mode of transportation - even better than walking .
The other insight from the graph is we gain quite a bit of efficiency from packing a lot in one vehicle .
( This is a concept used often in China )
As far as transporting goods , there is a large disparity in energy efficiency per ton mile for different transport methods :
Energy Intensity per ton mile by freight mode .
Source - EIA Click to Enlarge
The above graph is somewhat dated ( 1991 ) , Though there have been efficiency improvements across the board , the general model of water / rail / truck / air in order of efficiency seems to still be intuitively correct , though some argue that rail is more efficient than water .
It is actually quite a complicated issue as it depends what one is transporting and the sequence of steps .
Alan Drake recently did a study showing rail transport to be 8.3 times as efficient as trucking .
One can visualize the energy efficiency / footprint of various transportation modes as something like this pyramid :
The Transportation Pyramid .
Click to Enlarge
As transportation costs increase , communities and regions that are able to effect movement downwards on the pyramid towards its base will have comparative advantages , due to savings on energy costs , and availability of products .
ENERGY USE AND HUMAN WANTS AND NEEDS
Let 's now shift gears just a bit .
Psychologist Abraham Maslow theorized that humans meet basic needs in a hierarchical fashion .
Once basic needs are met , we seek to satisfy higher needs such as self actualization and fulfillment .
In the current era of cheap oil , at least for western society , a very small % of energy is spent on basic needs in proportion to the energy intensive ' desires ' that drive western society :
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs------------------Nate's Intuitive but Made Up Hierarchy of Energy Use. Click to Enlarge
This concept can be expanded upon .
We sometimes take for granted the things that we really need , and make us happy - I am 90 % as happy eating fried fish from a local lake as I am driving to Chicago to my favorite sushi restaurant ( well at least 80 % ) .
Higher personal consumption efficiencies in an energy challenged world are lower on the pyramid .
The Consumption Pyramid - Click to Enlarge
We finally come full circle to the spark plug question .
There is a great movement ( at least in the peak oil circles , not yet in the peak credit circles ) towards relocalization .
But ' local ' labels in many cases are misleading due to the insidious reliance on foreign parts at different moments in the supply chain .
One of my best and oldest friends is an entrepreneur from China .
He owns a business in Connecticut that seeks out American companies that need nails , screws , and small metal parts at their factories - he then signs contracts for 5 million screws at 2.5 cents each - screws that in the US would cost 6 or 7 cents due to higher labor etc .
He pockets half the difference .
The point being that our basic goods might ostensibly be made here , but their component parts may not .
I have not seen a way to measure this so have come up with my own , " the Embedded Transportation Chain " .
First Order Origin represents where you buy something ( in your town would be 100 % local ) .
Second Order Origin represents where the components and parts came from on the product you bought .
And Third Order Origin represents where the raw materials came from for the parts to make the Second Order Origin parts .
To determine how ' local ' ( in the sustainability and security sense ) a product is , one would multiply Level 1 * Level 2 * Level 3 .
Of course , there is very little that is truly local , as a world of increasing international trade has increased ' Third Order Origin ' percentages dramatically .
( I do n’t have accessible data on this - the amount of work would be closer to an academic paper – here I just wanted to lay out the idea ) .
True to the field of economics , I have made these terms up .
However , also consistent with economics , one can grasp the common sense implications .
When looked at in this 3 - tiered light , the phrase “ Made in America ” , takes on different meaning .
The Transportation Origin Chain - Click to Enlarge
I currently reside in Wisconsin .
To eat local is cheese curds , fried fish and venison .
All these things can be bought ( or harvested ) locally .
But the cheese company gets milk transported from around the state , uses packaging made overseas from natural gas .
Its employees drive to work using cars made in Japan and oil from Nigeria and eat food imported from New Zealand .
Although the dairy farmers themselves use largely local inputs for feed and bedding , their milk buckets are made from steel processed in China , and the wood for the barn comes from a mill in Canada .
It is not easy to decipher the ‘ localness ’ of a product , unless one walks out and picks a wild mushroom .
Use your imagination however to consider WHAT IF oil doubles triples or more in price , what sort of domino effects might occur in the production supply lines .
It is hard to predict what " Liebigs product of the month " might disappear from the store shelves - Charmin bath tissue one week and Stihl chain saw blades the next .
A quick example is footwear .
98 % of all shoes in the United States are made somewhere else , many in China .
CONCLUSIONS
Increases in efficiency of goods production in a global context are considered a good thing , as they raise respective countries GDP , and allocate resources wherefore the total pie gets bigger .
Once on this track however , participants continue to strive for more and more efficiency , more trade advantage and cheaper production .
If taken to its natural extreme , every place on earth will specialize to the maximum profit of corporations .
Implicit in this path is the forgoing of expertise and local resources that are lower down the pyramid of human necessities .
If transport costs are 20 % of a products value and oil doubles or triples , they become upwards of 50 % of a products cost .
Certain products then become uneconomic to ship .
Some of those products are components of larger products which do not have local substitutes .
High quality and abundant oil has obfuscated the difference between wants and needs .
At a Walmart or a Safeway , young people today see quilted bathroom tissue , pork chops , colorful shoes , dental floss , and avocados as a natural smorgasbord , without internalizing the complex energy / trade chain that put them there .
This plethora of choices that globalization offers us could just not be possible in local or regionally based economies .
In some senses , to revert the global network of specialization back towards less complex , more regional networks is kind of a chicken - or - the - egg dilemma .
Unless we change the consumption drivers , there will be little incentive for the manufacturers of nascar lunch boxes to move downwards the production / transport and global / local pyramids .
When ( and in my opinion its only a matter of when ) oil becomes less available / affordable , centralized forms of energy command will not be efficient because different regional blocks and localities possess their own comparative energy and resource advantages and disadvantages .
National umbrella energy policies treat all states the same .
Corn ethanol roll out is a prime example - what might be great for communities in Iowa and Minnesota has different math for California and Vermont .
We know that distance impacts energy efficiency and costs .
We also know that different states ( and countries ) have different indigenous energy resources ( Quebec has hydro – Arizona has sun , Montana has wind and coal , etc ) .
It is likely there will be decentralization of energy production as regions move towards building blocks of basic needs in safer spatial scales .
The magic of comparative advantage can still work in the second half of oil .
But it ultimately will differentiate between basic needs and unnecessary desires - and take advantage of water and railway access .
THE BOTTOM LINE
1 . We need oil for more than just driving .
It is embedded in almost everything .
Unless you 're Amish , Aleutian , or have alot of friends , oil is life in the USA ( at least currently ) .
2 . Higher oil prices combined with lower ( or no ) credit availability will eventually make certain types of modern trade prohibitive .
As such there is shortfall risk in modern supply chains that is not in current economic forecasts .
3 . Those nations , regions , communities and families that produce lower on the left graph and consume lower on the right graph will have an advantage when transportation costs increase .
Those communities using predominantly rail and water transport will have advantages over those more dependent on truck and air , everything else being equal .
4 . As is occurring in some South American nations currently ( Peru and Venezuela come to mind ) , a return to the import substitution model away from the so - called Washington consensus seems inevitable .
However , remember the supply / demand wedges in the Hirsch / Bezdek report showing how rapidly production shortfalls could occur .
Local , regional and national action needs to be taken soon because of the required long lead times .
5 . In rich nations , in addition to conserving , it will be advantageous to begin to be happier with ' less ' because the delta of ' desires ' may change slower than that of ' things ' available in the future , relative to other countries ( e.g. Europe and Africa ) that exhibit lower energy footprints .
In other words , though the USA can easily get by with half as much energy - intensive stuff and conveniences , an abrupt change to this level will be much more mentally painful than a gradual one .
In conclusion , as a thought experiment , the next time you go to your nearest box store , look at the gazillion products on display .
Try to imagine where they come from , where their parts come from , and how that supply chain might change when new oil production fails to match decline rates of older wells .
While you are there , you might notice how many of the myriad products improve yours or your friends lives , and how many do not .
This ' demand ' side view of Peak Oil will be the subject of my next post .

Since a few folks have asked on irc and they are not using my innovative comment - reading service , am reposting ( with some slight edits and clarifications ) the answer to " Will Mono implement C# 3.0 ? "
Yes , we will be implementing C# 3.0 .
We have been waiting for two reasons : first , we wanted to focus on bug fixing the existing compilers to ensure that we have a solid foundation to build upon .
I very much like the Joel Test that states ` Do you fix bugs before writing new code ? '.
C# 3.0 is made up of about a dozen new small features .
The features are very easy to implement but they rely heavily on the 2.0 foundation : iterators , anonymous methods , variable lifting and generics .
Since we have been fixing and improving the 2.0 compiler anyways , we get to implement the next draft of the specification instead of the current draft .
This means that there is less code to rewrite when and if things change .
Fixing bugs first turned out to be a really important .
In C# 3.0 lambda functions are built on the foundation laid out by anonymous methods .
And it turned out that our anonymous method implementation even a few months ago had some very bad bugs on it .
It took Martin Baulig a few months to completely fix it .
I wrote about Martin 's work here .
The second piece is LINQ , some bits and pieces of the libraries have been implemented , those live in our Olive subproject .
Alejandro Serrano and Marek Safar have contributed the core to the Query space , and Atsushi did some of the work on the XML Query libraries .
We certainly could use help and contributions in that area .
Anecdote : we started on the C# 2.0 compiler about six months before C# 2.0 was actually announced at the 2003 PDC .
Through ECMA we had early access to the virtual machine changes to support generics , and the language changes to C# .
By the time of the PDC we had almost a functional generics compiler .
The spec was not set in stone , and it would change in subtle places for the next two years .
So during the next two years we worked on and off in completing the support and implementing the changes to the language as it happened .
Most of the hard test cases came when C# 2.0 was released to the public as part of .
NET 2.0 .
About six weeks into the release ( mid-December and January ) we started receiving a lot of bug reports from people that were using the new features .
Second Mini-Anecdote : Pretty much every new release of IronPython has exposed limitations in our runtime , our class libraries or our compilers .
IronPython has really helped Mono become a better runtime .
Moving Illusons are static images where you can see illusory motion due to color contrasts and shape position .
Often , you 'll see waving effect ( eg. on the Valentine Picture Illusion including hearts ) or spinning effect ( on the following illusion using round shapes and tricky colors ) .

Rice Waves
There is nothing moving below ( by Akiyoshi Kitaoka ) .

Neat !

Northern Blvd. Burger King .
4.03 PM .
A slight breeze blows from the east .
The commerce district of Queens approximates a population of fifty thousand during optimal peaks .
Medium vanilla shake with fries .
Pink hair pulled back into a short , neat ponytail .
She 's reading Cryptonomicon .
Sweet Jesus , she 's a Neal Stephenson fan .
By historic precedence , this easily makes her a Coupland reader too .
I deduce assumptions on the reduction of casualty rates if I DON 'T talk to her .
" It 'd just blow up in my face if I tried speaking , " I mumble to myself and make a rather impressive attempt to forget about the nice girl by the window .
I purchase my vanilla shake and fries and glance through last night 's notes on bone exclusion ratios for 3D studio max forms .
In Queens , architects of fast food joints have noticed that there is a significance to building concrete slab tables and benches for outdoor eating .
The healthiness of fresh air and sunlight seems to consciously cancel out the crap factor of grease food .
If only for a little while .
I take out my manual and make notes on the inside cover of new similarities I 've noticed with Lightwave .
Did I set the render farm partitions before I left ?
A quiet knocking in the back of my head .
I dismiss it as pesky head noise that always visits when I 'm trying to memorize things .
Knocking turns to a respectable thud - thudding and I look up and behind me .
The pink haired girl is trying to get my attention .
I try at some semblance of a smiling expression towards her while alternately attempting to not urinate on myself .
Did I breach the exclusion zone somehow ?
Mind throws into hyper -time .
Thoughts of unintentional nuclear armament work its way from my brain to my extremities .
I quickly look back and downwards at the area of concrete table in front of me and over clock my brain functions as to what I 've done wrong .
My internal brain cavity acolytes return reports that all system parameters were green lights when I left the cash register .
Stare too long at her breasts ?
Negative .
Talk too loudly to myself ( again ) ?
Could n't have .
I reach for a fry and try not to move around too much .
Oh , man .
I think I ordered the same thing she did .
The gut feeling of unintentionally looking like a psycho immediately becomes awash in the lower recesses of my tummy .
This is not my fault .
I try as fluid as a motion possible to clear my area , collect my books , and start walking home . "
Hey , wait up .
Did you drop this ?
I thought it was yours cause no one else was before you in line , " she says .
I look down at what she 's holding and see the napkin I was writing MAXscripts on last night before bed . "
Hey , yeah ! "
I grab it out of her hands and search the delicate tissue for any smearing or blemishes that might have accrued while on the restaurant floor .
Nerd throttle is pushed to maximum as the importance of the napkin's integrity is notched one higher than the equally important situation of not dorking myself out in front of the young lady .
For a second , I almost forget to say thank you to her . "
Urm , it 's just some notes on computer stuff ! " I throw out to her .
Holy shit , I 'm screaming .
Somewhere inside me , there is a guerilla death squad executing the brain acolyte who should have been watching my sound levels . "
Yeah , it looks like programming , right ?
I 've never seen that kind of syntax before , though . "
Is she engaging me in a conversation ?
I do n't understand this entire situation even more so , now .
I want to go home .
" Uh , yeah .
It 's kind of proprietary code used for only one program .
Meant for streamlining certain macro functions , I guess .
It 's not as savvy as C++ or anything . "
I kind of do this glance to my watch thing while switching body weight to my left foot .
I try at a facial smile again .
Across the silo deck , I 've given the other man a rather obvious sign that if she does NOT want to arm this nuke , this is the time to walk away .
I make a note to myself that relating simple conversation to the beginnings of World War III might not be the healthiest thing a person should do .
I continue to stand there , shifting my eyes here and there , awaiting any audible formality she might want to end this situation with .
Suddenly , she brings my nation to DEFCON 2 . " Really ?
Which program ? "
She quietly turns the key and smiles towards me on her side of the panel and through the 5 foot plexan glass , I can see smoke emanate from the pit of the missle housing .
" I'm taking computer graphics at the School of Visual Arts in the city and this looked a lot like aertskdalitapersjgn120#948 ... " .
My brain loses touch with the specifics of what she 's saying exactly .
Inner voices and my abilities to understand speech are being delegated to the high level of readiness that this beautifully smoking nuclear warhead might actually try to launch us into DEFCON 1 .
I catch her scent off a down draft of breeze .
She smells like soap and no perfume .
Somewhere in my gut , the amazing destructive power of nuclear war is n't looking so bad right now .
I continue to stammer out about four hundred pages worth of 3D modeling - speak as we continue down the sidewalk , together .
She comes back with a story of how the Netscape application and school PC 's do n't mix .
Ever .
It is n't till we reach the park on 32nd AVE .
that I realize just how far into the arming sequence we 've fallen into .
She 's taken off her sneakers and socks to crumple grass blades with her feet .
We sit under a big tree that 's lived longer than both of us put together .
Somewhere between the area of dirt , grass , and ants that we speak to each other over ; amazing clouds of fire and nuclear fallout continue to burn and drop over the atmosphere .
It 's hard for me to imagine how the simplicities of conversation with attractive women can be described in any other way .

Mr Blair wants to bring down the curtain on his time in high office in the place where he began his fight to succeed John Smith and create the New Labour electoral success story .
He will inform the cabinet this morning before flying to his Sedgefield constituency to announce his decision at noon amid the party workers who first selected him as their parliamentary candidate on May 20 1983 at the age of 30 .
He is expected to make a personal speech that will insist he is a product of Labour and that his government has left Britain stronger than he found it .
Mr Blair will not quit as prime minister until the beginning of July , giving the party seven weeks to conduct its contests for leader and deputy leader .
He will spend the intervening period seeking international deals on climate change , a new slimmed - down treaty for the European Union and extra cash for Africa .
With David Cameron branding Labour as " a government of the living dead " yesterday , Mr Blair will attempt to counter criticism that he is a lame duck by travelling to France tomorrow to meet the new French president - in - waiting , Nicolas Sarkozy , and then flying next week to Washington for talks with George Bush on climate change and Iraq , the two issues that have dominated their relationship .
He will also press ahead with announcements on academy schools , planning and energy supply .
Two bills on criminal justice and terror will be published .
Two policy papers , including one on the future role of the state , will be published on Monday .
Mr Brown is planning to launch his campaign to succeed Mr Blair tomorrow , giving the country the first glimpse of the prospectus the next prime minister will offer the country over what is expected to be at least two years in No 10 .
He is expected to offer broad themes , rather than a string of rabbit - out - of - the - hat policies .
One of Mr Brown 's closest advisers , Ed Miliband , praised Mr Blair 's legacy at an event held last night by the Progress thinktank in London , but he acknowledged Labour had to do more to end child poverty and win the argument about tackling crime and the causes of crime .
He also urged the party to offer " a clear ethos of equality , community and empowerment " .
Lord Giddens , the " third way " guru , urged Mr Brown to make a significant early speech on foreign policy which acknowledged the mistakes in Iraq and promoted a multilateral foreign policy .
Although some have criticised Mr Brown 's silence about his intentions , one cabinet member said yesterday the chancellor 's reticence has built up expectations perfectly .
His campaign team is thought to have nominations from at least 250 Labour MPs , 205 more than he needs to get on to the ballot paper .
The two leftwingers still hoping to mount a token challenge to Mr Brown for the leadership - Michael Meacher and John McDonnell - will meet today to see who has gathered more nominations .
Mr Meacher is claiming 24 supporters .
Mr McDonnell has not disclosed the number of MPs backing him , but his supporters have cast doubt on the firmness of Mr Meacher 's numbers .
The two have agreed to hold a press conference this afternoon announcing which of them will go forward as the candidate of the left .
There is no guarantee that either can secure the 45 nominations required to prevent Mr Brown being elected unopposed .
Mr Meacher believes that if he can get on to the ballot paper he can win a third of the electoral college , made up equally of MPs , the 180,000 party members and 3 million party affiliates .
It is expected that Mr Blair 's deputy , John Prescott , will also announce his resignation before the Labour national executive meets on Sunday to set the precise timetable for the contest for the two posts , culminating in a meeting of the electoral college on June 30 .
In a taste of the Tory attack to come Alan Duncan , the shadow industry secretary , said yesterday that while Mr Brown would get a popularity " bounce " when he takes over No 10 from Mr Blair his leadership would generate " nastiness in spades " against the Conservatives .
" No 10 will now be occupied by the wrong end of the pantomime horse , " he said .
Whereas Mr Blair had been hard to dislike , Mr Brown would not be and he would be aggressive .
" We have tried to take the Punch and Judy out of politics .
Under Gordon Brown it will be all Punch . "
Since 1997 Mr Blair had been " the great actor , but Gordon has been the playwright and director , " Mr Duncan said .
TRENT LOTT , call your office : Apparently some parts of American history can be sanitized and forgotten .
Earlier this week , President George Bush issued a formal White House proclamation celebrating Kwanzaa .
Sounding like a " Saturday Night Live " send - up , Bush praised the " seven principles " of Kwanzaa , " known as Nguzo Saba , " and discussed the " early harvest gatherings called ' matunda ya kwanza , ' or first fruits . "
He included the usual claptrap about how Kwanzaa celebrates " traditional African values " and " uniting people of diverse backgrounds and beliefs . "
It is a fact that Kwanzaa was invented in 1966 by a black radical FBI stooge , Ron Karenga , aka Dr. Maulana Karenga .
Karenga was a founder of United Slaves , a violent nationalist rival to the Black Panthers and a dupe of the FBI .
In what was probably ultimately a foolish gamble , during the madness of the '60s the FBI encouraged the most extreme black nationalist organizations in order to discredit and split the left .
The more preposterous the organization , the better .
Karenga 's United Slaves was perfect .
In the annals of the American ' 60s , Karenga was the Father Gapon , stooge of the czarist police .
Despite modern perceptions that blend all the black activists of the '60s , the Black Panthers did not hate whites .
They did not seek armed revolution .
Those were the precepts of Karenga 's United Slaves .
United Slaves were proto- fascists , walking around in dashikis , blowing away Black Panthers and adopting invented " African " names .
( That was a big help to the black community : How many boys named " Jamal " currently sit on death row ? )
Whether Karenga was a willing dupe , or just a dupe , remains unclear .
Curiously , in a 1995 interview with Ethnic NewsWatch , Karenga matter - of - factly explained that the forces out to get O.J. Simpson for the " framed " murder of two whites included : " the FBI , the CIA , the State Department , Interpol , the Chicago Police Department " and so on .
( He further noted that " the evidence was not strong enough to prohibit or eliminate unreasonable doubt "  an interesting standard of proof . )
Karenga should know about FBI infiltration .
In the category of the - gentleman - doth - protest - too - much , back in the '70s , Karenga was quick to criticize rumors that black radicals were government - supported .
When Nigerian newspapers claimed that some American black radicals were CIA operatives , Karenga leapt in to denounce the idea publicly , saying , " Africans must stop generalizing about the loyalties and motives of Afro-Americans , including the widespread suspicion of black Americans being CIA agents . "
By now , there is no question that the FBI fueled the bloody rivalry between the Panthers and United Slaves .
In one barbarous outburst , Karenga 's United Slaves shot Black Panther Al " Bunchy " Carter on the UCLA campus .
Karenga himself served time , a useful stepping - stone for his current position as a black studies professor at California State University at Long Beach .
Kwanzaa itself is a lunatic blend of schmaltzy ' 60s rhetoric , black racism and Marxism .
Indeed , the seven " principles " of Kwanzaa praise collectivism in every possible arena of life  economics , work , personality , even litter removal .
( " Kuumba : Everyone should strive to improve the community and make it more beautiful . " )
It takes a village to raise a police snitch .
When Karenga was asked to distinguish Kawaida , the philosophy underlying Kwanzaa , from " classical Marxism , " he essentially explained that under Kawaida , we also hate whites .
While taking the " best of "  I 'm not making this up  " early Chinese and Cuban socialism , " Kawaida practitioners believe one 's racial identity " determines life conditions , life chances and self - understanding . "
There 's an inclusive philosophy for you .
Coincidentally , the seven principles of Kwanzaa are the very same seven principles of the Symbionese Liberation Army , another charming invention of the Least - Great Generation .
In 1974 , Patricia Hearst , kidnap victim - cum - SLA revolutionary , posed next to the banner of her alleged captors , a seven - headed cobra .
Each snake head stood for one of the SLA 's revolutionary principles : Umojo , Kujichagulia , Ujima , Ujamaa , Nia , Kuumba and Imani  precisely the seven " principles " of Kwanzaa .
With his Kwanzaa greetings , President Bush is saluting the intellectual sibling of the Symbionese Liberation Army , killer of housewives and police .
He is saluting the founder of United Slaves , who were such lunatics that they shot Panthers for not being sufficiently insane  all with the FBI as their covert ally .
It 's as if David Duke invented a holiday called " Anglica , " and the president of the United States issued a presidential proclamation honoring the synthetic holiday .
People might well stand up and take notice if that happened .
Kwanzaa was the result of a ' 60s psychosis grafted onto black community .
Liberals have become so mesmerized by multicultural nonsense that they have forgotten the real history of Kwanzaa and United Slaves  the violence , the Marxism , the insanity .
Most absurdly , for leftists anyway , is that they have forgotten the FBI 's tacit encouragement of this murderous black nationalist cult founded by the father of Kwanzaa .
Now the " holiday " concocted by an FBI dupe is honored in a presidential proclamation calling it a " holiday that promotes mutual understanding . "
A movement that started approximately 2,000 years before Kwanzaa leaps well beyond merely " promot ( ing ) mutual understanding " to say we are all equal before God .
It is so inclusive , people get mad at it .
That movement is also celebrated this week .
But the Christian leaders at the forefront of the abolitionist and civil rights movements have been washed down the memory hole .
Assume a process which repeatedly marks all of positive integers which belong to a Fibonacci sequence which start with the lowest unmarked x and x+c .
For example , if c is one , the first Fibonacci sequence marks 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , etc .
The process would start the second Fibonacci sequence at 6 and 7 , marking thereafter 13 , 20 , 33 , ... , the third one would mark 9 , 10 , 19 , 29 , etc .
The unmarked numbers 4 , 18 , 22 , 28 , 32 , 47 , 54 , 72 , etc. are then what I call the anti-Fibonacci numbers for the given c = 1 .
For c = 2 the anti-Fibonacci numbers would be 5 , 8 , 9 , 24 , 34 , 38 , 45 , 50 , etc .
One might assume that anti-Fibonacci number generation is a sufficiently complicated process to be essentially pseudo - random .
My back - of - the - envelope calculation went as follows : Let p( i ) be the probability that i is anti-Fibonacci .
A single existing Fibonacci sequence grows sparser with a rate of phi/ i where phi is the base of the golden ratio ( sqrt ( 5 ) +
1 ) / 2 with which the Fibonacci values grow , but with a probability of p( i ) ^2 the i and i+c starts a new Fibonacci sequence and p( i ) gets a nudge of 2 / i upwards .
Putting these in equilibrium and solving for p gives sqrt( sqrt ( 5 ) +
1 ) / 2 , or roughly 0.899 .
I knew I had made some lofty approximations in the derivation above , especially in assuming that the density of multiple Fibonacci sequences would decrease as rapidly as that of one sequence , so I wrote a little program that computes some 100 million first anti-Fibonacci numbers .
I was somewhat surprized to see that p is only approximately 0.856 for c = 1 .
For c = 2 the program gave 0.872 , which as again surprizing because I did n't expect c to affect p .
But when my computer spat out what looks like interference patterns my jaw really dropped .
Having seen the non-randomness of the average of p over all i and observed how it depends on c , a change in coordinates lead me to wonder if conversely the average of p over c's depends on i .
The answer is yes .
Below I have a sample of p ( i ) estimated by c up to ten thousand .
The moral of the story ?
Whenever playing with number theory , staple your jaw so it wo n't keep falling off constantly .

A disturbing recent phenomenon in Washington is that laws that strike to the heart of American democracy have been passed in the dead of night .
So it was with a provision quietly tucked into the enormous defense budget bill at the Bush administration ’s behest that makes it easier for a president to override local control of law enforcement and declare martial law .
The provision , signed into law in October , weakens two obscure but important bulwarks of liberty .
One is the doctrine that bars military forces , including a federalized National Guard , from engaging in law enforcement .
Called posse comitatus , it was enshrined in law after the Civil War to preserve the line between civil government and the military .
The other is the Insurrection Act of 1807 , which provides the major exemptions to posse comitatus .
It essentially limits a president ’s use of the military in law enforcement to putting down lawlessness , insurrection and rebellion , where a state is violating federal law or depriving people of constitutional rights .
The newly enacted provisions upset this careful balance .
They shift the focus from making sure that federal laws are enforced to restoring public order .
Beyond cases of actual insurrection , the president may now use military troops as a domestic police force in response to a natural disaster , a disease outbreak , terrorist attack or to any “ other condition . ”
Changes of this magnitude should be made only after a thorough public airing .
But these new presidential powers were slipped into the law without hearings or public debate .
The president made no mention of the changes when he signed the measure , and neither the White House nor Congress consulted in advance with the nation ’s governors .
It ’s time to review some nasty writing mistakes that damage our credibility .
Not normally a fun task , but absolutely necessary .
I promise to keep you amused to diminish the pain ( or at least I ’ll give it a shot ) .
I also feel compelled to mention that copywriting and blogging should be conversational and engaging , and breaking formal grammatical and spelling conventions can often be a good thing .
Outside of specific professional or academic contexts , writing with a personal style that makes it easier on the reader is more important than pleasing Strunk and White .
That said , I also believe you have to know the rules in order to break them .
Plus , there are some errors that you ’ll never convince anyone you did intentionally in the name of style ( outside of a joke ) , and even then some people will still assume you ’re dumb .
So , let ’s take a look at some of those types of glaring errors you never want to make — common writing mistakes that can diminish the shine and credibility of your message .
1. Loose vs. lose
This one drives a lot of people crazy , including me .
In fact , it ’s so prevalent among bloggers that I once feared I was missing something , and somehow “ loose ” was a proper substitute for “ lose ” in some other English - speaking countries .
Here ’s a hint : it ’s not .
If your pants are too loose , you might lose your pants .
2 . Me , myself , and I
One of the most common causes of grammatical pain is the choice between “ me ” and “ I . ”
Too often people use “ I ” when they should use “ me . ”
Since “ I ” sounds stilted and proper , it must be right , right ?
Nope .
The easy way to get this one right is to simply remove the other person from the sentence and then do what sounds correct .
You would never say “ Give I a call , ” so you also would n’t say “ Give Chris and I a call . ”
Do n’t be afraid of me .
And whatever you do , do n’t punt and say “ myself ” because you ’re not sure whether “ me ” or “ I ” is the correct choice .
“ Myself ” is only proper in two contexts , both of which are demonstrated below .
Many consider Chris a punk , but I myself tolerate him .
Which brings me to ask myself , why ?
3. Different than vs. Different from
This one on our list of writing mistakes slips under the radar a lot , and I ’ll bet I ’ve screwed it up countless times .
It boils down to the fact that things are logically different from one another , and using the word “ than ” after “ different ” is a grammatical blunder .
This vase is different from the one I have , but I think mine is better than this one .
4. Improper use of the apostrophe
Basically , you use an apostrophe in two cases :
For contractions ( do n’t for do not )
To show possession ( Frank ’s blog means the blog belongs to Frank )
If still in doubt , leave the apostrophe out .
It causes more reader confusion to insert an apostrophe where it does n’t belong than it does to omit one .
Plus , you can always plead the typo defense if you leave an apostrophe out , but you look unavoidably dumb when you stick one where it does n’t belong .
5. Parallelism
Back when I talked about bullet points , one of the tips involved keeping each bullet item in parallel by beginning with the same part of speech .
For example , each item might similarly begin with a verb :
Deliver …
Prompt …
Cause …
Drive …
When writing a list of items in paragraph form , this is even more crucial , and failing to stay in parallel can result in confusion for readers and scorn from English majors .
Check out this non-parallel list in a sentence :
Over the weekend , Kevin bought a new MacBook Pro online , two software programs , and arranged for free shipping .
Do you see the problem ?
If not , break the list into bullet points and it becomes clear :
Over the weekend , Kevin : Bought a new MacBook Pro online
Two software programs
Arranged for free shipping
Stick the word “ ordered ” in front of “ two software programs ” and you ’re in parallel .
Your readers will subconsciously thank you , and the Grammar Police wo n’t slam you .
6. i.e. vs. e.g .
Ah , Latin … you ’ve just gotta love it .
As antiquated as they might seem , these two little Latin abbreviations are pretty handy in modern writing , but only if you use them correctly .
The Latin phrase id est means “ that is , ” so i.e. is a way of saying “ in other words . ”
It ’s designed to make something clearer by providing a definition or saying it in a more common way .
The Latin phrase exempli gratia means “ for example ” , so e.g. is used before giving specific examples that support your assertion .
7. Could of , would of , should of
Please do n’t do this :
I should of gone to the baseball game , and I could of , if Billy would of done his job .
This is correct :
I should have gone to the baseball game , and could have , if Billy had done his job .
Why is this one of our common writing mistakes ?
They could ’ve , should ’ve , would ’ve been correct , except that the ending of those contractions is slurred when spoken .
This creates something similar to a homophone , i.e. , a word that is pronounced the same as another word but differs in meaning , e.g. , of , which results in the common grammatical mistake of substituting of for have .

so you have your work done and do n't want to get your foot caught in the trap known as " gap work " .
are few tips to get you through with out anyone asking any questions .
Most of these should be obvious or common practice but I will try to help novice to pro :
The set - up:1 ) Always have a spreadsheet open on the desktop behind your currentbrowsing material .
You should know what is on the spreadsheet as well , do n't pick a random object off the company server .
2 ) Make sure that this spreadsheet is3 / 4 of a page full and isto your project , if you do not use spreadsheets substitute , word , company email program , orwhatever will fit into your office environment3 )
Check all your angles , make sure that your current window is not liable to be visible from anyone just passing by .
Make sure you are sure of your environment , we will discuss later the necessity of not over reaching your abilities4 )
Desk -
Do n't have a clear desk , clear desks mean you had enough time to put everything away .
Rotate documents that apply to your current project so that itappear that you are stuck , this could raise more questions than you want to answer .
It could also be a dead give away when you have mail from 3 days prior unopened .
5 ) If you operate windows make sure that the toolbar is hidden .
If a boss it looking over your shoulder it would not be beneficial to have an object that says " Funny Ass Shit ( NSFW ) " where s/he can see it .6 ) Extras -
You will see people with mirrors on their computers or within their range of site but this is just pushing it .
This is drawing attention to not only yourself but you set up , do n't push the envelope , one questionable encounter and then you are on the shit lis or worse .
Next time I will go over the exectution of our favorite past time - Slacking
Labels : lazy , office , slacking , work
The rawest explanation of the core principles of the new conservatism to date is laid bare in yesterday 's Wall Street Journal opinion pages .
Let me give you an idea of how this is gonna go .
Here are the fifth and sixth sentences from this abomination , authored by Harvard professor and Claremont Institute fellow Harvey C. Mansfield :
Though I want to defend the strong executive , I mainly intend to step back from that defense to show why the debate between the strong executive and its adversary , the rule of law , is necessary , good and -- under the Constitution - - never - ending .
In other circumstances I could see myself defending the rule of law .
Ohhhhh boy .
What do you even say to something that starts off on that foot ?
Well , I frequently find that when you 're staring at the work of a psychopath who 's too far gone to even begin addressing rationally , it turns out that Glenn Greenwald is already on the case .
And thank God for that !
I have n't got the stomach for it , myself .
Take it away ( please ! ) , Glenn :
[ R]eading Mansfield has real value for understanding the dominant right - wing movement in this country .
Because he is an academic , and a quite intelligent one , he makes intellectually honest arguments , by which I mean that he does not disguise what he thinks in politically palatable slogans , but instead really describes the actual premises on which political beliefs are based .
And that is Mansfield 's value ; he is a clear and honest embodiment of what the Bush movement is .
In particular , he makes crystal clear that the so - called devotion to a " strong executive " by the Bush administration and the movement which supports it is nothing more than a belief that the Leader has the power to disregard , violate , and remain above the rule of law .
And that is clear because Mansfied explicitly says that .
And that is not just Mansfield 's idiosyncratic belief .
He is simply stating -- honestly and clearly -- the necessary premises of the model of the Omnipotent Presidency which has taken root under the Bush presidency .
The Nixon Doctrine .
" When the president does it that means that it is not illegal . "
This is why , when Alberto Gonzales last appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee , I thought that one of the most important questions that could be put to him on the subject of the day was :
Given that it's his contention that nothing " improper " happened , is it even possible for something the president does to be " improper " at all ?
This is , in case it's not obvious from the breathtaking scope of Mansfield 's pronouncement , something that applies across the board .
Asking Gonzales about whether or not anything could be improper in the scandal surrounding the dismissal of the U.S. Attorneys is small potatoes .
I originally felt the question had to be asked of Gonzales when he baffled Senator Russ Feingold with his answers about the " administration 's " program of domestic surveillance .
Feingold thought Gonzales had lied in his confirmation hearing , but I thought he had just been engaging in wordplay :
Not only is he saying that no law can be passed that infringes upon the president 's " inherent authority , " he is saying that he told the truth in his confirmation hearings because he believes the surveillance programs do not violate the law because they cannot violate the law .
That 's why he regarded Senator Feingold 's question as a hypothetical .
Because it was and is his assumption that no program initiated by the president in furtherance of the national security could be in violation of the law .
And , sure enough , Mansfield was on the scene with another article , making a similar argument about Bush 's domestic spying .
Greenwald continues :
In that article , Mansfied claimed , among other things , that our " enemies , being extra- legal , need to be faced with extra-legal force " ; that the " Office of President " is " larger than the law " ; that " the rule of law is not enough to run a government " ; that " ordinary power needs to be supplemented or corrected by the extraordinary power of a prince , using wise discretion " ; that " with one person in charge we can have both secrecy and responsibility " ; and most of all : Much present - day thinking puts civil liberties and the rule of law to the fore and forgets to consider emergencies when liberties are dangerous and law does not apply .
" Law does not apply " -- that is Mansfield 's belief , and the belief of the Bush movement .
Really , you should just go read Glenn 's post .
There 's so much more to it than it 's reasonable to reprint here .
But I 'll just leave you with this important observation :
The point here is not to spend much time arguing that Mansfield 's authoritarian cravings are repugnant to our political traditions .
The real point is that Mansfield 's mindset is the mindset of the Bush movement , of the right - wing extremists who have taken over the Republican Party and governed our country completely outside of the rule of law for the last six years .
Mansfield makes these arguments more honestly and more explicitly , but there is nothing unusual or uncommon about him .
He is simply expounding the belief in tyrannical lawlessness on which the Bush movement ( soon to be led by someone else , but otherwise unchanged ) is fundamentally based .
This is why he is published in The Weekly Standard and The Wall St. Journal -- the two most influential organs for so - called " conservative " political thought .
All sorts of the most political influential people in our country -- from Dick Cheney to Richard Posner to John Yoo and The Weekly Standard -- believe and have argued for exactly this vision of government .
They literally do not believe in our constitutional framework and our most defining political values .
And his equally important conclusion , found in an update :
UPDATE : I just want to add one related point here .
Much of the intense dissatisfaction I have with the American media arises out of the fact that these extraordinary developments -- the dominant political movement advocating lawlessness and tyranny out in the open in The Wall St. Journal and Weekly Standard -- receive almost no attention .
While the Bush administration expressly adopts these theories to detain American citizens without charges , engage in domestic surveillance on Americans in clear violation of the laws we enacted to limit that power , and asserts a general right to disregard laws which interfere with the President 's will , our media still barely discusses those issues .
They write about John Edwards ' haircut and John Kerry 's windsurfing and which political consultant has whispered what gossip to them about some painfully petty matter , but the extraordinary fact that our nation 's dominant political movement is openly advocating the most radical theories of tyranny -- that " liberties are dangerous and law does not apply " -- is barely noticed by our most prestigious and self - loving national journalists .
Merely to take note of that failure is to demonstrate how profoundly dysfunctional our political press is .
One last thing I can't resist , though it might be interpreted as a dig at Greenwald , so before I mention it , let me just say that I have only the highest respect for him , and that the fact that he takes on tasks I could n't bear to contemplate is part of what keeps me getting out of bed in the morning .
But let me just remind you of how far into the abyss this " administration " has dragged us .
Here 's Greenwald nearly a year ago , answering reactions to the Hamdan case put forward by , well , people like me , who 've believed for a long time that the Bushbots were insane :
That means that the administration has no defenses to fend off charges that they deliberately violated the criminal law -- and continue to do so -- by eavesdropping on Americans without warrants , or torturing people in violation of the Geneva Conventions and / or the McCain Amendment , or violating the National Security Act of 1947 by concealing major intelligence activities from Congress .
Those are criminal offenses .
And the Supreme Court just expressed unbridled hostility towards their only defenses they have to those crimes .
Anyone who suggests that that is a meaningless development and that Bush officials are unaffected by them has embraced a cartoon super - villain version of the administration which is just not real .
I guess it might be time to rethink that .

Are you thinking about buying a hybrid ?
Yes
No
View results NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - Toyota is now measuring " time on the lot " for the Toyota Prius in hours , not days .
The average Prius goes unsold for only about 20 hours after it hits a Toyota dealer 's lot , according to a recent report .
With gasoline prices now around $ 3 a gallon , you might think it makes a lot of sense that hybrid cars are hot sellers .
Actually , it does n't -- at least not a lot of financial sense .
They may make a social statement you 're interested in , but if you want to save money because of rising gas prices , you 're heading down the wrong road , at least for now .
Some simple calculations by our partners at Edmunds.com revealed the following : A hybrid Honda Accord costs about $ 3,800 more than the comparable non-hybrid version , including purchase , maintenance and insurance costs .
Over five years , assuming 15,000 miles of driving per year , you 'll make up that cost in gasoline money if the price of gas goes up immediately to $ 9.20 a gallon and averages that for the whole period .
For the Ford Escape hybrid , the difference is less stark .
To make up the difference over five years between the Escape hybrid and a Ford Escape XLT , gas prices would have to average $ 5.60 after you purchase the vehicle .
The Prius itself , however , could be an exception .
There is no such thing as a non -hybrid Prius , making a direct comparison impossible .
Compared to a Toyota Camry , a car with similar interior space which costs about $ 100 more over five years , the Prius driver could actually save a small amount of money .
There is a tax deduction of $ 2,000 available for purchasing a hybrid vehicle , but that translates to a one - time tax savings of less than $ 500 for most buyers .
That 's nice , but it 's not enough to make much of a difference in the long run .
The recently passed energy bill includes a tax credit that would range from $ 500 up to $ 3,400 , depending on the fuel efficiency of the car , for vehicles purchased after Jan 1. , 2006 .
The credit could be enough to create some real savings .
For example , Ford estimates the tax credit on a Ford Escape hybrid to be $ 2,600 .
The new rules are extremely confusing , though , said David Mellem of Ashwaubenon Tax Professionals in Wisconsin , and the IRS has n't yet published an official list of what vehicles will qualify for what sort of tax credit .
Certainly , though , most car buyers who are considering a hybrid will be far better off waiting until 2006 to make that purchase , said Mellem .
In the meantime , there are other ways to save gas that wo n't cost you any extra money .
Drive more gently First , change the way you drive .
There 's no trophy for being first to arrive at the red light , or beating everyone away from the green .
In driving tests by Edmunds.com , simply going easy on the gas and brake pedals garnered gas mileage improvements of about thirty percent .
Hybrid buyers pay thousands for that kind of savings .
( For more , see Gas - saving tips put to the test . )
Check out diesels Second , consider buying diesel .
Diesel cars cost only a little more than gasoline - powered cars , but they get far better fuel mileage .
Also , because their engines are more durable , diesels have better resale value than gasoline - powered cars .
That alone should be enough to make up any additional cost of the vehicle , leaving the gas - money savings in your pocket .
Also , diesels will qualify for tax credits under the new tax rules .
Again , diesel buyers might want to wait until next year to buy .
( For more , see It may be time for diesel . )
Shop smarter
Third , look more closely at the actual fuel economy numbers when you buy and consider what you 're willing to give up .
The promise of hybrids is better fuel economy with the same , or more , engine power .
But , for that , you pay more for the complex technology and , to date , long - term resale value is unknown .
You could simply decide that you could do with less engine power or a smaller , lighter vehicle .
That way you could get better fuel economy while paying even less money for the vehicle itself .
And you do n't have to buy a subcompact .
For example , an two - wheel - drive Ford Escape hybrid has a sticker price of about $ 26,900 and gets an EPA - estimated 33 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving .
A Ford Focus wagon gets an EPA - estimated 28 mpg in combined driving but it costs about $ 10,000 less .
With the Focus you get about same amount of interior space for passengers and even more cargo room .
Also , you 'll have a much easier time negotiating a good price on the Focus wagon than you will on the Escape hybrid , which typically sells at full sticker price .
There are , of course , an endless number of similar comparisons out there .
The point is , do n't just get sucked into the hybrid hype .
If what 's really important to you is saving on fuel , do a little thinking before you buy .
There are lots of options available .

A MOST unfortunate photograph is currently filling e-mail in - boxes all across France , appearing to show a nightmare vision of a future France run by the centre - right presidential candidate , Nicolas Sarkozy .
The picture is genuine enough , France 's newspapers have reported .
As Le Monde explains , it shows menacing riot police outside the headquarters of the UMP ( Mr Sarkozy 's party ) , with a banner above showing one of his favourite slogans , " Let 's imagine the France of tomorrow . "
And there you see ( cue titters from those who think Mr Sarkozy is a nasty authoritarian ) the France of tomorrow looks like a Sarkozy - run police state , guarded by jack - booted officers of the feared riot police .
It is all an unhappy coincidence , it seems .
The picture was taken on the day of a workers ' protest outside the headquarters of a telecommunications firm , Alcatel , which lies on the other side of the street from the national headquarters of the UMP in Paris .
The flics were merely using the UMP building as a place to gather and lounge , menacingly .

An unexpected pleasure of watching any Spider - Man movie , and the new release of the third is no exception , is that it allows the viewer to be a voyeur of a largely abandoned ideology , the perspective of the old , old Left .
The film , and the ideological structure of Spiderman 's world , not only shows us how wrong the left was way back then ; it reveals just how much the class - conflict view of economics has had to adjust in order to stay viable at all .
In this old - left view of the social order , the essential conflict driving history was between the wealthy capitalistic barons who live in unrestrained opulence at the expense of the working poor who never get a break and never advance socially or economically .
In this unreconstructed version of leftism — which reached its height from the '30s through the ' 60s — issues like the environment , disability , sexual orientation , and the unmitigated evil of the European mind play no role at all .
This was the Left of yesteryear that believed in socialism as a tool for economic development , the remedy for the intractable plight of the working poor .
This is a view that has a dwindling presence in the world today .
Spider - Man is , of course , the archetype of the oppressed proletarian .
He has all the makings of someone who should excell .
He is smart , hard working , charming , and , by the way , possessed of amazing powers to climb buildings and dash around on webs .
But he gets not justice : he still lives in a dingy , dumpy , broken - down apartment and can barely pay his rent .
Whatever job he happens to find , he loses rather quickly .
Bosses are arbitrary and uncaring .
He takes great photos but has to sell them to J. Jonah Jameson at a fraction of what they are really worth , and hence the media mogul enjoys the surplus value .
Part of his passion for social justice stems from his own consciousness of his economic class .
Thus says the Socialist Worker : " Spider - Man is a superhero we can all identify with . "
Why he has to remain poor is not explained very well .
He complains that the door on his apartment does n't work right , but he does n't think to hop over to Home Depot and pick up a new knob .
The paint in his apartment is cracking and dingy but he somehow can't take a Sunday afternoon off to do some renovation work , and neither can his proletarian landlord across the hall .
He has to use a payphone to make calls when he could just Skype ( actually , it is rather interesting : I ca n't recall any computers in the film at all ) .
He keeps selling his photos at below market rates , without thinking to offer them to a newspaper besides the Daily Bugle .
Get a life , Spidey !
But for reasons that are unclear , he just can't .
Nor can those in his immediate circle .
His girlfriend can't get a break either .
She lands a singing job on Broadway but ( we saw it coming ) she loses it rather quickly .
Even though she is beautiful and talented , she ends up having to wait tables in a jazz club — an appropriate venue for her since jazz mavens can be counted on to embrace one of their own .
Spidey 's
Aunt is in a similar situation , always on the verge of some economic disaster .
None of this makes any sense unless you are willing to buy into the old socialist view that the capital owners are running everyone else into the ground via some kind of logic of history .
The third film in the series highlights the strange way in which Spider - Man 's villains are unusually sympathetic creatures .
Look at the life of The Sandman as the movie presents it .
He was a perfectly normal working - class guy but he was faced with the terrible reality of a daughter who was desperately in need of some medical attention that he could n't afford .
So , he decided to steal the money — which , we are led to believe , is perfectly understandable .
But during the robbery he became scared , and in an ill - fated moment of snap decision - making , he pulled the trigger on the guy he robbed .
The victim happened to be Spider - Man 's uncle , but once Spidey came to understand the background here , he too is sympathetic .
The Sandman is caught and goes to jail , but then escapes .
On the run from the police , he runs through a field and falls into a hole that was being used for some nuclear molecular - decompression blaster thing .
His body and sand are fused together and he somehow lives on to continue his search for money to help his daughter .
So while he is ostensibly Spider - Man 's enemy , they really share the crucial thing in common : class interest .
The Sandman might steal , kill , and destroy with impunity but if you focus too much on these facts , you are blaming the victim !
The class interest issue arises again in connection with Harry Osborn ( the new Goblin ) , the son of Norman Osborn , a .k.a. the Green Goblin , who is the ultimate Marxian prototype of the wealthy capitalist villain , who himself inherited wealth from his father Amberson Osborn .
Here we have the capitalistic dynasty , which , despite living in a marbled - floored mansion , is rife with every pathology one can imagine , each brought on by the desperate struggle to retain possession of vast wealth .
Harry is ostensibly friends with Peter Parker ( Spider - Man ) but is secretly involved in a private war to kill Spider - Man in revenge for Harry 's father 's death .
Tellingly , Spider - Man 3 has a period in which Harry and Peter are genuinely friends .
In this period , Harry is sincere , charming , and truth telling .
How does this come about ?
Harry has lost his memory , enough such that his class consciousness is changed .
His is temporarily freed from his attachment to wealth and class .
Once he recovers his memory by looking at an image of his father , his nastiness comes back again .
And so on it goes .
Not that any regular viewer would recognize any of the underlying ideological dynamics at work here .
Nor is this presentation particularly effective , since the old - line Marxist notions are about as fantastical as the whole superhero concept itself .
It posited that capitalism was driving the working poor into the ground , but as it turns out , capitalism is undeniably the best thing that ever happened to the working poor .
In the sweep of history , capitalism has , in fact , been the sole source for economic advance .
When this became obvious even to the Marxists at the turn of the 20th century , there ensued a clamor to reformulate the historical dynamic that Marx had dreamed up .
But what is most interesting here is how far removed the movie has to be from reality in order to project this Marxian vision .
People are not quite responsible for their social positions but rather come to inhabit them in some sort of Rawlsian way , and they live out their appointed roles as if controlled by some hyper - historical force operating in the world .
In the movie , moreover , one sees none of the real institutions that truly do serve the working poor .
Peter Parker is never shown shopping at Wal - Mart for example .
Indeed , it is capitalism that has created in reality all that the socialists of old imagined their revolution would achieve : an unbelievable variety of food , clothing , and life - style luxuries at rock - bottom prices .
So you might believe that the socialists would cheer .
On the contrary , they loath Wal - Mart more than any existing institution and implausibly claim that it is somehow an exploiter .
The passage of time in the real world has also revealed the reality of what the working poor really want : not revolution against the capitalist class but more free ring tones on their cell phones .
It was only after it became perfectly obvious to every living person that the market was serving the poor that the socialist Left abandoned its goal of material prosperity of the working poor .
Now they tell us that material prosperity itself is the problem ( and actually Rothbard took note of this ideological turn in the late 1950s ) .
If we want true justice , the new view went , we must all learn to live without .
What should concern us is the destruction of the environment , the exploitation of cultural minorities , the hidden costs of industrialization , and even such bogeymen as warm weather .
What the Spider - Man movies show us is a simpler time when the socialists made a strong but empirically testable claim : socialism would serve proletarian interests whereas capitalism is always contrary to proletarian interests .
That claim turned out to be 100 % false .
The movie makes one nostalgic for such simple - minded and easily refutable views .
Perhaps it is appropriate that such a vision live on only in comic books and the movies based on them .
RIAA is Spamming ?
Filed under : March 9 , 2007 , 10:26 pmFiled under : Uncategorized
Some idiot at Policy Bytes wrote an article called ‘ Should RIAA sue college students who facilitate massive copyright piracy ?.
I am living in the world where RIAA ’s dumbness is universally accepted , and when I go through entries like this , I ’m feeling like I ’ve just had ice - cold shower .
It is shocking , yet refreshing .
Not trying to rebutt claims about ‘ piracy = stealing ’ , outright insults at CopyLeft movement activits and silly ideas like ‘ if you contribute to economy , you are against piracy ’ , I will just focus on title .
Should RIAA sue college students ?
Perhaps , it is jury ’s prerogative to determine who ’s right and who ’s wrong .
As silly RIAA ’s claims may be , I am not the power to stop it suing pirate students .
Yet , RIAA does n’t have enough money to pay lawyers for thousands or millions of lawsuits .
What RIAA should n’t do is to abuse electronic messaging systems to send unsolicited bulk messages , which are almost universally undesired .
To those who did n’t get it : it is the Wikipedia definition of spamming , and its exactly what RIAA is currently doing with college students .
Spamming is gross federal offence .
Should we sue RIAA ?
This is a weird story .
Earlier today , a blast near a soccer field in Ramadi kills scores of children .
Also today , apparently , the US military conducted an explosion near a soccer field in Ramadi that hurt a bunch of children .
But the US military is saying the deadly attack could n't have happened , because they'd have known about it .
At the same time , both of these attacks sound awful similar - like they may be the same explosion , i.e. , one we caused .
Here 's the OTHER blast in Ramadi that killed 18 boys near a soccer field :
A car bomb exploded Tuesday near a park popular with young soccer players , killing at least 18 boys in [ Ramadi ] a city west of Baghdad known as a center of the Sunni insurgency , police said .
The U.S. military said its soldiers had carried out a controlled explosion in Ramadi , near a soccer field , that wounded 30 people , including nine children .
Iraq 's government and police said a bomb blast near a soccer field in the western city of Ramadi on Tuesday killed 18 people , mostly children , but the U.S. military said it was unaware of such an attack ....
" I can't imagine there would be another attack involving children without our people knowing , " said Major Jeff Pool , a spokesman for U.S. forces in western Anbar province .
The wounded had cuts and bruises , he said [ referring to the explosion the US caused near a soccer field ] .
And here 's the blast the US military caused in the same town near a soccer field , injuring kids :
But here 's where it gets stranger .
The US says they can't imagine the deadly attack is real since they were n't aware of it :
So , is the attack that killed the children " real " or did n't it happen at all ?
And if it real , is it the SAME explosion that US caused , and if so , did we also kill children and no one is telling us ?
“ If I get locked up , will you bail me out ? ” Ms. Ferreira asked her friends .
Ambergris begins as a waxlike substance secreted in the intestines of some sperm whales , perhaps to protect the whale from the hard , indigestible “ beaks ” of giant squid it feeds upon .
The whales expel the blobs , dark and foul - smelling , to float the ocean .
After much seasoning by waves , wind , salt and sun , they may wash up as solid , fragrant chunks .
Because ambergris varies widely in color , shape and texture , identification falls to those who have handled it before , a group that in a post - whaling age is very small .
Ms. Ferreira says she has yet to find an ambergris expert .
“ A hundred years ago , you would have no problem finding someone who could identify this , ” said James G. Mead , curator of marine mammals at the Smithsonian Institution , who said he hears of new ambergris surfacing somewhere in the world maybe once every five or six years .
“ More often , you have people who think they ’ve found it and they can retire , only to find out it ’s a big hunk of floor wax . ”
Adrienne Beuse , an ambergris dealer in New Zealand , said in a telephone interview that good - quality ambergris can be sold for up to $ 10 per gram , adding that for the finest grades , “ the sky ’s the limit . ”
At $ 10 per gram , Ms. Ferreira ’s chunk , according to a neighbor ’s kitchen scale , would have a value of $ 18,000 .
“ The only way to positively identify ambergris is to have experience handling and smelling it , and very few people in the world have that , ” Ms. Beuse said .
“ Certainly , if she has it , it ’s like winning a mini-lottery . ”
Larry Penny , 71 , director of East Hampton ’s natural resources department , said he had no way of making a definite determination , because “ we do n’t keep a certified whale - vomit expert on staff . ”
Mr. Penny , whose great - great - uncle was skipper of a whaling ship out of Sag Harbor , said he grew up searching the beach for ambergris .
George Alagiah will present a new bulletin aimed at US audiences
The channel , which already broadcasts to 270 million homes worldwide , can now be seen by cable viewers in New York .
The BBC says it hopes to strike deals with cable and satellite providers elsewhere in the US soon .
A new breakfast programme aimed at American audiences will be launched in July , presented by George Alagiah .
" What we 're not setting out to do is carve a niche that reflects America back to the Americans , " said Alagiah .
" What we 're trying to do is reflect the world back to Americans . "
The show , which will be based in London , will also be carried on the cable channel BBC America .
Global broadcaster
BBC World was launched in 1995 , and is funded by advertising and subscription .
As well as news bulletins , it broadcasts the interview programme Hardtalk , motoring show Top Gear and film guide Talking Movies , among others .
We 're offering something nobody else is
Richard Porter , Editor of BBC World
" The American TV market is the most crowded market in the world , " says the station 's editor , Richard Porter .
" For cable operators to want to find a space for another news network has been quite difficult . "
Porter says the channel 's coverage of global affairs has been their key selling point .
" We 're offering something nobody else is . "
The launch of BBC World in New York comes just four months after the station signed a distribution deal with Discovery .
The channel 's main competitor in the US will be CNN International , whose managing director , Chris Cramer , shrugged off the impact of the BBC World 's launch .
" At the end of the day , I guess the audience will decide , " he said .
AUGUST 8-- While we 're hopeful that tomorrow 's scheduled return of the Discovery space shuttle is a smooth one , TSG can't help but recall a couple of our favorite NASA - related memos , one which anticipated the demise of the Apollo XI astronauts .
Though the July 1969 mission proved a success , President Richard Nixon 's aides devised a contingency plan in case astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin ( and their lunar module ) were somehow stranded on the moon .
In a memo drafted two days before the Eagle landed , aide William Safire provided Nixon with a short speech to be delivered " In Event of Moon Disaster . "
After making condolence calls to the " widows - to - be , " Nixon would have said , " Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace . "
We 've also included a second memo -- prepared by NASA for the president and vice president -- suggesting statements in the event of Apollo " crew fatalities . "
The presidential lamentation ended by noting that the dead men " have followed a star , in night of space , and we for whom they went will not forget . " ( 4 pages )
Introduction
Check out our review of Aperture 2.0
Aperture
Developer : Apple ( product page )
Price : US $ 499 ( shop for this item )
Apple has cojones .
Let 's not pretend otherwise .
Jumping headfirst into the fully mature digital imaging market requires the shameless bravado of a one - legged man at a butt - kicking contest or any number of contestants on So You Think You Can Dance ?
What 's at risk is not only cold , hard cash , but more importantly , their reputation as a software innovator .
With Aperture , Apple is clearly hoping to have the same success it has had with Final Cut Pro.
Plus , becoming a household name in imaging can't hurt the bottom line for hardware sales .
Aperture hopes to do this by edging its way into the workflows of professional digital photographers by being basically an iPhoto Pro. Leveraging Core Image , a very powerful and very fast way to use modern 3 - D cards for near - realtime processing of images , and as someone that 's played around extensively with the Core Image Fun House when Tiger came out , there 's no denying that Core Image is fast :
Three sophisticated filters interacting with realtime feedback .
Click to animate
Apple also wants to instill the idea that Macs are for professional imaging and if you do n't use one then you 're missing out on all the gooey goodness and your Powerbook - toting friends should rightfully laugh at you .
But that 's only half of the problem .
They still have to make a program that will meet the demands of people who are n't willing to trade quality for speed .
Aperture touts fidelity and nondestructive editing as its main selling points , so it 's clear Apple understands the professional buzzwords but does it do enough to warrant a US $ 500 complement to Photoshop ?
Well , I 'm assuming that 's why you 're here .
Without further ado , let 's see if Apple can dance .
Test hardware
Dual G5 2.0
Nvidia 6800 Ultra 256 MB
4.5 GB RAM
OS X 10.4.3
Lacie Electron Blue 22 monitor with Blue Eye calibrator
Apart from the RAM , this is pretty well the base recommended system for running Aperture .
Since it uses Core Image for image processing , it requires a hefty graphics card and wo n't work on anything less than an ATI Radeon 9600 card .
Those of you hoping to shoehorn it into a floral G3 iMac are n't going to have much luck as it wo n't even install if the installer detects incompatible hardware .
You can check if your system is compatible with the Aperture Compatibility Checker .
Note that while I 'm not a professional photographer , I work with high - end digital and scanned images as a commercial retoucher and formerly as art director for a fashion magazine .
I also shoot as a hobby and often use the RAW format for maximum control over images , so I understand the needs of a professional digital photographer .

Matt Raible of Raible Designs gave this morning 's keynote presentation comparing Java Web frameworks ( slide - PDF ) .
Matt started off with an overview of the pros and cons of each framework , as he saw them .
Java Server Faces or JSF is the Java EE standard .
Lots of demand and lots of jobs working with JSF .
Initially , its fast and easy to develop with .
There are a lot of tools and component libraries are plentiful .
The bad news :
Tag soup for JSPs -- the pages are lots of anything but HTML .
JSF does n't do REST - style Web services well and security can be a problem .
What 's more , there 's no single source for an implementation .
Consequently , it 's hard to track down answers about problems .
Spring MVC has lifecycle for overriding binding , validation , etc .
It also integrates iwth many view options seamlessly : JSP / JSTL , Tiles Velocity FreeMarker , Excel , XSL , PDF , and others .
Because control is inverted , it 's easy to test .
The downside : lots of configuration .
Also , it 's almost too flexible .
For example , there 's no default parent controller .
Spring MVC does n't have built - in AJAX support .
That can be an advantage since built - in AJAX support in other frameworks is frequently out of date .
Stripes does n't use XML following the Rails mantra of convention over configuration .
There 's good documentation and Stripes is easy t learn .
An enthusiastic community is eager to help newcomers get up to speed .
The cons : the community is small and development is not as active as in other projects .
If Stripes does what you want , great .
If it does n't then you may be out of luck .
Another problem , Action URLs are hard coded .
Struts 2 has a simple architecture that 's easy to extend .
The tag library is easy to customize with FreeMarker or Velocity .
You can use either controller - based or page - based navigation .
Digging into the code is pretty easy .
The downsides : Documentation is poorly organized .
It 's wiki - based and mostly just thrown together .
There 's too much concentration on new features rather than stabilization .
Using Google will give you back Struts 1 documentation rather than Struts 2 documentation .
Tapestry can be very productive once you know it .
Templates are HTML , so it 's very designer friendly .
Lots of innovation happens between releases .
On the other hand , the documentation is conceptual rather than pragmatic .
It can be hard to find answers to specific problems .
There 's a steep learning curve and a long release cycle .
Wicket is great for Java developers , not Web developers .
There 's a tight binding between pages and views .
There 's an active community and getting support from the creators is easy .
But ... HTML templates live next to Java code in the package .
Could be a good thing , but it throws people off at first .
You need to have a good grasp of OO .
You need to be willing to live with the " Wicket way " -- everything is done in Java .
Matt moves into an evaluation based on the following criteria :
Ajax Support :
Is it built - in and easy to use ?
Bookmark - ability : Can users bookmark pages and return to them easily ?
Validation :
How easy is it to use and does it support client - side ( JavaScript ) validation ?
Testability : How easy is it to test Controllers out of container ?
Post and Redirect :
How does the framework handle the duplicate post problem ?
Internationalization : How is i18n supported and how easy is it to get messages in Controllers ?
Page Decoration :
What sort of page decoration / composition mechanisms does the framework support ?
Community and Support : Can you get questions answered quickly ( and respectfully ) ?
Marketability of Skills :
If you learn the framework , will it help you get a job ?
Job Count :
What is the demand for framework skills on dice.com and indeed.com ?
I wo n't report the detailed results of the evaluation of each framework in these areas .
See the slides if you want to see the results ( and pretty graphs ) .
What do people use ?
Struts and JFC were reported as the most used in an AppFuse survey .
After the session , I asked Matt which of the Java frameworks is most like Rails .
He said that Struts2 and Spring were trying hard on the convention over configuration front and Tapestry 5 is promising dynamic class loading .
He ended by speculating that the best solution was probably a hybrid with Java doing the heavy lifting on the back - end and some dynamic language doing presentation on the front end .

Digg CEO Jay Adelson has denied any direct connection between HD DVD and Digg , but evidence discovered by Texyt.com appears to contradict this .
The HD DVD Promotion Group 's sponsorship of his company , Revision3 , “ is no way connected to anything that 's on Digg ” , Adelson claimed in an interview .
However , Texyt.com has determined that it was Digg itself that accepted and displayed advertising from HD DVD , and not only Revision3's DiggNation site , as Adelson apparently claims .
Please see our earlier story which first revealed the links between DiggNation , Revision3 and HD DVD for background information .
HD DVD ad on Digg
An HD DVD advert on Digg.com is clearly visible in this screenshot .
These ads are published by the HD DVD Promotion Group , an industry body formed by the companies behind HD DVD to promote the standard .
The screenshot was taken by a Digg user and is in fact linked to by a story on the Digg website which never reached the front page .
In a story pointing out that Digg was simultaneously displaying advertising for both the HD DVD and Blu Ray technologies , Digg user Splizxer linked to December 2006 screenshots hosted at Imageshack.us .
The full Digg logo was added to the screenshot , as the original partially cropped it out .
Furthermore , in another a story posted less than three months ago , another user , Digid , points out more HD DVD banner adverts on Digg .
No HD DVD link with Digg , Adelson claims
In an interview yesterday with Wired , Digg CEO Jay Adelson accepted that the DiggNation show on his Revision3 site had been sponsored by HD DVD , but he was either unaware or chose not to say that HD DVD advertising has appeared on Digg itself .
In fact , he strongly implies that Digg has never carried such advertising .
“ In the case of HD DVD being a sponsor on Revision3 , if Revision3 takes a call from an agency that wants advertising space on DiggNation , it is no way connected to anything that ’s on Digg.com , ” he told Wired interviewer Adario Strange .
Opinion
Note that this is an opinion story .
Most of the news we publish here on Texyt is just straight reporting , not opinion , and we try to keep our own biases out of it as much as humanly possible .
Under the ' rules ' of that style of news reporting , we need to back up our statements with sourced evidence .
So we 're sometimes not able to publish conclusions that seem obvious to us , because they are based mostly on our own judgment or analysis , not reported from external sources .
In this case , however , I 'm concerned that , if I do n't express my own opinion very clearly , others will effectively put words into my mouth .
Source of Digg 's troubles
I believe that what Digg has here is a legal and public relations problem – not an ethical or moral problem .
I think it 's unlikely that Jay Adelson or Kevin Rose were influenced by the sponsorship received from HD DVD when they made the decision to remove the HD - DVD code from Digg .
There are at least three fairly plausible arguments in Digg 's favor .
Firstly Digg takes advertising from many companies , HD DVD is just one of them .
Secondly , Digg actually accepted advertising from both HD DVD and its competitor , Blu Ray – although the suspicious might argue that both organizations would support the blocking of DRM - defeating information like the HD DVD hex code .
And of course , most obvious of all , Digg 's eventual decision to actually publish the code itself will hardly sit well with these sponsors .
Instead it looks as if , under the pressure of a frightening legal threat that could scare off investors and potentially cost them their company , Digg 's management made several poor decisions and failed to keep on top of a very difficult and rapidly unraveling situation .
PR Disaster
Digg 's handling of this case has been a lesson in atrocious public relations management .
With hindsight , it 's now obvious that the decision to delete articles containing the HD DVD code was unwise , given the user generated nature of Digg.com – but this is an error that many of us would have made under the same difficult circumstances .
However , Digg turned this public relations crisis into a total implosion by failing to communicate clearly with its users , and even worse , attempting to block all discussion of its actions by deleting or burying dozens of stories and banning users en masse .
Breakdown in trust
The most lamentable part of the whole fiasco was not the initial blocking of HD DVD stories as a legal precaution , but Digg 's apparent censoring of many other stories which merely criticized Digg 's handling of the affair - without even mentioning or linking to the HD DVD code .
Further fuel was added to the fire by the company 's inability to acknowledge its acceptance of HD DVD sponsorship .
Unfortunately , as Adelson 's latest comments show , this is a path along which Digg continues .
While the truth is probably more benign , this gives the appearance of an extremely embarrassing conflict of interest .

Subject : [ ANN ] rocaml : Ruby extensions in Objective Caml
From : Mauricio Fernandez < mfp@ m r
Date : Fri , 22 Jun 2007 20:35:43 +0900
rocaml allows you to write Ruby extensions in Objective Caml .
I never seem to manage to release things when I should , so here 's a pre-release announcement to let you know about this so you can play with it before the actual release , which could take longer than necessary .
http://eigenclass.org/repos/rocaml/head/
Young as it is , rocaml is very usable and the generated extensions are reliable , since they enforce type safety and handle exceptions both in Ruby and OCaml ( OCaml exceptions are passed to Ruby ) .
Developing Ruby extensions with rocaml is easier and more convenient than writing a plain old C extension since rocaml performs Ruby <-> OCaml conversions for a wide range of types , including abstract types and arrays , tuples , variants and records of values of any supported type ( e.g. arrays of arrays of variants of tuples of ... ) .
Making an extension with rocaml involves two steps : * implementing the desired functionality in Objective Caml , and registering the functions to be exported ( using Callback .
register : string -> ' a -> unit ) * creating the extconf.rb file ( just modify the sample extconf.rb distributed with rocaml ) defining the interface of your Objective Caml code . **
At no point is there any need to write a single line of C code when ** ** using rocaml . **
The mandatory trivial example =============================
Let 's create an extension with a ' fib ' function .
Here 's the OCaml code : let rec fib n = if n < 2 then 1 else fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ) let _ = Callback .register " Fib.fib " fib Here 's the interface declaration in your extconf.rb : Interface.generate ( " fib " ) do def_module ( " Fib " ) do fun " fib " , INT => INT end end That 's it .
Running extconf.rb will generate all the required wrappers and make will link them against your ml code , creating a normal Ruby extension that can be used simply with require ' fib ' p Fib.fib 10
Set of strings using a RB tree ==============================
Here 's a simple set based on an RB tree , specialized for strings ( see examples / tree for how to create several classes from a single polymorphic structure ) .
The ( unoptimized ) RB tree takes only ~30LoCs , but lookup is 3X faster than with RBTree , which takes >3000 lines and over ~ 250 lines for the equivalent functionality , without counting the * manually written * wrappers for the underlying C data structure .
This shows how rocaml handles complex types , including variant and recursive types .
Given this interface definition : Interface.generate ( " tree " ) do string_tree_t = sym_variant ( " string_tree_t " ) do |t| constant : Empty non_constant : Node , TUPLE (t , type , t) end def_class ( " StringRBSet " ) do |c| t = c.abstract_type fun " empty " , UNIT => t , :aliased_as => " new " fun " make " , string_tree_t => t method " add " , [ t , STRING ] => t method " mem " , [ t , STRING ] =>

The Los Angeles Housing Department has paid thousands of dollars to a Zen Buddhist priest from Hawaii for management training that includes teaching breathing with sphincter control , learning “ how to stand ” and playing with wooden sticks .
Norma Wong , a former Hawaii state legislator and leadership consultant , has been paid $ 18,819 since 2005 to conduct at least four training sessions for executives and other staff .
The most recent one was last week .

Los Angeles Times Thursday May 17 , 2007 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 1 inches ; 55 words Type of Material : Correction
Management workshop :
An article in Friday ’s Section A about an unusual management workshop paid for by the Los Angeles Housing Department said the city attorney ’s office approved the $ 4,750 two - day workshop , titled “ Recalibration . ”
The city attorney ’s role is only to assess the legality of a contract ; it does not approve other aspects of the contracts .
Mercedes Marquez , the general manager of the department , said the training was designed to help “ center ” Housing Department managers and teach them to react nimbly to problems such as the city ’s housing shortage .
Up to 30 people attended each session .
“ She asks when you center yourself to hold yourself in , ” Marquez said of the instructor .

The breathing exercises and stick play , she said , were a small part of two - day sessions , which also included discussions of team building and improving department procedures .
Some staff members , however , have found aspects of the training objectionable .
Lynn Hansen , a former assistant general manager , said she was put off by the presumption that she and her colleagues “ had to be taught how to breathe and how to stand . ”
“ I ’m not sure how that helps me face an irate constituent , ” she said .

Hansen , who left the department in late 2005 , participated in the first session .
She said most of the training took place in a conference room but “ at one point we went out in the parking lot to wield our swords . ”
Another attendee described how executives were asked to encircle Marquez with their backs to her while holding their sticks , saying they were instructed to imagine that they were shielding their boss from opposing forces such as City Council members or other departments .
“ We had to make sure she was protected , ” said the participant , who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation .

Marquez and her deputy , Yolanda Chavez , flatly denied that that ever happened .
Marquez describes herself as a Zen Buddhist priest as well as a Roman Catholic .
She and others stressed that there was no religious component to the training .
Marquez also said Zen Buddhism is not a religious faith but a “ way to live . ”
Marquez said she met
Wong in the course of her own Buddhist training and came to admire her work as a leadership consultant .

Marquez urged
Wong to consider submitting a proposal to do leadership training for the department shortly after Marquez was named to head it in 2004 .
Wong ’s Honolulu - based temple is called Daihonzan Chozin - ji and also does business as Anko - In .
Anko - In , founded in 2000 , provides workshops and seminars “ on the application of Zen principles for organizations and individuals , ” according to a description in a 2005 city memo .
It has been hired by private firms and school districts .
Wong declined to comment , saying she did not have the city ’s permission .
According to advertisements about an appearance at the University of Wisconsin , she is considered an expert on Sun - Tzu ’s “ Art of War , ” an early treatise on military strategy that has gained popularity among business executives who seek to apply its principles to capitalism .

In some ways , the training is similar to what occurs in the private sector , in which managers sometimes are exposed to Eastern texts such as the Bhagavad Gita , asked to dodge paint balls or catch their colleagues in so - called trust falls .
High - end sessions might include whitewater rafting .
Marquez said many people had told her that they found the training helpful .
Her department , with more than 500 employees and a budget of $ 45 million , helps build affordable housing , enforce rent control laws and ensure apartments are up to code .
In 2005 , the city attorney ’s office approved an initial $ 4,750 two - day workshop titled “ Recalibration , ” described in the 2005 memo as helping executives to “ manage the stress of change ” and develop “ team dynamics , chemistry and rhythm . ”

Among the activities described by attendees was an exercise in which employees tried to match the movements of a leader ’s stick .
“ The leader gives an initial command , so everybody waves sticks in rhythm , ” said Mark Winogrond , a former Culver City city manager and former interim director of the city ’s planning department , who helps Wong do the training .
“ She ’s a very clever team builder . ”
Last year , the City Council unanimously approved another contract for up to $ 15,000 to Wong ’s organization .

Since then , Griffin has toiled tirelessly to transform the image of the party .
Out went the number one haircuts and Doc Martens , in came suits , silk ties and sensible shoes .
Out too went the foul - mouthed vitriol and swinging fists , replaced with press releases , soundbites and Newsnight appearances .
Yet despite the seven years of repackaging , it is impossible to miss the racism .
Xenophobia oozes from every pronouncement of the party and its leaders , on paper , on the internet and in person .
The BNP has abandoned words such as " black " and " white " , and even " race " , but still talks of " ethno- nationalism " or " socio- biology " .
The party talks about " the indigenous peoples of these islands in the North Atlantic which have been our homeland for millennia " .
And its officials rarely miss an opportunity to promote fear and loathing of Islam .
Still the makeover is attractive to increasing numbers of people .
In 2004 , at the last European elections , 808,200 voted BNP .
In last May 's local elections the party won 229,000 votes and now has more than 50 council seats .
Its leaders seriously believe they can gain a foothold on the Greater London Assembly , and that they will soon capture their first Westminster seat .
It is also gaining significant numbers of new members .
The Icelander
As well as handing over the complete membership lists for the area , along with a code which it uses to decipher its encrypted email messages , the BNP introduced me to the elaborate system of pseudonyms and secret rendezvous points which it uses to hide some of its activists ' true identities and to conceal the locations of their meetings .
The party was eager to recruit more members in some of the most affluent areas of central London , partly in the hope of shaking off its image as a party appealing purely to the white working class .
Once in possession of the membership lists , however , I discovered that it already has significant numbers of members in areas such as Chelsea , Belgravia , Knightsbridge and Primrose Hill , including a leading proponent of complementary medicine , a healthcare regulator and a popular ballerina .
But the only person I recruited to the BNP was an immigrant who was out of work and applying for state benefits .
It was an episode which demonstrated that while the party says it is resolutely anti-immigration , it will eagerly admit some immigrants to its ranks - as long as they are the correct colour .
During the first week of November , an Icelander approached a leading BNP member to ask whether he could join .
I was told to call on him at home , establish whether he was " settled here " and , if so , sign him up .
I reported back to the London regional organiser , Nick Eriksen , that he was a pleasant and presentable young man , and that he was very concerned about " the dangers of Islam " .
On the other hand , I pointed out , he 's an immigrant , he 's unemployed , he 's seeking incapacity benefit and council accommodation , and his heavily accented English is difficult to understand at times .
Perhaps not the most obvious candidate for BNP membership .
" But he 's here legally ? " Eriksen demanded .
" Oh yes , he 's met a woman here , a nurse , and they have a three - year - old son . "
" Well that 's fine then , if he 's married to an Englishwoman and he 's entitled to be here .
Let 's sign him up . "
I explained to Eriksen that the Icelander and his partner were not married .
" And she 's not English .
She 's Filipina . "
There was a slight intake of breath at the other end of the line , and a long pause .
" Erm , would you like some time to think about it , Nick ? "
" Yes , that 's a good idea , I 'll think about it . "
Eventually , he was allowed to join , precisely because his partner is Filipina .
During one of our chats at the Orange Tree pub in Richmond , Eriksen explained that the party was looking for a member " who is comfortable and happy dealing with people of other ethnic groups " , and who could talk to members of something called the Ethnic Liaison Committee .
This bizarre BNP organisation , run from a residential address in Erith , south - east London , is open to members of ethnic minorities who support the party .
Nick explains that a number of Chinese people and Sikhs sometime send emails to the party , expressing support .
The Liaison Committee can be useful : " It shows that we 're not raving , racist skinheads who want to kill everyone - it shows that we are perfectly able to have cordial relations with other groups ... and if they do n't threaten us , we do n't threaten them . "
The handbook
The party is eager for me to get a small group of activists out into the residential areas of central London , distributing leaflets and selling copies of the party newspaper , Voice of Freedom .
Nick has a few tips about how to make the work easier .
I should take a copy of the local electoral register , he says , to avoid wasting time knocking on the doors of black or minority ethnic people .
" You want to have the register in front of you , and you say ' Oh , we 'll skip this door , it 's Mr Omonga Bonga ' , or whatever .
It 's more efficient that way . "
There is more advice to be found in the BNP 's Activist 's and Organiser 's Handbook , which informs me how to deliver leaflets without being attacked , how to deal with " screamers " - people who object loudly to having BNP literature stuffed through their letterboxes - what to do if arrested ( police officers can be " motivated by a desire to please their politically correct bosses " , the book warns ) .
It also concedes : " In the past the nationalist movement has , to be truthful , often acted in a way that conforms to and confirms the negative media stereotype .
It is therefore important that you as an activist only act in a way that reflects credit on the party . "
The determination of the BNP 's leaders to forge a disciplined and well - organised party should not be underestimated .
The handbook hammers home the need for complete dedication .
" We can not rely on the media to promote our policies and ideas , " the book explains .
" We have to rely on our members to get out there ... we must effectively create our own nationalist community , our own sea in which we can swim politically . "
This is what the party is doing , with some success , in a handful of areas .
In Barking and Dagenham , it polled an average of 41 % of the votes in the wards it contested in last May 's elections , compared with a Labour vote of 34 % .
It now has 11 councillors and is the official opposition .
And campaigning does not end when polls have closed : last month BNP activists distributed 62,000 leaflets across the borough .
Jon Cruddas , the Labour MP for Dagenham , tells a story about three tower blocks where data collected over several elections showed that no one ever voted .
As a consequence , the Westminster parties never sent anyone there .
BNP activists knocked on every single door and the residents , long neglected by the mainstream politicians , turned out in force for the party .
The BNP is appealing not only to xenophobes , but to those who feel effectively disenfranchised by 21st century British politics - people who feel not so much alienated as cast utterly adrift .
RVP , Railway Tavern
While the BNP relies heavily upon its activists , there are many whom Nick describes as " silent members " - people who wish to join and offer financial support , but who are anxious to remain anonymous .
This is one reason for the encryption of all emails in which membership details are divulged , and for the use of rendezvous points , or RVPs .
Those who gather at one of the most popular Saturday evening RVPs , outside Liverpool Street station in London , are generally redirected to a second - floor bar above the Railway Tavern , a pub a few hundred yards away .
This is a popular venue for BNP buffets and quiz nights : it was here that the party 's London activists held their Christmas party the weekend before last .
With a £ 12 entry fee ( £ 20 for couples ) and drinks at £ 3.15 a time , it is also a useful place to raise funds .
The crowd upstairs at the Railway are mostly middle - aged , and around three - quarters are men .
There are usually a few shaven - headed members wearing football shirts or Union flag t- shirts , but most favour sober suits and ties .
As is customary whenever large numbers of BNP members gather , a security guard or two , wearing black suits and earpieces , hover near the entrance .
It was at the Railway that I met several of the BNP 's councillors , including Richard Barnbrook , who is to be the party 's next candidate for London mayor - " I 've given up drinking because of the perception of some in the party that I drink a little too much on occasions " - and Pat Richardson , whose decision to join the party astonished many , as she is Jewish - " you should come out leafleting with us , you get all that exercise and fresh air , and you 're among your own people " .
I also met many of the party 's rank - and - file members , who talked frankly about their discontent , about their racism , and about the sense of comradeship that the BNP brings them .
Many see Britain as a sick and corrupt place , a country in perpetual crisis , and appear to believe that it is falling headlong towards collapse .
Multi-culturalism , they believe , is as much a cause as a symptom of this diseased state .
It is also the cause of their own unease .
Several young men , for example , talked about how uncomfortable they felt in central London , because there were so many non-white people around them .
" We 're all being pushed out to the fringes , " said one .
While the men at the Railway complain about " white flight " , the women talk about how they joined the BNP for the sakes of their children .
Joyce , a former policewoman from Hornchurch , said when she announced she intended to join , " my husband was worried I was going to get my head kicked in " .
The other women laugh aloud at the notion that the party could in any way be associated with violence .
Electoral strategy
It is at the Railway that I learn from veterans of the BNP just how inspired they have been by the experiences of the French far - right party , the Front National , and the Flemish nationalist party , Vlaams Belang .
The Front National 's leader , Jean - Marie Le Pen , won 17.8 % of the vote in the 2002 presidential elections , while Vlaams Belang can attract almost a quarter of the votes cast in Flemish areas of Belgium and increased the number of council seats it controls from 439 to 794 in elections two months ago .
But is electoral success what the BNP and its leaders are really seeking ?
They crave political legitimacy and want to win votes , but do they really think they could take control of a local authority in Yorkshire or win more than two or three London Assembly seats ?
Eriksen says the party intends to target Jon Cruddas 's seat , but does it really think it could win ?
And if it did , could it win a second Westminster seat ?
At the same time that it is seeking electoral success , the BNP appears desperate to instil a sense of real urgency into its activists .
The organiser 's handbook warns : " We do not have centuries in which to gradually achieve our aims ... we have a limited amount of time available for us , maybe a couple of decades . "
The BNP is clearly in a breathless hurry , but , from my conversations with members , I could never quite understand why .
Then I heard a recording of a speech Nick Griffin gave to a closed conference of white supremacists in New Orleans last year .
In it he spelled out the party 's strategy - and made clear that winning votes is not an end in itself .
After his almost - casual denigration of British Muslims - " the most appalling , insufferable people to have to live with " - Griffin revealed his belief that a period of prolonged recession was certain to engulf the developed world as a result of fuel shortages and global warming .
This , he said , would happen soon but it would not be a disaster , rather " a once - in - 200 - years opportunity " .
Far - right parties needed to prepare for this moment of crisis by ensuring that enough people were aware of their policies and had discovered that they were " not crazy - eyed lunatics " , he said .
If people had considered voting for the BNP , he argued , they would be more likely to turn to the party during a time of immense crisis .
" It will be the beginning of an age of scarcity , an age in which a well - organised nationalist party could really make an impact .
And that 's the key word - organised .
In Britain , we are almost there : we have got this solid 5 % block [ of support ] .
Other radical movements in the past , far left or far right , whatever , a couple of years before a crisis have had far less than 5 % , so as far as I am concerned , that is fairly satisfactory . "
So there it is : the BNP 's leaders believe that the time will soon come when power will fall into the street , and at that moment , with significant sections of Britain 's white population cheering them on , they will be able to scoop it up .
While 5 % support is a good starting point , Griffin told his audience , the Front National has an 18 % - strong block of support , and almost half the white voters in France had voted for the party at some time .
If the BNP was to enjoy that level of support , it would not be consigned to the political margins for much longer .
It would , Griffin said , be just " one crisis away from power " .
The Christmas party
Upstairs at the Railway , it is unclear whether the crowd propping up the bar are aware of the role they would be expected to play in the post - apocalyptic Albion of Nick Griffin 's imagination .
Most seem content merely to be enjoying a drink among " our people " .
At the Christmas party two weeks ago , with around 100 people crammed into the room , one young member told me of the immense relief he felt after joining the party .
Lawrence , an East - Ender in his 20s , confided that he had felt extremely isolated because so few people shared his dislike of black people .
" I thought I was the only person who thought this way , " he said .
" I would sit in the pub getting drunk on my own , thinking I was going mad . "
As the beer flowed and the 80s pop music blared , and as Councillor Richard Barnbrook tried on a red Santa hat adorned with flashing lights , Lawrence looked around the room at his new friends .
" I 've found other people who think exactly the same way , " he said .
" And it 's just ... fantastic . "

The sage of Baltimore , H.L. Mencken , once observed , " The urge to save humanity is almost always only a false - face for the urge to rule it . "
We could even indulge that old habit of division by saying that people are divided into two classes — those who are willing to leave others alone to pursue their own happiness , and those who have a burning itch to tell others how they should do it and , if they do n’t listen , force them to follow instructions .
I ’ve seen this in my own life .
Even under the influence of spirits , I never imagined that disliking the flavor of brussels sprouts could spark anger in another person , but as it turned out , I married just such a person .
She had a great many virtues , but it did upset her to find out that people had different tastes and opinions about things .
She thought , bless her memory , that her firm statement that brussels sprouts were good was a universal and indisputable fact .
It frustrated her greatly when I insisted that it was merely a matter of opinion , and in my opinion they were not good and that their flavor resembled the smell of sewage .
My philosophy , no doubt a result of my Celtic genes , is that I will do what I like and other people are free to do what they like .
Differences of opinion , tastes , even ideology do n’t bother me .
I ’m even reluctant to give advice when people ask for it .
In fact , since the traditional definitions of liberals and conservatives have been made obsolete by modernity and its muddy thinking , we can even redefine them .
A liberal is person with a burning itch to run other people ’s lives ; a conservative has no desire to do so .
Look at our current society .
People who think smoking is bad are not content to quit the habit themselves ; they wish to forcibly prevent others from smoking .
People who think eating trans fat is bad are not content to avoid it themselves ; they want to ban it .
People who think owning a gun is a bad thing want to prevent others from owning guns .
People who think using certain drugs is bad want to prevent others from using them .
People who dislike the Confederate battle flag wish to prevent those who like it from displaying it .
And so on and so forth .
In every case , prevention is translated into a denial of choice , and what is freedom but the liberty of making one ’s own choices ?
The more areas of our lives in which we are denied the freedom to choose , the less liberty there is .
Totalitarianism is the denial of all choices .
We have n’t gotten to that point yet , but we seem to be steadily marching in that direction , led , of course , by liberal reformers who wish to save us from ourselves .
That ’s why I say that authoritarianism , not democracy , is the direction the world is headed toward .
Truly , I ’ve never understood the psychology of those people who want to control the lives of other people .
Granted , parents have to provide some guidance to their children , but even that , I think , should be limited to survival skills and a basic moral code .
Children come into the world their own persons , and parents have no right to force them into some kind of mold .
Whether a child likes sports or reading should be left up to the child , for example .
All of a child ’s inclinations should be encouraged , and none discouraged .
Conditional love is , in my opinion , not love at all .
No child should have to earn his or her parents ’ love .
Alexander Solzhenitsyn said once that America had lost its civic courage , and that might be our core problem .
It takes a great deal of courage to live free and to allow others to live free .
Maybe I ’ve answered my own question .
People ’s itch to control others might be motivated by fear .
That ’s at least worth thinking about .

I must start by saying that I ’ve never really liked Froot Loops .
I was always more of a Trix guy growing up .
I ca n’t say why , exactly .
Maybe it was my sympathy for the Trix rabbit , or maybe it was because I never really understood the appeal of Toucan Sam .
He was boring and dull , nothing like my buddy “ Two - Can Sam ” who earned his nickname through his method of drinking which led to alcohol poisoning .
Perhaps I never really dug Froot Loops because my elementary school would feed me stale ones every morning .
It also could ’ve even been the fact that my school district switched from milk cartons to milk bags in the mid nineties , forcing us to puncture the bags like savages .
The milk went everywhere but in the bowl , causing me to dress the cereal with tears when the milk from the bag ran out .
So maybe it was the horrible traumatization , but I ca n’t be sure .
What I am sure of is that I no longer have to relive those memories , as Froot Loops now come in straw form .
“ Straws …made of cereal ?
This is fucking AWESOME ! ”
What do you mean ?
That was n’t what you were thinking ?
Okay , you ’re probably right .
On the list of “ things nobody asked for , but we ’re going to give you anyways , ” cereal straws has to rank in the top five .
On that basis alone , it was worthy of an impulsive buy .
I need to drink more milk , anyways .
I have n’t grown in years and the commercials say it helps prevent osteoporosis in women .
I ’m not sure if I need that second part , but you can never be too sure .
Upon perforating one of the two packages , the perfume of fake fruit and powdered milk permeated the air and tempted the taste buds ( try to say that without sounding like Daffy Duck , I dare you ) .
There ’s something about unabashedly artificial flavoring that ’s both charming and nostalgic … sexual , even .
Alright , maybe not sexual , but something pleasant nonetheless .
The straws were thinner than what the box indicated , looking more like real straws than giant - sized novelty pens .
They are lined in the middle with that sickly sweet powdered milk that seems to be popping up in granola and cereal bars everywhere .
Someone needs to tell these guys that it does NOT replace milk and that we can all tell it ’s just sweetened coffee creamer .
Fortunately , the flavor of that is masked by the Froot Loop shell .
The straws themselves are rather sturdy and hold up well to milk .
They last a long time without getting soggy and do actually work as straws .
They basically taste like Froot Loops , which is all you could realistically hope for .
Sadly , the cereal straws live in a paradoxical existence ; humans cannot eat and drink at the same time .
Well … I guess soup makes us do that , but let ’s ignore that for a second .
Once you take a single bite of the cereal straw , it becomes too short for drinking and the fun immediately dissipates .
If you just sit there and drink the milk , you ’ll just be wasting the straw as it imparts no flavor and is generally useless .
Once you get to the bottom , you realize you have a half - soggy cereal straw with no milk to wash it down with .
God damn , it ’s like a snake eating its own tail !
Alas , cereal straws are apparently too cool for the laws of this universe and exist only as fun , yet impractical novelties .

In her historical mystery , The Daughter of Time , Josephine Tey ( a pen name of Elizabeth MacKintosh ) has Scotland Yard Inspector Alan Grant , while confined to his hospital bed , solve the 15th century murder of the two York princes in the Tower of London .
The princes were murdered by Henry VII , and the crime was blamed on Richard III in order to justify the upstart Tudor ’s violent seizure of the English throne .
Tey makes the point that if a 20th century mystery writer can detect the truth about a 15th century murder , historians have no excuse to persist in writing in school textbooks that Richard murdered his nephews .
British historians remained loyal to the Tudor propaganda long after the Tudors were no longer around to be feared or served .
At the beginning of the scientific era , men had the hope that the ability to discover truth would free mankind from superstition , dogma , and the service of power .
The belief in truth was powerful .
Truth would deliver justice and bring an end to status - based privileges and the falsehoods propagated by privilege .
The faith in truth was short - lived .
Today propaganda is everywhere in the ascendency .
In the panoply of left - wing propaganda about Pinochet , it is nowhere mentioned that Allende was appointed president of Chile by the Chilean congress , which three years later called on Chile ’s military to oust Allende for his totalitarian ways .
Instead , Allende is portrayed as a " popularly elected president who was overthrown by a tyrant . "
Every week another apologist for President Bush compares " Bush ’s fight for Iraqi freedom " to Abraham Lincoln ’s " fight to free the slaves . "
The American civil war was not fought to " free the slaves , " as Thomas DiLorenzo and other scholars have thoroughly documented , any more than the purpose of Bush ’s illegal invasion of Iraq was to " bring freedom to Iraqis . "
The freedom excuse was invented after it became impossible to maintain the fictions about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and Saddam Hussein ’s connections to Osama bin Laden .
Bush has yet to tell the real reason he invaded Iraq .
In the US today , demonization and propaganda substitute for facts and analysis .
Professors and journalists are quick to lend their names and voices to the untruths that rule our lives .
Just as Hitler ’s foreign policy was based in propaganda , so is Bush ’s and Blair’s .
The success of propaganda enhances government ’s illusion that it has a monopoly on truth .
It is the monopoly on truth that gives the Bush regime the right to define the " Iran problem , " the " Syria problem , " the " Lebanon problem , " and the " Korea problem " and to apply coercion in place of understanding and negotiation .
Secure in its possession of truth , the Bush administration refuses to talk to the enemies it has manufactured .
It will only fight them .
When scholars , such as John Walt and Stephen Mearsheimer , or President Jimmy Carter , who has tried harder than anyone else to achieve Arab - Israeli peace , point out that Israel ’s mistreatment of Palestinians is a cause of Middle East turmoil , they are immediately denounced as anti-Semites .
Columnists and academics who know nothing about the Middle East or its troubles nevertheless know what they are supposed to say whenever anyone mentions Israel in any critical context .
And they have no compunction about saying it , the truth be damned .
Without commitment to truth , science , justice , and debate falter and disappear .
The belief in truth is fading from our society .
It is unclear that scientists themselves any longer believe in truth or the ability to discover it .
The discovery of truth is no longer the purpose of our criminal justice system .
Once prosecutors believed that it was better for ten guilty men to go free than for one innocent person to be wrongfully convicted .
Today prosecutors believe in high conviction rates to justify their budgets and re-election .
In the past police solved crimes .
Today they round up suspects and pressure them .
There was no debate in Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia , and none today in the US .
Many Americans , who imagine themselves to be conservatives even though they have never read , nor could they identify , a conservative writer , equate truth - telling with hatred of America .
They are of Bush ’s mindset : " you are with us or against us . "
Bush supporters respond to factual articles about Iraq and the rending of the US Constitution by suggesting that as the writer hates America so much , he should move to Cuba or China .
In America today each faction ’s " truths " are defined by the faction ’s dogma or ideology .
Each faction bans factual analysis that it does n’t want to hear .
This is as true within the universities as it is at political rallies .
The old liberal notion that " we shall follow the truth wherever it may lead " has long departed from America .
Think tanks reflect the views of the donors .
Studies are no longer independent of their financing .
In America , truth has become partisan .
All societies have elements of myth , untruths that nevertheless serve to unite a people .
But many myths serve as camouflage for evil .
One of the greatest myths is that " GIs have died for our freedom . "
GIs have died for American empire , for the American elite ’s commitment to England , and for the military - industrial complex ’s profits .
Some may have died in Korea for the freedom of South Koreans , and some may have died trying to save South Vietnamese from the North Vietnamese communists .
But it is hogwash that GIs died for our freedom .
There was no prospect of North Korea attacking America in the 1950s or Vietnam attacking America in the 1960s and none today .
The Nazis were defeated by Russia before US troops landed in Europe .
The US never faced any threat of invasion from Germany , Italy , or Japan .
America ’s wars have created hysteria that endangers our freedom .
Abraham Lincoln shut down the freedom of the press and arrested editors and state legislators .
Woodrow Wilson arrested war critics .
Franklin Roosevelt interred American citizens of Japanese descent .
George W. Bush has destroyed most of the Bill of Rights .
In 2006 Congress appropriated funds for building concentration camps in the US .
Recently , Newt Gingrich , the former Speaker of the House , said that freedom of speech is inconsistent with " the war on terror . "
If it takes a police state to fight terror , the country is lost even if Muslim terrorists are defeated .
Americans have far more to fear from a homeland police state than from terrorists .
The vast majority of the world ’s terrorists are the recent creations of Bush ’s invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and of Israel ’s invasion of Lebanon and brutality toward the Palestinians .
Bush is simultaneously creating terrorists and a police state .
It serves no one but the police to make their power unaccountable .
On December 26 Jeff Cohen explained on Truthout how war propaganda took over TV news and demonized everyone who spoke the truth about Iraq , while pushing war fever to a frenzy .
Fox " News " was the worst with its ranks of generals and colonels who sold their integrity for dollars and TV exposure .
One of Fox ’s loudest voices for war was a retired general who sat on the board of a military contractor .
When the Clinton administration allowed the media concentration in the 1990s , the independence of the American media was destroyed .
Today there are a few large conglomerates whose values depend on broadcast licenses from the government .
The conglomerates are run by corporate executives who are not journalists and whose eyes are on advertising revenues .
They publish and broadcast what is safe .
These conglomerates will take no risks in behalf of free speech or truth .
The challenges that America faces are not terrorism and oil supply .
The challenges that we face are the police state that Bush has created and the disrespect for truth that is endemic in government , the universities , and the media .
The US has entered a dark age of dogmas and unaccountable power .
The Best of Paul Craig Roberts
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China plans to sack all officials found to have secretly “ kept and supported ” mistresses , in a move aimed at raising social morals , state media reported on Friday .
The step hardens up previous policy .
“ It is a misunderstanding that officials who have mistresses would only be sacked when the situation is serious , ” the Beijing News quoted a Ministry of Personnel spokesman as saying .
Mistresses and “ second wives ” are common among government officials and businessmen in China , and Chinese media have said the financial pressures of keeping mistresses have driven some officials to seek money through bribes or abuse of power .
Corrupt officials are a major cause of public outrage in China , and the country ’s Communist rulers have warned that if graft is not checked it could threaten the party ’s grip on power .
The ministry said it had studied the issue and found it “ necessary to make a clarification and emphasis ” on the punishment for officials who supported mistresses .
“ The morality of government officials shown in their management or power operation ... directly affects the moral level of the whole society , ” the spokesman was quoted as saying .
“ Therefore , officials should set up good examples , and abide by social morality rules . ”
Last year , a Chinese vice admiral was jailed for life on embezzlement charges after one of his many mistresses blew the whistle on him when he refused to give in to her demand for money .

When the Huygens probe touched down on Titan , it landed on arelatively soft patch of material similar to lightly packed snow , researchersannounced today .
But to get to that soft patch , Huygens had to descend through atreacherous atmosphere where winds raged up to 270 mph , temperatures dropped aslow as - 333 degrees Fahrenheit , and lightning was likely .
Nearly a year after the probe landed on Saturn 's largest moon , scientists are still poring over loads of data .
Today , researchers releasedtheir newest findings in a series of seven reports published on line by thejournal Nature .
The findings provide a better picture of some of the most basiccharacteristics of Titan , a smog - shrouded world that had eluded close scrutinyuntil Huygens and the Cassini mothershipteamed up for a series of observations .
The landing site
Titan 's surface was unveiled as Huygens plunged through theclouds and fired up its Descent Imager / Spectral Radiometer ( DISR ) .
While theseimages did not show the pools of liquid hydrocarbon that many scientistsexpected , they do show the signs of flowing liquid in the form of brightnessvariations around the outlines of " ponds " and a " coastline " as well as what appear to be slopes carved by liquid drainage .
Images taken after landing show several small stones andpebbles and that the general topography of the region is fairly flat , varyingonly 3 feet or so in height .
Images and other instruments ruled out thepresence of extensive methane ground fogs in the landing site .
The surface of the landing site was neither hard nor fluffysoft , instead having characteristics similar to wet clay , lightly packed snow , or wet or dry sand , into which the probe sank a tiny bit after landing .
Thecomposition of surface vapors near the probe showed that the surface was wetwith methane , which evaporated as the warm probe landed in the cold soil .
Thesurface was also rich in organic compounds – such as cyanogenand ethane – not detected in the atmosphere .
Some scientists speculated that a tide had just gone out and the probe landed on the still - wet beach .
Super - windy
Scientists had long suspected that Titan 's atmosphere wasmoving around the moon faster than the moon was rotating – a physicalcharacteristic known as superrotation and previouslyobserved on Venus .
Now , data from the probe 's DISR instrument and the DopplerWind Experiment have confirmed that Titan 's methane filled clouds do indeed superrotate .
While the uppermost clouds – about 75 miles above thesurface – spin around the moon at about 270 miles per hour , wind speedsgradually decline as the near the surface .
Here generally weak winds , gustingno more than a few feet per second , were observed in the lowest 3 miles of theprobe 's descent .
The probe passed through one other region of near zero windspeeds , from altitudes 62 to 37 miles .
Scientists cannot explain this yet .
Atmosphere
During its descent , Huygens provided the first in situ look at what chemicals exist inTitan 's atmosphere .
The atmosphere is mainly nitrogen and methane , butscientists did n't know how these chemicals originated – did they arrivein their present form or were they originally part of other molecules and werechemically altered to the states seen today .
The gas argon 36 was detected by the Gas Chromatograph MassSpectrometer in very low abundance , and scientists say this indicates thatnitrogen was originally present as part of ammonia .
Also , the early atmosphereof the moon was at least five times denser with nitrogen than it is now , suggesting that some of the gas has been lost into space .
Ratios of carbon isotopes also indicate that the atmosphere isalso leaking methane , and that there must be some period method forreplenishment , although none was observed .
Some researchers predicted therewould be a large methane surface or subsurface reservoir that replenished theatmosphere , although that too was not seen .
Also missing from the observationswas the signs of methane rain , which scientists believed showered the moon ' ssurface .
It could be that cyrovolcanoes– similar to terrestrial volcanoes except they spew liquid water andammonia from subsurface reservoirs – could be providing both theatmosphere and the surface with nitrogen and methane .
" The current theories are that there is a region ofwater - ammonia mix in liquid form at some depth below Titan 's surface –this is equivalent to the magma on Earth , " study co-author Andrew Balltold SPACE.com .
" These areone possible source for renewable methane on Titan . "
Aerosol clumps , freezing temperatures , and maybe some lightning
The Aerosol Collector and Pyrolyser ( ACP ) instrument analyzed particles as it passed through the clouds andreported the presence of nitrogen - containing organic compounds , which mayinclude amino , imino , and nitrilegroups – key components to protein formation here on Earth .
These particles also clump together , perhaps providing afoundation for cloud formation , and affect temperatures and wind speedsthroughout the atmosphere .
They also fall as kind of steady organic rain onTitan 's surface , the researchers write , and could produce a global blanket witha potential thickness of half a mile or more .
Researchers also used the Huygens Atmospheric StructureInstrument ( HASI ) during the descent to measure the atmosphere 's temperaturefrom the upper layers all the way down to the surface .
Temperature at thesurface averaged around - 289 degrees Fahrenheit , which is warm enough for theexistence of lakes and rivers of liquid natural gas .
Atmospheric temperaturesranged from - 333 degrees Fahrenheit at the highest elevations – 870 milesabove the surface – to about - 154 degrees Fahrenheit in the stratosphere , about 25 miles from the surface .
The HASI instrument also detected electric activity that issimilar to lightning 's signature .
This was spotted around 37 miles above the moon ' ssurface , which is also the region where the wind speed dropped to near zero .
i Pod Shuffle and Zune Ads Compared
" I 've seen the demonstrations on the Internet about how you can find another person using a Zune and give them a song they can play three times .
It takes forever .
By the time you 've gone through all that , the girl 's got up and left !
You 're much better off to take one of your earbuds out and put it in her ear .
Then you 're connected with about two feet of headphone cable . "
i Pod Shuffle and Zune Ads Compared

All technology issues aside , I like the contrast between the Zune ads and the brand new iPod Shuffle ads .
On the surface , you have some similar elements : young people in designers clothes against indie-ish music .
A bit deeper down , differences are striking .
The format for most of the Zune ads is to create an environment of people just hanging out , in way that 's designed to look candid and casual .
The camera moves around as in a reality show .
Once that 's setup , they insert a Zune into the shot .
Until that point , the commercial could be for anything from Gap to Coke .
I 'm also fascinated — — by the fact that the spots pointedly highlight what Steve Jobs said about the Zune file sharing feature :
Here 's what Steve said in Newsweek :
And there it is , right in the ad for the thing .
The conventional iPod ads with the deep black sillouttes against pastel grounds are instantly recognizable , to the point that even the spoofs are recognizable .
What 's interesting ?
No faces , and the clothing all blends together .
The iPod itself stands out in front of everything else .
The camera is always fixed on the one character and the iPod .
The racial makeup of the characters is generally left to the viewer to decide .
The iPod Nano ads flip the equation around a bit by making the iPod itself the pastel , but the result is the same : the focus is on the iPod , not the people .
The new iPod Shuffle ads are something else entirely .
You can see the people in designer clothes .
No pastel backgrounds , no silhouettes .
Still , the anonymity of the characters is preserved because the faces are cut off .
The camera is static .
I love transitions between the characters .
Subtle yet suprising .
I love the eerie lighting .
Throughout all of the iPod ads , two elements remain : there 's only one person on the screen at any time and the iPod itself is .
It might be that the Zune approach is effective , but it 's interesting that the tactic is to set the stage first , then introduce the Zune near the end .
Okay , now that I 'm done over - analyzing , I 'd like to say I love the Zune ad with the basset
In the long term , something more ominous is at work .
If a free society is to work , the vast majority of citizens must reflexively obey the law not because they fear punishment , but because they accept that the rule of law makes society possible .
That reflexive law - abidingness is reinforced when the laws are limited to core objectives that enjoy consensus support , even though people may disagree on means .

Thus society is weakened every time a law is passed that large numbers of reasonable , responsible citizens think is stupid .
Such laws invite good citizens to choose knowingly to break the law , confident that they are doing nothing morally wrong .
The reaction to Prohibition , the 20th century ’s stupidest law , is the archetypal case .
But the radical expansion of government throughout the last century has created many more .
For example , all employers are confronted with rules and regulations from Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that they regard with contempt — not because they cut into profits , but because they are , simply , stupid .
They impede employers yet provide no collateral social benefit .
And so employers treat the stupid regulations as obstructions to be fudged or ignored .
When they have to comply , they do not see compliance as the right thing to do , but as placating an agency that will hurt them otherwise .
The same thing applies to lesser degrees to all of us who find ourselves doing things that we know are pointless ( think of various aspects of tax law ) only because we fear attracting a bureaucracy ’s attention .
For millions of Americans , our day - to - day relationship with government is increasingly like paying protection to the Mafia — keeping it off our backs while we get on with our lives .
" Here is where the action takes place .
This is where we effectively try to turn the clock back 14 billion years .
Right above your head , about 13 ½ feet in the air . "
Looking up , I try to imagine the events Tim Hallman is describing — atoms of gold colliding at 99.99 percent the speed of light ; temperatures instantly soaring to 1 trillion degrees , 150,000 times hotter than the core of the sun .
Then I try to picture a minuscule five - dimensional black hole , which , depending on your point of view , may or may not have formed at that same spot over my head .
It 's all a little much for an imagination that sometimes struggles with the plot of Battlestar Galactica .
I 'm standing in a Battlestar - scale room at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton , New York , where Hallman and about 1,200 other physicists labor away as latter - day demiurges .
Here in the middle of Long Island , they are re-creating the opening microseconds of the universe 's existence , the time when the first particles of matter — of everything — appeared .
The building we 're in straddles a small segment of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider , or RHIC ( pronounced " Rick " ) , an ultrapowerful particle accelerator with a 2.4 - mile circumference .
For nine months of the year , a 1,200 - ton detector as big as a house fills most of the room .
But technicians have hauled the detector to an adjoining hangar - size area for maintenance , leaving me and Hallman free to amble just below the spot where a new form of matter exploded into being during the accelerator 's recent runs .
New , that is , in that it has n't existed since the very beginning of time , or by the transcendently precise reckoning of physicists , since 10 millionths of a second after the Big Bang , 13.7 billion years ago .
That was the last time particles called quarks and gluons — the most fundamental constituents of matter — roamed free in the cosmos , and it was a brief run .
After just a hundred - millionth of a second , all the universe 's quarks combined in triplets — held together by gluons — to form protons and neutrons .
They have been locked inside the hearts of atoms ever since , until RHIC set them loose once again .
When the gold nuclei collide in the accelerator , they explode in a fireball just a trillionth of an inch wide .
Inside that nanoscale fireball , temperatures exceed a trillion degrees , mimicking conditions in the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang .
The nuclei literally melt back into their constituent quarks and gluons .
Then , 50 trillionths of a trillionth of a second later , the fireball cools , just as the infant universe did as it expanded , and the quarks and gluons merge once again to form protons and neutrons .
With these experiments , Hallman and his Brookhaven colleagues are discovering something extraordinary about the early universe .
The quarks and gluons that coursed through the newborn cosmos — and considerably more recently , through RHIC — took the form not of a gas , as physicists expected , but of a liquid .
For a few instants , a sloshing soup of quarks and gluons filled the universe .
" I like to say that our theory of the early universe is now all wet , " says Bill Zajc , a physicist at Columbia University and the leader of one of the experimental teams at RHIC .
He might have added that the theory is full of holes , little black ones from the fifth dimension , because it turns out that in a strange mathematical sense , the quarks and gluons at RHIC are equivalent to microscopic black holes in a higher - dimensional space .
Understanding just why that is so involves navigating a labyrinth of strange , heady , and heretofore seemingly unrelated theories of physics .
In addition to challenging the conventional model of how the universe behaved in its earliest instants , the RHIC data also provide the first empirical support for a theory so enthralling it once had physicists dancing at a major conference .
Moreover , the accelerator 's results hint that string theory — the much - ballyhooed " theory of everything , " which has lately come under attack as being little more than a fanciful , if elegant , set of equations — may have something to say about how the universe works after all .
Before the physicists at Brookhaven could begin their pursuit of quarks , gluons , and hyperdimensional holes in space - time , they first had to prove that they would n't destroy the planet in the process .
The doomsday risk never really existed , but making that clear to a worried public occupied the time of some of the world 's leading physicists .
Once the doubts about Earth 's safety had been laid to rest , the physicists at Brookhaven fired up their $ 500 million accelerator for the first time , in the summer of 2000 .
For Nick Samios , it was the culmination of two decades of work .
Samios , who is now director of the RIKEN - BNL Research Center , headed Brookhaven from 1982 until 1997 and was the driving force behind the effort to build RHIC .
" I 'll tell you a story , " he says over lunch at Brookhaven 's staff cafeteria , leaning forward .
The story 's principals are Stalin ; his chief of secret police , Lavrenty Beria ; and Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov , a leading Soviet nuclear physicist .
" Stalin and Beria are discussing the Soviet Union 's first atomic - bomb test .
' Who gets the award if the test is a success ? '
Beria asks Stalin . ' Kurchatov . '
So then Beria asks , ' Who gets shot if it does n't work ? ' ' Kurchatov . '
I feel like Kurchatov .
Anyone else could disassociate themselves from the project .
I could n't . "
One gamble Samios and his colleagues made 20 years ago was to trust in Moore 's law , first formulated in 1965 by one of Intel 's founders , which holds that computing power doubles roughly every 18 months .
The type of accelerator Samios wanted to design would generate a petabyte of data — a million gigabytes — during each run , a rate that would fill the hard drive of one of today 's typical desktop PCs every few minutes .
In 1985 there were no computers that could handle anything close to that .
But the " if we build it , the computers will be there " strategy paid off , and Samios 's dream of a Big Bang machine became a reality .
To re-create the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang , RHIC reaches higher energies than any other collider in the world .
Unlike most accelerators , which smash together simple particles like individual protons , RHIC accelerates clusters of hundreds of gold atoms — with 79 protons and neutrons in each gold nucleus — to 99.99 percent the speed of light .
In the resulting multiatom collisions , a melee of tens of thousands of quarks and gluons is released .
They in turn form thousands of ordinary particles that can be tracked and identified .
" The physics at RHIC is complicated , " Samios says with a touch of understatement .
" Two big nuclei are hitting each other .
Physicists are used to calculating a proton hitting a proton .
We 're hitting 200 nucleons with 200 nucleons [ a nucleon is a proton or neutron ] .
With each collision we get thousands of particle tracks coming out .
We had to build detectors that could count all of them .
People were n't used to that .
They were used to counting 50 in a collision .
" We hoped that RHIC would make great discoveries .
We hoped that we 'd break nuclei into quarks — the early universe was quarks and gluons , and then it cooled off and you got protons and us .
We 've done that .
The question is –Is there something new going on ?
And the answer is yes . "
Until the first gold atoms started making their 13 - microsecond laps around RHIC 's 2.4 - mile - long perimeter , physicists thought they had a pretty good idea of what to expect from the collisions .
The gold nuclei were supposed to shatter and form a hot gas , or plasma , of quarks and gluons .
For physicists , watching the collisions in RHIC would be like watching the Big Bang unfolding before their eyes , but running in reverse — instead of a seething cloud of gluons and quarks settling down to form protons and neutrons , they would see the protons and neutrons burst open in sprays of quarks and gluons .
The universe has been around now for about 400 quadrillion seconds , but for physicists like Tom Kirk , the former associate lab director for high - energy and nuclear physics at Brookhaven , the first millionth of a second was more intriguing than any that followed .
" You may remember Steven Weinberg 's book The First Three Minutes , " says Kirk , referring to a classic account of the physics of the early universe .
" Steve said after those first three minutes , the rest of the story is boring .
Well , we could say after that first microsecond , everything else was pretty boring . "
Kirk smiles and raises his eyebrows slightly , gauging whether I 'm sympathetic to his remark , made , perhaps , only half in jest .
When that first microsecond of eternity ended , the remainder of cosmic history unfolded with stolid inevitability .
Once quarks finished clumping together as protons and neutrons , it was only a matter of time — and gravity — before the first simple atoms gathered in vast clouds to form stars and galaxies , which eventually begot us .
( For an elaboration of your personal relationship with quarks , see " The Big Bang Within You , " below . )
RHIC was designed to observe directly , for the first time , how quarks behave when freed from their nuclear prisons .
The initial results , announced in 2005 , stunned physicists everywhere .
The particles released by the high - speed smashups were not bounding around freely the way atoms in a gas do but moving smoothly and collectively like a liquid , responding as a connected whole to changes in pressure within the fireball .
The RHIC physicists describe their creation as a near " perfect " fluid , one that has extremely low internal friction , or viscosity .
By the standards physicists use , the quarks and gluons make a much better liquid than water .
Since the similarity of quarks and gluons to water is not readily apparent to me , I take the subway to Columbia University to meet Zajc , the leader of one of RHIC 's main experimental groups , hoping he 'll enlighten me .
" So how does one calculate the viscosity of those quarks and gluons ? " he asks rhetorically .
I sit silently , clueless , hiding my befuddlement behind a vigorous show of note taking .
" It turns out there 's a connection here to black - hole physics . "
That connection could be the first , long - awaited sign that string theory — which is in desperate need of evidence , any evidence , to support its ambitious claims to truth — is on the right track .
The implausible - sounding connection between droplets of quarks and black holes may also vindicate a theory that once had 200 of the world 's leading theorists jubilantly dancing the macarena .
Ehhhh !
Maldacena !
M - theory is finished ,
Juan has great repute .
The black hole we have mastered ,
QCD we can compute .
Too bad the glueball spectrum
Is still in some dispute .
Ehhhh !
Maldacena !
So goes Jeffrey Harvey 's über - geek version of the once - ubiquitous 1996 hit .
Harvey , a theoretical physicist at the University of Chicago , wrote the lyrics to honor Juan Maldacena , a young Argentine string theorist now at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton .
It was the summer of 1998 , and Maldacena had just published a paper that to physicists bordered on the miraculous .
He proposed an unexpected link between two ostensibly different theories of fundamental physics : string theory and quantum chromodynamics .
String theory purports to describe all the elementary components of matter and energy not as particles but as vanishingly small vibrating strings .
Photons , protons , and all the other particles are , according to this theory , just different " pitches " of vibration of these strings .
If it is right , string theory would unify gravity and quantum mechanics in a single overarching framework — a goal that physicists have pursued for more than half a century .
The problem is that there is no shred of experimental evidence that string theory is correct ; all the arguments in its favor have been made entirely on the basis of its sophisticated mathematical structure .
Direct experimental tests of string theory have thus far proved impossible , in part because strings are predicted to be so small that no conceivable particle accelerator could ever reach the energies needed to produce them .
Quantum chromodynamics , or QCD , on the other hand , is backed by decades of experiments .
It describes the interactions of quarks and gluons .
( Quarks come in three " colors , " analogous to electric charge ; hence the " chromo " in chromodynamics . )
Unfortunately , unlike string theory , QCD says nothing about gravity , so physicists know they need a broader , more complete theory if they want to explain all of physics .
Moreover , the equations of QCD are notoriously difficult to work with .
Enter Juan Maldacena .
He developed a theory nearly identical to standard QCD , with the major difference being that in his version quarks come in many different colors rather than the usual three .
Even though his theory does not fully apply to the universe we know — it does n't correctly describe quarks — physicists frequently use such so - called toy models to get a handle on otherwise impossibly difficult problems .
And Maldacena 's theory had a remarkable feature , the one that inspired his colleagues to hit the dance floor .
He proved that his pseudo - QCD and string theory are not in fact different theories at all ; mathematically , they are entirely equivalent .
Maldacena 's realization raised an enormous question :
If string theory and his slightly altered take on QCD are essentially one and the same beast , does that mean there is a way to connect string theory to the physics of the real world ?
For the next few years , Maldacena 's tour de force remained largely a plaything for theorists , who almost immediately found intriguing ways to use it .
Most important , his theory simplified the grueling calculations of QCD by offering a way to translate certain QCD problems into the more tractable mathematics of string theory .
" Things that are hard to calculate in QCD are easy in string theory , and vice versa , " says Horatiu Nastase , a string theorist at Brown University .
It was this power to shift problems from the QCD perspective to a string theory view that first led some physicists to see a link between the quarks and gluons at RHIC and the equations describing a black hole .
Dam Thanh Son , a physicist at the University of Washington in Seattle , was one of them .
I called him to ask about what seems , on the face of it , an extraordinarily unlikely comparison .
What could quarks and gluons possibly have in common with nature 's ultimate trash compactors — ultradense concentrations of matter whose gravitational field is so powerful it curves space - time around itself , trapping anything that crosses its surface ?
Son insists that black holes , quarks , and gluons really do have a big thing in common :
They can be described by equations that govern the behavior of liquids .
Then he explains that black holes — and quarks and gluons — are really no stranger than a cup of water .
" If you have a cup of water , and you disturb the water — say , you drop a pebble into it — the disturbance will not last forever .
The water will come to rest .
If you take a cup of honey , the motion ceases more quickly than in water ; the more viscous the fluid , the quicker the perturbation of the system decays with time . "
When something falls into a black hole , Son says , the surface of the black hole is disturbed , just like the water in a cup .
" The black hole will wiggle for some time and come to rest .
In these two processes " — disturbances in black holes and in water — " there is a connection at the mathematical level .
The equation that describes the evolution of the stirring of water in a cup is similar in form to the equations that describe the evolution of the surface of a black hole .
When I deform a black hole , it goes back and forth and then comes to rest .
To describe that I use equations that are similar to equations used for any fluid . "
As word spread that RHIC had created a quark - gluon fluid , Son and a number of other theorists began to wonder if they could use Maldacena 's sleight of hand and substitute the equations of a black hole for the ones normally applied to quarks and gluons .
The switch would make calculating the properties of the primordial particle soup much easier .
Compared with a trillion - degree ruck of quarks and gluons , black holes are simple objects .
( Which is why the lyrics to the Maldacena macarena go : " The black hole we have mastered , QCD we can compute . " )
One property of the quarks and gluons that Son and his colleagues wanted to calculate was viscosity .
Using a black - hole model , they predicted that quarks and gluons should have almost zero viscosity .
When experimentalists at RHIC finally crunched through all their data , they confirmed that the quark - gluon fluid indeed had a low viscosity , at or near the theoretical minimum value predicted by the five - dimensional black - hole model .
" Talk about a shot out of the blue , " Zajc says .
" Who would have thunk it ?
It is the most fascinating thing I 've been involved with , to see this completely unexpected connection emerge and start having an impact on our field . "
So does this success bolster the idea that string theory is the right way to unify all of physics ?
" Absolutely , " says Horatiu Nastase of Brown , who has also sought to understand RHIC 's results in terms of a black hole .
" At least that 's my interpretation and the interpretation of other people .
My understanding is that one is experimentally testing , in this indirect way , string theory . "
Zajc and many other physicists are n't so sure .
" I 've thought an awful lot about this , " he says .
" But I 'm not ready yet to claim that this validates string theory .
Even the string theorists will tell you the viscosity result depends only on ordinary quantum mechanics — it 's just that string theory gives you a snazzy way to calculate it . "
In any event , the black hole under consideration is not the sort that could swallow Long Island .
It 's an entirely different animal .
According to string theory , the universe may contain as many as 10 dimensions .
Most of them are hidden , curled up on scales so small that we cannot sense or even detect them .
The black hole in Son 's calculation dwells in a theoretical world of five dimensions , where the effects of gravity drop so precipitously with increasing distance that a five - dimensional black hole poses no threat — if it even exists at all .
Some physicists consider the five - dimensional black hole to be a mathematical convenience , a way to tackle a complex physical system .
Others are open to a far more radical interpretation , however .
" What we think of as atomic nuclei , quarks , and gluons may really be objects that are projections , in a sense , on a screen , " says Miklos Gyulassy of Columbia , sounding more like Plato philosophizing than like the theoretical physicist that he is .
" We are on the screen .
It looks to us like there are photons and these other particles , but they might really be manifestations , projections , from a higher - dimensional space , of objects that are more conveniently described in our world by saying , ' There is a photon , ' or ' There is a gluon . '
So the very hot quarks and gluons at RHIC may really be a hologram of some nasty black hole somewhere . "
All of these issues and more will continue to be studied at RHIC and at an even more powerful accelerator nearing completion in Switzerland .
The Large Hadron Collider , as the new accelerator is called , will be almost 17 miles in circumference and will reach energies 27 times higher than RHIC's .
" One question that screams out to be answered is whether we 'll see the same sort of perfect fluid that we see at RHIC , " Zajc says , " or whether we 'll see something like an ideal gas where the quarks and gluons are essentially free .
I think it will continue to be a perfect fluid , or very nearly so .
But we 've been surprised before in this field . "
As to whether Maldacena 's ideas will further strengthen string theory or prove a theoretical dead end is anyone 's guess .
The data , says Zajc , are simply too raw .
" This is what new discoveries look like from the inside , " he says .
" If you 'll allow me to mix metaphors , it 's sort of a Mixmaster of swirling ideas that may gradually be distilled into something elegant and nice .
But at the moment we 're watching the sausage - making process . "
Have you wondered why Google Logo is designed like this in this special day ?

There used to be one of those Scandia " family fun " centers on Interstate 50 , just outside of Sacramento , they had Tankball , but in basically overgrown gocarts with plywood on them to make them look like tanks , big targets on the sides , and a turret mounted air powered tennisball launcher .
One person drove the " tank " , one person fired the " cannon " , goal was to hit the target on the other tank , which would stop the tank for a few seconds and spew smoke , you were n't supposed to fire until the tank moved again , not that anyone ever listened to that rule .
Now they sell RVs there , I miss that place .
Would have been MUCH better with paintball guns .
The headquarters of what may be , on a per-capita basis , the busiest , most profitable site on the entire World Wide Web is on the 16th floor of a brand - new Vancouver building with panoramic views of the nearby Canadian Rockies .

It 's been fun to watch the evolution of Gmail 's spam filtering .
In the early days , it was laughably bad .
Even the most basic spam , the stuff that SpamAssassin would score in the 20 + range , would make it through .
But today things are quite a bit different .
Based on my experience , the spam detection and filtering in Gmail is as good as Yahoo's SpamGuard .
Though I do n't regularly use Yahoo !
Mail , we do have the benefit of SpamGuard on our corporate mail servers so I 've developed a subjective notion of how much spam sneaks through both systems .
At this point it 's a draw .
In any given day , I get maybe 15 � 25 spam messages on both systems .
And I suspect they 're both using virtually all the same techniques anyway .
But all along , I 've been popping my personal email into Thurderbird from my own mail server , which runs a combination of spam - fighting stuff .
And just the other day I realized how much less effective it is .
Even after training Thunderbird 's spam filter for months , the combination of SpamAssassin and Thunderbird are far less effective .
I still end up with 75 � 100 spams a day in Thunderbiard , when Gmail is knocking out most of 'em .
The only logical thing to do was take advantage of Gmail 's spam filtering and secure POP access .
Gmail makes it easy to turn on POP access to your inbox and even gives you smart choices about what to do with the Gmail copies once you 've popped your mail :
keep Gmail 's copy in the Inbox
archive Gmail 's copy
delete Gmail 's copy
That , combined with the fact that you even get secure ( meaning encrypted ) POP access and the ability to use Gmail as your SMTP relay ( once you setup SMTP AUTH in your mail client ) tells me one thing :
The folks behind Gmail are trying to give everyone the sort of power and flexibility that used to come only with running your own mail server .
The results so far have been impressive .
I 'm spending less time dealing with the crap that used to end up in my inbox .
Gmail is usable at home , on the road , and at conferences with unsecured networks .
This all makes me wonder if it 's worth it for smaller organizations to bother running their own mail servers anymore .
If Google offered small business mail the way Yahoo does , there 'd be some serious competition in the market and it'd make a lot of people 's lives much easier .
For the last 10 years I 've helped run the various services for WCNet , a community ISP in northwestern Ohio .
We have roughly 15,000 users and get a lot of spam .
Even with greylisting , which helps a lot , we 're still dealing with a lot of spam .
( Postgrey kicks ass as a greylisting implementation for Postfix . )
Amusing side note : WCNet used to stand for " Woody County FreeNet " but the notion of a FreeNet is pretty old , and the service has grown to cover much of northern Ohio and southern Michigan .
So we just call it WCNet these days . :-)

Coding Horror has a post asking people what their favorite programming quotations are .
He throws a sideways reference to Programmers at Work , a book I recently finished reading .
I ’m one of those annoying people who writes in the margins of books , and one of the things I like to do is collect my favorite quotations so that I can remember them down the road .
These are my favorite quotes from Programmers at Work : Interviews with 19 Programmers Who Shaped the Computer Industry .
It is a collection of interviews Susan Lammers did in the early 80s .
You can read my full review of the book here .
“ I have always worried that when these claimed incredible new benefits come , we will lose all the old ones .
Then it becomes a kind of trade - off situation where you have to see if you are better off .
I like clear wins .
I would bet on improving what we have while maintaining all the benefits and eliminating the drawbacks , rather than introducing new games where there are new benefits and new drawbacks . ”
Charles Simonyi , P19
“ Physics and mathematics , like other respectable disciplines , require that you think clearly to succeed in them .
That ’s why many successful computer people come from these fields .
It ’s harder to do what people do nowadays — start in computer science and stay in it — because it ’s a very shallow discipline .
It does n’t really force you to exercise your intellectual capabilities enough ” Butler Lampson , P27
“… They published a ten - year plan that included a foldout showing lines of development and milestones when breakthroughs would be made .
It ’s all nonsense because no one knows how to do these things .
Some of the problems may be solved within the next ten years — but to have a schedule !
The world does n’t work that way .
If you do n’t know the answers to the problems , you ca n’t schedule when you ’re going to finish the project . ”
Butler Lampson , P30
“ The most important goal is to define as precisely as possible the interfaces between the system and the rest of the world , as well as the interfaces between the major parts of the system itself .
The biggest change in my design style over the years has been to put more and more emphasis on the problem to be solved and on finding techniques to define the interfaces precisely .
That pays off tremendously , both in a better understanding of what the program really does , and in identification of the crucial parts .
It also help people understand how the system is put together .
That ’s really the most important aspect of designing a program . ”
Butler Lampson , P33
“ Some people are good programmers because they can handle many more details than most people .
But there are a lot of disadvantages in selecting programmers for that reason — it can result in programs that no one else can maintain . ”
Butler Lampson , P34
“ Our aspirations are contstantly increasing , so the development of better abstractions does n’t make the task of programming much easier :
It means we can do more elaborate things .
We can do more because the primitives that we are using are much more powerful . ”
Butler Lampson , P35
“ To hell with computer literacy .
It ’s absolutely ridiculous .
Study mathematics .
Learn to think .
Read .
Write .
These things are of more enduring value .
Learn how to prove theorems .
… this skill is transferable to many other things .
To study only programming is absurd . ”
Butler Lampson , P38
“ I think a lot before I do anything , and once I do something , I ’m not afraid to throw it away .
It ’s very important that a programmer be able to look at a piece of code like a bad chapter of a book and scrap it without looking back .
Never get too enamored with one idea , never hang onto anything tenaciously without being able to throw it away when necessary ; that should be the programmer ’s attitude . ”
John Warnock , P47
“ Do n’t bind early ; do n’t ever make decisions earlier than you have to .
Stay an order of magnitude more general than you think you need , because you will end up needing it in the long term .
Get something working very quickly and then be able to throw it away .
Learn from small experiments rather than large ones .
Do n’t go into a two - year development with nothing coming out in the middle .
Have something come out every two months , so you can evaluate , regroup , and restart . ”
John Warnock , P52
What happens when little companies grow up into huge corporations ?
“ The trick is to learn from the Hewlett - Packard approach : Keep it as twenty different , small companies .
Keep breaking it up and never let it become a huge organization , except at some level that nobody cares about .
In terms of working relationships , keep the number of people small and their focus localized , project - oriented , so they can work at their best . ”
John Warnock , P54
“ Part of our strategy is getting the programmers to think everything through before they go to the coding phase .
Writing the design document is crucial , because a lot of simplification comes when you see problems expressed as algorithms .
They ’re kind of in the smallest form then , where you can see what the overlap is . ”
Bill Gates , P74
“ The most important part of writing a program is designing the data structures .
The second most important part is breaking the various code pieces down . ”
Bill Gates , P76
“ Features are kind of crummy in a way , because the more features you have , the bigger the manual is .
And features are only beneficial if people take the time to use them , wheras speed — if you can print the pages faster , or show it on the screen faster , or recalc it faster — that ’s worth an incredible amount .
If you can give the users a few simple commands and make the program efficient enough to do what they want with those few commands , then you ’re much better off .
One sign of very good programs is that even internally they follow that philosophy of simplicity .
If they want to do something complex , they call the code with simple operations internally , rather than doing the complex operation from scratch . ”
Bill Gates , P78
“ I still think that one of the finest tests of programming ability is to hand the programmer about 30 pages of code and see how quickly he can read through and understand it . ”
Bill Gates , P83
“ Complicated programs are far easier to write than straightforward programs — the exact opposite of what you ’d expect .
It ’s easy to write complicated programs because you reflect the complexity back onto the user ; you force the user to make all the hard decisions . ”
John Page , P95
“ Company employees need to feel ownership of what they ’re doing and have psychological ownership of the ideas they ’re implementing , otherwise they ’re not motivated . ”
John Page , P97
“ You can have either high productivity or a great deal of control .
That ’s the trade - off programmers and users find themselves making all the time . ”
John Page , P103
“ Flying is a lot like programming .
A good pilot gives the passenger a flawless , boring ride , while a good programmer gives the customer a flawless , boring experience on their computer . ”
John Page , P106
“ While you ’re working hard on a complicated program , it ’s important to exercise .
The lack of physical exercise does most programmers in .
It causes a loss of mental acuity .
It also leads to physical weakness that can heighten the feeling of disillusionment that often comes after the second or third straight programming effort . ”
Jon Page , P107
“ It ’s also important to try out the program on users to make sure it solves real users ’ needs .
And that ’s where this company is going astray ; it ’s ignoring users .
They ’ve gotten caught up in marketing , and what they ’re really fighting are other marketers .
All the ads are done by marketers , they ’re not done by users saying this is what we need .
It ’s one marketer , trying to pit his or her skills against another marketer , so they ’re fighting the battle of the specs . ”
C. Wayne Ratliff , P125
What would be your advice to young programmers ?
“ Do n’t assume you know all that much , and try to learn and question the assumptions .
Have a lot of confidence , but stay modest and assume you ’re doing something wrong .
Get just enough guilt — not too much or you ’ll be afraid to do anything — but enough to develop an aesthetic sense .
Try to develop a deeper understanding . ”
Bob Frankston , P159
“ Bugs are often characteristic of a bad interface between subsystems , which is frequently a result of inadequate communication among people when they design the subsystems .
When a bug is found , there is a tendency to handle it within the subsystem and not look at the program as a whole . ”
Ray Ozzie , P186
“ Programming is the ultimate field ofr someone who likes to tinker .
Tinkering requires tools .
Electrical engineers have various components they can put together to build something .
But they ’re constrained by the availability of physical equipment .
With a computer , if you can think about it , you can do it .
You can design your own tools or create the parts as you go along .
If you do n’t like something , you can just change it or rewrite it .
It ’s a wide - open tool box , given the resource , the computer .
The only limiting factors are the amount of time it takes the computer to do the task and the amount of time it takes you to write the program . ”
Ray Ozzie , P188
“ I ’ve seen many intelligent people who are just not practical .
They get lost pursuing some academic goal that is totally useless .
Being practical is important to good programming .
You must be able to guess accurately how long it will take to complete a project , have the ability to calculate what can and cannot be done in that time , and then do it , resisting the temptation to go off and do other things .
Practicality is important when you ’re trying to make every piece of work the best because you always have a limited amount of time to work on it .
It ’s easy to triple the time to complete a project when you ’re consumed with making it the ultimate in elegance . ”
Peter Roizen , P193
“ If you ’re going to do anything well , you need to have a serious interest in it .
If you do n’t care , all the talent in the world will still produce a lousy result .
If you do care , you need only one - third the talent to produce something decent . ”
Peter Roizen , P196
“ Picture yourself driving your car .
Let ’s say that every Thursday the gas pedal and the brake pedal are interchanged .
It would drive you up the wall , or through it .
You could n’t live with it .
Yet our computers change things around all the time by using “ modes ” .
A system should be “ modeless ” .
The same user action should always have the same effect . ”
Jef Raskin , P243
サンポウといえば、三宝がすぐに浮かぶのだが、算法騎士団の名前を目にして、そういえば算法ってのもあるなぁ、と思ったのがつい一週間ほど前のこと。
で、昨日RSSリーダを眺めてたらどこか忘れてしまったけど誰かが、
算法少女 ( ちくま学芸文庫 ) ( 遠藤 寛子 )
という本の書評を書いていて、へーと思ったまま、今日、本屋へ行ったら平積みされてたんでつい買って帰って今読み終わって、子供へあげた（やったーまんじゃないから、上げるのだ、おれは）。
なるほどなーと思ったのは、1970年代に刊行されてから1980年代まで刷数を重ねたもののそこで打ち止まったという時代感だ。まだ経済成長が続いていた、むしろより高度化しつつある頃に生まれて読まれ続けて、80年代の半ばで消えるって、まさに算法少女の名前に似つかわしい。それが、2006年に復刊する（でも児童書の出版元からではなく、ちくま学芸文庫だ）というのも。（おれのベースは80年代カルチャーだから、その空白が実に興味深い）
想像するに、ゆとり教育の本来の意図ってのは、丸暗記とか受験テクニック（でも、おれ、これは意味あるように思う）とかだけの勉強だけで済ませるんじゃなくて、教養のための時間を取るとか、それこそ算法少女みたいな本を読んで（和算なんて関孝和の名前を覚えて終わりなわけだろ、普通には）過ぎし方を通して本来の学のありようの1つでもじっくり考えてみようや、みたいなことをするためにゆとりを設けようってことだったはずなんだが、それが時期的にバブルが重なったもんで、何も考えなくても誰かが考えてくれるという啓蒙の反対の状態、つまるところゆとりによって本来生まれるはずだった状態を単に消費に当てるだけっていう正反対の方向に世の中が進んじゃったってところに問題があったってことなんじゃないかと思う。であれば、今はむしろバブルが弾けて、その余波の混沌も収まってきた以上、ゆとりというものが本来意図した状態が実現できる可能性が生まれたんじゃないかと思うんだけど、どうして長期的にものを考えられないのか理解しがたい駆け引きの結果、暗黒の黒を強める方向に進めようとしているように見えるんだけど、まあ、おれの知ったことではないわけだけど。
内容的には、ここでは仇役の関派だけど、時々読んでいる
不思議な数πの伝 記( Alfred S. Posamentier )
にも出てくるわけで、そのあたりが興味深かったり、万葉集に九九による当て字（十六と書いて「しし」と読ませるとか）が出てくるとか知らないこともいろいろあったり、でも別に算法そのものの本ではなくそれなりにドラマがある小説であった。というか、算法少女という題名がいかしているが、それが200年前の実在する本の名前だというのがしびれる。というか、この本を読むと、いやー学問って本当にいいもんですなぁと感じるんだが、そこが一番のポイントだろう。
で、算法とは別に、もう一点興味を惹いたのが、この本も復刊ドットコムの対象になってたんだな、ということ。
おれも、復刊ドットコムにはピカピカのぎろちょんで世話になって、無事に入手できたわけで、それなりのポジションを築いているのだな、ということ。
ピカピカのぎろちょん ( fukkan.com ) ( 佐野 美津男 )
（これは算法少女とはまた別の意味で歴史感覚が刺激される小説である）
で、最初に戻って、算法騎士団の名前を目にした場で、「bit別冊
Common Lisp オブジェクトシステム -- CLOS とその周辺 」の復刊ドットコムでの投票がもう一息という話が出てたのも思い出した。というわけで、なんか最近、Lisp関係の話題も多いわけだし、（個人的にはPCLでの実現技術の章がおもしろい）いろいろ読める本なので、ちょっと復刊リクエストにご協力お願いします（でも、リクエストしたら買えよ、というのもあるので、興味が無いのにリクエストすると後続のリクエストの信頼性に問題が出たりもするだろうから、無理にとは言わない。おれは読みたければ手元のやつを読むだけだし）。
MacIvoryかっこいい。
追記：もうちょっと『bit別 冊 Common Lisp オブジェクトシステム -- CLOS とその周辺』について触れると、この本の価値というのは、オブジェクト指向プログラミング言語のシステムについて、記述された本だという点にある。OOのうち、現在普通に入手できる本のほとんどは、(1)OOAの本か、( 2)OODの本か、( 3) OOPを利用してプログラムを書くための本か、に分類できると思う。メイヤーの有名な本もストラプラスプラスのC++本も（違うのもあるけど思索的だな。それが良いわけだけど）、OODに力が入っているので(2)になる。でも、このbit別冊はどれでもない。「システム」という言葉がさすのは、OOPによって作られたシステム（たとえば会計処理Webアプリケーション）のことではなく、OOPを実現するシステム、システム開発視点から見た場合にはメタシステムの側のことだ。
まえがきを引用する と
本書は 、CLOS ( Common Lisp Object System ) と呼ばれる Common Lisp のオブジェクト指向機能に関するものである。その概要と仕様について著している。また、他のオブジェクト指向機能との位置を知ることは重要と思われるので、共通例題を幾つかの言語で記述することも試みている。
とあるように、ある言語にオブジェクト指向「機能」を実現するという観点からの本だ。（RHGと目線は似ている）
つまり、インサイド オブな本だし、フロム インサイドな本だ。利用するための本ではなく、実現するための本。1990年代以降、技術がコモディティ化して誰もがOOPを使うようになったために、逆に（それってインフラ）消えた側の本だ。
Photographs by Brian Finke View Slideshow __Squad leader Michael Marks __ kneels , hidden by trees , surveying his target through the night - vision scope on his weapon , a paintball gun modded to look like an M4 rifle .
He 's watching a cluster of concrete buildings about 50 yards away .
Signal flares sputter in the streets .
Armed men dart between shadows .
Marks touches his neck to activate his throat mic .
" A straight depopulation , " he radios to his men .
" Seek and destroy . "
With that , the squad creeps out of the forest , three men decked in combat fatigues , riot - gear helmets , and flak jackets emblazoned with their unit name , Dead by Dawn .
It 's a reference to the 1987 cult horror flick Evil Dead II .
Yes , they know this dates them .
Each soldier also carries a thin layer of natural padding , the kind that comes with middle age and a daily commute from suburbia to a desk job .
They all have macho call signs they probably do n't use around the office , though .
Marks , a counterterrorism expert who writes training programs for the Department of Homeland Security , goes by Marksman .
Ted Deeds , the COO of the nonprofit Law Enforcement Alliance of America , is Gunslinger .
Mike Harris , a computer systems engineer wearing thick glasses and a breathe - easy nose strip , is Dr. Doom .
Staccato gunfire rips the air ; Dead by Dawn charges into one of the buildings for cover .
The guys flatten themselves against the interior all as paintballs rain through a window , exploding in wet pops behind them .
Deeds drops to the ground , rolls to the opening , and rises to flash short pulses from a retina - burning white - LED tactical flashlight .
Marks and Harris unleash their own barrage of semi automatic fire on the blinded hostiles , but they are outgunned .
* Thwap !
* Harris ' world goes gray as a lead - colored paintball explodes across his face mask .
Then Deeds gets shot in the hand .
Marks raises his arms in surrender .
You already know about paintball , a sort of tactical game of tag played with nonlethal — but really quite painful — ammo .
In the early 1980s , men stalked each other through the New Hampshire woods with single - shot , pump- action paint guns used by foresters to mark terrain .
Now the game has gone professional .
Modern guns have piezoelectric triggers and pneumatic muzzle velocities of 280 feet per second , half as fast as a bullet from a .38 special .
And players are n't just running around undeveloped land in the exurbs anymore : Cruise past ESPN2 at the right time — wee hours are good — and you might see the National Professional Paintball League play its version of the sport , a sort of special ops adaptation of soccer that confines the play to seven minutes and an arena just 180 by 100 feet .
Dead by Dawn is playing something called scenario paintball .
In this latest splatter - sport spinoff , players go on 24 - hour missions across battlefields drawn from Vietnam , Iraq , or Halo .
A behind - the - scenes " producer " scripts all the action , assigning ranks and duties with the verisimilitude of a Civil War reenactment .
The result is Rambo meets Boba Fett : Grenades spray paint 15 feet in every direction , paintball guns get modded into M16s , and homemade PVC - pipe bazookas launch Nerf rockets the length a football field .
These vicarious warfare experiences now attract huge numbers of fighters — 1,200 of them came to the National Guard 's Joint Training Center for Military Operations on Urban Terrain at Camp Blanding , Florida , on this cold Saturday night in mid-February .
Scenario games have gotten so popular , in fact , that the same big companies and smart engineers who professionalized tournament paintball are starting to pay attention to scenario players , too .
Sports equipment manufacturers , private entrepreneurs , and tournament types are all vying to build weapons and tech for the most active members of the role - play crowd .
Diane
Howe sits in the country - themed kitchen of her trailer , overseeing this weekend 's game from the staging area to the east of town , like a minor god of war .
Clad in a camouflage jumpsuit , she 's chain - smoking Benson & Hedges menthol lights while reading a map of the battleground and radioing coded deployment orders to commanders .
" Mike , Juliet - Nine , Paul , Quebec , " she says — and on the field , that means something .
Specifically , she has just directed an Alliance squad to take and hold the dilapidated row of buildings where , it turned out , Dead by Dawn was prowling .
Howe has been a paintballer for 20 years ; she met her husband , Patrick McKinnon , while playing against him in 1996 .
They eventually decided the biggest problem with paintball was that it did n't have a compelling narrative — the stakes of the game did n't match the level of ultraviolence most players seemed to bring to the field .
From his ranch outside Houston , McKinnon posted a 24 - page scenario rule book on the Web .
In 1999 , he and Howe launched Mackz Xtreme Sportz to produce giant , scripted battles ; they said they wanted to make " blockbusters . "
This weekend , the scenario is The Battle of Iron Forge , loosely based on the online role - playing universe of World of Warcraft .
Howe has divided the field into two factions : the Horde , a malicious mob of goblins and orcs , and the Alliance , a benevolent band of elves and humans .
Players get a character card with their name , role , and motivation .
Dead by Dawn is assigned to the Horde .
According to his card , Deeds , the firearm - friendly COO , is now Blood Point , an orc who has " sworn to do anything required to protect the Clan from enemies . "
" You are a huge , green - skinned Warrior , whose hide is resistant to just about any attack , " the card reads .
" You 're red -eyed with fury and can't wait for the battle to begin . "
Deeds is cool with being an orc as long as he still gets his assault rifle .
But he wo n't dress up .
The few guys who go all comic - con and don ghoulish costumes just turn themselves into easy targets , he says .
Howe and McKinnon set up their games like a movie crew on location .
They choose big , empty locations and truck in props , sets , and pyro — lots of pyro .
A typical MXS production features flares , smoke bombs , and noise - making bird bangers , all detonating in a kind of orchestral cacophony .
Howe loosely scripts a plot , then stays up all night directing it over walkie - talkie , calling out missions to opposing field commanders every 20 minutes .
Field referees report in regularly , and Howe adds plot twists per their intel .
McKinnon claims , perhaps hyperbolically , that his productions have actually induced flashbacks in Vietnam vets .
To win , a team — Alliance or Horde — has to score the most points , which accrue with the completion of specific missions like assaults , patrols , or photo recons with digital cameras .
Or players can go questing , trying to retrieve objects with meaning in the game ( like the War Axe of the Tiger , hidden in a building called Maeva 's Mystic Apparel ) .
Though every game has a high - scoring MVP , individuals can't win on their own .
As in real war , they are just cogs in the machine .
Some become demolition experts , empowered to fire Nerf rockets that " destroy " buildings and " kill " everyone inside .
Others — designated engineers — repair Nerfed buildings by touching them ; players called griffins give characters safe transit across the battlefield ( because , you know , griffins can fly ) .
Or you can just open fire .
Get hit with a paintball and you 're out ; you can reinsert 20 minutes later .
It all runs pretty much according to Howe 's whims .
Back in the trailer , she runs her hands over her maps and codebooks and lights another Benson & Hedges .
" You tell me where you want it to happen , " she says , " and I can make a fight . "
On Sunday morning , 19 hours into the game , the members of Dead by Dawn rally .
Having " died " and reinserted several times ( and taken a four - hour sleep break ) , they roll out the Necronomicar , a tank built from an 11 - horsepower Jacobson turf hauler and parts from Home Depot .
It has a welded steel frame with windows screened in netting to provide 360 - degree visibility and to slough off incoming paintballs .
It 's festooned with novelty maces , swords , and zombie heads attached like macabre hood ornaments .
Atop the gunner 's hatch is a turret boasting two clip - fed , electro - pneumatic PVC barrels capable of firing 30 Nerf rockets per minute .
The guys on the team pooled their money , about $ 7,000 , to build the car .
Sensible transportation was worth the money , especially given their middle - aged aches and pains .
There are 22 men on Dead by Dawn , and few of them are as spry on the battlefield as they used to be .
" Listen , we know our age .
We 're not the fastest .
We 're not the best shooters .
We 're not a lot of things , " Marks says .
" So you sit there and you say , ' Let 's play smart . ' "
When the tank sputters into the city , the sun has barely risen and the temperature is just above freezing .
There 's a Diet Coke in the cup holder .
The men have traded flak jackets for sweatshirts .
Someone cues up an MP3 player hooked into the 1,000 - watt waterproof boat stereo and cranks their war anthem : Rob Zombie 's Dragula .
The enemy Alliance troopers open window shutters like saloon doors and rain fire on them , steam rising from their muzzles in the cold morning air .
Most of their shots bounce right off the Necronomicar 's hull .
Marks grasps the wide motorcycle grips on the turret cannon and lines up his sight — a vertical tab notched with marks for 50 , 75 , and 150 yards — with a screw set farther down the barrel .
Then he starts blasting , launching Nerfs into each hideout to disqualify the players inside .
Mike " Emeril " Cawthon , an industrial - printer salesman who , at age 35 , is one of the youngest guys on the Dead by Dawn team , pokes his gun through the netting and casually picks off soldiers like he's in a shooting gallery .
Marks fires another 10 rounds to take out two other tanks swiveling toward them 100 yards uprange .
Then Marks gets overeager .
Rather than alternating fire from each barrel to allow the cannon to recharge , he double - presses one trigger .
The air tank is nearly empty .
The shot poofs lamely and drops to the ground .
Premature evacuation .
" I just could n't recover quickly enough .
I limped it , " Marks shouts over the din .
" Do n't worry , I wo n't tell your wife , " Cawthon chuckles .
Behind the Necronomicar , other Horde members pour into the city .
Dead by Dawn is leading the charge .
__Howe designed her battle __royale with profit in mind .
Paintball field owners and game producers do n't make their money on admission fees ; they make it on accessories .
At Camp Blanding , companies set up at booths near the staging area are hawking all kinds of spiffy gear .
Ben Tippmann , scion of the dominant paintball gunmaker , will sell you a $ 110 kit to mod your gun into an AK 47 replica .
Austin , Texas based nanotech firm Nanohmics is focus - grouping a nonlethal flash - bang grenade with LEDs and a siren that it designed with a Defense Department grant .
And Duane Bell , inventor of scented paint grenades ( watermelon , mint chip , and root beer ) , is letting Marks field - test his new H8 Tactical Rifle .
But as any arms dealer will tell you , the real money is in ammo .
Cases of paintballs containing 2,000 rounds each were $ 75 at the door ( $ 60 in advance ) , and Howe wo n't reveal her markup .
She gets them wholesale , and this weekend she sold about 2,000 cases , literally a semitrailer full .
That 's 4 million shots .
Orchestrating 24 hours of on - demand firefights means a lot of shooting , which means more money .
At an MXS event , the last man standing will probably be the guy who shelled out the most for paint .
Then there 's the overhead .
For Iron Forge , Howe cut a deal with the National Guard to use its base — she wo n't say how much it cost , or how much she spent to rent the portapotties , air - filling stations , and dumpster .
Each player paid at least $ 45 for an advance ticket , with the price going up as game day drew closer .
It was $ 75 at the gate .
" Is this a lucrative business ?
Absolutely not , " Howe says .
The last thing she wants is to sound like a profiteer .
But she has no problem ramping up the carnage to boost the bottom line .
" I try to get players in as many firefights as possible , " she says .
" They want targets to shoot .
If there 's a way to get them to a place where they 're shooting more paint , I 'll do it . "
To ensure a grand finale , she dispatches a set of identical commands to multiple team leaders , ordering soldiers to converge at three points around the battlefield and hold their positions at all costs .
That 's when Dead by Dawn gets word that for the final battle , tanks must be pulled from the field .
Losing the Necronomicar will put them at a serious disadvantage .
Plus , Howe has eliminated the 20 - minute insertion delay .
Players who are killed can simply check in at a launch point and then resume fighting immediately .
Lots of Marks ' team members simply opt out .
The guys are exhausted .
At their base camp on the sidelines , most of the team has collapsed into folding chairs beneath a canopy tent filled with picnic goodies .
But Cawthon wants to make a stand .
He watches exhaustion crease his teammates ' sweaty faces and decides not to offer a rousing speech .
He just stands up , says he 's going back out , and asks for ammo donations .
A few people trade this - guy - is - nuts glances .
But team tradition kicks in and they pass around a big cardboard box , dumping in the few paintballs they have left .
It slowly fills with pearl - gray ammunition .
A few friends carry it to the field .
For all that , Cawthon is still a little conflicted .
" Do not be aggressive .
Do not be aggressive , " he repeats to himself .
" I told my wife I would come home in one piece . "
From Cawthon 's vantage point in the forest , the town looks riotous .
Fighters crisscross the main road .
Snipers rain cover fire from the rooftops .
The Alliance is charging the center of town , but they 've also managed to pull off a flanking move , sending a huge force marching down a side street and across a small field lined by squat buildings .
A few Horde stragglers give chase , but they 're quickly forced back against a bunker under a shower of paint .
Cawthon dashes across the main drag toward the pinned soldiers , outrunning a few shots at his heels .
Stripped of his usual toys , he clutches only a basic AKA Excalibur .
Somehow , he makes it to the Horde hideout unscathed .
The stragglers turn out to be a bunch of teenagers .
Then he takes a peek around a corner and sees the real problem : a line of about a hundred Alliance troops advancing down the fairway .
Like real war , paintball games are always populated with plenty of cannon fodder ; this is the kind of situation where Cawthon usually would pull rank and direct one of the spry 16 - year - olds to go get 'em .
But Cawthon looks at the kids around him and sees fear in their eyes .
They 're green .
They need a leader , a veteran , someone brave enough to rally a charge .
Cawthon breathes heavily .
Beneath his fatigues he wears a brace to protect his left knee , which he sprained playing paintball a few years ago .
He rotates his left shoulder , grimacing — it gets stiff in the cold ever since he dislocated it in a game last year when he fell and planted his elbow in the dirt .
A sort of clarity comes into his eyes .
" I drove 800 miles to play paintball , " he says .
" If nobody shoots me , I 'll be pretty upset . "
Cawthon breaks cover and runs past the kids around him , slanting across open turf toward a far - off tree line .
He waves an arm for the boys to follow .
But they do n't .
They gawk , rooted in place .
The hostiles see him ; his chest glows with pinpoints of light from laser sights .
The volley sounds like popcorn crescendoing in a microwave .
Paintballs zip past just ahead of him , perhaps where someone faster might already be .
Cawthon ducks , swivels , and returns fire .
It 's pointless .
The air is swarming with ammo , coming so thick and from so many angles that rounds are actually slamming together in midair and exploding .
He feels a sting in his gut and reaches to cover it .
Another shot pelts him square in the chest .
A few more ping against his legs and mask , rocking him back on his heels .
Cawthon stops running .
He slumps and raises his hand .
He 's out .
Dejected , Cawthon drags himself back to the launch point , wiping paint off his clothes and trying to avoid collateral hits .
The sun rises in the sky .
His knee hurts .
But he catches his breath , checks in , and is suddenly reborn .
He rubs paint off his goggles and heads back toward the Alliance line .
That 's where the fun is .

Facebook WASHINGTON ( AP )  Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards said Wednesday that conservative author Ann Coulter 's attacks are hurtful as his campaign used her remarks in an appeal for money .
Edwards made his first comments to The Associated Press in response to Coulter 's suggestion that she wished he would be " killed in a terrorist assassination plot . "
His campaign cited her remarks in two e-mails to supporters for donations , with the fundraising deadline on Saturday .
USA TODAY ON POLITICS : Video links , more on Edwards - Coulter spat It 's not the first time Coulter has given the Edwards campaign a financial boost .
In March , she called Edwards a " faggot " and the campaign used video of the comment to help raise $ 300,000 before the end of the first quarter .
In the e-mails , the campaign asked supporters to send donations to defy her remarks and help Edwards meet his goal of raising $ 9 million in the second quarter .
The first e-mail from campaign adviser Joe Trippi showed a clip of Coulter on ABC's Good Morning America , where she said Monday that she wished Edwards would be killed by terrorists .
When Coulter appeared Tuesday on MSNBC's Hardball , Elizabeth Edwards called in to ask Coulter to stop making personal attacks on her husband .
The exchanged deteriorated , with Coulter shouting over Mrs. Edwards and demanding that the campaign stop using her name to raise money if they want her to stop personal attacks .
Response to the controversy was so large that it repeatedly crashed the server for MSNBC 's political blog Wednesday .
Mrs. Edwards followed up with an e-mail to supporters Wednesday morning that included a clip of their exchange and a donation request .
The campaign said they raised more money this week than from any previous e-mail campaign , but declined to give a total .
" I think when they engage in these attacks and use the language of hate , it 's very important to stand up , " Edwards said .
" What happens if you are silent when this kind of hateful language is used — not just by her , but by anyone — hate gets a foothold . "
Edwards pointed out that Coulter 's attacks have n't been limited to him , but also included his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Coulter has made fun of Hillary Rodham Clinton 's legs and compared Barack Obama to terrorists because his middle name is Hussein .
" What she said about Senator Clinton and Senator Obama is outrageous , " Edwards said .
" And somebody has to stand up when she makes these kind of attacks . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Scientists have discovered a new type of embryonic stem cell in mice and rats that should speed up research into regenerative medicine and help in the hunt for cures to a range of diseases .
Mouse embryonic stem cells stained with a flourescent green marker are seen in an undated handout photo from the National Science Foundation .
Scientists have discovered a new type of embryonic stem cell in mice and rats that should speed up research into regenerative medicine and help in the hunt for cures to a range of diseases .
REUTERS / Handout
Two independent teams from Britain ’s Oxford and Cambridge universities said on Wednesday that so - called rodent epiblast stem cells were very similar to human embryonic stem cells , making them particularly good models for analyzing human health .
The new cells effectively constitute a “ missing link ” between mouse and human embryonic stem cells , according to Roger Pedersen , leader of the Cambridge group .
Human embryonic stem cells are the source of every cell , tissue and organ in the body .
Scientists want to use them to find cures for diseases like Parkinson ’s , cancer and diabetes , although critics say it is wrong to use any embryo in this way .
Laboratory mice have long been a favourite model for human disease but researchers have been frustrated by the fact that human and mouse stem cells behave very differently .
Now scientists think they may have cracked the problem .
INSIGHT
Two papers published in the journal Nature show that when mouse stem cells are derived from the innermost cell layer -- or epiblast -- of a week - old rodent embryo they are in many ways almost identical to human ones .
“ Ultimately , we have to admit that mice are n’t humans , ” Pedersen told reporters .
“ But we now have a much better model than we previously had . ”
Up until now , scientists have grown embryonic stem cells from the blastocyst , a very early - stage embryo not yet implanted into the womb .
The new cells are taken after implantation .
Because they are further along the developmental timeline , they may offer a unique insight into how stem cells start producing mature cell types , like neurons , muscle and bone .
Pedersen -- who left the United States in 2001 to work in Britain because of curbs on federal funding of stem cell work -- said the hope was to work out how to control their growth and differentiation , in order to regenerate cells as a way to cure injuries and disease .
Richard Gardner , who led the Oxford team , said the latest discovery should also help researchers derive stem cells in other species , including agricultural livestock .
That may provide different avenues for medical research , since some larger mammals are known to be better models of human disease than rodents .
Sheep , for example , are a particularly good proxy for studying cystic fibrosis .
The use of epiblast stem cells will not lead to immediate breakthroughs in clinical treatments but the fact that two teams made the discovery almost simultaneously is a sign of momentum picking up in stem cell research .
“ We are reaching a critical mass of understanding about these cells which should enable us to make the most of them in coming years , ” Gardner said .

Review of The FairTax Book , by Neal Boortz and John Linder ( Regan Books , 2005 ) .
Syndicated talk show host Neal Boortz and Congressman John Linder ( R - GA ) have joined forces to write a book on the FairTax Plan — a proposal to replace the current system of federal income taxes , corporate taxes , Social Security and Medicare taxes , capital gains taxes , gift taxes , and estate taxes with a national sales tax on new goods and services that does not reduce the government 's overall tax revenue .
They have never been so right and never been so wrong .
Former attorney Boortz is the well - known Atlanta - based " libertarian " talk show host who , like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity , spends an inordinate amount of time on the evils of liberalism , the Left , and the Democratic Party while turning a blind eye to big government Republicans and supporting Bush 's " War on Terror . "
Boortz has drawn fire from Christians for his support of abortion and gay rights .
He has also offended Southerners ( he himself was born in Pennsylvania but was raised throughout the country as a " Marine brat " ) because of his negative comments about the Confederate flag .
Former dentist Linder represents Georgia 's Seventh District , which includes the highly gerrymandered parts of five counties .
He has been a member of the House of Representatives since 1992 .
Although Linder has received the designations " Hero of the Taxpayer , " from Americans for Tax Reform , " Taxpayer Hero , " from the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste , and " Tax Fighter , " from the National Tax Limitation Committee , he is ranked by Congressional Quarterly as " among Bush 's strongest supporters . "
Linder 's claim to fame is that he is " the primary sponsor of the FairTax . "
He actually introduced the first FairTax bill in Congress back in July of 1999 .
It is interesting to note that his rating on The New American magazine 's " Conservative Index " for his term in the 108th Congress was 45 .
For this same period , the universally acknowledged " taxpayer 's friend , " Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , scored a perfect 100 .
Since Boortz has previous writing experience , and his name appears in larger letters on the book 's cover , I will refer to Boortz as the author of The FairTax Book .
This is not , of course , meant to imply that Linder had no hand in writing the book .
Linder himself says in " A Word from Congressman John Linder " that " the inflammatory and rude references come from Neal " while he " provided the intellectual backdrop that allows him to be outrageous . "
The Evils of the Federal Tax System
Boortz is certainly right when he describes the evils of our current tax system :
Our current tax system is one that punishes the behaviors Americans value and rewards the behaviors we abhor .
Those in our society who work hard and achieve are punished with taxes that approach confiscatory levels .
Politicians have managed to mold our tax code into an instrument designed not so much for raising revenue to fund the legitimate operations of government , as to control the behavior of individual Americans and corporations , and to give politicians levers to pull and buttons to push to buy votes when reelection time comes around .
The FairTax Book contains whole chapters on the hidden evils of the withholding tax ( " Politicians love withholding because it gives them a chance to grab their ' share ' of your earnings before you even see your paycheck . " ) , corporate taxes ( " Business and corporations merely collect the taxes from individuals and pass them on to the government . " ) , the cost of compliance with the tax code ( " In 2002 individuals , businesses , and nonprofits spent 5.8 billion hours complying with the tax code — an effort that cost an estimated $ 194 billion . " ) , the embedded costs of taxes in all consumer goods and services ( " When you buy that loaf of bread , you 're paying a portion of all of the bills , including tax bills , of every person or business entity that had anything to do with that bread . " ) , and corporations moving offshore ( " They 're moving for one simple reason : to escape a punishing tax structure here at home . " ) .
The abuses of the IRS merit not only a full chapter , but are mentioned throughout the book .
Indeed , one of the continually stated purposes of the FairTax proposal is to eliminate the IRS altogether .
However , whether this would actually be the case remains to be seen .
But rather than just calling for the elimination of Social Security and Medicare taxes , withholding taxes , corporate taxes , gift taxes , estate taxes , capital gains taxes , and personal income taxes , Boortz proposes to replace all of these taxes with the FairTax .
The FairTax Plan
The FairTax Plan is currently pending in Congress under the name of " The Fair Tax Act of 2005 . "
It is a consumption tax in the form of a national sales tax of 23 percent on new goods and services .
Although it would " not be imposed on used or previously owned items , " it would apply to all new goods and services : medical procedures , haircuts , new cars , new homes , gasoline , food , medicine , Internet purchases , and electricity .
The taxes currently imposed by the states would be unaffected by the FairTax Plan .
Thus , states that impose a state income tax or a state sales tax would continue to collect those taxes .
The FairTax Plan would be administered through the states .
However , this does n't mean that individual businesses would not be dealing with the federal government .
For acting as a tax collector for the federal government , both the states and the businesses that initially collect the national sales tax will be paid one quarter of 1 percent of what they collect .
But not only will all businesses receive a check from the federal government , so will all households .
The FairTax plan includes a monthly check from the government called a " prebate " that reimburses each household for the taxes paid on " the basic necessities of life . "
These checks , which are based on " the government 's published poverty levels for various - sized households , " do not just go to the poor , they are " paid to everyone , rich and poor alike . "
Boortz cites as an example a married couple with two children receiving a monthly check for $ 492 — regardless of their income .
Although the FairTax Plan would eliminate Social Security and Medicare taxes , it would not eliminate the programs .
Boortz correctly explains that " under our current tax code , these programs can be maintained only by increasing the tax on those who work , reducing benefits for those who have retired , or by increasing the age of retirement . "
The FairTax Plan solves this problem because it would fund Social Security and Medicare out of general revenues .
So , instead of calling for the elimination of the various federal programs that feed off tax dollars , Boortz wants to merely change the way they are funded .
The Goals of the FairTax
Boortz tells us that the FairTax idea originated with the group Americans for Fair Taxation ( AFFT ) .
He says that " the goal of AFFT was to develop a system that would raise the same amount of revenue for the government as our current income tax system , but which would be less intrusive , abusive , coercive , and corrosive . "
This means that the FairTax idea should have been discarded at the very beginning , for instead of saying that it was not fair that the government confiscate 10 , 20 , 30 , or 40 percent of a man 's income , the FairTax proponents did not even begin to tackle the root of the problem : the welfare / warfare state that drives the federal leviathan 's insatiable lust for the taxpayer 's money .
Over and over again , Boortz emphasizes that the FairTax is " revenue neutral . "
The rate will be set " to ensure that the federal government — and all the programs within it , including Social Security and Medicare — will receive from the national retail sales tax exactly what they had been receiving under the current tax system . "
The FairTax is " simply a new and equitable method for raising the same amount of money our old and complicated code does today . "
It " is n't about cutting spending or changing government benefits .
It 's simply a plan to change the way Americans fund their federal government . "
The FairTax is designed to simplify the tax code , increase compliance , and make the government more efficient at collecting taxes .
It is not about reducing the overall tax burden one cent .
The book should therefore be discarded upon reading this line on page two : " This book is n't about saving us a penny in taxes . "
Boortz has the proverbial cart before the horse .
He wants to fight for " a simpler , clearer way to fund our federal government " before he fights for " tax cuts and lower government . "
Boortz laments that tax evaders , tax avoiders , participants in the underground and shadow economies , and users of offshore financial centers are n't paying their fair share of taxes .
He rejoices that the FairTax will eliminate the " cap on earnings subject to the levy for Social Security , " thus forcing " the wealthy " to contribute their fair share .
The FairTax will " recapture " the billions currently lost " from Internet and catalog sales . "
We know that governments are notoriously inefficient at everything they do .
But is this always a bad thing ?
Why would anyone want to make the government more efficient at collecting taxes ?
We want the government to be just as inefficient as possible when it comes to tax collections .
Just like we want the government to be just as inefficient as possible when it comes to launching an aggressive war , violating the Bill of Rights , or punishing dissent .
The Claims of the FairTax
Boortz makes a lot of dubious , unsubstantiated claims for the FairTax that greatly exaggerate its benefits .
He all but states that the FairTax will usher in the millennium .
The FairTax will not just increase economic growth , it will " send the American economy into warp drive . "
It will " bring a period of transformation and economic growth to America such as has never been seen before . "
" Millions of new jobs will be created . "
The FairTax will " double the size of the economy in the first fifteen years . "
After its implementation , " capital investment will increase quickly by a staggering 76 percent , " " interest rates will decline by almost 30 percent , " and " the economy will grow by 10.5 percent . "
Although he disparages " soak the rich " sentiments and " economic class warfare , " Boortz appeals to the poor and middle class .
He contends that the FairTax will " create a financial bonanza for the poor and the middle class . "
It will " all but eliminate the tax burden on the middle class . "
The FairTax " would give the average income worker a 50 percent increase in take - home pay . "
The lowest income earners should support the FairTax because " for them it 's all benefit and no burden . "
Correct , thanks to the prebate .
For even though the purpose of the " prebate " is to cover " the basic necessities of life , " Boortz acknowledges that there will be " money left over " for the poor " to invest in their own futures . "
The trouble with this is that the " money left over " belongs to someone else — " the rich " who will pay most of the taxes just like they do now .
Based on an unnamed study by Harvard economics professor Dale Jorgenson , Boortz maintains that the current price of consumer products includes embedded taxes of about 22 percent .
Under the FairTax , these prices will " go down by roughly the same amount as the proposed FairTax rate of 23 percent . "
Consumers will be paying " at least 20 percent less for virtually everything they buy . "
A new home , even with the FairTax added to the price " may cost less than that home would have cost under our current tax structure . "
Everything will nearly be a wash , declares Boortz the economist .
But not only does this ignore the basic laws of supply and demand , it is based on the fallacy that the costs of inputs in the production of a good determine the price of the output they produce .
The FairTax Plan is so good that even the states will want to adopt some form of it .
The state governors that Boortz talked with said that under a national FairTax system , " They 'd be very likely to eliminate state income taxes . "
Boortz 's unnamed governors would also " welcome a move to taxing all goods and services with no exclusions or exemptions . "
Why , of course they would .
They would welcome that right now , but could never get away with it .
Naturally , Boortz maintains that with the addition of a tax on services , and with no exclusions or exemptions on any good or service , states would be able to reduce their sales tax rate " without losing a dime in revenue . "
And then there are the " global implications of the FairTax . "
After the adoption of the FairTax , " foreign corporations will be compelled to build new plants in America " to remain competitive .
Boortz envisions " the forward - thinking nations of the world " adopting " their own version of the FairTax , " which will " spread freedom across the globe . "
Is there any problem in the world that wo n't be fixed with the adoption of the FairTax ?
The Lies of the FairTax
In addition to the unsubstantiated claims that Boortz makes for the FairTax , there are three ridiculous lies of the FairTax Plan .
Lie # 1 : taxes would be voluntary under the FairTax .
In his discussion of the origins of the FairTax , Boortz says that the AFFT sought " a method of taxation that would be totally voluntary , that would allow all citizens to pay what they choose , when they choose , by how they choose to spend their money . "
Boortz has the audacity to say that " there is nothing coercive about the FairTax . "
It is " a truly voluntary tax system . "
The government should allow you to " keep your money in an investment account of some kind , earning interest for you , until you decide to pay taxes to the federal government . "
The FairTax would allow people to " judge for themselves when and how they 're comfortable making taxable purchases . "
Well , if the FairTax system is voluntary , and allows everyone to pay what they choose and when they choose , what happens if someone decides that they do n't want to pay any taxes to the federal government ?
The same thing that happens now : fines and imprisonment .
The FairTax is not a voluntary tax at all .
The whole idea is a contradiction in terms .
Boortz 's statement about people keeping their money until " they 're comfortable making taxable purchases " is ludicrous .
There is no way to avoid buying new items .
One can buy a used car , a used house , and used clothes , but one cannot purchase used food .
One could argue that our present tax system is also voluntary :
Do n't earn any income and you wo n't have to pay any income taxes .
Lie # 2 : the FairTax rate would be 23 percent .
Throughout the book , Boortz gives the FairTax rate as 23 percent .
It is not until near the end of the book — in the chapter , " Questions and Objections " — that he admits it is really 30 percent .
But even then he still insists it is 23 percent .
Those of us who were skeptical from the beginning noticed this when we got to page 84 .
There Boortz used the example of a single mother with two children spending $ 45 a week on groceries .
He claims that the removal of the taxes currently embedded in the price would lower the cost of the groceries to $ 35.10 ( a dubious proposition ) .
But then he says : " Add the FairTax , and the groceries would cost $ 45.58 .
I learned in the sixth grade that if an item cost $ 35.10 , and I add to it $ 10.48 in sales tax , then I paid a tax rate of almost 30 percent — not 23 percent .
Boortz says in the " Questions and Objections " chapter that " critics of the FairTax have a way of dwelling on this 30 percent figure . "
I wonder why ?
Although Boortz explains that he is using an exclusive rate rather than an inclusive rate to figure the percentage , his " mathematical equivalent of a game of semantics " still results in a FairTax rate of 30 percent .
This is why Boortz prefers the national sales tax to be included in the price of each item — so the consumer does n't realize that he is really paying an extra 30 percent in sales tax , not Boortz 's new math amount of 23 percent .
Lie # 3 : the FairTax would abolish the IRS .
Boortz claims that his book is about transforming the nation by sending " one of its most hated institutions , " the IRS , to " that place in the government guano heap of history . "
The goal of the FairTax is to " eliminate the IRS . "
Boortz even jokes about IRS agents working at a fast food restaurant after the FairTax is implemented .
Calling the IRS by another name does n't mean that its functions will be eliminated .
Just as the income tax will be replaced by the FairTax , so the IRS will be replaced by some other federal bureaucracy to oversee the collection of the FairTax .
It should not be forgotten that the FairTax is a national sales tax .
According to The Fair Tax Act of 2005 :
There shall be in the Department of the Treasury a Sales Tax Bureau to administer the national sales tax in those States where it is required pursuant to section 404 , and to discharge other Federal duties and powers relating to the national sales tax ( including those required by sections 402 , 403 , and 405 ) .
The Office of Revenue Allocation shall be within the Sales Tax Bureau .
The Fair Tax Act also sets up a " Problem Resolution Office " and authorizes " problem resolution officers . "
There will even still be tax courts .
Boortz himself also states : " We envision a department of the Treasury to deal with Internet and catalog sales , with stiff penalties for those selling into our communities who do not abide by the law . "
The FairTax will abolish the IRS in the same way that it will abolish the income tax — by replacing it with something else .
The Problems of the FairTax
Besides the fact that it does n't lower the amount of taxes seized from the taxpayers by the federal government and is based on unsubstantiated claims and ridiculous lies , the FairTax is fraught with other problems .
In his Introduction , Boortz says that this book will explain the FairTax in detail .
He will walk us " through the plan step by step , detailing both the good and the bad . "
Since Boortz never gets to the bad , I here present seventeen problems with the FairTax .
Problem # 1: The FairTax hides the amount of sales tax being paid .
Boortz explains how " the FairTax was designed as what 's called an ' inclusive ' tax — that is , the tax is included in the list price of the product . "
He reasons that " since our current income taxes are figured on an inclusive basis — that is , they are taken out of our paychecks , not added to them — it was decided to handle the sales tax in exactly the same manner . "
How could someone write a whole chapter on the evils of the withholding tax and then turn around and recommend a hidden tax like the FairTax ?
Boortz even has the audacity to claim that with the FairTax the " consumer is completely aware of what he is paying . "
Really ?
Suppose the FairTax is implemented next year .
Go stand in front of a store and ask the typical American how much federal sales tax he paid on the item he just bought for $ 139 ?
Give him a calculator and ask him again .
Unless he is familiar with figuring percentages , the average American will not be able to tell you how much sales tax he just paid .
Problem # 2: The FairTax is progressive .
Boortz correctly identifies a progressive income tax with Karl Marx .
Yet , because of the prebate , the FairTax sets up a progressive tax system like we have now .
Millions of Americans will pay no taxes at all .
Others will have some of their taxes offset by the prebate .
" The rich " will still be paying the majority of the taxes — something Boortz says he considers " class warfare . "
Problem # 3 : The FairTax is an income redistribution scheme .
Boortz calls the Earned Income Tax Credit " a prime conduit for income redistribution from high - income earners to the poor and middle class . "
Why , then , would he promote a FairTax Plan with a prebate that in essence allows the majority of citizens to not only pay no taxes , but in many cases gives them money over and above that which they paid in sales tax ?
What 's fair about making " the rich " subsidize the poor and the middle class ?
Boortz calls Social Security an " income redistribution and welfare program . "
But under the FairTax Plan , Social Security is even worse .
At least now it is funded by payroll tax contributions that are independent of deductions for federal income tax .
Thanks to the prebate , many people will receive a free retirement program via Social Security who never contributed a dime towards their retirement , or as Boortz says : " All benefit and no burden . "
Problem # 4 : The FairTax creates new tax collectors .
From doctors and lawyers to garbage collectors and tree trimmers — multitudes of individuals and businesses that never collected taxes before will be turned into tax collectors for the federal government .
Will a teenage babysitter be required to collect the FairTax from her neighbors ?
Problem # 5 : The FairTax creates new taxes .
All Internet purchases will be subject to the national sales tax .
So will heart surgeries , kidney transplants , and appendectomies — plus the drugs prescribed by the doctors doing the procedures .
Want to attend a baseball , football , or basketball game ?
Better save up a little extra to take care of the FairTax that will be imposed on your tickets .
Problem # 6 : The FairTax creates new taxpayers .
If there are no exceptions and no exemptions then churches and other non-profits will be forced to pay a national sales tax on every purchase .
The FairTax will basically do away with not - for - profit entities .
The FairTax would also count as taxable the purchases made by federal , state , and local governments .
This means the government will be using taxpayer money to pay taxes to itself .
Problem # 7 : The FairTax makes it easier for the federal government to raise taxes .
All Congress has to do is slightly increase the initial 23 percent rate .
A penny here , a penny there ; a quarter of a cent now , a half of a cent later .
Just a little at a time , of course .
It might be to compensate for inflation , to give seniors a cost of living raise , or to pay for some manufactured crisis like bird flu .
Since the federal budget goes up every year , and the FairTax is supposed to be " revenue neutral , " the FairTax rate will have to go up right along with the federal budget .
You can count on an increase every year , for if government budgets are not under control now , why should we expect Congress to magically become fiscally responsible just because the FairTax is adopted ?
Furthermore , since Social Security and Medicare would be funded out of general revenues the FairTax rate would also have to go up to fund the ever - increasing cost of these programs .
Then there are the escalating costs of the new prescription drug plan .
And if the amount of the prebate " is updated every year to keep up with inflation , " the FairTax rate will have to be raised in like manner .
How can Boortz recognize that " there is absolutely no limit to the government 's desire for your money " and then express hope that the FairTax rate " will go down in the future " if " Congress can keep government spending down " ?
Problem # 8 : The FairTax makes it easier for state governments to raise taxes .
In the name of simplicity and efficiency , the states would be inclined to follow the lead of the federal government .
States that currently have no sales tax could add one .
States that have exemptions on certain items could get rid of the exemptions so as to match the federal government .
States that have no sales tax on services could begin taxing services like the federal FairTax Plan would do .
Problem # 9 : The FairTax has unknown and potentially huge transition costs .
Boortz asks a good question : " How will the switch to the FairTax be made ? "
But then he gives a very naïve answer : " Cold turkey ! "
He explains that " on January 1 , we 'll begin to get our gross pay with no deductions . "
Boortz gives one " transition rule " :
The value of any inventory on hand December 31 can be used as a credit against collecting taxes in the next year . "
This should get accountants to work figuring out how to value each company 's inventory the highest .
Will it be specific identification , average cost , FIFO , or LIFO ?
But what if a company 's fiscal year does not end on December 31 ?
This will cause massive accounting problems .
And especially for the federal government since the government 's fiscal year begins on October 1 .
Problem # 10 : The FairTax makes certain exceptions while supposedly having none .
After saying that there are " no exclusions or exemptions " under the FairTax , Boortz specifically mentions exemptions for Internet access services and tuition .
Therefore , his complaint that " exempting certain items — such as food and prescription drugs — would again open the door to an entire battalion of lobbyists to argue that the portion of the industry that they represent is clearly an essential product " is unjustified for he has already opened the door to that very thing .
Problem # 11 : The FairTax has great potential for fraud .
Boortz envisions the prebate amount being issued to a card " like your bank debit card . "
Since every head of household would have one of these cards , there would be a great chance of criminals preying on people for their cards .
There is also the possibility of counterfeiting , resulting in massive theft from the taxpayers .
And since the FairTax only applies to new items , there will also be a tremendous incentive for new items to be reclassified as used or previously owned .
Businesses could offer a slight increase in the price of a reclassified item in exchange for not having to charge customers the 23 percent national sales tax that would be due if the item was considered new .
Enforcement of the " proper " classification of items would require an army of federal bureaucrats that would rival the IRS .
Problem # 12 : The FairTax has the potential to turn thousands of law - abiding Americans into criminals .
Since the FairTax contains no exemption for even the smallest business , anyone who does not collect the FairTax on any good he produces or services he provides is breaking the law .
Mow a yard — collect the tax .
Babysit — collect the tax .
Repair a car — collect the tax .
If you do n't collect the FairTax then you are a criminal .
Once again , the FairTax would have a terrible enforcement problem .
Problem # 13 : The FairTax does not repeal the Sixteenth Amendment .
When FairTax advocates discuss their plan , they talk as though the FairTax would result in the repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment that gave us the income tax .
To his credit , Boortz does n't make that mistake , but when many people read about " saying goodbye to the income tax , " that is what they think .
The FairTax bill now pending in Congress ( H.R. 25 in the House and the identical S. 25 in the Senate ) , repeals Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that relates to income taxes and self - employment taxes and Subtitle C that relates to payroll taxes and the withholding of income taxes .
The only mention of the Sixteenth Amendment in H.R. 25 is when it reports : " Congress further finds that the 16th amendment to the United States Constitution should be repealed . "
But to repeal Sixteenth Amendment would require a constitutional amendment .
Are we to believe that Congress would vote to repeal the Sixteenth Amendment after the passage of the FairTax ?
And even if Congress did so it would still have to be sent to the states for approval by three - fourths of them .
So , barring the repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment , what is there to prevent an income tax from being imposed again after a national sales tax has been enacted ?
And what is to prevent any of the other taxes replaced by the FairTax being re-imposed due to some unanticipated budget shortfall or " crisis " ?
Is Boortz that naïve to think that Congress will be satisfied with just the FairTax ?
And even if the Sixteenth Amendment was repealed after the imposition of the FairTax , any previous tax not on income could be brought back .
Can Congress be trusted to do anything else ?
I can easily envision Congress proposing to lower the rate of the national sales tax in exchange for the addition of a supplemental Social Security tax because we need more money to fund Social Security .
Then , a few years later , the national sales tax rate would be right back up to where it was before the " exchange . "
Problem # 14 : The FairTax does not eliminate all federal taxes .
Although it is implied throughout the book that the FairTax will be a replacement for the various federal taxes , there are some federal taxes that will still be with us under the FairTax .
Even Boortz slips up one time and says that the FairTax would " replace virtually all personal and corporate taxes . "
Two examples of federal taxes that will still be with us under the FairTax are the excise tax on gasoline and the various taxes that one pays when purchasing an airline ticket .
There is no mention of the federal gas tax anywhere in the Fair Tax Act of 2005 .
No list of taxes that are supposed to be eliminated under the FairTax includes the federal gas tax , which adds 18.4 cents to the price of a gallon of gas .
So under the FairTax , we would have added to each gallon of gas federal excise tax , state excise tax , and federal sales tax .
This is just the minimum .
The states could also begin applying their sales tax to gasoline .
A recent airline ticket I purchased had added to its price a federal excise tax of $ 15.28 , a federal segment tax of $ 12.80 , and a September 11th security fee of $ 10.00 .
And what about federal taxes on tobacco and alcohol ?
The FairTax will merely replace one visible tax with another while leaving intact the invisible ones .
Problem # 15 : The FairTax is not at all about lowering the amount of taxes the government collects .
Boortz terms the FairTax a " tax reform measure , not a government reform measure . "
It " changes the way revenues are raised for the legitimate operations of the federal government . "
But if the FairTax raises the same amount of revenue to fund the same federal programs , then what does Boortz think the federal government does that is illegitimate ?
Is there anything he considers to be illegitimate ?
If so , then why would he expend so much energy on changing the way the federal government collects taxes instead of changing the amount that the federal government collects in taxes ?
The fundamental problem is clearly taxation , not the tax code .
What is wrong with the federal government 's tax code is not that it is too complex , but that it makes possible the almost $ 3 trillion a year that the federal government spends .
As the French laissez - faire economist Jean - Baptiste Say ( 1767 –1832 ) once said : " The best tax is always the lightest . "
Or , as our modern - day Say in Congress , Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , says : " The real issue is total spending by government , not tax reform . "
Problem # 16 : The FairTax does n't even begin to address the root of the problem .
Boortz does refer to Frank Chodorov ( 1887 –1966 ) , reminding us that he " once observed that , by enacting the income tax , the American government was proclaiming that all wealth belonged to the government , and whatever wealth the government did not seize from the person who created it should be looked on as a concession — a gift from the government . "
But Boortz does n't quote Chodorov , and he gives no source that he is referencing .
He subtly seems to imply that Chodorov was opposed to the income tax because it was an income tax and that , therefore , he might be inclined to support the FairTax if he were alive .
But this could n't possibly be true because Chodorov considered taxation itself to be robbery .
How is justifying the federal government spending almost $ 3 trillion a year of the taxpayers money , as long as it is collected " fairly , " any different from the viewpoint that Chodorov condemns ?
While making the case for not allowing exemptions from the FairTax for food , Boortz , in using the example of a wedding reception , inadvertently shows his true colors : " Would it be fair to allow a multimillionaire to spend $ 20,000 on food for a large wedding reception at his estate , and not pay any sales tax on that purchase ? "
Why , of course it would .
It would be fairer than forcing the American people to pay a 23 percent national sales tax on every good and service they purchase .
Problem # 17 : The FairTax makes welfare universal .
Millions of people who never took a dime from other taxpayers in the form of food stamps , SSI , AFDC , Medicaid , WIC , or housing assistance will now be on the federal dole via the prebate .
The FairTax is welfare for the masses .
It makes us all wards of the state .
Perhaps it would be best , in the interest of equity and efficiency , if all the money Americans earned was just paid to the state and then distributed to every American in a " fair " manner .
The government could just keep what it needed , redistribute what 's left , and do it all without the FairTax .
The Fraud of the FairTax
The FairTax is not the solution .
And because it allows the federal government to confiscate the wealth of American citizens less intrusively and more efficiently , it will become part of the problem — the problem of the ever - increasing , ever - intruding , ever - destroying welfare / warfare state .
The FairTax is a fraud .
Yet Boortz ties rejection of the FairTax to believing that America is a great country because of its government , " as so many politicians do . "
Politicians who oppose the FairTax do so because they " thrive on dependency . "
The antidote to the fraud of the FairTax is a good dose of the wisdom of Murray Rothbard : " There can be no such thing as ' fairness in taxation . '
Taxation is nothing but organized theft , and the concept of a ' fair tax ' is therefore every bit as absurd as that of ' fair theft . ' "
Boortz believes that the abolition of the income tax will make the bad day of April 15 " just another beautiful spring day . "
With its unsubstantiated claims , ridiculous lies , and numerous problems , the FairTax will ensure that everyday is a bad day , not just April 15 .
Words for the Democratic Congress to live by :
The ink on the President 's veto is barely dry , and already , a lot of Washington insiders - including some Democrats -- are saying Congress should just give in to the President .
Never mind how hard people have pushed to bring Congress to this point , when we are finally standing up to the President 's disastrous Iraq policy -- they want to give up on the binding language in the bill requiring the President to begin redeploying troops from Iraq .
But that 's just letting the President have his way all over again .
That 's the kind of thinking that got us into this war in the first place , and it 's not going to cut it anymore .
We can't keep giving in to this Administration on Iraq .
Every time the Administration gets its way , it means that our troops will remain stuck in the middle of Iraq 's civil war , and our national security will continue to be undermined .
With so many Americans demanding that our involvement in this war come to an end , backing down is not the answer .
No one else should die in Iraq to give political comfort to dealmakers in Washington ....
The next step to ending the war is n't to give in , but to step up the pressure on the President .
I 'm pleased to be working with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on a bill to end our open - ended military commitment in Iraq .
Now that the President has rejected the will of the American people with this veto , our bill , or some other proposal to end funding for a failed policy , should be the next step to end the war .
In yesterday ’s analysis I presented some coverage of the “ Phishing , Spam , and Security Risk Highlights ” of Symantec ’s Internet Security Threat Report , volume XI .
Today , rather than continue my analysis , I ’m taking a break to address the important matter of how a secondary analysis may be conducted in the comfort of your own mind .
I will continue to provide analysis of further content of the ISTR XI on a (n almost ) daily basis , until I decide I ’m finished .
Do try this at home !
The most important system security utility in your arsenal is , and likely always will be , your mind .
Techniques of Informal Secondary Analysis :
The following points are things to keep in mind when reading a statistical analysis of data related to computer security , or when reading some reporter ’s take on such an analysis .
These principles of secondary analysis may even prove useful for reading my own analyses .
Take no such analysis merely at face value — instead , consider all such sources suspect , and always apply critical thought to them .
limited statistical sampling :
The sample analyzed is probably artificially limited in some way that creates unobviously erroneous impressions .
For instance , the Symantec Internet Security Threat Report XI analysis of operating systems was limited to MS Windows , MacOS X , Sun Solaris , HP - UX , and RHEL / Fedora .
A lot of people — including supposed experts who should know better — took this to mean that some kind of analysis of “ Linux ” in general was done , rather than a single OS that happened to have a Linux kernel .
Similarly , sweeping generalizations were made about all available OSes based on this very limited sampling .

Similarly , sweeping generalizations were made about all available OSes based on this very limited sampling .
conflicts of interest :
The people presenting the analysis probably operate under conditions of a conflict of interest .
The vast majority of TCO comparisons between MS Windows and any Linux distributions have been conducted by someone paid by an interested party who benefits materially from a given result .
The Symantec Internet Security Threat Reports are all created by a corporation that stands to lose a lot of money if people migrate away from MS Windows in droves .
Sometimes , these biases and conflicts of interest can be very difficult to detect , but failing to research the matter in some depth can result in accepting data as unbiased that should be viewed with suspicion .

statistically insignificant sampling :
It is dismayingly rare to get an analysis of a statistically significant sample .
Most of the time , samples are pathetically small , which can lead to severe shortcomings in accuracy — statistical data becomes more accurate as there is more of it .
The reason for this is that small samples are too easily skewed by externalities and transient effects .
For instance , the Symantec Internet Security Threat Reports are often held up as indications of some grand , sweeping conclusion , such as the claim made by a couple of information technology reporting agencies declaring that MS Windows is the “ most secure ” OS based on a mere six months of data , during a period when MS Windows was in transition between releases ( new MS Windows releases tend to enjoy a brief period of relatively low exploit activity ) , among other positive effects on MS Windows statistical security .

cherry - picking statistical data : Cherry - picking comparison data to make a point is common , particularly in vendor - sponsored reports and superficial secondary reporting of data .
For instance , at least one trade rag reported on the supposedly heightened security of MS Windows based on the total number of vulnerabilities discovered during the six month period of the Symantec Internet Security Threat Report XI , but neglected to mention that in that period only two RHEL / Fedora vulnerabilities and one MacOS X vulnerability were of high criticality while a dozen MS Windows vulnerabilities in the same comparison were of high criticality .

improperly excluded comparison data :
That ’s not the only biased choice of data one may find .
Often , data may be excluded from specific comparisons in a manner that creates false , or biased , impressions of the results .
For instance , in the Symantec Internet Security Threat Report XI , much is made of the apparently relatively low number of vulnerabilities and the quick patch times for MS Windows , but the MS Windows numbers did n’t include several classes of software vulnerabilities that bear directly on MS Windows security — such as Microsoft ’s Achilles heel , Internet Explorer .
MS Windows was reported as having only 36 vulnerabilities during that six month period , while IE was reported as having 54 of them in the same period .
Clearly , the 36 reported for MS Windows is not the whole story , especially considering that IE is effectively indivisible from the OS .

improperly excluded study data :
This is a bit more difficult to detect than improperly excluded comparison data .
With comparison data , you can find other data that seems relevant to a comparison but was not part of it if you look elsewhere within the report .
In the case of improperly excluded study data , you usually need to be able to read between the lines exceedingly well , and double - check your guesses against some hard data that can prove your guesses correct .
At this time , I am not certain of any improperly excluded study data in the Symantec Internet Security Threat Report XI , so I will not speculate in examples .

improperly included comparison data :
The flip - side of improper exclusion is the case of including data in a comparison that should not be included .
For instance , in Symantec ’s Internet Security Threat Report XI , the RHEL / Fedora statistics give false impressions in comparison with other OSes in a couple of manners : in one case , by including mutually exclusive software package version vulnerabilities from two actually separate OSes as though they were the same OS ; in another case , by including thousands of third - party applications and other pieces of software in the analysis , just because they are provided via the YUM package management system for user convenience — equivalent to counting vulnerabilities in Adobe Photoshop , the World of Warcraft game , Symantec Norton Antivirus , Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite , Mozilla Firefox , and thousands of other third - party applications in MS Windows vulnerabilities .
In fact , many that were included in RHEL / Fedora ’s count could be included in the MS Windows count as well , because they will run on either platform , but they were only counted toward RHEL / Fedora .

disputing data : Often , you will find that two reporting organizations provide contradictory data .
No statistical analysis should be viewed in a vacuum , if it is at all possible ( and practical ) to avoid doing so .
For instance , the data related to Sun Solaris is materially disputed by Sun Microsystems .
If Sun ’s charges of inaccurate data are correct , that does not bode well for the accuracy of data elsewhere in Symantec ’s report .

verifiability of data :
The more you can check the data for independent verification , the more you can usually trust it .
For instance , Symantec ’s data for its Internet Security Threat Reports is famously unverifiable , with the exception of certain classes of statistical vulnerability data .
Even this is usually not verifiable in practical terms for anyone that does n’t have tens of thousands of dollars to spend on the process , because it is usually not packaged effectively for easy parsing and statistical analysis for the general public .

scary , but misrepresented , data : Often , data is presented in a confusing or deceptive manner .
In fact , this is often done accidentally , as many so - called experts do not even realize the errors of assumption they make .
For instance , the number of discovered vulnerabilities is a common statistic used by people of all supposed levels of expertise to bludgeon each other over the relative security of different OSes .
This is a generally poor metric in itself for measuring security .
In open source software development , in particular , the number of discovered vulnerabilities in a given time period is under most circumstances a misleading metric , as the open source development model lends itself to faster and more productive vulnerability identification by the “ good guys ” , who can then patch previously unknown vulnerabilities before the “ bad guys ” figure out the vulnerabilities on their own and develop exploits .
The converse is generally true of closed source , proprietary software — MS Windows , for instance , suffers from poor internal vulnerability detection because it must contend with very limited resources in that regard , as compared with the hundreds of thousands of potential bug fixers in the open source development community , and as a result MS Windows labors under the weight of always playing catch - up with zero - day exploits .
The first thing you should ask yourself when someone quotes vulnerability discovery numbers at you is “ Does this mean it ’s more vulnerable , or that the contrasted software has more vulnerabilities that have n’t been discovered by the ‘ good guys ’ ? ”
Do you feel safer when the community or organization that maintains your OS finds the vulnerabilities first , or when malicious security crackers find them first ?

One of the quickest ways to increase your productivity on the computer is to go commando : stop using the mouse .
When you stop relying on the mouse for everything , you 're forced to learn the keyboard shortcuts .
Jeremy Miller calls this the first step to coding faster .
I agree .
Keyboard shortcuts are almost always more efficient than using the mouse to point and click your way around the computer – but you 'll never learn them if you keep leaning on your trusty mouse to do all the work .
Stop for a moment , resist taking the easy way out with the mouse , and force yourself to learn at least one new keyboard shortcut per day .
Yes , it 's a tiny bit of extra work .
But it will pay off down the road : you 'll spend less time mousing around , and more time getting things done .
I 'm not anti-mouse by any means .
I remember when mice were new ; I 'd never want to go back to the bad old days of keyboard - only interfaces .
But most people I 've observed using the computer these days rely almost exclusively on the mouse , to the detriment of their overall computer experience .
Here are a few examples of how even the simplest keyboard shortcuts can make your daily routine easier :
Logging in with the keyboard , using Tab and Enter Going to a website using Alt + D and Ctrl + Enter Searching using Ctrl +
E then Enter Editing text and moving your cursor with basic textbox shortcuts
That 's just the tip of the iceberg .
Most applications have tons of useful keyboard shortcuts ; you just have to put down your mouse long enough to discover a few of them .
It 's a shame more applications do n't go out of their way to make keyboard shortcuts more discoverable .
At the very least , I 'd like to see Office 2007 type behavior where , as you press the keyboard accelerator key , all the possible keyboard shortcuts " light up " .
Unfortunately , navigating through websites is nearly impossible without a mouse , due to the highly mouse - centric nature of HTML .
I 've given up on trying .
But it is possible , if you 're a die - hard .
Unless you enjoy pressing the tab key umpteen million times , you 'll definitely want to check out Jon Galloway 's mouseless computing recommendations , wherein he conquers the HTML keyboard challenge .
For best computing results , try to use your mouse and your keyboard to the fullest .
But to do that , you 've got to actively wean yourself off the mouse .
Try going commando every now and then .
It will be awkward and painful at first .
You 'll be sorely tempted to switch back to your old faithful mouse to get things done .
Resist this urge !
I guarantee whatever you 're trying to do is possible – and ultimately quicker – if you persist with the keyboard .
This schematic of the scientists ´ experiment shows a light pulse illuminating a cesium atom in an optical cavity , where the quantum states of the light and atom are mapped onto each other .
When the light pulse exits , its interference with the original pulse demonstrates the reversibility of the state transfer .
Image credit : Boozer , et al .
Quantum computers offer the promise of processing information much more efficiently than classical computers .
But before quantum computers can be built , scientists must confront several challenges , one of which is quantum computers ' vulnerability to their surroundings .
Interaction with outside forces would immediately damage a quantum computer 's information ; this problem is known as " decoherence . "
One method to coherently process quantum information involves cavity quantum electrodynamics ( QED ) .
In this method , scientists use a small cavity to achieve coherent dynamics between an atom and a photon by manipulating an atom 's radiation properties with mirrors .
Scientists from the California Institute of Technology are among the leaders in cavity QED , and have recently reported an important advance to enable a coherent distribution of quantum information across a network .
In their paper published in Physical Review Letters , physicist David Boozer and his colleagues have demonstrated the reversible state transfer of a coherent light pulse to and from the internal state of an atom trapped in an optical cavity .
This observation is the first verification of atomic physicist Ignacio Cirac 's proposal for the reversible mapping of quantum states between light and matter using cavity QED to provide strong coupling for the atom - photon interaction .
“ The most significant result of this work is the demonstration of reversibility ( i.e. , coherence ) for the light emission and absorption processes , ” Boozer told PhysOrg.com .
“ The fact that this process is coherent means that it preserves superpositions of quantum states , hence it is a way of mapping quantum information between an atom and light . ”
In quantum networks , qubits ( the information states for quantum computers ) can be represented by either atoms or photons .
Atoms , which have long coherence times , serve as " stationary " qubits , or nodes of a network , where they are stored and locally manipulated .
Photons , on the other hand , serve as " flying " qubits , or quantum channels that connect nodes over long distances .
While many single - photon sources have been demonstrated in the past decade , none have been experimentally shown to be reversible until now .
“ In principle , in a quantum computer there are several logic gates , each of which performs an elementary quantum operation on one or two stationary qubits , ” Boozer explained .
“ The gates are connected together in a network , so that the output of one gate can be transported as a flying qubit to the input of the next gate .
Hence , one needs a way to turn stationary qubits into flying qubits and vice - versa , which is what our recent work has demonstrated . ”
In the Caltech scientists ' experiment , a cesium atom is localized within the cavity by a far off - resonant optical trap , where it repeatedly undergoes a series of light absorption and reemission cycles , lasting a total of 360 ms .
During each such cycle , the cavity is first illuminated by an incident pulse of coherent light .
Whenever the atom - cavity system absorbs this pulse , the quantum state of the light is written onto the internal state of the atom .
After a delay of about 300 ns , the atomic state gets mapped back onto an emitted pulse of light , which is allowed to interfere with the source of the original coherent pulse .
Observing the resulting interference fringe demonstrates the reversibility of the overall absorption - reemission process .
“ Our optical cavity has a very small mode volume ( the cavity length is only 42 microns ) , which ensures that the coherent interaction between the atom and light field occurs on a much faster time scale than the decoherence caused by atomic spontaneous emission or cavity leakage , ” Boozer explained .
“ Thus the atom and cavity field can exchange quantum information coherently many times before an incoherent process occurs .
This regime is known as strong - coupling in cavity QED . ”
The scientists explain that the efficiency of the light - to - atom transfer is limited in this scenario by factors such as passive mirror losses , equal transmission coefficients of the cavity mirrors , and the coupling of the atom to both polarization modes of the cavity .
With the ability to reversibly transfer a qubit 's state from " flying " to " stationary " and back again , the scientists have taken a step toward coherently transferring quantum information across a network , without disruption with the outside world .
Still , Boozer and his colleagues look forward to future improvements .
“ In the present work , the qubit is encoded in the photon - number states of light and in the hyperfine levels of the atom , ” he said .
“ A more robust scheme which we may pursue in the future would be to instead use the polarization degree of freedom of the light , and the magnetic sublevels of the atom .
Another future goal will be to increase the efficiency of the state transfer process , for instance by using cavity mirrors with unequal transmissivities and / or even higher reflectivities . ”

TUNIS —
The plan , hatched for months in the arid mountains of North Africa , was to attack the American and British Embassies here .
It ended in a series of gun battles in January that killed a dozen militants and left two Tunisian security officers dead .
But the most disturbing aspect of the violence in this normally placid , tourist - friendly nation is that it came from across the border in Algeria , where an Islamic terrorist organization has vowed to unite radical Islamic groups across North Africa .
Counterterrorism officials on three continents say the trouble in Tunisia is the latest evidence that a brutal Algerian group with a long history of violence is acting on its promise : to organize extremists across North Africa and join the remnants of Al Qaeda into a new international force for jihad .
[ Last week , the group claimed responsibility for seven nearly simultaneous bombings that destroyed police stations in towns east of Algiers , the Algerian capital , killing six people . ]
An interesting bit of information popped up in this weekend ’s LA Times — The Pirate Bay is planning to design the next generation of file - sharing technology .
Based in Stockholm , Sweden , The Pirate Bay has become one of the top file - sharing websites on the Internet allowing users to download thousands of movie and music files though various BitTorrent clients daily .
The only problem is , most of the files being traded free - of - charge are violating the copyright of the owners and producers of the content .
According to The Pirate Bay ’s own stats , the site receives about 12,000 file transfer requests per second .
The organizers behind the site do n’t offer much detail about the new technology other than to say that it is intended to make “ every transaction completely untraceable . ”
So far , The Pirate Bay has received legal threats from major corporations such as Microsoft , DreamWorks , EA , SEGA , Apple , Warner Bros . and the MPAA .
Even now the site remains defiant , prominently displaying a statement that leaves no doubt where they stand : “ 0 torrents has been removed , and 0 torrents will ever be removed . ”
Despite the illegal nature of the site , it appears to be gaining traction in the legitimate world .
Trent Reznor ’s band Nine Inch Nails just released a track called “ Year Zero ” on the site for users to download for free .
Mainstream acceptance , or music promo hype , either way the move is likely to appeal to the band ’s hardcore fans online .
The Times article also mentions a burgeoning political movement forming around The Pirate Bay .
It 's doubtful that a political movement based on " free everything " will gain much traction , but the very existence of such a group proves that The Pirate Bay is slowly becoming more than just a group of geeks protecting their servers .

Earth sits amid the magnetosphere , rendered in blue and surrounded by the solar wind .
The white rectangle on the left identifies the area where ESA ’s Cluster and China / ESA Double Star ’s satellites discovered density holes .
The brown dots represent the solar wind and ions back - streaming against the solar wind flow , along the interplanetary magnetic field lines ( in black ) .
The space above you is fizzing with activity as bubbles of superhot gas constantly grow and pop around Earth , scientists announced today .
Astronomers found the activity up where Earth 's magnetic field meets a constant stream of particles flowing out from the Sun .
While space is commonly called a vacuum , in fact there is gas everywhere , albeit not as dense as the air you breathe .
The newfound bubbles are technically called density holes .
In them , gas density is 10 times lower .
The gas in the bubbles is 18,000,000 Fahrenheit ( 10,000,000 Celsius ) instead of the 180,000 degrees Fahrenheit of the surrounding hot gas , which is known as plasma [ Graphic ] .
The bubbles were found in data collected by the European Space Agency 's Cluster mission , a flotilla of four spacecraft .
Researchers first thought they had an instrument glitch when the spacecrafts passed through bubbles .
" Then I looked at the data from all four Cluster spacecraft .
These anomalies were being observed simultaneously by all the spacecraft .
That 's when I believed that they were real , " said George Parks , University of California , Berkeley .
The bubbles expand to about 620 miles ( 1,000 kilometers ) and probably last about 10 seconds before bursting and being replaced by the cooler , denser solar wind , Parks and his colleagues say .
[ Find out why the high temperatures do n't fry the spacecraft . ]
It is not known for sure how the bubbles are created , but the researchers suspect it involves the solar wind colliding with the magnetic field , which forms a boundary called the bow shock .
The phenomenon is similar to the wake formed by the front of a boat .
The discovery , detailed in the journal Physics of Plasmas , could help astronomers better understand how this solar wind interacts with the magnetic field .
GRINNELL , Iowa ( AP ) 
The body of a college student who had been missing since last fall was discovered in a country club swimming pool when a worker removed the cover to get it ready for summer , police said .
Dental records identified the body as Paul Shuman - Moore , 19 , a Grinnell College sophomore from Chicago , police said .
An investigation shows Shuman - Moore killed himself , and the official cause of death was listed as drowning , police said Wednesday .
Investigators found the he had bound his own legs and hands with duct tape .
Shuman - Moore was last seen alive on Sept. 25 .
His disappearance prompted an extensive search of the area by police and volunteers .
" For the past six months , we have hoped and prayed that our dear son Paul was alive , " his parents , Steve Moore and Betsy Shuman - Moore , said in a statement .
" Now that he has been found , we are devastated . "
Grinnell College was providing counseling and mental health services for students , said Tom Crady , the school 's vice president for student services .
He said he participated in the search for Shuman - Moore and said the Grinnell Golf and Country Club property , a few blocks from campus , was extensively examined .

Albert Einstein , as every kid knows , was a smart guy .
But as we discover when we get older , smart gets you only so far .
It 's worth remembering , especially now , that what made Einstein special was his impertinence , his nonconformity , and his distaste for dogma .
At a time when the US , worried about competition from China , is again emphasizing math and science education , Einstein 's genius reminds us that a society 's competitive advantage comes not from teaching the multiplication or periodic tables but from nurturing rebels .
Grinds have their place , but unruly geeks change the world .
And , as recent research into Einstein 's personal papers shows , there 's no better glimpse into his offbeat creativity than the way he puzzled out the special theory of relativity .
As a child , Einstein was slow to speak .
This , combined with his cheeky defiance of authority and his distaste for rote learning , led one school master to send him packing and another to dismiss him as a lazy dog .
" When I ask myself how it happened that I in particular discovered the relativity theory , " Einstein once said , " it seemed to lie in the following circumstance .
The ordinary adult never bothers his head about the problems of space and time .
But I developed so slowly that I began to wonder about space and time only when I was already grown up . "
Einstein alienated so many professors that he was unable to earn a doctorate , much less land an academic job .
At the age of 26 , he was working as a third - class examiner at the Swiss patent office in Bern .
As it happens , the patent office provided a better launchpad than any university .
On his way to work , Einstein would see trains rolling past the city 's 12th - century clock tower , which by then had been synchronized with clocks in the nearby train station , and many of the patent applications he was reviewing proposed using signals traveling at the speed of light to sync up even more distant clocks .
Yet the two ideas were " seemingly incompatible . "
He visualized a light beam racing down a railway track .
The postulates , taken together , would mean that a man standing next to the track would see the light beam race by him at the same speed that a woman sitting in a railway car would see it — whether she was zooming toward the beam 's source or away from it .
Then something delightful happened .
Einstein went to visit his best friend , Michele Besso , a brilliant but unfocused engineer he had recruited to come work at the patent office .
Einstein told Besso about the dilemma .
" I 'm going to give it up , " he said .
But as they walked to work , Einstein took one of the most elegant imaginative leaps in the history of physics .
" I suddenly understood the key to the problem , " he later recalled .
" Time can not be absolutely defined . "
Imagine lightning striking at both ends of a long , fast - moving train .
If the light from each strike reaches a person standing on the embankment at the midpoint of the train at the same moment , he would say the strikes happened at the same time .
But a person riding inside the train at its midpoint would be a bit closer to the front lightning strike by the time the light arrived ; she would say that the light from the front strike reached her first , so the strikes were not simultaneous .
From that sprang Einstein 's special theory of relativity .
Two events that are simultaneous in one reference frame may not be simultaneous for someone moving relative to that reference frame .
Therefore , time is relative depending on your state of motion .
Try to catch up with a light beam and , though the speed of light remains constant , time slows down .
Other scientists had come close to his insight , but they were too confined by the dogmas of the day .
Einstein alone was impertinent enough to discard the notion of absolute time , one of the sacred tenets of classical physics since Newton .
" Imagination is more important than knowledge , " Einstein later said .
Indeed , if we are ever going to unravel the further mysteries of dark matter , come up with a unified theory , or discover the true nature of energy , we should carve that proclamation above all of our blackboards .

Republicans struggled Thursday to keep a permanent extension of the Patriot Act on track as critics appeared to gain ground in their bid to derail the anti-terrorism legislation .
The two sides were poised for battle on the Senate floor today , where a filibuster was planned to force the framers of a House - backed compromise bill back to the drawing board .
The opponents gained momentum when Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , a defender of the original Patriot Act , said she would support a filibuster .
The White House and the Republican leadership sought to corral votes to avoid a year - end political embarrassment .
A deeply divided chamber engaged in an often - emotional debate Thursday , weighing issues of security and liberty on a day that one member noted was the anniversary of the ratification in 1791 of what would become known as the Bill of Rights , including the 4th Amendment ’s right against unreasonable searches .

“ It is ironic ... that we are considering legislation that would greatly undermine that principle , " said Sen. Ken Salazar ( D - Colo. ) , part of a bipartisan group of nine senators building support for the filibuster .
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist ( R - Tenn . ) , while acknowledging that the vote would be close , said Thursday he expected the Senate to overcome opposition and pass the legislation .
“ We ’ll have the votes by tomorrow , ” Frist said .
But Sen. Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , a leading opponent of the measure , dismissed the prediction and said opponents appeared to have enough support to sustain the procedural stalling tactic .
Sixty votes would be needed in the 100 - member chamber to end debate and move to passage of the legislation .
The arithmetic could pose a problem : Republicans hold 55 seats , but four are committed to opposing the legislation ; even absent further defections , supporters would have to win over nine Democrats .
Advertisement
Senate Republicans were developing a backup plan in case the filibuster threat succeeded , such as a short - term extension of the law in its original form .
Others speculated that the leadership might pull the bill at the last minute to avoid an embarrassing denouement .
Feinstein , a moderate who has been a defender of the current law , is considered an important swing vote in the debate .
She and others predicted the act would be extended in some form , but without agreement on key changes .
“ What will be lost is the much - needed sense that the Patriot Act represents a broad consensus , ” Feinstein said on the Senate floor .
“ Having a consensus bill is of paramount importance . ”
The uncertain fate of the legislation owes much to an unlikely alliance that includes Wisconsin Sen. Russell D. Feingold , a possible 2008 Democratic presidential candidate , and several conservative Republicans .
The group said the White House miscalculated by not taking their concerns more seriously .

“ I think the president has not been especially well - served by those who took on the responsibility of crafting this extension , ” said New Hampshire Sen. John E. Sununu , one of four Republicans who support the filibuster .
“ I think the administration has been surprised about the depth and breadth of concern on this issue , ” Sununu said in an interview .
“ It is another indication of their lack of engagement .
They should n’t be surprised .
They thought it would be an easy vote ....
We all know it is going to be very close . ”
The sticking points involve what Sununu described as “ a few areas of a very large bill . ”
Sixteen provisions of the Patriot Act expire on Dec. 31 , although the debate has zeroed in on a few , including one popularly known as “ the library provision . ”
In general , critics contend the law should be changed to require federal agents , when requesting records in terrorism cases , to demonstrate a closer connection between the records they are seeking and terrorism suspects .
Without that connection , they say , authorities can engage in fishing expeditions that intrude on the lives of ordinary citizens .

At the same time , many of the provisions have been little - used .
The Justice Department has estimated that a form of search warrant that has been at the center of the debate constitutes less than 1 % of the number of federal search warrants executed since the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Another section that gives the government authority to obtain records from a broad array of businesses , including libraries and bookstores , has been used a few dozen times , Justice has said .
Supporters predicted dire consequences if the bill did not pass .
The Patriot Act “ will prevent future acts of terrorism unless we allow it to expire , ” Sen. Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) said .
If a filibuster resulted in the act ’s ceasing to exist and an attack occurred , “ everyone who votes to support a filibuster will have to answer for that , ” Kyl said .
Opponents denied they wanted to kill the law .
They said they wanted to improve it .

“ Jon , you ’re wrong , ” said Sen. Larry E. Craig , an Idaho Republican .
“ Jon , you ’re just flat wrong .
We are talking about and focusing on a very small part . ”
Via The Progressive :
With scarcely a mention in the mainstream media , President Bush has ordered up a plan for responding to a catastrophic attack .
Under that plan , he entrusts himself with leading the entire federal government , not just the Executive Branch .
And he gives himself the responsibility “ for ensuring constitutional government . ”
He laid this all out in a document entitled “ National Security Presidential Directive / NSPD 51 ” and “ Homeland Security Presidential Directive / HSPD - 20 . ”
Other than a discussion on Daily Kos led off by a posting by Leo Fender , and a pro-forma notice in a couple of mainstream newspapers , this document has gone unremarked upon .
The subject of the document is entitled “ National Continuity Policy . ”

Well it ’s impossible to remove all of the parentheses in Lisp , but I can think of several methods to eliminate the bulk of them .
One alternative to parentheses is being sensitive to white space , in a way that is reminiscent of Python .
The simple description is as follows : each line automatically has an opening parenthesis added before it , and a closing parenthesis added after it , except under the following circumstances : if the following line has one extra level of indentation omit the closing parenthesis .
If the line in question is indented two or more levels beyond the previous line add an extra opening parenthesis for every new level of indentation beyond the first .
If the line following the line in question is less indented than the line we are examining add an extra closing parenthesis for each level less .
( the end of the file should be treated as a line with 0 indentation of course )
Let ’s apply these rules to some simple cases :
A cond statement of the following nature :
( cond ( (< x - 1 ) (* x x ) ) ( (> x 1 ) (* x x ) ) ( (< x 0 ) ( sqrt ( abs x ) ) ) ( else ( sqrt x ) ) )
would become :
cond (< x - 1 ) (* x x ) (> x 1 ) (* x x ) (< x 0 ) ( sqrt ( abs x ) ) else ( sqrt x )
if we are willing to take up some more lines it could also become :
cond (< x - 1 ) * x x (> x 1 ) * x x ( < x 0 ) sqrt ( abs x ) else sqrt x
Admittedly this expansion looks rather verbose for such a simple cond statement , but if the cond was more complex , and had more instructions in each branch , it would not be too much of an expansion , because it is likely the programmer would have already indented it in this fashion .
Now consider the let statement :
( let ( ( a (+ 1 v ) ) ( b ( car z ) ) ( c ( avg 8 3 w ) ) ( d w ) ) ( body - goes - here ) )
This statement could be written as :
let ( a (+ 1 v ) ) ( b ( car z ) ) ( c ( avg 8 3 w ) ) ( d w ) body - goes - here
or as :
let a (+ 1 v ) b ( car z ) c ( avg 8 3 w ) d w body - goes - here
So far everything looks pretty nice , but there are a few problems with this method .
For example : consider the case where programmers break a function containing many , possibly complicated , arguments onto several lines :
( my - large - function ( car ( cdr y ) ) ( lambda ( x ) ( / x 2 ) ) my - list )
we want to break it up like so :
my - large - function car ( cdr y ) lambda ( x ) ( / x 2 ) my - list
but unfortunately the rules we have laid out dictate the my - list should be wrapped with parentheses , and thus will be called like a function .
This can also be a problem when you want to put more than one function call on a single line , for example :
( lambda ( x ) ( display x ) ( newline ) (* x 42 ) )
is not properly translated as :
lambda ( x ) ( display x ) ( newline ) * x 42
since the result of ( display x ) is not a function to be applied to the result of ( newline ) .
There are several ways to overcome this , for example using values ( in an ideal world , where it worked like you expected it to ) and begin .
However a simpler solution is to simply add a special prefix the language that when encountered before a line instructs the compiler / reader to add one less pair of parentheses around the line .
I would suggest the \ character , since it has been used in other contexts as an escape character .
Our examples then would be written ( correctly ) as follows :
my - large - function car ( cdr y ) lambda ( x ) ( / x 2 ) \ my - list lambda ( x ) \ ( display x ) ( newline ) * x 42
Note : \ is not notation for the continuation of a line .
Well , it ’s something to think about at least .
I know some people will object for the same reasons they do to Python ’s white space sensitivity , but consider this before you dismiss it out of hand : one of the biggest barriers to the adoption of Lisp is that the sheer bulk of parentheses can be intimidating , and a method such as this would hide the majority of them , especially the large mass of closing parenthesis that seems to end every complicated function .
As you may know I plan on experimenting with my own Scheme variant soon , and this is one of the ideas I think I will try out in it ( as a compiler option of course , not a mandate ) , unless I hear a good reason not to .
Notes from Underfoot
Are Programmers People ?
And If So , What to Do About It ?
by Ken Arnold
April 9 , 2003
Summary
... Wherein we explore the radical notion that programmers are people , and then look at what this might mean for deep tools , such as APIs , protocols , and programming languages .
Advertisement
My experience is that significant advances are triggered by radical notions .
My current radical notion is this : Programmers are people .
Some will be skeptical , but I think that there is sufficient evidence to accept this , at least for the sake of argument .
Briefly , though , I will point out that programmers are well known to sleep on occasion , and to smell badly if they do not bathe .
Beyond these basic animal traits , we can also note that they use language ( although often crypticly ) , a trait commonly accepted to be a hallmark of humans .
If we accept that programmers are humans , one primary and interesting consequence is that human factors issues can be properly applied towards the tools they use .
I 'm not talking here about IDEs , which have GUIs that are clearly subject to human factors analysis .
( Answer : They mostly suck . )
I am speaking about the more basic tools programmers use every minute they do their work : programming languages and APIs .
I first started to think about this when writing a paper on C ++.
In the first ( and only ) draft , I declared that a programming language is a user interface to the language 's abstract programming model .
I was surprised to discover that this view was not common , although it was easy to sell .
It was easy to sell because most people quickly see the point : Users ( in this case programmers ) are interfacing with the programming model through the medium of the code text .
The striking thing was that it was n't already widely accepted .
I thought I was stating an obvious truism .
But for many , I was stating a wholly new idea .
Clearly the practice of programming languages does not look to human factors .
C++ is a grand example of this .
As a small example , consider the following :
There are two ways to declare variables :
The way used for function parameters and the way for everything else : foo( int a , int b ) vs. int a , b ; .
One is comma separated , the other semicolon terminated .
You cannot directly declare two variables to have the same type if and only if they are function parameters .
Basic human factors says that an interface should have one way to do a single thing that always looks the same .
Is this earth - shattering ?
Hardly .
It 's just easy to describe in a paragraph .
And it shows the basic premise at work .
More profoundly , consider garbage collection .
One can argue up and down about the overhead , etc. , but consider this :
Two of the best selling C++ books are Scott Meyer 's Effective C++ and More Effective C++.
The single largest category of the 85 tips -- about one quarter of them -- is dealing with potential memory leaks .
In a garbage collected environment , none of those tips need to be considered .
Whatever other costs you consider , you must consider the bug rate when those hints are not used , or are used incorrectly .
This is fundamentally a human factors problem :
You can tell people how to avoid the whirling knives of the abattoir , or you can close the abattoir door .
I do not claim to be original in worrying about such issues :
The classic Brian Kernighan1 paper " Why Pascal Is Not My Favorite Programming Language " does not say so , but many of its critiques are human factors based .
But I think our lives as programmers could be a lot better if we took this seriously , actually understanding human factors and applying them , instead of just doing our best to exercise personal good taste .
Consider the following human factors principles ( the numbers are only so I can refer back to them ; these are in no particular order ) :
There should be one way things are done ( whether or not it appears in multiple places ) .
For example , the login dialog box should look the same , no matter where and why it pops up .
Similar things should be done similarly .
This helps people use their learning from one place to work in another .
Different things should be clearly different .
Dangerous things should be impossible , or where necessary , clearly labeled as dangerous .
Default behavior should be harmless .
Users should be able to predict what the results of actions will be .
My first example fails ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .
A C++ example of ( 3 ) ( and ( 6 ) ) might be implicit conversion .
Without a large knowledge of the local environment ( or a very good IDE ) nobody can tell if return x + y ( where x and y are objects ) creates one new object , or three , or twenty .
It all depends on how many conversions are necessary on y to make it usable in some operator + method on x , and then how many more are required to turn the result into an object compatible with the return type .
In one example I uncovered , the total number of objects created and discarded was 12 .
The difference between x + y and x + new Foo( new Bar( new Gogin(y ) ) ) is pretty important , and completely invisible .
Many of C++'s most egregious violations of human factors violate ( 5 ) .
Consider that a default copy constructor will be created for you if you do not provide one .
This constructor will be simple ( field - by - field copy ) , but also often enough wrong .
You can stop it from giving you one by providing your own , but you must do this whether or not you want a copy constructor at all .
If you do n't want one , you declare one but make it private .
In other words , the default is dangerous ( and the workaround backhanded ) .
And compare that behavior to a violation of ( 6 ) :
One would expect that there would be a default overload for the == operator .
Why ?
Because in almost every situation where the default copy constructor was valid , an analogous field - by - field comparison for equality would be valid as well .
But you do n't get a default operator== .
And surely if you do provide one , it clearly obvious that 99.99 % of the time , you can define x != y as !( x == y ) .
This is far more likely to be correct than the default copy constructor , but in one place C++ is " helpful " and in the other place we must trust people to know Scott 's Effective C++ tip that you should always override == and != as a pair .
This is a rich source of bugs .
Note in addition that these two language choices take fundamentally different views of the human programmer .
Is C++ a " tries to be helpful " language for default method implementations or a " conservative choice " language ?
What would you guess : Does C++ provide an automatic = ( assignment ) operator ?
In this and many other ways it is schizophrenic , and hence unpredictable .
I do n't want to pick on C ++.
At least not exclusively .
Smalltalk 's unusual syntax contributed greatly to its demise .
Java chose to keep C's " fall through " default for switch statements which is Just Plain Wrong TM .
Perl has so many ways to do the same thing that most Perl programmers commonly encounter chunks of Perl they cannot comprehend : each Perl programmer has a sub - dialect they understand , and much they 've never seen .
I could go on for a long time on languages alone , never mind APIs .
And so could you .
No matter what , every language will have human factors problems .
Tradeoffs are inevitable even with the best design , so you can always find one principle violated to support another .
But I want us to be trading them off against each other , not ignoring them .
Let us think of each other as human ( well , with a few exceptions ) and then design like it .

My projects are all suspended … I have been busy playing with stream examples of chapter 3 of SICP :) .
I wrote in Erlang a simple implementation of stream as cons-list .
It is not meant to be efficient but easy to understand ( and debug ) :
a stream is here a tuple {stream , Head , DelayedTail} , where DelayedTail is a 0 - arity ’s function which return the next stream element tuple ;
, where is a 0 - arity ’s function which return the next stream element tuple ; a macro implements the delay function used to construct a stream tail :
- define ( DELAY ( Any ) , fun ( ) ->
Any end ) .
Note : the head is not delayed , and if we need a delayed head this probably means that we need a lazy - evaluation model , to which I ’ll come later .
Using abstract functions , head / 1 to access current value and tail / 1 to force evaluation of next stream state , will enables to hook a memoization process if needed .
Anyway , the stream concatenation and the delay ’s macro are enough to build all stream manipulations .
Here are some examples :
% map : application of a procedure to all elements of a stream map ( Proc , Stream={stream , undefined , undefined} ) -> % empty stream : do nothing Stream ; map ( Proc , Stream ) -> % apply Proc to current , and delay apply to all tail elements { stream , Proc( head ( Stream ) ) , ? DELAY ( map ( Proc , tail ( Stream ) ) ) } % filter elements of stream with respect to some predicate filter ( Pred , Stream={stream , undefined , undefined} ) -> % empty stream : do nothing Stream ; filter ( Pred , Stream={stream , _Head , _ Tail} ) ->
Current = head ( Stream ) , case Pred( Current ) of true -> { stream , Current , ? DELAY ( filter ( Pred , tail ( Stream ) ) ) } ; _ False -> filter ( Pred , tail ( Stream ) ) end .
% generalized map : apply proc to multiple streams ( traverse streams " in parallel " ) gmap ( Proc , Streams= [ First={stream , undefined , undefined}|_Others ] ) -> % assume all stream have the same length % found one stream empty : end of process First ; gmap ( Proc , Streams= [ First|_Others ] ) -> % create a list of heads
Heads = lists : map ( fun( S ) -> stream : head ( S ) end , Streams ) , % create a generator of the list of tails FTails = fun ( ) -> lists : map ( fun( S ) -> stream : tail ( S ) end , Streams ) end , % result is the application to heads and delayed mapping to tails { stream , Proc( Heads ) , ? DELAY ( gmap ( Proc , FTails ( ) ) ) } .
And now , we have enough to use the streams :
% explicit definition of infinite sequence of integers explicit_integers_from( N ) -> { stream , N , ?DELAY( explicit_integers_from ( N+1 ) ) }. % add values of 2 streams add ( S1 , S2 ) -> gmap( fun ( [ X , Y ] ) -> X + Y end , [ S1 , S2 ] ) . % infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers fibs ( ) -> { stream , 0 , ? DELAY ( {stream , 1 , ? DELAY ( add ( fibs ( ) , tail ( fibs ( ) ) ) ) } ) }.
A bit more usefull : 2 infinite sequences of prime numbers .
First one uses the sieve of Eratosthene ; second one uses basic definition of prime : number not divisible by any previous primes .
% Sieve of Eratosthene : sieve ( Stream ) ->
Current = head ( Stream ) , {stream , Current , ? DELAY ( sieve ( filter ( fun( N ) -> N rem Current /= 0 end , tail ( Stream ) ) ) ) }. sieve_primes ( ) -> sieve ( explicit_integers_from ( 2 ) ) . % prime numbers using the factors decomposition property primes ( ) -> {stream , 2 , ?DELAY ( filter ( fun is_prime / 1 , explicit_integers_from ( 3 ) ) ) }. is_prime( N ) -> iter_is_prime( N , primes ( ) ) .
iter_is_prime(N , Primes ) -> FirstPrime = head ( Primes ) , if FirstPrime * FirstPrime > N -> true ; N rem First Prime == 0 -> false ; true -> iter_is_prime( N , tail ( Primes ) ) end .
And of course there are lot of stream examples in SICP chapter , like the impressive Euler transformation to accelerate convergence of sequence .
In this thread http://erlang.mirror.su.se/ml-archive/erlang-questions/200010/msg00165.html
you can find a real stream implementation by Richard Carlsson , as well as interesting discussions about stream and lazy evaluation .
Also check this other thread http://www.erlang.org/ml-archive/erlang-questions/200602/msg00003.html if you ’re interested by memoization in Erlang .
I may test it later to learn the magic of Erlang parse_transform ; ) , but I think an easy possible way to implement memoization for my stream is to model a stream as a tuple of 4 elements , adding a dictionary of memoized values as last element ( my current implementation uses the process dictionary to store memoized values ) .
Actually I ’m not sure if this post is too short to be a tutorial or too long to be a interesting post !
Anyway , it exists now 😉 … mostly because a friend gave me motivation to do so , thanks !
Fox suggests Rosie fired over ' leaked ' video of 9/11 talk David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday May 29 , 2007 Print This Email
This ( Update at bottom : 9/11 activist slams ' absurdity ' of Fox report ) " Is this the real reason ? "
Fox News asked Tuesday , why Rosie O'Donnell is no longer on The View , before playing a YouTube video of O'Donnell warming up her audience by " ranting " about suspicious events she says were omitted from the 9/11 Commission Report .
Most accounts have stated that O'Donnell 's departure was due to an on -air fight over Iraq with co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck .
The Fox hosts speculate that the video might have come from an audience member 's cellphone , and then comment briefly on how " people go off on this topic when Rosie talks about World Trade Center Building Number 7 , " before cutting to a story about a giant lizard .
The video was also posted at the Screw Loose Change blog , which characterized O'Donnell as " raving about WTC 7 being omitted from the 9 - 11 Commission Report " -- adding " like the 9 - 11 Commission was concerned about a building in which nobody died , which was not a direct target of the attacks . "
Loose Change is an internet documentary which has received widespread press coverage over the last couple of years .
Although many " 9/11 truth movement " activists have criticized prior edits of the documentary , including a since - removed section which claimed video " proof " that the World Trade Center had been blown up , billionaire Mark Cuban is planning to finance a theatrical release after its latest edit , with actor Charlie Sheen possibly providing narration .
" And anyway , the notion that the 9 - 11 Commission Report ( PDF file ) does not mention WTC 7 is wrong , " Pat at Screw Loose Change writes , before citing four references to it , including page numbers .
However , none of these selections refer to the destruction of WTC 7 , which has perplexed many scientists , government investigators and architects over the years .
" Never in the history of the world has a building fallen from a fire into its own footprint eliminating the core , twenty - five steel beams , " O'Donnell said during the warm - up .
" Physics - wise , " O'Donnell said , such an occurrence is " impossible . "
Reporting for New York Magazine last November , Mark Jacobson noted that , along with the 9/11 Commission Report , WTC 7 was also " given much shrift in the subsequent ' Final Report on the Collapse of World Trade Center Towers , ' compiled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) . "
Dr. S. Shyam Sunder , head of NIST , told Jacobson that they had " preliminary hypotheses " regarding WTC 7 and " are studying the horizontal movement east to west , internal to the structure , on the fifth to seventh floors . "
" But truthfully , I dont really know , " Sunder admitted .
" Weve had trouble getting a handle on building No. 7 . " Sunder told Jacobson that the building 's omission from their report was only " a matter of staffing and budget , " and that they " hoped to release something on 7 WTC by the end of the year . "
However , no NIST explanation has been released as of yet .
The following video clip is from Fox News ' America 's Newsroom , broadcast on May 29 .
9/11 activist slams ' absurdity ' of Fox report William Rodriguez , a former World Trade Center maintenance worker who became a 9/11 activist after helping rescue fifteen of his co-workers , penned a letter which attacks Fox News for rumormongering about O'Donnell 's firing .
" Fox news came out today with the rumor that Rosie O'Donnell was fired because she mentioned my story to a live audience of The View that was recorded by a spectator and posted on the Internet , " Rodriguez wrote in a letter obtained by RAW STORY .
" The absurdity of their comments and their lack of investigative skills to even research that what she was talking about , makes
Fox look like always , a far right demagogic network with no desire to look on the real evidence of 9/11 .
They finished by attacking the messenger like always . "
Rodriguez continues , " Rosie did not get fired by mentioning me .
I canceled the appearance before Rosie decided to quit , due to my many efforts in Washington and nationwide . "
At her blog , O'Donnell heard from a reader on Fox 's reporting : " Fox says you left because of a video of you talking about wtc7 to the audience during a commercial break .
Um , you talked about that on air !
And you need to keep talking !
Perpetuate the conversation ! "
In response , O'Donnell blogged back in her usual style : " william rodriguez
my friend
google him
i didnt get fired for talking about him
he was a booked guest in fact "
At the end of his letter , Rodriguez , who serves as President of The Hispanic Victims Group ( and his personal website can be found at this link ) writes , " I am still working hard for the truth and Rosie is by my side . "
According to a recent report for the Energy Information Administration , natural gas users can expect to pay an average of $ 350 more this winter compared with last year , an increase of 48 percent .
And those who heat with oil will pay an estimated $ 378 , or 32 percent , more .
As a solution , the Alliance to Save Energy suggests energy efficiency , and the simplest place for consumers to start saving is at home .
The American Council for an Energy - Efficient Economy estimates that if each person increases the energy - efficiency in major appliances by 10 percent to 30 percent , it will release the demand for electricity by the equivalent of 25 large power plants .
Saving energy also saves money .
By using energy - efficient products , the average household can save up to $ 400 per year on utility bills .
Here are some ways to save energy at home : 1. Weatherize your home .
The gaps around the windows and doors in an average American house are the equivalent of a 3 - by - 3 foot hole in the wall .
Caulk and weatherstrip to seal off these air leaks .
This can save as much as 40 percent on your home 's heating and cooling costs .
Stop air from escaping under doors with " sweeps " or " shoes " attached to the bottom .
Use window putty to seal gaps around loose window panes .
Also , install foam gaskets behind all the light switches and electrical outlet covers .
They help seal the holes created when the outlets and light switches are built into homes .
Use child safety plugs to keep the cold air from coming in through the sockets .
2 . Get a programmable thermostat .
Programmable thermostats that have earned the Energy Star label help you save money and keep your home comfortable by automatically adjusting your temperature settings while you are asleep or away , saving you about $ 100 per year .
3. Consider zoning .
In a typical two - story home , the upstairs can be up to 10 degrees warmer than the downstairs .
One solution to help regulate uneven temperatures is a temperature control system that divides the house into separate zones , like those offered by Aprilaire .
These systems use multiple thermostats and dampers in the heating and cooling duct work that control temperature in separate areas to deliver conditioned air only to the part of the house that needs it .
4 .
Install a ceiling fan in the largest room of your house .
This will allow you to lower the setting on your air conditioner by 3 to 6 degrees , which will save up to 25 percent of energy costs of home cooling .
In addition , you can save over $ 125 annually by replacing three old - style light bulbs with modern fluorescent twisters ; setting your heat at 68 degrees in the winter and your air conditioner at 78 degrees in summer ; and unplugging three appliances - or switching off a power strip full of plugs - when not in use .

Friday night on Real Time , Bill Maher interviewed retired Army Major General Paul D. Eaton who was the original Commander in charge of training Iraqi troops .
Maher tries to get a laugh out of him but as you 'll see , Eaton is a straightforward man who does n't mince words -- if he says it , he means it .
He blames Donald Rumsfeld for the majority of the failures in Iraq ( including the current problems at Walter Reed ) , thanks God for the new Democratic majority and lays down some truth :

" We 've got this thing that so many military believe that Republican administrations are good for the military .
That is rarely the case .
And , we have to get a message through to every soldier , every family member , every friend of soldiers that the Republican party , the Republican dominated Congress has absolutely been the worst thing that 's happened to the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps . "
Bush has always contended that he " listens to the generals on the ground " , but we know that 's a lie .
It 's obvious that he ignores or fires anyone who does n't tell him what he wants to hear .
After listening to Eaton rip him and his administration to shreds , I can see why .
A few decades ago , the most popular science fiction epics were works like Isaac Asimov 's Foundation trilogy or Frank Herbert 's
Dune series — stories that were set thousands or even tens of thousands of years in the future but involved human beings more or less like us and societies more or less like our own , but with more advanced technology .
Today , by contrast , many of the genre 's top writers are unwilling to speculate more than 20 years ahead .
The acceleration of technological advance , they argue , has begun to make traditional visions of far - future humanity look increasingly myopic and parochial .
One increasingly popular vision of that rapidly accelerating progress is called the Technological Singularity ( or , sometimes , just the Singularity ) — a concept evoked not just in science fiction novels by the likes of Charles Stross and Bruce Sterling but in works of speculative nonfiction , such as the futurist Ray Kurzweil 's popular 2005 book The Singularity Is Near .
No name is linked more tightly to the idea of the Singularity than that of Vernor Vinge , 63 , who for four decades has written stories about the ways humanity and its technologies are building a future that may be impossible for us even to imagine .
" It seems plausible , " Vinge says , " that with technology we can , in the fairly near future , create or become creatures who surpass humans in every intellectual and creative dimension .
Events beyond such a singular event are as unimaginable to us as opera is to a flatworm . "
Vinge , who was also one of the first science fiction writers to conceive of cyberspace , formalized these ideas in an essay written for NASA in 1993 and published later that year in the Whole Earth Review .
The article noted several trends that together or separately might lead to the Singularity : artificial intelligence , which could lead to " computers that are ' awake ' and superhumanly intelligent " ; computer networks that achieve such intelligence ; human - computer interfaces that " become so intimate that users may reasonably be considered superhumanly intelligent " ; and biological improvements to the human intellect .
" Within thirty years , we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence , " Vinge predicted , adding somewhat ominously that " shortly after , the human era will be ended . "
A number of Vinge 's novels , including Marooned in Real­time ( 1986 ) and A Fire Upon the Deep ( 1992 ) , have dealt obliquely with the concept , typically by telling the stories of human beings who have escaped , one way or another , the Singularity 's explosive transformations .
But in his most recent book , last year 's Rainbows End ( just out in paperback from Tor ) , Vinge comes toe to toe with imminent change .
Humanity , within a couple of decades of the present day , is on the brink
of something transformational — or else on the brink of destruction — in large part because almost everyone is connected , usually via wearable computers , to tomorrow 's In- ternet .
The result is a struggle between those who would hobble our independence to make us safer and those who are willing to risk skirting the edge of destruction to see where the Singularity takes us .
It 's just the quality of speculation you 'd expect from an author whose previous novel , A Deepness in the Sky ( 1999 ) , won not only a Hugo Award but also a Prometheus Award for the best libertarian novel of the year .
Vinge is a mathematician and computer scientist as well as a novelist ; he is now retired from his faculty position at San Diego State University to a life of writing , lecturing , and consulting .
Contributing Editor Mike Godwin interviewed him , in part via email , in the weeks following his appearance last year as a guest of honor at the 16th annual Computers , Freedom & Privacy conference in Washington , D.C.
At that conference Vinge spoke about both the Singularity and a " convergence " of technological trends that threaten to drastically limit individual freedom .
Reason :
In your speech you foresaw efforts to build ubiquitous monitoring or government controls into our information technology .
What 's more , you suggested that this was n't deliberate — that the trend is happening regardless of , or in spite of , the conscious choices we 're making about our information technology .
Vernor Vinge : I see an implacable government interest here , and also the convergence of diverse nongovernmental interests — writers unions , Hollywood , " temperance " organizations of all flavors , all with their own stake in exploiting technology to make people " do the right thing . "
Reason :
Do you believe this pervasive monitoring and / or control might stall the Singularity ?
Vinge : I think that if the Singularity can happen , it will .
There are lots of very bad things that could happen in this century .
The Technological Singularity may be the most likely of the noncatastrophes .
Except for their power to blow up the world , I think governments would have a very hard time blocking the Singularity .
The possibility of governments perverting the Singularity is somewhat more plausible to me .
( Who wrote the story with the newspaper headline " Today Parliament Met and Abolished the People " ? )
In A Deepness in the Sky the Singularity did n't happen , but not because of governments .
On the other hand , A Deepness in the Sky showed how government could use technology to create a whole new level of tyranny .
But in my speech , I also wanted to raise the possibility that these abuses may turn out to be irrelevant .
There is a national interest , and not just in America , in providing the illusion of freedom for the millions of people who need to be happy and creative to make the economy go .
Those people are more diverse and distributed and resourceful and even coordinated than any government .
That 's a power we already have in free markets .
Computer networks , supporting data
and social networks , give this trend an enormous boost .
In the end that illusion of freedom may have to be more like the real thing than any society has ever achieved in the past , something that could satisfy a new kind of populism , a populism powered by deep knowledge , self - interest so broad as to reasonably be called tolerance , and an automatic , preternatural vigilance .
Reason :
It 's now more than 20 years after you first started writing about the Singularity and more than a dozen since you presented your ideas in a paper about it .
Are we still on track ?
Vinge : I think so .
In 1993 I said I 'd be surprised if the Technological Singularity happened before 2005 — I 'll stand by that !— or after 2030 .
It 's also possible the Singularity wo n't happen at all .
Reason :
What kinds of things might prevent the Singularity from happening ?
Vinge : First , physical disasters — the usual range of ugly , violent threats to civilization — could intervene .
I think the most likely existential threat is simply nuclear warfare between nation - states , most especially MAD [ mutual assured destruction ] strategy wars .
We are so distracted and ( properly ! ) terrified about nuclear terrorism these days that we tend to ignore the narrow passage of 1970 to 1990 , when tens of thousands of nukes might have been used in a span of days , perhaps without any conscious political trigger .
A return to MAD is very plausible , and when combined with the various likely natural hardships ( climate , fresh water issues ) , it 's a civilization killer .
Perhaps a human race killer .
If the nation - states do n't blow us all up ( and again , if there is no Singularity ) , then eventually terrorism becomes an existential threat , the reductio ad absurdum example being when technology puts the ability to devastate continents at the fingertips of anyone having a bad hair day .
A second possibility , less likely in my opinion , is that maybe it will turn out that whatever the hardware power of our new computers , we simply never figure out how to connect the parts .
In one form or another , I think this is where most thoughtful skepticism re­­sides .
Still less likely , but possible : Maybe we have drastically misestimated the raw hardware power of what we carry between our ears .
Hans Moravec had a very nice estimate of our " raw hardware power " back in 1990 in his book Mind Children .
His estimate puts us humans way ahead of contemporary machines ( and makes predictions of contemporary failures of A.I. [ artificial intelligence ] quite plausible ) .
On the other hand , his estimate , together with the possibility that Moore 's Law [ the observation that the computing power of new microprocessors doubles every 18 months to two years ] continues for a decade or two , makes it plausible that very interesting A.I. developments might occur before 2030 .
On the other hand , if one looks inside an individual neuron , one could argue that it is much more computationally competent than a microprocessor .
This is without invoking quantum or mystical hocus - pocus .
There was a researcher at the Thinking Machines meeting in 1992 who saw the possibility of computation taking place via the neuron 's microtubules .
Certainly if one looks at all the stuff going on inside any cell , there is very significant computation .
The question is , how much of that is needed to support the brain 's ensemble behavior ?
The high - end estimates of neuron computational competence could push the Moore 's Law crossover point significantly further into the future .
Reason :
What has changed since 1993 ?
What has turned out different or slower or faster than you expected ?
Vinge :
In the 1993 essay , I categorized approaches to the Singularity into four groups .
As time passes , some of these paths seem more likely than others , though that could change again and again , and the ultimate outcome will probably be some combination of approaches .
The most intriguing trend over the last few years has been the interactions between people , networks , computers , and databases , perhaps an ensemble critter very much like [ biophysicist and science writer ]
Gregory Stock 's " metaman " [ Stock 's name for a " superorganism " consisting of humanity plus its technology ] .
At the same time , we are at the beginning of an era where computer power and storage is plausibly comparable to that of some animals .
Before , this coming parity was simply a talking point .
But now , questions about awareness in machines — and in people — should be subject to new insights .
Thus , I 'd expect these sorts of discussions to become increasingly substantive .
Reason : I increasingly encounter the assumption that consciousness is going to emerge from the growth of processing power and networks .
Vinge : I do n't want to make the assumption that it would just naturally happen .
Mucho human genius will likely be necessary to " connect the parts " for the first time , even if the connections are simply the setup for intellectual growth .
However , hardware parity between humans and computers is at least a reason for being more optimistic about the possibility of success .
Reason :
Some philosophers have suggested that you need to have an actual body , with feelings , to have an emergent consciousness .
Is this view just meat - space parochialism ?
Vinge : Possibly .
But in fact , this has been a selling point for mobile - robot research .
Maybe emotions arise most naturally out of specializing broadly defined goals to threats and promises in the complexity of the real world .
Of course , this is not to imply that the computer itself must be in the mobile .
Reason :
You speculated about the Singularity in your novel Marooned in Realtime , the sequel to The Peace War ( 1984 ) .
Did it inform your writing of The Peace War as well ?
Vinge :
It 's informed most of my writing back to my short story " Bookworm , Run ! " [ 1965 ] , though I did n't use the term Singularity until a panel discussion at AAAI ' 82 [ the 1982 conference of the American Association of Artificial Intelligence ] .
In the case of The Peace War , I think it 's there , but far offstage .
Reason :
What are the sources of your vision of the Singularity ?
Vinge :
It 's a truism that science fiction is always about the present .
That is , the stories are simply a reflection of the concerns of the era in which they are written .
That 's a good insight , but imprecise : Science fiction is almost always a reflection of the author 's present .
Looking back , I see how I was immersed in stories that pointed in this direction , including stories by Olaf Stapledon , Poul Anderson , and John W. Campbell Jr. Entire generations of science fiction writers had enchanted me with visions of how different the future could be .
Many of these writers had speculated on the consequences of superintelligence .
The notion that those consequences might be in the near future was often missing , but by the time of my childhood it was obvious to anyone of overweening optimism .
When I was a 10 - year - old reading science fiction , there had already been essays by people like [ scientist and sociologist ] J.?D. Bernal and [ engineer and computing pioneer ] Vannevar Bush .
And through the late 1940s and 1950s there was [ statistics and probability theorist ]
I.?J. Good .
His 1965 paper ( which I did n't find until probably the 1990s ) " Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine " includes almost exactly the notion of the Technological Singularity , though without using that terminology .
Reason :
What is the role of science fiction in helping us cope with a transformation you believe many of us will live to see ?
Vinge : I think science fiction can have all the power of conventional literature , but with the added potential for providing us with vivid , emotionally grounded insights into the future and into alternative scenarios .
Speaking grandiosely , science fiction might be taken as having the role for humanity that sleep dreaming has for the individual .
Sleep dreams are mostly nonsense , but sometimes we wake up with the stark realization that we have underestimated a possibility or a goodness or a threat .
Reason :
Who are the most inspiring writers you 've been reading lately ?
Vinge :
In connection with these topics , David Brin , Greg Egan , Karl Schroeder , Bruce Sterling , Charles Stross — and I fear I am missing others .
In nonfiction , Ray Kurzweil and Hans Moravec .
Hans is awesome , a more radical explorer than just about any science fiction writer .
Reason :
You dedicate Rainbows End " to the Internet - based cognitive tools that are changing our lives — Wikipedia , Google , eBay , and the others of their kind , now and in the future . "
What 's the story behind this dedication ?
Vinge : I regard the current Internet as a test bed for the cognitive coordination of people and databases and computers .
Tools such as Google , eBay , and Wikipedia are — I hope — harbingers of much more spectacular developments .
Reason : I notice that people of every age group are now reflexively using search engines — not just to answer questions but to find people , form groups of like - minded folks , and so on .
It now feels like such a reflex that , on the rare occasions when I 'm not connected to the Internet , I feel sort of hobbled or cut off .
Vinge : Me too !
Reason :
In Marooned in Realtime and in Rainbows End you have couples that get together , break up , and then live long enough and change enough that they find each other again .
On one hand , that does n't seem itself too terribly science fictional , but on the other hand we used not to live long enough , most of us , for such change and rapprochement to happen .
It seems to me that learning how to live a long time is going to be a major task for us as individuals and as a society .
Vinge : Yes , and I hope it will be mainly a happy task !
Reason :
It seemed like an interesting metaphor about how other long - term relationships in our lives can change or go sour .
Vinge :
It would be interesting to see , if people could live in energetic good health for an additional few decades , how many would go back and undo mistakes that in past eras might only be the subject of pointless regret .
Reason :
There does n't seem to be much of a guarantee in your works , or in Kurzweil 's , that the Singularity is going to be very pleasant or happy - making .
Vinge : Speaking for myself , that 's true .
No guarantees .
But if the Singularity were in prospect for 1,000 years from now , I think that many , including the likes of Ben Franklin , would regard it as the meliorist outcome of all the human striving down the centuries .
It 's the possibility that it could happen in the next 20 years that 's scary !

Discuss this article online .
It is 30 years since the publication of a slim volume of articles and essays titled Small is Beautiful - a key text of the nascent environmental movement .
The year 1973 was a timely one for radical environmental thinking .
The first UN conference on sustainable development had been held the previous year , and soon after , within months of each other , Greenpeace , Friends of the Earth and the UK Green party were founded .
Small is Beautiful rapidly became a bestseller , and its author , EF Schumacher , was feted by international leaders and counterculture activists alike .
Today , Schumacher is less well known , but the ideas he popularised helped shape modern environmentalism , development theory and the global justice movement .
Equal parts economic analysis , spiritual tract and radical manifesto , the book reflected the contradictory nature of its author - a patrician academic who was also passionately interested in Eastern philosophy .
What bound his work was a central belief that modern society had lost touch with basic human needs and values - and in doing so had failed both the planet and its people .
In the name of profit and technological progress , Schumacher argued , modern economic policies had created rampant inefficiency , environmental degradation and dehumanising labour conditions .
" Ever bigger machines , entailing ever bigger concentrations of economic power and exerting ever greater violence against the environment , do not represent progress : they are a denial of wisdom .
Wisdom demands a new orientation of science and technology towards the organic , the gentle , the non-violent , the elegant and beautiful , " he wrote .
The remedy he proposed - a holistic approach to human society , which stressed small scale , localised solutions - flew in the face of economic orthodoxies of the time : " I have no doubt that it is possible to give a new direction to technological development , a direction that shall lead it back to the real needs of man , and that also means : to the actual size of man .
Man is small , and , therefore , small is beautiful . "
Western campaigners and governments in the developing world took up his arguments .
But today , amid the wholesale imposition of globalisation and free trade , Schumacher 's vision of self - sufficient local economies seems quaint and anachronistic .
So is small still beautiful ?
Born in Bonn in 1911 , Schumacher emigrated to England in 1936 .
He became a British citizen in 1946 and in 1950 became economic adviser to the National Coal Board .
For the next 20 years he worked at the heart of the British economic establishment , but visits to India and Burma led him to doubt technocratic certainties .
He concluded that the imposition of a Western model of development had bypassed the rural poor .
Industrialisation and megaprojects created vast wealth for a few , but left the masses trapped in spiritual and material poverty .
The antidote he called " Buddhist economics " - " a middle way between materialist heedlessness and traditionalist immobility " .
Instead of mass production and mechanisation , industry in the developing world should be on a " human scale " .
Cheap , locally developed solutions would be more effective than imported technologies and have less environmental impact .
In 1966 , Schumacher founded the Intermediate Technology Development Group ( ITDG ) , and his work inspired non-government organisations around the world .
Today the group supports hundreds of projects , from donkey plough workshops in Sudan to micro-hydroelectric schemes in Nepal , Sri Lanka and Peru .
But Small is Beautiful was never accepted by mainstream economists , who see it as an impractical model for development .
The Oxford economist Wilfred Beckerman published a riposte to Schumacher titled Small is Stupid .
Local management of resources has become commonplace in mainstream economics , but localisation and self - sufficiency are not always efficient or even practical , says Julian Morris , director of free - market think - tank the International Policy Network .
" Most of the people in the world who currently do n't have electricity would benefit from having it .
The important thing is to get them electricity in the most efficient and costeffective matter , and avoid pollution .
For that , we 're not talking about local solutions , but solutions that come from the economies of scale , " he says .
" It comes down to whether or not you believe in technological progress and growth , " says Philip Stott , professor emeritus in bio-geography at the University of London .
" I believe that technology and growth can fundamentally be equated with good . "
According to Stott , Schumacher 's followers idealise a primitive past while ignoring the benefits of scientific progress .
They risk condescension in their attitudes towards the developing world .
" There is an element of neo -colonialism - they are trying to regress parts of the world that should be progressing , " he says .
But science and technology have not improved basic living conditions for much of humanity , argues Cowan Coventry , chief executive of the ITDG .
" Given the dramatic [ scientific ] advances of the past 40 years , why is it that the number of people living in poverty continues to increase ?
Why do we find that 2 billion still do n't have access to electricity ? "
Schumacher 's followers may have failed to take up the wider implications of Small is Beautiful , says Coventry .
Despite the tight focus implied in the title , Schumacher proposed an overhaul of the way the global economy is run .
" People saw the beauty of local endeavour , but they never really grappled with the bigger issues of how to change macro policies . "
Meanwhile , the march of trade liberalisation threatens small - scale manufacture in developing countries , while small - scale agriculture is swamped by subsidised imports .
" We 're seeing the same economic model .
It 's business as usual , " says Spencer Fitzgibbon , a member of the Green party national executive .
Governments still place their faith in technological advances instead of considering economic re-organisation , he says .
Schumacher 's view of mechanisation finds its parallel in today 's debates over GM crops and nanotechnology .
Once again , hi-tech solutions are being boosted when their benefits are still unclear , argues Coventry .
" Extravagant claims are often made about new technologies and their benefits for developing countries .
We 're sceptical about those claims , especially when they 're made by corporate interests .
The big question is , can new technology bridge the divide between the haves and the have nots ? "
It is the same question that Schumacher put 30 years ago .
" Small is Beautiful is a book of many good ideas , and they are more and more relevant today , " says Satish Kumar , editor of Resurgence , where many of Schumacher 's essays first appeared .
" Schumacher was called a crank , and he quite happily agreed .
But what is a crank ?
It 's a small element in a machine that makes revolutions . "
