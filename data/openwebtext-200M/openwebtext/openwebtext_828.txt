The number of soldiers who committed suicide in January could reach 24 , a count that would be the highest monthly total since the Army began tabulating suicides in 1980 .
The latest Army figures , released Thursday , show seven confirmed suicides last month , with another 17 deaths still being investigated .
The Army has said the vast majority of suspicious deaths typically turn out to be suicide .
If confirmed , the suicide count for last month would exceed those killed in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan during the same period .
In January 2008 , five soldiers committed suicide .
“ Each of these losses is a personal tragedy that is felt throughout the Army family , ” said Gen. Peter Chiarelli , the vice chief of staff of the Army .
“ The trend and trajectory seen in January further heightens the seriousness and urgency that all of us must have in preventing suicides . ”
Sony PSP can be more interesting than funny sometimes .
Few people know about the potential of the PSP port of Stackless Python 2.5.2 .
This great port of python was done by Carlos E. and you can find more information about the progress of the port on his blog .
Well , I ’ve tested the Pyevolve GA framework on the Stackless Python for PSP and for my surprise , it worked without changing one single line of code on the framework due the fact of Pyevolve has been written in pure Python ( except the platform specific issue like the Interactive Mode , but this issue is automaticly disabled on unsupported platforms ) .
So now , we have Genetic Algorithms on PSP .
Follow some screenshots ( click to enlarge ) :
The GA running on the PSP screenshot is the minimization of the Sphere function .
Here is the steps to install Pyevolve on PSP :
PSP Stackless Python Installation
1 ) First , create a directory called “ python ” on your PSP under the “ / PSP / GAME ” and the directory structure “ / python / site - packages / ” on the root of your memory stick ( this last directory will be used to put Pyevolve later ) .
2 ) Copy the EBOOT .
PBP and the python.zip files to this created directory ;
Pyevolve Installation
3 ) Download the Pyevolve source and copy the directory called “ pyevolve ” to the created directory “ / python / site - packages / ” , the final directory structure will be : “ / python/site-packages / pyevolve ”
Ready !
Now you can import Pyevolve modules inside scripts on your PSP , of course you ca n’t use the graphical plotting tool or some DB Adapters of Pyevolve , but the GA Core it ’s working very well .
Here is some basic usage of PSP Stackless Python port .
I ’ve used the psp2d module to show the information on screen .
When I got more time , I ’ll port the visualization of the TSP problem to use the psp2d , it will be nice to see Traveling Salesperson Problem running with real - time visualization on PSP =)

Now that Barack Obama has been president for nearly two months , it is time for him to give a defining speech on climate change .
While Obama has spent most of his time on what the majority of Americans consider the most pressing issue — the economy — he has proven himself adept at juggling the economy with other vital issues .
A fact - based speech on climate change would accomplish several goals .
First , by using his unique position in the world , Barack Obama could directly impact the debate on climate change , which has spent far too many decades stuck in the scientific consensus vs. denialism and not discussing what should — and must — be done to address what the majority of scientists consider a clear and growing threat .
With his unique gift of explaining complicated issues clearly , President Obama needs to tell a confused and conflicted American public what climate change is , the threats it poses , and what should be done based on current scientific consensus .
This he can do with input from his excellent team of science advisors .
As well , the President must not ignore those who continue to doubt , but address how they are mistaken .
With clear and concise language the President can address where scientists see uncertainty in climate change predictions — and where they do n’t .
Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have risen sharply since the Industrial Revolution .

Global , Regional , and National CO2 Emissions .

For too long climate change has been ignored , belittled , or misunderstood by the American media which in turn has spread their ignorance to the American public .
Even as the evidence becomes clearer and more overwheliming , and the urgency grows , the American media still dithers .
For example , George Will of the Washington Post can still write an op - ed full of misinformation and cherry - picking on climate change that the Washington Post continually defends even after Will ’s ‘ facts ’ have been debunked time and again by the scientific community .
In the opposite direction the media sometimes will take a single outlying study and tout it as scientific consensus , providing denialists with ammunition to seize upon and say ‘ here , it ’s all a lie !’.
The one thing the media has avoided is sober analysis .
The continual spread of misinformation has its effect : a recent Gallup polll showed that more Americans than ever believe global warming is exaggerated .
With a clear and definitive speech , President Obama has the power to change the conversation on air , shame those media outlets that have remained willfully ignorant , and move America forward .
In his speech , Barack Obama would need to highlight how his stimulus plan will aid America in moving toward a more sustainable future and why congress must act soon with cap - and - trade legislation .
He can make his case as to why a cap - and - trade program is not choosing the environment over the economy , but how such legislation will be beneficial to both in the long run .
President Obama ’s speech would also send the clearest signal yet to the world that America is finished denying , stalling , and essentially doing nothing about climate change .
There is little question that such a speech would be welcomed worldwide , but more importantly it could have a large affect on negotiations in Copenhagen in December on a new global treaty against climate change — perhaps our last and best chance to truly tackle the issue .
Finally , President Obama should use his speech as a moment to reach out to Americans to make changes in their daily lives in order to contribute to the government ’s work in mitigating climate change .
Having proven himself a bold and popular president , who unlike most politicians , walk the walk : in less than two months he has passed a massive stimulus bill against opposition and doubt , banned torture , set new ethics rules on the executive branch , expanded health care for children , ordered new rules for car emission standards , and overturned a ban on stem cell research .
In addition to concrete actions President Obama has the unique capacity to inspire people to make changes and sacrifices in their own life .
He can give concrete examples of effective ways of curbing one ’s energy use and living a more sustainable life .
Obama needs to hand a portion of the power and responsibility over to the people of America for their own high - carbon lifestyles , while highlighting that Americans have risen to great and difficult tasks in the past , and we must do so again .
Barack Obama is a rare president with the ability to inspire millions to take action .
His special clout with my generation , those in their 20s and 30s , who see in him an embodiment of their own potential , is particularly important , since they will be the ones inheriting what the baby boomers have left behind .
By being up - front now both about the consequences of climate change and what can be done –by nations and individuals — to mitigate it , Barack Obama will be remembered for being the first American President to boldly lay before the American people the choices on the table .
His courage to do so , just seven weeks into his first term amidst a financial crisis , will not be forgotten .
Scientists are increasingly clear that large - scale action to reduce CO2 emissions can wait no longer .
Through stalling we have reached a crisis point that must be addressed for the wellbeing of ourselves , our children , and our grandchildren .
It is the President ’s responsibility to address the nation now and not pass on the task like his predecessors .

Should we trust DNA ?
The role of DNA testing in the justice system has seemed unassailable - who can argue with the odds of two people sharing the same genetic markers being , in some cases , as low as 1 in 113 billion ?
So DNA testing has been used to convict defendants in cases that are otherwise scant of evidence , and it's been used to spring prisoners who rotted in jail for decades for crimes that they said they did n't commit .
Now , it turns out that DNA might not be so reliable after all .
Seven years ago , a state crime lab analyst was running tests on Arizona 's DNA database when she found two felons - one white , one African - American - who had nine out of 13 matching loci .
According to the FBI , the odds of two unrelated people having a similar match was 1 in 113 billion .
The analyst found dozens of similar matches in the years to come , and eventually news of her discovery spread to defense lawyers and the courts , despite aggressive attempts by the FBI to block similar searches .
Considering how much we 've come to rely on DNA tests in the judicial system , the FBI 's resistance to allowing other expert scientists test the accuracy of their official statistics borders on criminal .
It 's also completely illogical .
The DNA system is n't under attack here - it's the numbers , and the way they 've been used , that are .
" It is n't that the DNA technology is problematic , " said David Faigman , the John F. Degardi Distinguished Professor of Law at UC Hastings School of Law .
" It 's that the explanation for what the DNA is doing that can be problematic .
It tells you something , but perhaps it does n't tell you everything that you want to know . "
Statistics of " one in a billion " can be misleading if you are searching through data banks with tens , hundreds of thousands , or even millions of people , Faigman explained .
Those kinds of data bank searches are usually used in cold cases - no suspect , no motive , and no witnesses .
" It 's an issue for the legal system , " Faigman said .
" Do you allow DNA hits in cold cases absent any other evidence ?
I would hope that there would be other evidence that 's solid if you 're going to get a conviction . "
Unfortunately , the FBI seems to think that the only way is its way .
The bureau has sought to discredit the analyst 's findings and urged state authorities to resist requests for similar searches .
FBI officials have even threatened to expel offending states from the national DNA database .
Their response is ridiculous and reprehensible .
People 's lives are at stake .
They must open their databases to outside scientists , and they must do it now .
Will the gold rush continue in 2009 ?
Gold bullion beat all other asset classes yet again in 2008 , the second year running and the third time since 2005 .
All that glistens : Demand for gold is once again on the up
A £ 1,000 investment in gold bullion on New Year 's Eve last year would now be worth more than £ 1,427 , according to new research from BullionVault , a gold dealer .
During the same period , the FTSE 100 index of the UK 's top firms has dived by almost one - third of its capitalisation , turning £ 1,000 into less than £ 689 .
Then there was residential property , which before tax , maintenance and mortgage costs has transformed every £ 1,000 invested in bricks - and - mortar into £ 870 , according to Nationwide figures .
For their part , cash Isas have added £ 46 in average interest payments , according to BullionVault , just outstripping retail price inflation of 3.7 % .
However , gold 's rise over the year has been largely dependent on the pound tumbling in value against the US dollar , the currency gold is priced in .
In dollar terms gold rose just 3 % in 2008 .
Longer term , the gold success story stands up .
The Footsie has plummeted by 36 % since its record peak of 6930 , on New Year 's Eve 1999 , while putting cash in a tax - free Isa has returned 52.5 % over the last nine years .
On the other hand , since the turn of the century , gold has risen by 246 % against Sterling , beating even residential property , up by 210 % on Nationwide data .
' Since Gordon Brown sold half the nation 's gold reserves at rock - bottom 10 years ago this May , ' says BullionVault's , Adrian Ash , ' gold bullion has been by far the best - performing asset class for British investors overall . '
With interest rates now crushed down to 1.5 % - their lowest level since the Bank of England was founded in 1694 , savings ' rates are becoming less and less attractive to many and confidence in stock markets has been battered .
One school of thought says that gold looks very attractive in 2009 - if for no other reason that the year looks bad for everything else .
Notably gold rose during the last bout of sharp deflation in the Great Depression of the 1930s when Roosevelt revalued gold by 60 % and devalued the dollar by 60 % , from $ 22 / oz to $ 35/oz .
What 's the outlook for 2009 ?
Communications giant Bloomberg conducted a Precious Metals Survey across 20 leading firms , to ascertain the outlook for gold and other metals in 2009 .
After hitting record highs in summer 2008 , gold pulled back in the second half of the year but was at an average of $ 872 an ounce last year .
There is a relatively wide disparity between the forecasts of the many participants and between the bulls and the bears .
There are more bulls than bears with only seven of the 20 participants calling for a lower average price in 2009 .
Most bearish are the online trading platform Finotec , bullion dealer Kitco and the bullion banks JP Morgan and Barclays .
They all forecast an average price of between 6.3 % and 11.8 % below the average in 2008 .
The most optimistic estimate is from Dallas Commodity Co. , which predicts a mean price of $ 1,200 per ounce .
The average amongst the 20 respondents is $ 910 .
UK and Ireland based , bullion dealer , Gold and Silver Investments , are the fourth most bullish on gold .
Mark O'Byrne , of Gold and Silver Investments , says : ' We believe our estimates to be conservative as the average price of gold in 2008 was some $ 872 / oz and thus an average price of some $ 1,020 is only some 20 % above the 2008 average price .
Similarly a high of $ 1,250 is only 21 % above the 2008 high . '
O'Byrne points out that many of the bears have been bearish for a number of years and have failed to realise that we are in a bull market for gold .
He adds : ' Given the deflationary headwinds assailing us early in 2009 , they may be proved right this year as further massive deleveraging could affect the gold price .
' We believe that should the deflationary pressures continue throughout 2009 , then most commodities and asset classes will again fall sharply in 2009 but gold will again outperform .
As gold did in 2008 when it was up 6 % in US dollar terms and by far more in most other currencies .
It promises to be a very uncertain and likely volatile year and it will be interesting to see how gold and silver actually perform . '
BullionVault 's
Ash adds : ' The only certainty about the gold price in 2009 will be volatility .
The financial crisis has seen daily swings in the gold price widen five times over for US - Dollar investors .
So whatever the longer - term price trend in 2009 , anyone making a gold investment should expect gut - wrenching moves on a daily basis .
But that does n't mean the 2009 gold price will cause more sleepless nights than owning stocks , bonds or currencies . '
Gold Supply
Supply is always an issue – it is commonly acknowledged that going into 2009 , gold mining supply worldwide has failed to grow during the seven - year bull market in gold – and failed badly .
Global gold mining output peaked in 2003 .
Even the record gold price of 2008 saw world supply fall .
In the third quarter of 2008 , the World Gold Council reported that supply was down by 9.7 % from the previous year .
As such many commentators do not believe the gold price can stay depressed given these fundamentals .
How to invest
Funds
Investing in shares carries greater risk and gold mining shares have fared worse than the gold price .
But Meera Patel , of Hargreaves Lansdown , an independent financial adviser , is optimistic for the fortunes of gold .
She says : ' What makes gold investing more attractive is through the shares of gold mining companies .
They have been marked down in the market falls and are currently on attractive valuations .
We would expect a good bounce from gold shares if they return to their historic average price compared to the gold price . '
A regular recommendation among advisers is the Blackrock Gold & General fund , previously known as Merrill Lynch Gold & General .
The fund which is managed by Graham Birch has been around for more than 20 years .
It invests primarily in the shares of gold mining companies .
Patel says : ' We believe the fund is well placed to benefit from a re-rating in the gold sector .
It also benefits from one of the most experienced teams in the industry .
But as with any specialist and high risk investment we believe investors should adopt a long term horizon . '
Purchase funds at This is Money 's fund supermarket
Another experienced manager in the sector is Ian Henderson , who manages the JP Morgan Natural Resources fund .
The portfolio invests in companies globally engaged in the production and marketing of commodities and currently has some 34 % of its assets in gold related investments .
Both the aforementioned funds endured a harsh time in 2008 but over the long term have very strong track records .
Over the past decade Blackrock Gold & General is up 635 % and JP Morgan Natural Resources fund has achieved growth of 406 % .
ETCs / ETFs
Another and popular route is via Exchange Traded Commodities .
Exchange Traded Commodities ( ETCs ) like Exchange Traded Funds , mirror the price of a single or indeed basket of commodities .
Like a tracker fund they are passive investments – they merely echo the direction of a the index or sector they are tracking .
Gold ETFs and ETCs are available from the Barclays ETF arm , Ishares , it offers the iShares Comex Gold Trust .
ETC specialist ETF
Securities has witnessed massive inflows into its gold offerings .
In the week ending January 2 2009 , investors bought nearly $ 35 m of physically backed gold ETCs bringing aggregate net inflows to levels 60 % above year - ago levels .
The group offers both physical gold funds – ETFS Physical Gold or you can track the spot price via Gold Bullion Securities or market funds .
It also allows investors to short or leverage their gold investments .
Bullion
The Mint has brought out a brand new UK sovereign issue for less than £ 50 but experts point out that such a coin , which weighs in at just under two grammes , has perhaps more of a novelty value rather than as a hard investment , simply because they have never been produced before .
Sandra Conway , managing director , of London based dealer ATS Bullion , admits that since the crunch began back in August 2007 , business has probably tripled .
At times the dealer has been besieged with queues .
She says : ' It has been very busy with huge demand and very limited supply .
The majority of people are looking for krugerrands and sovereigns but they have been buying bars too because of the shortage of coins . '
Some dealers believe sovereigns are worth paying a slight extra premium for , because of their more diminutive size and the historic and aesthetic values which act as a valuable bonus .
Sovereigns can benefit investors as they are smaller , more attractive , especially given their historic value , and are arguably better known coins than krugerrands .
As such experts tend to believe that it is worth paying a slight extra premium over and above krugerrands notes Lawrence Chard , of Chard , a specialist coin and bullion dealership .
The British Sovereign displays the Queen 's head and a horse and dragon and has the advantage of being exempt from Capital Gains Tax in the UK .
Other popular options are the Britannia , the Canadian Maple Leaf , the American Eagle or older British coins such as Georgian , Edwardian or Victorian coins .
Expect to pay just under £ 19,000 for a kilogramme bar of gold .
A krugerrand , weighing in at an ounce , costs £ 633 and a sovereign , which weighs just under eight grammes costs £ 150 .
But remember
Only do business with a reputable dealer .
Check on the World Gold Councils – ' Where to buy directory ' which can be found on its website at gold.org and the London Bullion Market Association members list which can also be located online at lbma.org.uk .
Both list reputable gold dealers .
And it is important to remember that you will also have to pay a fee to store gold with your bank or broker .
Death penalty may die for lack of funds Joe Byrne
Published : Saturday March 7 , 2009
Print This Email This
The death penalty is barely surviving , a report by the Chicago Tribune found today .
Struggling state budgets and the high cost of maintaining a capital punishment system are contributing to the lull in state - funded execution .
The recent political sea change may also have an impact on the future of the death penalty .
Most of the debate surrounding the death penalty has nothing to do with cost .
However , ignoring the expense of a drawn - out capital punishment trial has become dangerous for states with little extra cash .
Death penalty trials are more expensive for several reasons .
In most states , the law requires extra lawyers with strict experience requirements .
Appeals can last almost indefinitely .
Security costs are higher , and especially expensive procedures like DNA testing become justifiable when an inmate 's life is on the line .
And the inflexible price of state - run execution can fall heavily on small rural counties that are used to working on a smaller scale .
California has the largest death row in the nation , though only 13 people have been executed in 33 years .
With the state deficit at nearly $ 15 billion , some lawmakers from both parties are coming together to reduce resources for capital punishment .
The renovation of a $ 395 million death row prison may have its funding removed by a proposal from Jeff Denham and Jared Huffman , a Republican Senator and a Democrat Assemblyman .
" The death row expansion is a bottomless money pit , " Denham said in front of the aging prison .
There are other expenses incurred by the death penalty , as well .
Louisiana - where twice as many people have been executed since 1976 - has no money left for the Orleans Parish district attorney 's office .
Following the successful suit of a man freed from death row because of improper prosecutorial conduct , the district attorney was ordered to pay $ 15 m .
They are considering bankruptcy .
In an uncommon marriage between social liberalism and fiscal conservatism , eight of the remaining 36 states that allow the death penalty are considering its abolition .
A bill in the Colorado legislature proposes re-allocating death row money to help clear unsolved cases .
A budget deficit in Kansas has one Republican lawmaker encouraging abolition , as well .
Already , the number of death sentences and executions is falling .
A report by AP found that there were 111 death sentences passed nationwide in 2008 , compared to 284 in 1999 .
There were 37 executions in 2008 ; 98 in 1999 .
And if the death penalty really is going out of style , the outlook for those on death row is now only slightly less bleak .
Contrary to popular belief , life imprisonment is a much more affordable sentence for a court to pass .

Profiles The Anarchist Professor : Interview with Denis Rancourt
It ’s time for another Profile in Nonconformity .
In this series I look at people who are challenging authority and changing the world in unique ways .
***
The Professor in Handcuffs
How does a tenured , full professor lose his job ?
First , he throws out the grading system by deciding that every student gets an A +.
Next , he tells students to rebel by showing how they , collectively , have more power and authority than any of the administration .
Then , he gets arrested and taken away in handcuffs by the police just for showing up for a film club on campus .
Denis Rancourt is the professor , and I first read about him from the Globe and Mail , Toronto ’s largest newspaper .
I tracked him down in Ontario and he agreed to answer my questions – but he responded with the qualifier , “ Hope this does not overly frighten your readers . ”
Hmmm , what do you think … are you frightened ?
I did n’t think so – but be sure and read the notes at the end for a reminder about unconventional thinkers .
OK , here is the interview .
How is it possible to give every student an A +?
Do n’t we need some kind of evaluation system ?
You put “ A+ ” in the box where it says “ student grade . ”
It ’s quite easy .
And with that simple move , you remove the instrument of power and oppression in the classroom .
My job description says nothing about rank ordering students for employers or graduate school .
It says “ optimize education . ”
You talk about students accepting an inferior system out of the desire ( or need ) for a degree .
What can they do to change the system ?
Students have as much power as they want in the classroom .
They can impose whatever syllabus or grading system they want .
Try it and see .
If you are the only one in the class to openly challenge the professor ’s absolute control then you will also be the only one to get an education .
Better to learn freedom than to degrade yourself by obedience to an absurd order .
When you returned for the film session , were you expecting to be escorted off the campus in handcuffs ?
What was that experience like ?
No , I did not expect it .
I did not expect the administration to be so bold as to have dissidents arrested in an auditorium full of students and community members .
I did not expect the police state mentality to extend to white male professors .
My main reaction to being cuffed was noting how gentle and polite the police were compared to how I have seen them cuff and arrest students and community members on campus , always under direct orders from the upper administration .
I actually think they have special “ prof cuffs ” that do n’t cut and hurt your wrists .
I have seen what the regular cuffs do .
What is your vision of higher education ?
Liberation .
Independent thinking .
The present prison system of education is a concentration camp that first teaches obedience , followed by indoctrination at the graduate and professional levels .
Farber ’s essay from the 60s The Student as N — – is dead on in my book , only it has gotten much worse since the 60s , as explained in Churchill ’s essay Pacifism as Pathology .
If you are really an anarchist , what would you say to someone who argues that rules and social order are necessary in an institution like the academy ?
I agree .
Anarchists are not against order and organization , but they fight impositions of undemocratic structures .
Anarchy is not chaos .
Anarchists are against illegitimate and self - preserving power structures ( hierarchies ) .
What do you expect will happen next in your case ?
The present media debate will be stifled as soon as the other side senses that some people risk catching on , as soon as the Lie begins to be exposed .
***
Wrap Up
Many of us feel threatened by unconventional ideas .
Whenever I mention Ayn Rand , for example , several people always send me notes expressing their concern or disappointment in me .
My response is that you do n’t have to be afraid or threatened by controversial ideas .
If your belief structure is threatened by someone else ’s ideas , then it probably was n’t very strong to begin with .
If you still feel threatened by alternative ideas despite having a strong belief structure , then perhaps the alternative ideas contain more truth than you initially want to admit .
I ’ve got a few other features like this scheduled for the rest of the spring .
Among other things , we ’ll look at passive versus active resistance , objectivism , and the life of Malcolm X .
For now , the point is that we can learn a lot from people who are unconventional or controversial .
When a member of an elite group ( tenured professors ) appears willing to forfeit his position over the right to teach as he sees fit , I think he ’s worth paying attention to .
Speaking of Professor Rancourt
I ’d love to know what you think of Denis Rancourt ’s ideas .
If you have any additional questions for him , post them up and we ’ll see if we can get him to respond .
To track the status of his legal case against the University of Ottawa and watch a recent press conference with him , head to AcademicFreedom.ca .

How much do artists make from digital downloads at stores like iTunes ?
According to Eminem 's former producers , not much — perhaps as little as 12 percent of what the label receives , which itself is estimated to be only 70 percent of the purchase price ( Apple and other retailers keep the rest for running the digital storefronts ) .
F.B.T. Productions says that Eminem 's label , Universal , was paying out the contractually required 50 percent royalty rate on the revenue from licensing music " to others for their manufacture and sale of records or for any other use . "
But when the music was sold through digital download stores or as a mastertone , the label only paid a fraction of this amount .
That massive discrepancy has fueled F.B.T.'s lawsuit against the label ; the case finally went to trial last week after two years of preparation .
F.B.T. is made up of brothers Mark and Jeff Bass .
The pair lives in Michigan and did production work on some of Eminem 's early work ( Eminem is not a party to the current suit ) .
They complain that the 50 percent royalty rate should also have applied to the revenue from iTunes , Buy.com , Napster , Cingular , Sprint , and T - Mobile .
In 2007 , the Bass brothers filed a lawsuit after a series of letters and a hired accounting firm produced no additional payments from Universal .
" Defendants have failed to comply with the terms of the March 9 , 1998 agreement and the 2003 Agreement by failing to account and pay royalties equal to fifty percent ( 50 % ) of Defendants ' net receipts from the digital uses of the Eminem Masters by the Music Download Providers and Mastertone Providers , " says the complaint .
" Defendants apply an incorrect formula for calculating royalties with respect to those royalties to be paid to Plaintiffs which results in the payment of approximately twelve percent ( 12 % ) of receipts instead of the fifty percent ( 50 % ) required by the terms of the agreements . "
Actual damages are n't known but are believed to " exceed one million dollars . "
Universal 's response provides few details about its defense , but media reports shed some light on the case , which turns on the distinction between a " distribution " and a " license . "
While the distinction may sound merely semantic , the two terms are linked to vastly different royalty rates — in this case , a difference of just over 4 x .
What appears to be at issue is whether Universal is simply " distributing " the music to iTunes in the same way that it distributes the CDs it presses to stores like Wal - Mart .
Such distributions tend to have a low royalty rate for artists .
But when major labels " license " the music to some other entity , they split the extra revenue 50/50 with most artists .
So the question really turns to just how much like a regular music store digital retailers are .
At least one distinction might be drawn between the two in terms of the mechanics of distribution .
Universal actually ships discs to Wal - Mart ; Wal - Mart does n't get one copy and replicate ( and distribute ) millions of its own copies .
But iTunes and other stores do , possibly making them more like a " licensee " that does its own distributing .
While artists today are generally savvy about the potential of Internet distribution services and take pains to nail down the details in their contracts , older contracts — even from four or five years ago — could be less clear about how revenue from services like iTunes should be split .
Should F.B.T. win the current case , it could open the doors for many acts to try squeezing their labels a bit harder over digital distribution royalties .

The notion of online verification is certainly nothing new , though it is also not for everyone .
Many users prefer the anonymity of the Web for any number of ( sometimes nefarious ) reasons .
For others , a centralized login and identity management resource is an ideal solution for the modern times , and these kinds of systems are blossoming .
OpenID itself is experiencing broad adoption by the �largest �players �in�technology �and �the Web , though consumers have �not been as quick to hop on board .
Facebook Connect has taken off as both a single sign - on launchpad and activity syndication mechanism , but the newly launched , London - based �MyID.is�may be the first to tackle the challenge of tying our Web personas with our real world identities .
MyID.is ' approach is simple , though it takes some time to get set up .
The company is an OpenID provider , and it adds a key element of real world ID verification by charging a small , random setup fee ( between � 2 and � 5 ) to your credit card , then mailing a code to your home address .
Much like PayPal 's account creation process , you must enter the fee amount and snail mail code on MyID.is ' website , and the name on your card must match the name you registered with .
After you successfully enter all this information , you 'll have a MyID .
is - provided OpenID URL and identity with which to badge your blog ( pictured above ) , forum comments , Facebook profile , and just about any other online activity to prove that the content you generate is really coming from you .
Ars asked Charles Nou�rit , founder and CEO of MyID .is , whether this kind of service should be coming from the world 's governments instead of the private sector .
After all , our governments provide our identification in real life , why not on the Web ?
" Yes , the governments should do this , " Nou�rit replied , " but attempts so far have failed .
Some countries have tried to get such a system off the ground , but governments can never agree on a standard .
I do n't see it happening for another 15 years . "
For now , MyID .is plans to make money through the initial setup fees it charges .
Nou�rit has worked on the company for two years , and it just emerged from an eight month private beta run , so there is plenty of room for growth .
Nou�rit says his company will never charge users again to keep or maintain their ID .
Premium features will be introduced down the road that add more value , like secure , verified e-mail , or perhaps faxing , for a fee .
Allowing users to publish content through MyID .is ( certified , of course ) to social media services is still in the works , as are the single sign - on tools .
Soon , the company will be a one - stop hub for verifying one 's activity online and actually generating that content .
We may not be on the verge of a brave new world where everyone 's forum handle can be verifiably pinned to a real world face and name , but MyID.is ' evolution of the ID management movement shows that there is interest in being able to prove you are who you say you are online .

European donors are moving towards increasing direct budget support to governments of aid - receiving countries .
Leading the charge is the UK , which gives the largest percentage of direct budget support of any bilateral or multilateral donor ( although the World Bank , the European Commission , the US and France also give substantial budget support ) .
Giving cash directly to host country governments for use in the general budget for public spending has a number of advantages .
The donors say it gives recipient governments more predictability , and more control over the aid resources being funneled in .
Rather than serving a plethora of masters in the international donor community , funds given as budget support can be corralled by the host government and spent coherently according to host government priorities , while building government capacity to do what everyone wants governments to do for themselves in the long run : competently manage their own affairs .
The aid jargon for this is “ country ownership . ”
So how is this working out in practice ?
In 2007 , the UK gave 20 percent of their total bilateral ODA in the form of budget support to 13 countries : Tanzania , Ethiopia , Pakistan , Ghana , Uganda , Mozambique , Vietnam , Malawi , Zambia , India , Sierra Leone , Nepal , and Nicaragua . ( Source )
Of this list , only Ghana and India were classified as “ free ” by the annual Freedom House ratings on democracy ( according to either the 2007 or 2008 rating ) .
For the 11 other countries that did get British budget support , how much is there “ country ownership ” when the government is not democratically accountable to the “ country ” ?
Moreover , Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) accused some of these governments of serious human rights violations .
Ethiopia ’s autocratic government , which is inexplicably the largest recipient of UK budget support in Africa , won 99 % of the vote in the last “ election . ”
The government army is accused by HRW of war crimes in the Somali region of Ethiopia .
Nor is this brand new — neither army officers nor civilian officials have been “ held accountable for crimes against humanity that ENDF ( Ethiopian National Defense Force ) forces carried out against ethnic Anuak communities during a counterinsurgency campaign in Gambella region in late 2003 and 2004 . ”
HRW also notes that today : “ Credible reports indicate that vital food aid to the drought - affected [ Somali ] region has been diverted and misused as a weapon to starve out rebel - held areas . ”
Ironically , Ethiopia ’s autocratic ruler , Meles Zenawi , was the Africa representative at the recent G - 20 meeting campaigning for more aid to Africa during the current crisis , because , among other reasons , Meles said “ people who were getting some food would cease to get it and … would die ” ( from an article in Wednesday ’s Financial Times . )
As for Vietnam , HRW reports : “ In March 2008 police arrested Bui Kim Thanh , an activist who defended victims of land confiscation and involuntarily committed her to a mental hospital for the second time in two years .
…
In October a Hanoi court sentenced reporters Nguyen Viet Chien of Young People ( Thanh Nien ) newspaper to two years in prison and Nguyen Van Hai from Youth ( Tuoi Tre ) to two years ’ “ re-education ” for having exposed a major corruption scandal in 2005 ….. ”
Oh yes , and let ’s consider corruption , which may affect whether aid to governments translates into aid to poor people .
Another country on the UK budget support list , Malawi , had received $ 148 million in budget support from its donors from 2000 to 2004 .
It ended those four years with poorer government capacity and greater fiscal instability than it began them , according to one evaluation .
Also during those four years , the Malawian president was accused of awarding fraudulent contracts , and government officials achieved new lows when they sold off all 160,000 tons of the country ’s grain reserves for personal profit .
In the ensuing famine , provoked by drought and floods but made worse by the loss of the grain reserves , the government had to borrow an additional $ 28 million to feed its starving people .
Yet Malawi continues to receive British budget support today .
Elsewhere on the corruption front , British aid continues to give direct transfers to the Sierra Leonean government even though its own 2006 report found that previous support to the “ Anti-Corruption Commission ” had “ made no progress on the overall goal of reducing corruption , had made no impact on reducing real or perceived levels of corruption , had suffered a fall in institutional capacity since the previous year . ”
( Quote from a 2008 Transparency International report ) .
Sierra Leone is ranked the 158th worst country in the world on corruption ( where the worst ranking is 180th ) .
Of course , low income countries have lower ratings on democracy , human rights , and corruption than richer countries , so poverty - alleviation aid has to face the tricky tradeoff of directing aid to the poorest countries while trying to avoid the most corrupt and autocratic ones .
Unfortunately , a recent article found that the UK was one of the best ( least bad ) official aid agencies in doing this , so most of the others are apparently even worse .
This study did not consider the issue of direct budget support .
There is nothing that says you have to give aid meant for the poorest peoples directly to their governments , if the latter are tyrannical and corrupt .
With the examples above , which side are UK aid officials on , on the side of poor people or on the side of the governments that oppress them ?
The former tax specialist who ran the high - priced prostitution service that the authorities say was patronized by former Gov. Eliot Spitzer , was sentenced Friday to two and a half years in prison on prostitution and money - laundering conspiracy charges .
The man , Mark Brener , 63 , apologized and both he and his lawyer asked for leniency , but the judge , Denny Chin of Federal District Court in Manhattan , said he was not moved by their pleas , particularly by the lawyer ’s suggestion that the crime had had no victims .
“ I certainly do n’t believe that prostitution is a victimless crime , ” Judge Chin said .
“ It may go on all the time and be the world ’s second oldest profession .
It ’s certainly my view that a number of people are significantly hurt by this . ”
Prosecutors had charged that Mr. Brener was the organizer of the ring , Emperors Club V.I.P. , which the government said generated enormous profits , which were then laundered using a set of bank accounts opened in the names of fictitious businesses .
“ Brener ’s conduct warrants substantial punishment , ” Daniel L. Stein , an assistant United States attorney told the judge in court papers .
In seeking leniency , Mr. Brener ’s lawyer , Murray Richman , said in court that his client had already spent 11 months in prison and was not a threat to the community .
“ It ’s his responsibility , and he takes full responsibility , ” Mr. Richman said .
When asked if he wanted to address the court , Mr. Brener stood and took a few moments to compose himself , appearing to choke away tears .
Citing his time in jail , he said , “ I have used this time away from my family and society to learn from my mistakes . ”
“ As a man of my age , ” he added , “ I know now that I do not have any more time to waste , and I will not violate the law again . ”
Mr. Brener pleaded guilty last June , and both sides agreed as part of the deal that a sentence of two to two and a half years would be reasonable , and prosecutors asked the judge to stay within that range .
In court papers , Mr. Richman asked the judge to impose “ time served , ” which would have been a term of nearly 11 months .
Mr. Spitzer resigned last March 12 , two days after his involvement with the ring was disclosed .
He was not charged .
Abstract Despite the abundance of evidence that human perception is penetrated by beliefs and expectations , scientific research so far has entirely neglected the possible impact of religious background on attention .
Here we show that Dutch Calvinists and atheists , brought up in the same country and culture and controlled for race , intelligence , sex , and age , differ with respect to the way they attend to and process the global and local features of complex visual stimuli : Calvinists attend less to global aspects of perceived events , which fits with the idea that people 's attentional processing style reflects possible biases rewarded by their religious belief system .

Introduction Perceiving our world is an active process .
We do not passively register the objects and events we encounter but explore and investigate them , attend to features and characteristics we find interesting and ignore those that we do not .
As emphasized by the New Look perspective to human perception [ 1 ] , this suggests that our perception and attention reflect our moods , needs , expectations , and beliefs .
Recent research has extended the list of possible factors to culture .
Increasing evidence suggests , for instance , that people growing up in the North American culture are less sensitive to contextual cues and show a more analytic cognitive style ( i.e. , they pay more attention to local features of objects and events ) than people growing up in an Asian culture , who exhibit a more holistic style [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
Holistic and analytic processing styles can be induced even within the same population by having people work through tasks that draw attention to either personal interdependence ( e.g. , by instructing participants to circle all relational pronouns , such as “ we ” , “ our ” , or “ us ” , in a text ) or independence ( by having them to circle pronouns referring to the self independent of others , such as “ I ” , “ my ” , or “ me ” ) [ 4 ] .
Recent electrophysiological evidence suggests that culturally or experimentally induced attention to the global context versus local detail affects the processing of visual features rather early in the processing stream .
In particular , marking independent pronouns yields an enlarged P1 amplitude to local than global targets in a global - local task ( [ 5 ] ; see below ) at lateral occipital electrodes ( i.e. , in the visual cortex ) , while marking interdependent pronouns has the opposite effect [ 6 ] .
However , research so far has completely ignored the influence of religion on attentional processing .
Given that culture is commonly defined as a system of shared beliefs , values , customs , behaviors , and artifacts , this blind spot is surprising .
It is even more surprising if one considers the recent history of increasingly dramatic international and societal conflicts based on apparent incompatibilities between the religious beliefs of social groups and nations and the behavioral implications thereof .
If the perception of events would be modulated not only by upbringing and culture but also , or perhaps even mainly , by religious factors , it would seem particularly important to study how they affect perception .
Here , we provide evidence that religious belief may systematically bias visual attention .
We investigated whether Calvinists and atheists , brought up in the same country and culture ( the Netherlands ) , differ with respect to the way they attend to and process global and local features of visual stimuli .
Cultural ( and , possibly , other ) differences in perceptual processing and attentional emphasis are assumed to be produced by social practice [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] that provides selective reward for attending to particular stimulus features and adopting particular attentional control settings [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
We speculate that practicing a religion and being exposed to particular religious practices may lead , among other things , to a chronic bias towards particular attentional control parameters .
In particular , our study was inspired by the Dutch neo-Calvinism concept of sphere sovereignty , which emphasizes that each sphere or sector of society has its own responsibilities and authorities , and stands equal to other spheres [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
If Dutch Calvinists , as compared to Dutch atheists , have been rewarded more for adopting a processing style that emphasizes a rather independent view of the self , this would be likely to induce an attentional set that facilitates the processing of the local details [ 6 ] .
If so , this should affect performance on the global - local task developed by Navon [ 5 ] , which indexes how fast people can process global and local characteristics of hierarchically constructed visual stimuli ( e.g. , larger letters made of smaller letters ) .
Typically , this task gives rise to the “ global precedence ” effect , which means that global features can be processed faster than local features .
According to our reasoning , Calvinists as compared to atheists might show a less pronounced , if any , global precedence effect [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
Results
The square root of error percentages and median reaction times were analyzed by means of analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) using Target Level ( global vs. local ) as within- and Group ( Calvinists vs. Atheists ) as between - participants factor .
The reaction time analysis showed a main effect of Target Level , F( 1,38 ) = 215.32 , p = .0003 , MSE = 544.632 , η 2 p = 0.85 , which was modified by Group , F ( 1,38 ) = 8.34 , p = .006 , MSE = 544.632 , η 2 p = 0.18 .
The main effect indicated global precedence [ 5 ] : Global targets were responded to faster than local targets .
However , as expected , the size of this effect varied with Group : Calvinists showed a smaller , but still significant , F ( 1,19 ) = 147.69 , p = .0002 , MSE = 256.092 , η 2 p = 0.88 , global precedence effect than Atheists ( see Table 1 ) .
Error percentages did not reveal any reliable effect , F's ( 1 , 30 ) < 1 . PPT PowerPoint slide

We further tested whether Age and IQ contributed to the effect on the global precedence .
An ANOVA with group as independent variable and age and IQ as covariates indicated no such contribution : the effects of the covariates were far form significant , for both F < 1 , and the Group effect remained clearly reliable , F ( 1,36 ) = 7.73 , p = .009 , MSE = 541.697 , η 2 p = 0.18 .
Discussion
This outcome suggests that religious belief biases the way people attend to and process visual events : Calvinists showed a less pronounced global precedence effect than atheists , indicating that practicing this religion might lead one to attend to more local aspects .
True , given the correlational nature of our observation we cannot exclude the possibility that Calvinism is more attractive for people with a more local attentional bias .
However , people commonly join religious groups before such biases become obvious ( often by birth , following family traditions ) , which seems to undermine this possibility .
As our groups were matched for sex , IQ , age , educational style and socio- economic situation we can rule out an account of our results in these terms .
Particularly important was the matching of the age range and educational style .
Developmental studies indicated that the global precedence effect is unrelated to general intelligence but changes with age [ 11 ] .
According to our approach , social experience and procedures ( in our case religion ) , and the selective reward they provide , can induce the emphasis on and higher weighting [ 12 ] of socially relevant perceptual features and characteristics of processed events .
We speculate that exercising a religion and being exposed to particular religious practices may lead , among other things , to a chronic bias towards particular attentional control parameters .
The sphere sovereignty principle underlying Dutch neo-Calvinism has led to a rigorous “ pillarization ” ( segregation ) of Dutch society and established the idea that , in a nutshell , everyone should “ mind his or her own business ” — which among other things inspired a rather liberal policy regarding drug use , abortion , or euthanasia .
Calvinists may have learned since early age to focus on local rather than global dimensions , at least as compared to people not sharing their religious practices .
In general , we suggest that peoples ' attentional processing style reflects possible biases rewarded by their religious belief .
Another possibility is that our results reflect a more general difference between believers and non-believers .
Being a believer ( totally and / or strongly focusing on one religion ) , as in the case of our Calvinists , might as such lead to a less pronounced global precedence effect .
Even though this possibility would still be consistent with our approach , further research is necessary to get a deeper insight into the responsible processing mechanisms .
In the Netherlands it is very difficult to find other comparable religious group to match without losing purity of culture .
Most Dutch Catholics ( the only other religious community with a sizeable membership ) live in Limburg ( at the border to Germany ) and Brabant ( at the border to Belgium ) .
Given the proximity to these other countries and the resulting mix of inhabitants ( many Dutch actually live in Germany and Belgium , and many Germans and Belgians live in the Netherlands ) it is hard to find a sizeable sample of Catholics not being exposed to another culture on an everyday basis .
We therefore plan to investigate religious belief systems outside the Netherlands , including Orthodox Judaism , which emphasizes social solidarity — a condition that might lead to an increase of the global precedence effect .
In sum , given that real - life objects and events are commonly complex and hierarchically structured , so that their perceptual organization and semantic interpretation often hinges on the aspect or level an observer attends to , it seems possible that religious beliefs may indeed lead to different and sometimes discrepant and incompatible interpretations of the same incident .
That this can happen is a well - known empirical fact but that it can originate in basic automatic visual operations that precede conscious representation is surprising and in some sense worrying — as it seems to work against the scientific ideal that careful observation is sufficient to reach agreements about basic facts and what we consider reality .
Our findings are consistent with the New Look on perception [ 1 ] in confirming that perceptual processes can be affected by the cognitive states of the observer .
To some degree they challenge , however , previous claims that culture has an important impact on perception .
Even though our findings do not rule out this possibility , they show that religion makes a difference even if culture is controlled for .
Given that previous reports on culture - related differences did not control for religion [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , it is possible that religious differences are sufficient to account for the available evidence .
Materials and Methods Participants
We tested 40 young healthy adults ( all students from Leiden University , Institute for Psychological Research ) , who participated for partial fulfillment of course credit or a financial reward .
They constituted two experimental groups : Calvinists ( all members of the Calvinistic corps of Leiden University ) and Atheists .
All participants were matched for race ( 100 % Caucasian ) , Culture ( 100 % Dutch ) , age , sex , and IQ ( measured by Raven 's Standard Progressive Matrices ) — see Table 1 for demographic data and religious behavior .
All Calvinists and Atheists were educated in The Netherlands following the same educational style and institution type ( VWO ) , and reported similar social - economical background .
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants after the nature of the study was explained to them ; the protocol was approved by the institutional review board ( Leiden University , Institute for Psychological Research ) , which approved the remuneration arrangements of 10 Euro .
Apparatus and stimuli Responses were made by pressing the “ Z ” or “ ? ” of the QWERTY computer keyboard with the left and right index finger , respectively .
The target stimuli were adopted from Huizinga , Dolan and van der Molen [ 11 ] , and consisted of geometric figures .
Larger ( global ) rectangles / squares consisted of smaller ( local ) rectangles or squares .
Global stimuli ( i.e. , squares or rectangles ; 93×93 pixels or 93×189 pixels respectively ) were composed of many smaller “ local ” stimuli ( i.e. , squares or rectangles ; 21×21 pixels or 8×46 pixels respectively ) .
The space between the local elements of a stimulus was 3 pixels .
A global square consisted of 16 small squares or 8 small rectangles ; a global rectangle consisted of 32 small squares or 16 small rectangles .
Procedure and design
All participants were tested individually and completed the intelligence test and the Local - Global Task .
Individual IQ was determined by means of a 30 - min reasoning - based intelligence test ( Raven 's Standard Progressive Matrices : SPM [ 13 ] ) .
Each item of this test consists of a pattern or sequence of a diagrammatic puzzle with one piece missing .
The task is to complete the pattern or sequence by choosing the correct missing piece from a list of options .
The items are getting more difficult as the test taker proceeds through the test .
The SPM assesses the individual 's ability to create perceptual relations and to reason by analogy independent of language and formal schooling ; it is a standard , widely - used test to measure Spearman 's g factor and fluid intelligence in particular .
In the Local - Global Task ( cf. , [ 11 ] ) , participants responded to randomly presented rectangles or squares by pressing a left or right response button , respectively .
Larger ( global ) rectangles / squares consisted of smaller ( local ) rectangles or squares .
Participants responded to the local figure in one block and to the global figure in another ( blocks 1 and 2 , in randomized order ; 30 practice trials and 100 experimental trials per block ) .
A cue indicated to which dimension ( global or local ) the participants should respond .
Cues that signalled the global ( local ) dimension consisted of a big ( small ) square , presented at one side of the target stimulus , and a big ( small ) rectangle , presented at the other side of the target stimulus .
The color of cues and target was red .
They remained on the screen until a response was given .
Participants had 3500 ms to respond .
The time interval between presentation of the cue and of the target stimulus was 500 ms .
The interval between the response and the presentation of the cue was fixed at 1000 ms .
The main dependent variable was the median response latency to local and global targets .

Now I ’d like to ask you a question … why did you go through all the necessary medical training if you believe that prayer can heal people ?
If you believe in prayer , why do you have insurance ?
If you believe in prayer , why do you invest ?
If you believe in prayer , why do you have a burglar alarm ?
If you believe in prayer , why do you see a doctor ?
When someone claims that prayer works , the first thing we should ask is what the speaker means by " works " in this context .
If I say that prayer works because engaging in prayer makes me feel better , I may be right to claim that it works .
Of course , this is not usually what the religious claim .
They want to posit something supernatural in between the prayer and my feeling better .
They want to claim that their god(s ) intervened in some manner .
They are also rarely content to limit the efficacy of prayer to making someone feel temporarily better .
But does even the most devout religious person really believe that their prayers bring about divine intervention ?
Their behavior often suggests otherwise .
Unreasonable Faith ( a blog that closed in 2014 ) used a recent comment in which the central question was framed for a nurse : I have blogged about this many times before , as has nearly every other atheist blogger with whom I am familiar .
Still , I continue to find it a fascinating question .
Maybe that is because I have yet to hear a religious person answer it sufficiently .
( None of the following are sufficient answers : " God works in mysterious ways , " " God helps those who help themselves , " or " I do n't claim to know the mind of god . "
Meaningless cliches ?
Yes .
Sufficient responses ?
No ) .
The question can be phrased a variety of ways :
The crux of the question is simple :
If you truly believe that prayer works - works in the sense that your god intervenes in your life - why do you not behave as if you believed that it works ?
If " prayer works " means nothing other than the act of praying makes me feel better , I do not disagree .
But if it means anything more than that , then those advocating the wonders of prayer should have no need for the reality - based alternatives to which they cling .
And if it does not always work , work completely , or only works on the small matters , then what does this say about your god ?
We 're soon to be told , officially , what guidance is given to British intelligence agents when they 're questioning detainees held abroad .
Are they advised , if there 's any unpleasantness afoot , to leave the room ?
To shut their eyes tight and cover their ears ?
To report malfeasance to the nearest police station or passing UN human rights ' rapporteur ?
It 's the latest twist in the extraordinarily tangled tale of America 's War on Terror , torture , and the secret " rendition " of prisoners from country to country by the CIA .
Immediately on taking office , Barack Obama was ostensibly able to start wiping clean the slate .
As the head of a new administration , the president could deny responsibility for what had gone before .
Gordon Brown , lumped with Tony Blair 's legacy and own part in it , has no such advantage .
Which brings us back to the the case of Binyam Mohamed , late of Guantanamo Bay and various hell hole prison cells in Afghanistan , Pakistan and , Morocco .
Binyam is in many ways the personification of the War on Terror and all its ambiguities .
He is both an alleged perpetrator and a victim .
He was supposedly bent on destroying Western democracy yet the west denied him civil , legal and democratic rights and then allegedly did far worse , putting him to torture .
Binyam was arrested at Karachi airport trying to leave Pakistan with a false passport in April 2002 , having fled from Afghanistan and the American invasion .
He says he'd gone to Afghanistan pre 9/11 to get off drugs and investigate Islam .
While such a claim may be met with scepticism it remains wholly plausible : many ardent converts will turn to religion after struggling with an addiction or personal trauma .
It is likely , however , that it will have been a radical and fundamentalist Islam that Binyam was following up : Afghanistan was under the iron rule of the Taliban .
So Binyam 's contacts in the UK , where he'd first found God , would have been of considerable interest to MI5 .
At this time - early 2002 - the shoe bomber , Londoner Richard Reid ( former drug addict and recent convert to hard line Islam ) , had just been prevented from blowing up a Transatlantic airliner .
Where things get sticky for the British government - the current British government - is when Binyam is detained in Pakistan , under CIA control , and is interviewed by an MI5 officer .
The officer , we know from various telegrams and reports revealed on Newsnight , warns Binyam to cooperate with his captors if he knows what 's good for him .
On May 17 2002 the officer reported as much back to London .
During this period , Binyam says , he was regularly being strapped to the ceiling by Pakistani interrogators .
He suggests the MI5 agent must have been aware of this treatment .
Later , we now know , Binyam was spirited away to Morocco .
It 's here , he says , over eighteen months the torture intensified while he was asked questions supplied to the CIA by MI5 .
The information ranged from the identity and nature of his kick boxing instructor in North Kensington to his exam results ; he was also shown " hundreds and hundreds " of photographs of Muslim men based in the UK and asked who he recognised and what he knew of them .
Complicity ?
This information , Binyam and his lawyers believe , can only have been provided by the UK with the implication that Britain was at the very least complicit in Binyam 's treatment .
And we know MI5 was aware he had been " disappeared " by the CIA because on October 25 , 2002 at MI5 headquarters in Thames House , London , they asked the Americans where Binyam had been taken and were told in effect to mind their own business .
British officials , apparently having decided they could do no more to locate Binyam Mohamed and ask him questions directly , then asked the CIA to put some further questions on their behalf .
They continued to provide information for their U.S. colleagues to put to Binyam - wherever he was and under whatever conditions he was being held - over the following weeks .
Does this make Britain complicit in Binyam Mohamed 's treatment ?
Does it suggest they 've colluded in torture ?
For all their bluster about opposing torture and rendition , no minister has so far denied complicity .
This may be significant .
Meanwhile Gordon Brown , saying he wants to restore public faith in the security services , has asked the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee to help draw up new guidelines on interrogation " in order to have systems that are robust " .
The Commons Intelligence and Security Committee , you may note , are appointed by and report directly to the Prime Minister and are frequently criticised for their secrecy and refusal to discuss their work .
Earlier this year High Court judges suggested the committee had been misled by intelligence chiefs over Binyam Mohamed and that they should reopen their investigation into his case .
Now the committee has announced it has taken the judges ' advice .
Barack Obama has announced the end of the War on Terror , an abstract noun that was as inane as it was counter - productive .
No more the concept of " enemy combatants " or " enhanced interrogation techniques " .
The fall out , however , will be with us for a long while yet .
Prosecutors have just brought federal charges of fraud and money laundering against Nicholas Arthur Woodhams of Kalamazoo , Mich .
You may remember Woodhams as the man who scammed Apple out of numerous iPod shuffles , a plot that got him sued by the company in June 2008 .
Here 's how the scheme worked : Between March 2006 and October 2007 , Woodhams guessed valid , serial numbers of iPod shuffles that were under warranty and have Apple send him replacement products .
Then those would be sold for $ 49 each — that 's $ 30 less than the then - price of $ 79 .
However , because Apple 's return policy requires that defective units be returned within a certain period , Woodhams came up with a scheme to use prepaid VISA gift cards and a UPS store mailbox to get around that pesky detail .
That way , instead of having Apple charge him for the replacement iPods , these VISA cards would reject that charge .
Apparently Woodhams got away with acquring over 9,000 iPods using this method .
It 's a clever enough ploy — if only he'd used his powers for good .
Maybe Apple should hire him and help show him the error of his ways .
When Kate and I were in Vermont last summer , we stumbled upon a book called Hill ’s Manual of Social and Business Forms .
It was published in 1880 .
The book is a hodgepodge of information that would be useful to a man of business back in the late 19th century .
There are sections dedicated to penmanship , business letter writing , and the dos and don’ts of social and business etiquette .
One section in the book is called “ Unclassified Laws of Etiquette . ”
It ’s a list of different rules of etiquette that did n’t quite fit under the other specific headings ( funeral etiquette , etiquette in the home , etc. ) .
While the list was written over 100 years ago and some of the suggestions are a bit random and outdated , the advice is still strikingly resonant .
It manages to cover many , many of the gaps in etiquette which have transformed society into a veritable Swiss cheese of incivility .
If a man puts these suggestions into practice , he will definitely set himself apart for the other knuckleheads out there trying to land a job or catch the eye of a good - looking gal .
Looking down the list , I can see several areas where I could use some improvement .
I bet you will too !
Never exaggerate .
Never point at another .
Never betray a confidence .
Never leave home with unkind words .
Never neglect to call upon your friends .
Never laugh at the misfortunes of others .
Never give a promise that you do not fulfill .
Never send a present , hoping for one in return .
Never speak much of your own performances .
Never fail to be punctual at the time appointed .
Never make yourself the hero of your own story .
Never pick the teeth or clean the nails in company .
Never fail to give a polite answer to a civil question .
Never question a child about family matters .
Never present a gift saying that it is of no use to yourself .
Never read letters which you may find addressed to others .
Never fail , if a gentleman , of being civil and polite to ladies .
Never call attention to the features or form of anyone present .
Never refer to a gift you have made , or favor you have rendered .
Never associate with bad company .
Have good company , or none .
Never look over the shoulder of another who is reading or writing .
Never appear to notice a scar , deformity , or defect of anyone present .
Never arrest the attention of an acquaintance by touch .
Speak to him .
Never punish your child for a fault to which you are addicted yourself .
Never answer questions in general company that have been put to others .
Never , when traveling abroad , be over boastful in praise of your own country .
Never call a new acquaintance by their first name unless requested .
Never lend an article you have borrowed , unless you have permission to do so .
Never attempt to draw the attention of the company constantly upon yourself .
Never exhibit anger , impatience or excitement , when an accident happens .
Never pass between two persons who are talking together , without an apology .
Never enter a room noisily ; never fail to close the door after you , and never slam it .
Never forget that , if you are faithful in a few things , you may be ruler over many .
Never exhibit too great familiarity with the new acquaintance , you may give offense .
Never will a gentleman allude to conquests which he may have made with ladies .
Never be guilty of the contemptible meanness of opening a private letter addressed to another .
Never fail to offer the easiest and best seat in the room to an invalid , an elderly person , or a lady .
Never neglect to perform the commission which the friend entrusted to you .
You must not forget .
Never send your guest , who is accustomed to a warm room , off into a cold , damp , spare bed , to sleep .
Never enter a room filled with people , without a slight bow to the general company when first entering .
Never fail to answer an invitation , either personally or by letter , within a week after the invitation is received .
Never accept of favors and hospitality without rendering an exchange of civilities when opportunity offers .
Never cross the leg and put one foot in the street - car , or places where it will trouble others when passing by .
Never fail to tell the truth .
If truthful , you get your reward .
You will get your punishment if you deceive .
Never borrow money and neglect to pay .
If you do , you will soon be known as a person of no business integrity .
Never write to another asking for information , or a favor of any kind , without enclosing a postage stamp for the reply .
Never fail to say kind and encouraging words to those whom you meet in distress .
Your kindness may lift them out of their despair .
Never refuse to receive an apology .
You may not receive friendship , but courtesy will require , when a apology is offered , that you accept it .
Never examine the cards in the card - basket .
While they may be exposed in the drawing room , you are not expected to turn them over unless invited to do so .
Never , when walking arm in arm with a lady , be continually changing and going to the other side , because of change of corners .
It shows too much attention to form .
Never insult another with harsh words when applied to for a favor .
Kind words do not cost much , and yet they may carry untold happiness to the one to whom they are spoken .
Never fail to speak kindly .
If a merchant , and you address your clerk ; if an overseer , and you address your workman ; if in any position where you exercise authority , you show yourself to be a gentleman by your pleasant mode of address .
Never attempt to convey the impression that you are a genius , by imitating the faults of distinguished men .
Because certain great men were poor penmen , wore long hair , or had other peculiarities , it does not follow that you will be great by imitating their eccentricities .
Never give all your pleasant words and smile to strangers .
The kindest words and the sweetest smiles should be reserved for home .
Home should be our heaven .
“ We have careful thought for the stranger ,
And smiles for the sometimes guest ;
But oft for our own the bitter tone ,
Though we love our own the best .
Ah ! lips with the curl impatient -
‘ Twere a cruel fate were the night too late
To undo the work of the morn . ”
Rachel Cunliffe runs blog design company cre8d design and is co-founder of TV community network Throng .
In 2008 , Twitter really started to hit the mainstream and bloggers began adding widgets to their sidebars to display their latest tweets .
In 2009 , Twitter will become much more tightly integrated with the rest of the blog in a variety of ways - watch out for tweetbacks and tweetstats to make their debut , and tweet comments to TwitterRolls to start appearing on blogs .
Here are 10 ways Twitter will impact blogs this year .
Have your own predictions ?
Add them to the comments .
1. Tweetbacks
Bloggers will start to add " Tweetbacks " to their blog posts .
The simplest version will show the number of people who have tweeted this post ( including all reverse engineered tinyurls ) .
Tweetbacks are not yet available .
Options will include :
Showing what tweeters are saying about the post
Replies to those tweets from others
Showing who is tweeting the post
Showing the tweeters ' avatars
Ordering tweeters by Twitter influence
Mixing tweets in with comments , rather than displaying them separately
2. Tweetstats
In addition to " most read , " " most commented " type sections in blog sidebars , bloggers will add " most tweeted " and " recently tweeted " blog posts sections .
These Tweetstats are not yet available .
3. TweetThis
Some bloggers will ditch catch - all social networking plugins AddThis and ShareThis and just use Tweet This , finding this to be the most effective way of sharing new links online .
Watch Twitter move up into the first tab of the Share This plugin .
4 . Tweets move out of the sidebar
More bloggers will mix blog posts and tweets into a single column together a la Tumblr , rather than keeping them in the sidebar .
More new themes will have a built - in style for displaying tweets in an elegant way amongst blog posts .
Wordpress users will find the Twitter tools plugin useful .
5 . Tweet comments
Blog visitors will be able to comment on tweets displayed within a blog - whether they are a Twitter user or not .
Wordpress users will find the Twitter tools plugin useful .
6. BlogTweet feeds
Blog feeds will have the option of including or excluding tweets - made simple thanks to Yahoo pipes .
Follow this video tutorial to see how to do it .
7 . Blog comment form changes
Some bloggers will add a form field for people to fill in their Twitter account name when adding comments on blogs .
Others will change the common " website " label to " website / Twitter page . "
Useful for visitors without their own blog or website but who use Twitter .
See the WP - Twitip - ID Plugin Wordpress plugin .
8 . New sidebar widgets
Favorites widget - display recent favorite tweets
This day in history widget - display a user 's tweets from a year ago ( or longer )
Not yet available .
9. TwitterRolls
In addition to blog rolls , bloggers will list their favorite tweeters and optionally a short note on why they 're worth following to help others discover new tweeters .
10 . Blog design influenced by Twitter themes
While many bloggers change their Twitter theme to match their blog 's themes as closely as possible , this will also work in reverse .
Influenced by Twitter 's design , bloggers will use more background images on their blogs and use the limitations of theming their Twitter page to influence how they design their blog .
Expect to see more blog headers rotated ninety degrees anti-clockwise and more blog sidebars on the right hand side .

Looking good so far .
Rick Sparks began composing music while in high school .
Even though he had received very little in the way of formal training , his choral teacher was impressed enough to collaborate with the school 's band instructor to create an independent music study class for the lad .
The grade for the class was determined solely upon Rick 's ability to compose an original instrumental song .
He received an " A " grade for the class .
Some mostly disastrous experiments with synth - driven pop/rock music during the late 80s led Sparks to found the experimental industrial music proj … read more

[ This is a dispatch from Elly Blue ’s East Coast Tour .
Read more here . ]
Parker and Sturgis - Pascale catch up with their former intern , Reed College student ( and New Haven native ) Rose Vickery .
( Photos by Elly Blue )
New Haven , Connecticut is the birthplace of pizza , hamburgers , and the lollipop .
It has the highest rate of public housing per capita in the United States .
But it has always been better known for being home to the wealthy , prestigious Yale University .
Yale is a major player in New Haven — the university is the city ’s largest employer , owns a huge percentage of downtown property ( including several streets ) , and is incredibly influential in the social and economic life of the city .
“ In five years you wo n’t recognize New Haven . ”
— Holly Parker
And Yale has begun to embrace sustainability in a big way , particularly sustainable transportation .
One afternoon in New Haven I headed over to Yale University ’s new Transportation Options office .
There I met with the program ’s Director , Holly Parker , and her assistant , Erin Sturgis - Pascale .
( Sturgis - Pascale is also on New Haven ’s Board of Alders , and was instrumental in passing their recent Complete Streets bill which I wrote about yesterday . )
Parker was hired away from a similar job at Harvard by Yale ’s new director of sustainability after she gave a presentation here about her work in Cambridge .
She has a key role in some of the major changes that office is bringing to the city .
“ I keep telling people , in five years you wo n’t recognize New Haven , ” Parker told me at the beginning of our interview .
We start out by talking about the bigger picture in which she is operating .
Signs of hope are beginning to show for sustainable transportation in Connecticut .
Former Governor John Rowland , who left office in disgrace in 2004 during a corruption investigation for which he pled guilty , had been actively hostile to any kind of non -highway transportation .
His replacement , M. Jodi Rell , is an improvement .
Her transportation decisions have not always been on the mark , but she did recently hire a Department of Transportation commissioner who is “ not a highway person ” — in fact , he worked on building light rail in Arizona .
Connecticut ’s DOT apparently has trouble hiring young , progressive engineers , but has been working with contractors on new projects , including a north - south commuter rail line .
In terms of bicycling , Connecticut has had a three foot passing law since October .
This was primarily the work of a citizen activist whose day job is in traffic engineering .
On a city level , New Haven is also moving forward with a new Director of Transportation , Traffic , and Parking .
Mike Piscitelli is extraordinarily supportive of non-car projects and has been writing grants and working closely with advocacy group Elm City Cycling .
“ He works really , really hard ” to improve cycling and walking conditions , Parker said .
The city also has a new police chief , who has been working hard on taming traffic of all kinds .
Until he was hired , New Haven had only has 6 traffic enforcement officers , in part because ticket money goes to the state rather than the city .
None had radar guns .
Connecticut law does not allow red light cameras ( New Haven has installed some already , against the day they ’ll be able to use them ) , contributing to enforcement woes .
The new police chief has said publicly that New Haven has the worst traffic he ’s ever seen — and he moved here from LA .
Parker and Sturgis - Pascale are strongly connected personally and professionally with the bicycle scene in town .
The Elm City Cycling group draws in a lot of community members — their meetings are packed and you ca n’t always find a seat .
There are a ton of rides happening , whether to community events , or weekly ice cream rides in the summer , or Sunday road rides .
There ’s also Critical Mass , which Parker attends to regularly .
The police usually show up to cork , she said , though they skipped the big Halloween ride this year for some reason .
A designated bike route
on the downtown section of Prospect St .
They agree : cycling is really booming here .
Sturgis - Pascale chimes in excitedly .
She has printouts of 2006 census data which she just discovered .
New Haven ’s pedestrian share in 2006 census ( which counts the primary mode of work commute trips ) is 14 % .
That ’s 4th highest in nation for cities with over 100,000 people .
I flipped the page and found Portland at # 36 with 5.4 % walking to work , which made Parker and Sturgis - Pascale smile proudly .
“ If we can do better than Portland on anything … ” Parker said .
By the same count , for transit commute trips , New Haven is # 38 at 10 % .
Parker and Sturgis - Pascale wondered how many of those trips might be made by members of the Yale community , particularly undergraduates , the majority of whom live on campus , and are able to live without a car .
As a partial answer to that question , Yale just finished its own internal survey ; in last year , 9 % of Yale community biked to campus ( dramatically up from 5 % the previous year ) .
They are still crunching the numbers on other modes .
The Transportation Options office at Yale is primarily focused on outreach and transportation demand management .
Their main target is commute trips for staff , faculty , and graduate students .
Their main outreach tool is the excellent Getting Around Yale website .
The site lists options including the Yale Shuttle , Zipcar , bicycling , walking , and “ Car Free in New Haven . ”
Information and encouragement are provided for all these modes , as is a “ proximity map ” showing areas from which you should be able to walk and bike downtown .
“ The real coup , ” Parker told me , is that nowhere on the site are private cars mentioned as an option .
Other outreach activities include the annual BABY ( Bicyclist Appreciation Breakfast : Yale ) event , an outdoor coffee and doughnuts affair for bike commuters .
The office also has a Y - Bike program which provides a fleet of bikes , one for each department .
The bikes come equipped with panniers , rack , generator lights , helmets , and cyclometers — the department that racked up the highest mileage on their bike by the end of the first year will get a prize .
They also promote bicycles at events , and are working on having a stop by Transportation Options become a fixture in new employee orientation ( “ Right now , they just hand you a parking permit application , and that ’s basically how it ’s been for the past 300 years ” ) .

Snow creates an ad hoc bike lane
on the usually bike - unfriendly Prospect St
in Downtown New Haven .
The conversation up to this point was entirely positive .
Parker and Sturgis - Pascale are excited , rightly , about the energy and progress with sustainable transportation in general and bikes in particular .
Then I asked if there is any opposition to it all .
Oh yes .
“ Bikes are persona non grata around here , ” Sturgis - Pascale said .
Parker added , “ New Haven was designed to move cars .
Through it . ”
Everything about the infrastructure tells people who are driving that the road is theirs , and there ’s a lot of anger at anyone who encroaches on that , they explained .
And road rage is only fed by infrastructure that does n’t work well .
Lights are n’t timed well for walking , biking , or driving .
Intersections are bad and waits are long .
People get angry , break the rules , and make each other even angrier .
It can be a scary place to get around no matter how you go about it .
But the biggest problem , Sturgis - Pascale told me , is that the downtown grid is made up almost entirely of one - way streets .
“ We ca n’t move forward until we convert back to two way streets ” she said emphatically .
It ’s a frustrating situation for driving , especially with frequent construction projects .
It ’s even worse for biking , though .
Sturgis - Pascale , who does n’t strike me as a scofflaw , says she regularly goes the wrong way down one particular street on her commute .
She knows it ’s illegal and dangerous but her alternative is to go three blocks out of her way through two major intersections that terrify her .
I pointed out that converting one - way streets back to a regular grid is a huge endeavor — so what is the low hanging fruit ?
They looked at each other and laughed .
“ There is no low - hanging fruit , ” they agreed .
There are a lot of problems in New Haven and the way to tackle them is head - on , at the source .
For the same reasons , they are frustrated by people who say that transportation is n’t as big an issue as , say , youth violence .
What if , for instance , the city was a better environment for businesses which could create jobs for those same youth ?
And if there were a good way to get to those jobs ?
Would n’t that be better than creating dozens of social service programs to patch up a broken system ?
I do n’t know the answer .
“ We ca n’t move forward until we save our grid .
We have to convert back to two - way streets . ”
I told them that going first for the low hanging fruit is a big doctrine in Portland sustainable transportation , and they shake their heads in disbelief .
They want to go for the biggest things first .
“ It ’s the one way streets , ” Erin says .
“ We ca n’t move forward until we save our grid .
We have to convert back to two - way streets . ”
The logistics of actually bringing solutions are not immediately obvious .
I ask whose job it is —
Yale ’s ?
The city ’s ?
Both ?
“ This is always a sensitive area , ” Parker said .
You have a university that has so much money , and a town that has so little , and Yale is naturally very wary of expensive collaborations .
She firmly believes that building infrastructure should be the government ’s job .
Sturgis - Pascale nods agreement .
Still , town and gown are on the same page on sustainable transportation goals .
I asked about Yale Transit .
CT Transit , the state ’s transportation agency which provides bus service in all several Connecticut cities including New Haven , has long had funding issues and threatens every few years to cut back service .
Yale has long had a shuttle for students , faculty , and staff .
Parker volunteers that Yale Transit in the last few years has started running fixed route shuttles into some commuter neighborhoods , such as East Rock where many , many grad students live — and that this has driven up housing prices in that neighborhood .
The shuttle runs along routes already served by CT Transit .
“ It ’s a full duplication of service . ”
One big project
Yale has taken on in collaboration with the city involves burying all the power lines in parts of downtown .
When they tear up and rebuild the roads for this , they plan to do streetscape redesigns in some areas to make them more walking and biking friendly .
This is a few years out , and may , like all of this , be affected by economy .
So there is a better prospect for collaboration on building walking and biking facilities .
There is n’t a way for Yale to create its own separate walking and biking infrastructure , right ?
I asked .
Not usually , though often in the past , “ Yale ’s just bought the street . ”
There is a pedestrian - only block of High Street , and a section of Wall Street , both in the heart of Yale ’s campus , which they have bought and designed for very low car traffic , and on which most users walk and bike .
Yale is clearly hoping to be a nationwide model for university - level transportation demand management , and it looks like they ’re well on the way .
“ There ’s a lot of work to do , ” Parker said .
But they ’re excited , they ’re onto something , and it does seem to be working .
She is inspired by Portland , and there was some eager talk about catching up with , and exceeding our accomplishments .
I hope they do , and wish them the best .

Ancient groundwater being tapped by Jordan , one of the 10 most water - deprived nations in the world , has been found to contain twenty times the radiation considered safe for drinking water in a new study by an international team of researchers .
" The combined activities of 228 radium and 226 radium - the two long - lived isotopes of radium - in the groundwater we tested are up to 2000 percent higher than international drinking standards , " said Avner Vengosh , associate professor of earth and ocean sciences in the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University .
Making the water safe for long - term human consumption is possible , he said , but it will require extra steps to reduce its radioactivity .
Vengosh and his research team , made up of scientists from Jordan , Palestine , Israel and the United States , published their findings Feb. 19 in a paper in the peer - reviewed journal Environmental Science & Technology .
Jordan 's annual water use exceeds the natural replenishment of its major river , the Yarmouk , and its local aquifers that are becoming salinized as a result of over - pumping .
In 2007 , the Jordanian government announced plans for a $ 600 - million project to pump low - saline fossil groundwater from the Disi aquifer , located along the nation 's remote southern border with Saudi Arabia , and pipe it 250 kilometers north to the capital , Amman , a city of 3.1 million people , and other population centers .
Fossil groundwater is a nonrenewable supply of water trapped underground in aquifers .
In recent years , policymakers in countries facing chronic water shortages have increasingly viewed low - saline supplies of fossil groundwater as an important potential source of water for human and agricultural use .
Libya and Saudi Arabia , for example , have relied extensively on fossil groundwater from Nubian sandstone aquifers similar to the Disi to meet their water needs in recent decades .
Most fossil groundwater resources in North Africa and the Middle East are characterized by high - quality water with low salinity .
" The assumption has been that unsafe radioactive levels occur primarily in high - saline groundwater , so low - saline sources , such as water from a Nubian sandstone aquifer , are relatively safe resources just waiting to be tapped , " Vengosh said .
To test that hypothesis , Vengosh and his colleagues investigated water from 37 pumping wells in the Disi aquifer 's Rum Group , where low - saline groundwater is extracted from Cambro - Ordovician sandstone , and from wells in the Khreim Group , where saltier water is extracted from an aquifer containing larger amounts of clay minerals and oxides .
All samples were analyzed for major and trace elements and for four radium isotopes .
For comparative purposes , sandstone rocks from the Disi aquifer , along with Nubian sandstone rocks from the nearby Negev Desert in Israel , were also measured for radium .
" We found a lack of correlation between salinity and radioactivity , " Vengosh said .
" Instead , our findings suggest that an aquifer 's geological properties may be a much more significant factor . "
Vengosh and his group hypothesize that an aquifer with a higher content of clay minerals and oxides provides more adsorption sites for radium , and this results in lower radionuclide levels in the water itself .
Sandstone aquifers , on the other hand , offer fewer adsorption sites , and , as a result , generate radium - rich groundwater .
" Given that most of the aquifers in the region that contain fossil water are composed of Nubian sandstone and are characterized by low - saline groundwater , similar to that in the Disi aquifer , we suggest that high - radioactive groundwater may also exist in these basins .
This could pose health risks for a large population , " Vengosh said .
Groundwater from the Disi aquifer is already used for drinking water in parts of Jordan and , more extensively , in Saudi Arabia , where it is known as the Saq aquifer .
" Making groundwater from the Disi aquifer and similar sandstone basins in the region safe for long - term human use will require a significant reduction of radionuclide levels , " Vengosh said .
Health officials could reduce radioactivity to safe levels by diluting radium - rich water with low - radium water from other sources , he said , or by treating it with ion exchange , reverse osmosis desalination or lime softening .
Each of these three treatment technologies does a good job of removing radium , Vengosh noted , but each produces solid and liquid residues that would have to be handled and disposed of as low - level radioactive waste .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) classifies radium as a Group - A carcinogenic material , which means exposure to it could cause cancer .

There are obviously many reasons why Git is awesome ( and why it sucks too ) , and there comes a point where it helps to dispel some of the rumors and issues surrounding Git .
The following list attempts to show what Git is not .
If you have your own reasons , feel free to contribute them to the comments and they may be added in .
1. Git is not Subversion with some added sugar sprinkled in .
Git works a lot differently than SVN and CVS .
Probably the biggest difference is that Git stores content primarily , and it works mostly by taking snapshots of the information available .
( This is why Git is commonly referred to as a ‘ dumb information tracker ’ ) .
Its algorithm for storing changes is fundamentally different from Subversion , and it much more efficient at doing so .
Also , if you ’re used to having all of your projects in one huge repository , Git does n’t really work like that either .
Repositories are meant mostly for single projects , and then you could use submodules that link to other repos if needed .
A tip covering how to deal with this situation will definitely be coming in the future .
The differences between Git and SVN could be in their own series of tips , but the Git - SVN Crash Course does a great job for those considering making the switch with drawing parallels .
2 . Git is not expensive network or space wise .
Local commits are a huge advantage to using Git , and it means that your workflow can be made a lot smoother since it ’s not talking over the network to a central server for most actions .
If you want to know more about how this works , check out this post on the staging area or this one on pushing and pulling .
Another awesome advantage is that there ’s one place where git stores its files for your repository ( usually the .git directory ) and it does n’t litter your working copy with thousands of hidden directories and files like SVN does .
3 . Git is not just for Linux kernel hackers or those who fly on airplanes all day to conferences .
Git can be installed on virtually every modern operating system , and it definitely works on Windows .
GUI support is n’t there 100 % on Windows , but plenty of work is being done on integrating into Explorer and to the various IDEs available .
There ’s plenty of slick tools available on other operating systems such as GitX on OSX .
4 . Git is not hard to set up .
Setting up a Git repository is as simple as doing git init in any directory .
It ca n’t get much simpler for that .
Sharing your changes with others is when things get a bit more interesting .
Usually sharing your changes is one or two commands away .
Hosting your changes somewhere the right way can be a little tricky though : usually for self setup the best way to go is using gitosis , which is an tool that helps with getting SSH keys for users set up for commit access .
Update 26 - Oct - 2011 : Note that the last commit of gitosis is from 2009 .
Gitolite nowadays seems to be better supported .
5 . Git is not hard to learn .
Git ’s manpages are quite extensive ( and verbose ) , but there are plenty of other guides available for learning online .
Some of the best are listed in the resources section in this site ’s footer !
For those new to Git , I usually recommend the Git Community Book and running through some of the GitCasts videos .
( Reading this site counts too ! )
6 . Git is not complex .
Yes , there ’s a lot of alien terminology and some concepts that are n’t instantly familiar to every newcomer , but the underlying concepts that the system is based on are fundamentally and purposefully simple .
One great example is the blob - tree - commit structure .
Once the basic concepts behind Git are grasped , it ’s really easy to make the tool work the way you want it instead of letting it force you into a specific workflow .
Sure , too much flexibility could be a bad thing , but when it offers so much power and ease of use , why not ?
New Hair Loss Treatment with BOTOX
Botox has been used for everything from anti-aging , wrinkle busting to treating migraine headaches .
But hair loss ?
A recent study shows Botox , injected along with a customized vitamin cocktail 2 - 3 times per year may make baldness a thing of the past .
With my patients these BOTOX ® and vitamin injectionsfor baldness have been very safe and more effective than anything I have seen before
Beverly Hills , CA ( PRWEB ) February 4 , 2009 -- Preliminary findings have shown that BOTOX ® injections into the scalp may effectively delay hair loss and even prevent baldness .
Dr. Simon Ourian , Medical Director of Epione , an internationally recognized Aesthetic Dermatology destination in Beverly Hills , has tested and refined the treatment over a period of three years with volunteer patients .
Dr. Ourian is now confident in the effectiveness of the treatment and offering it to his patients .

It is important to realize that baldness is not a medical disorder ; it is a condition by which hair follicles under the scalp shrink to the point where they no longer generate replacement follicles .
Since each follicle typically regenerates every 2 - 6 years , baldness is a slow but continual physiological process that results in patches of baldness on the scalp connecting with other patches to form a hairline .
Dr. Ourian notes that participating in an effective hair loss treatment is a personal decision involving many factors including cost , possible benefits and convenience .
The prospective patient looking for ways to treat hair loss has more choices now than at anytime in history .
Medicine currently offers two distinct forms of hair loss treatments .
There is the prescription medication route , which usually involves Minoxidil ( Rogaine ) or Finasteride ( Propecia ) and can be a very cost - effective hair loss remedy .
Rogaine , a solution applied directly to the scalp , slows down hair loss and in some cases can actually grow new hair .
Propecia , on the other hand , does not in most cases grow new hair , but has proved even more effective , especially if detected early , in slowing down and stopping the rate of hair loss .
Surgical baldness treatments such as Hair Transplantation , are also a viable option , but are more expensive than Botox injections or prescription medications .
Dr. Ourian discovered the apparent hair loss prevention properties of BOTOX ® while treating his own mother for debilitating headaches , a side effect of chemotherapy treatments she was receiving at the time .
Citing studies conducted by Allergan , the manufacturer of BOTOX® , indicating that BOTOX ® could be used effectively to relieve migraines and having experienced first - hand the appreciation of patients relieved from the agony of years of suffering from migraine headaches by virtue of BOTOX ® scalp injections , Dr. Ourian hoped to provide that same relief to his mother , After Dr. Ourian injected his mother 's scalp with BOTOX ® not only did her headaches diminish but her hair follicles , damaged by the chemotherapy , began to re-grow in the areas surrounding the injections .
'' Of course , I was happily surprised by the result , '' said Dr. Ourian , '' so I decided to share this discovery with several of my regular patients .
Because hair loss is a significant source of insecurity for many people , both men and women , there was no shortage of volunteers with thinning hair .
The results for many were astonishing , and for some , a single session yielded dramatic results . ''
" With my patients these BOTOX ® and vitamin injectionsfor baldness have been very safe and more effective than anything I have seen before , " says Dr. Ourian .
Typical side effects of the scalp treatments were those normally associated with BOTOX ® injections ( temporary swelling , pain , bruising , etc ) .
In an effort to increase the efficacy of the treatments , Dr. Ourian added a cocktail of vitamins generally known to stimulate hair growth to the BOTOX® injections .
These injections appeared to improve the tissue environment surrounding the hair follicles by reducing scalp tension and improving blood flow .
Rocket Pictures is currently making CG animation Gnomeo and Juliet
Sir Elton John is to make a sci - fi horror film where aliens wreak havoc on a Jane Austen - style period drama .
The pop star 's film company , Rocket Pictures , has announced plans to start filming Pride and Predator in London later this year .
" It felt like a fresh and funny way to blow apart the done - to - death Jane Austen genre , " producer David Furnish told Variety magazine .
Sir Elton will supervise the music and act as executive producer .
The movie will be directed by Will Clark , who previously helmed 2007 short film The Amazing Trousers .
Starring Valkyrie 's David Bamber and My Family 's Kris Marshall , the fairytale comedy was about a luckless Edwardian who agreed to trade his legs for a year of amazing success .
Clark co-wrote the script for Pride and Predator , but no cast has yet been announced .
Furnish , who tied the knot with Sir Elton in 2005 , promised the film would drop an " alien into the middle of a costume drama , where he stalks and slashes to horrific effect " .
Iran has become the latest country to edge towards ditching Windows in favour of Linux , even if its refusal to abide by copyright laws means that the country does not pay a penny to Bill Gates .
According to Mohammad Sephery - Rad , the man in charge of the government 's computer systems , long - term political and security considerations have sparked a major initiative to make the switch .
" All the software in Iran is copied .
There is no copyright law , so everybody uses Microsoft software freely , " said the secretary of Iran 's High Informatics Council .
" But we can not continue like this much longer , " he said .
The reason has nothing to do with the guilt of using pirated software ( a cracked Windows XP CD costs the same as a blank CD ) , but more pragmatic considerations - not least because of the irony that Iran 's information technology ( IT ) backbone is based on software from its arch - enemy the United States .

President Barack Obama has appointed two experts , one in food the other in drugs , to head up the soon to be reorganized Food & Drug Administration in preparation for an agency split that would separate the FDA into two – one agency to oversee foods and the other to regulate drugs .
But just exactly where does that leave dietary supplements ?
The Dietary Supplement Health & Education Act of 1994 ( DSHEA ) declares dietary supplements to be products intended to supplement the diet .
But the FDA contends DSHEA severely limits the FDA in regulating a growing industry .
A recently issued report from the General Accounting Office claims the FDA does not have the resources to adequately regulate dietary supplements .
The GAO report appears to be part of an orchestrated effort to soften the public up for a major change in the classification and regulation of dietary supplements .
Unlike drugs which must be approved for safety and efficacy before entering the market , dietary supplements marketed before 1994 are presumed to be safe .
FDA must demonstrate that a product presents a significant or unreasonable risk to the public to get it off the market .
But that may change .
An ominous sign of things to come – the FDA just classified a form of vitamin B6 ( pyridoxine ) as a new drug ( Pyridorin , Biostratum ) .
Despite recent outbreaks of foodborne disease ( Salmonella in peanuts ) and approval of deadly or problematic drugs ( recently Vioxx , Seroquel , many others ) compared against few if any reported deaths in the newly implemented Adverse Event Reporting for dietary supplements , the Federal government is aiming its regulatory muscle at vitamin , mineral and herbal pills .
Despite the fact that dietary supplements are far safer than table salt , aspirin , vaccines and many FDA - approved drugs , they are being demonized .
Year after year , surveys conducted by poison control centers show dietary supplements to be the safest products of all .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In a misdirection , it appears food supplements are being mischaracterized as potentially dangerous and in need of greater regulatory oversight .
This leads to the possibility of FDA placing supplements under the same regulatory body that oversees drugs .
The FDA appears to be covering for the sins of the drug companies , which is pushing for faster approval of new drugs , which led to the Vioxx fiasco ( it is estimated 20,000 Americans died prematurely from taking this anti-inflammatory drug that should have never been approved by the FDA ) .
Vioxx , if you recall , was touted as being safer than other anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and aspirin .
Just recently it was revealed that salespeople for a U.S. drug company told doctors that an anti-psychotic drug ( Seroquel - $ 4.45 billion in sales 2008 ) did n’t cause diabetes more than two years after the drug maker warned physicians in Japan of possible links to the disease .
Twelve serious cases ( including 1 death ) of hyperglycaemia , diabetic ketoacidosis and diabetic coma here causally linked with the drug .
What penalties a drug company will receive from the FDA for this type of apparent misdeed is unknown .
Massive efforts have been taken to convince the public to be wary of dietary supplements .
Just when DSHEA was being deliberated for passage in Congress in October of 1994 , suddenly a report was published in New England Journal of Medicine claiming beta carotene pills increased the risk of death among smokers in Finland .
But examination of the published paper showed beta carotene hardly increased mortality rates at all ( by less than 1 % ) .
For years the FDA drug its feet in publishing Good Manufacturing Practices ( GMP ) for the dietary supplement industry , while pointing fingers at and sanctioning supplement makers who made marginal quality products , often mislabeled for dosage or for making false advertising claims .
Only recently has the FDA completed GMP guidelines for food supplements .
In 2006 the FDA drew fire when it declared tart cherry supplements to be “ new drugs ” because manufacturers claimed their products had potent anti-inflammatory properties .
Another agency of the government , the US Department of Agriculture , published a study showing tart cherry extract is as effective as ibuprofen in reducing inflammation .
Ibuprofen can cause gastric problems that can lead to bleeding ulcers and even death .
Tart cherry extract has no reported side effects .
In this manner the FDA restricts free speech and the public is deprived of learning ways to stay healthy naturally and practice self care .
In 1994 Americans wrote more letters to Congress to maintain access to dietary supplements than on any other piece of legislation to date .
Imagine you are on a cruise ship where people are getting sick from Norovirus in contaminated shellfish , and the ship ’s doctor is dispensing poorly - made sea-sick medicine that is making people ill as well , and the captain overlooks these problems , declares he does n’t have enough authority over people taking vitamin pills below - decks and demands everybody dump their vitamin pills overboard .
This is what is going on at the FDA today .

Proper Fixation always had more unfinished drafts than posts , but recently it 's getting ridiculous .
I do have a couple of drafts I seriously intend to finish ( usually the drafts which do n't make it to posthood during the first 4 hours or so go to the eternal drafthood land . )
Until I 'm able to think this stuff out to the point where I can share the results of my thinking , I figured I could share the far less scarce resource of Wisdom with ya .

Since I 've violated the Golden Rule of Helping Friends with their PC Problems and attempted to help a friend with his PC problem , expectedly wiping out his hard drive in vain , I had many opportunities to explain the Programmer Paradox : how can a programmer fail to make a computer do as he wishes ?
While the difficulty of debugging a program without the source proved hard to explain to laymen , I think I 've found a metaphor that does a good job .
A programmer is to the blue screen of death what Mikhail Kalashnikov is to a loaded AK - 47 : just as helpless a victim as any other mortal , except for having a profound understanding of the mechanisms of his execution .

I would like to get some statistics on file encryption .
For example , of all the files on the planet , X % are encrypted .
Of all those files , Y % will never be read by someone due to encryption .
Of all those files , Z % will never be read by malicious intruders .
If I could lay my hands on the value of just one of these unknowns , I 'd pick Z , because at least 100 - Z % of the files will never be read by their owners .
I would bet on Z lying somewhere between 0 and 1 .

One of the key traits of good code is the ease at which it can be modified .
One of the key traits of bad code is the high cost of modifying it .
So good code is likely to deteriorate until it's bad enough to become hard to change , and bad code is likely to stay bad .
In short , code has a strong tendency to end up bad .
This can sound worthlessly pessimistic , similarly , for example , to " It is easier to break a leg than it is to cure it , therefore , most legs end up broken . "
However , I think it 's more analogous to aging – the accumulation of changes in an organism , observably causing most animals to end up dead .
Similarly , code that is used will be changed , code that is changed will degrade , and code that degrades beyond a certain point will die .

Health tends to be simpler than disease .
For example , everybody can brush their teeth but few people can treat cavities .
Similarly , it 's not very hard to maintain a sane development environment , but pretty hard to deal with the tide of bugs and of long - living branches resulting from a failure to do so .
However , I 'm generally optimistic about the chances of such cavities to be treated , and as usual , the optimism is based on the pain they cause – a strong incentive to seek and reward treatment .

There 's this evolution vs Intelligent Design debate .
Well , I do n't know about life on Earth , but I sure have hard time believing in Intelligent Design in software .
Code has to repeatedly survive exposure to users upon whom its fate depends .
Yes , " users " can be a set containing just the author , but only if it 's honest - to - God USAGE , that is , the author has to pay a price when the program is hard to use – like not getting important things done properly .
Show me a program that someone finds useful and that was n't subject to such evolutionary pressure , but rather was Intelligently Designed as useful .
I think that my intense hatred of the word " design " has to do with its prominent place in the speech of software creationists .
These people are likely to constantly complain about not having enough resources to do The Right Thing in the ugly real world .
They are also likely to give you software that you hate enough to wish to kill them , and be articulate enough to convince you that the problem is at your end , and fail to notice how this latter ability quadruples your desire to slash their body into square millimeter pieces .

I 'll conclude with an off - topic request : if you know a good text advocating a collectivistic or other kind of heterodox approach to economics , I 'd be very grateful for a reference .
By " advocacy " , I mean a text for laymen expressing support for a certain set of policies ( as opposed to merely criticizing the effects of existing policies ) – like Milton Friedman 's " Capitalism and Freedom " , for example .
Neil Young once said “ it ’s better to burn out than to fade away ” a sentence that would later be found in a suicide note written by Kurt Cobain .
Kurt was the 5th member of the 27 club , a group of musicians who died at the age of 27 .
Today , with the passing of Amy Winehouse , she too has joined the ranks of greats like Jim Morrison , Jimi Hendrix , and others who are part of this very exclusive club .
Jimi Hendrix – The Jimi Hendrix Experience ( died 1970 )
There was nothing about Jimi Hendrix that did n’t stick out ; from his flamboyant outfits , to his left - handed guitar , or his use of amp overdrive .
After being turned down by The Rolling Stones , Jimi was introduced to Chas Chandler via Keith Richard ’s girlfriend .
They went on to form
The Jimi Hendrix Experience a rock band that would revolutionize the genre forever .
In 1969 , he headlined the biggest music festival of all time , Woodstock .
One year later , Jimi Hendrix was found dead after overdosing on pills and drowning in his own vomit ( asphyxiation ) .
Brian Jones – The Rolling Stones ( died 1969 )
Brian Jones was the founder of a little known band named The Rolling Stones .
While on the phone to secure a gig with a venue owner , Brian came up with the name “ Rollin ( g ) Stones ” by reading it off an album that was laying around .
Their music consisted mostly of R&B covers and it was n’t until Andrew Loog Oldham joined that they began shifting their focus to newer , more original material .
This transition reduced Jones ' role in the band which was further accelerated with his drug habit and alcohol abuse .
He became alienated from The Rolling Stones and eventually , he was no longer a member of the band he helped form .
One month later , he was found face down in his swimming pool .
Janis Joplin – Big Brother and The Holding Company ( died 1970 )
Janis ’ big break came in 1966 when she became the lead vocalist of the psychedelic hippie rock band , Big Brother and The Holding Company .
She was renowned for her strong powerful vocals during a male - dominated rock era .
Janis Joplin performed at Woodstock after having several shots of heroin and being highly inebriated .
In 1970 , she flew to Brazil where she cleaned up her act and remained sober for a while .
She would later return to the US where her drug habits would resurface and ultimately , get the better of her as she died from an apparent heroin overdose in October 1970 .
Keep reading to see who else is part of the 27 club .
Jim Morrison – The Doors ( died 1971 )
Jim Morrison was a poet , a writer , a filmmaker , and of course , the lead singer for the rock band , The Doors .
Controversy surrounded The Doos when they were asked to perform on the Ed Sullivan show .
Fearing that the lyric “ Girl We Could n’t Get Much Higher ” was too risqué for television , Ed Sullivan requested that the band modify the sentence to be more TV friendly to which they agreed .
When they played , Jim proceeded with original wording which infuriated Ed Sullivan .
The Doors had great success in the late 60s but Jim Morrison started to get out of control .
He was constantly drugged or drunk and would oftentimes show up late for live performances .
In 1971 , he moved to Paris and a few months later , Jim Morrison was found dead in his apartment .
The circumstances surrounding his death are still unclear as an autopsy was never performed .
While we 're talking about Jim , here are the 7 most controversial Jim Morrison moments .
Kurt Cobain – Nirvana ( died 1994 )
In an era where rock music was all about long hair and leather jackets , Kurt Cobain sported short hair and wore flannel clothing .
Nirvana became an overnight success when they took Michael Jackson off the number one slot in the Billboard music charts with their smash hit , Smells Like Teen Spirit .
Grunge music would go on to flood the radio airwaves throughout the early nineties .
In 1992 , Cobain wed the equally unorthodox Courtney Love with whom they had daughter Frances Bean Cobain .
In 1993 , Nirvana , known for their grungy loud music , were approached by MTV and asked to perform a quieter , more intimate acoustic set .
Kurt Cobain ’s emotional performance in Where Did You Sleep Last Night still sends chills down our spines .
Here are 7 interesting facts you may not know about Kurt Cobain .
Amy Winehouse ( died 2011 )
Ironically , Amy Winehouse owed much of her popularity to her song Rehab which contained the lyric " They tried to make me go to rehab but I said ' no , no , no . ' "
After struggling with drug addiction , Amy Winehouse finally went against those same words and checked into rehab in 2011 .
After a short stay , the singer checked herself out of rehab and began a new European tour .
She was booed off stage after showing up at her first gig intoxicated and unable to remember the lyrics to her famous songs .
Her tour was cancelled following the incident to give her more time to recover .
She was found dead in her London home a few weeks later .
I ’ve begun to immerse myself in my second novel about my heroine detective , and so am thinking again about the daily workflow .
Generally , the main part of the process that interests writers is the question of whether to have some kind of daily writing quota , most often a word - count based quota .
But I think I ’m realizing that what I really need is a somewhat more complex routine .
Here ’s where I am at : I have the plot and plot outline .
I have a working list of characters and scenes , though emphasis so far is on “ list ” because that ’s just about all I have for most of these : tentative names and places .
Vague glimmers of ideas about them .
I also have a list of the “ ingredients ” that should be common to any book about this particular heroine , including things about her and her style of working , her mental profile / attitudes / psychology , and the kinds of situations and issues she tends to get pulled into .
( This list is bigger — including things like the different dilemmas she keeps wrestling with , meanings of things like sex or work or identity for her , etc. , but this is the gist .
Some writers call this the “ formula ” for a particular character , series , or kind of novel .
Formulas really do help keep things consistent from book to book ; if a reader wants to follow a particular heroine or hero , say Jane Whiteside in Thomas Perry ’s novels , it ’s because there are predictable things about the character and her challenges from book to book that one enjoys reading about again and again .
If the writer loses track of these ingredients , he or she loses that readership . )
Though I ’ve started in on the writing , I ’ve actually got a bit of fleshing out to do on many of these list items before I can move around easily in this imaginary world .
While I ’ve often written by just plunging in with a vague notion of plot , I think it ’s proving more helpful to take the time to first construct the characters in a scene , to give them pretty fleshed - out independent lives .
Because when you really know the whole iceberg , it ’s easier to write credibly about the tip that shows up above water in an individual scene .
For instance , in scene one , I describe a new character , a pedophile who gets nabbed by the detective .
For him , I did actually flesh out the profile first , using the template below .
As a result , when I wrote the scene I felt like I knew a lot about how he ’d react , and it made the scene , including his arrest , more vivid :
His wife Betsy later tells me they arrested him the next morning , after the kids were at school .
He screamed and collapsed and it took four officers to pry his hands off the door jamb and drag his thrashing screaming praying to Mary Mother of God body into the back of the squad .
Because I had fleshed out details of his life , for instance , I realized that this guy would indeed collapse when arrested , and start frantically praying .
As with other things in that chapter , it was much easier to give him a pretty complex set of attributes ( how courtly and gentle he was to the detective , how he sheds a tear talking about how he wants his daughter to become a doctor , even though he ’s also molesting her , etc . )
My current working template for fleshing out characters includes a bunch of questions that take time to answer ( see below ) .
My second scene in the book is one in which the heroine has to meet and interact with six new people , all important characters , along with learning about a new physical space ( a large Victorian house which contains a school she ’s attending ) and an institutional “ space ” in transition ( the tradition of the small school , and the fact that it is being purchased and transformed by a corporation . )
Meaning , ideally , I have a lot of homework to do — six characters to flesh out , extensive notes on the space , etc .
Some of this can be invented as I write , but even when I do that , it helps inspire me and keeps things consistent if I have at least some background fleshed out .
If you KNOW your character is secretly hostile toward men , for instance , you ’re more likely to come up with the real - life , subtle little signs of that in the dinner party scene , instead of writing something that is too over - the - top that you ’ll then spend a week trying to work around during your later revisions .
So I ’m finding that my work day is kind of like riding a railway for a distance of 1000 words , but in order to do that , I first have to build the tracks .
Since I want to do my thousand words in the morning , it means that I have to do two things later in the day : build the “ track ” for the next day ( filling in the general information / profiles / listing clever ideas for the scenes I ’ll write ) , and then doing some editing of today ’s thousand words .
Because I find if I write a section then go off to the gym , I always come up with a bunch of improvements or new ideas .
( Often simple things : realizing I should have given some info about where people were sitting , what they were doing with their bodies in that first meeting ; realizing that two characters might already be signaling that they are going to like , or hate , each other , etc . )
Last but not least is research .
My character is learning about psychology , and also training in ninjitsu , a new sport for her .
I have to do some scouring of the history of psychology and learn , maybe first - hand , some things about being a black - clad assassin .
Sounds like a full day , particularly if I want to be a “ working novelist ” who actually gets one or two of these things written every year .
But a full work day is n’t bad , especially a structured one like this .
Nothing is harder for a writer than not being sure what he or she is supposed to do next .

NEW YORK , United States —
The Baha'i International Community has issued an open letter to Iran 's prosecutor general outlining the tragic history of the persecution of Baha 'is in that country , explaining their innocence in the face of accusations made by the government , and asking for fairness in any upcoming trial of seven Baha 'i prisoners .
Sent late yesterday by email to Ayatollah Qorban - Ali Dorri-Najafabadi , the letter also suggests that the government 's continued oppression of Baha 'is will ultimately have a wide impact on Iranian society as a whole .
" Your Honor , the decisions to be taken by the judiciary in Iran in the coming days will have implications that extend well beyond the Baha 'i community in that land - what is at stake is the very cause of the freedom of conscience for all the peoples of your nation , " said the six - page letter , dated 4 March 2009 .
" It is our hope that , for the sanctity of Islam and the honor of Iran , the judiciary will be fair in its judgment . "
The letter comes after a series of statements from Ayatollah Najafabadi quoted in the Iranian news media leveling charges at the Baha 'is and stating that the ad hoc arrangements that tend to the spiritual and social affairs of the Baha 'i community of Iran are illegal .
" The Islamic Republic of Iran will not allow any movement to harm the national security through illegal and unauthorized organizational activities , " he said , referring specifically to Baha 'is , according to an account published by the Islamic Republic News Agency .
The seven members of the group that had been coordinating the affairs of the Baha 'is at the national level and who have been in prison for some 10 months , responded to the declaration from their prison cell .
They stated that if the current arrangements for administering the affairs of the Baha 'i community are no longer acceptable to the government , to bring them to a close would not present a major obstacle .
They said this is now being done , to further demonstrate the goodwill that the Baha 'is have consistently shown to the government for the past 30 years .
The letter , which was also sent to the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations and published late yesterday on the Web site of the United Nations office of the Baha'i International Community , carefully outlines the facts of the oppression of the Iranian Baha 'i community since the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979 .
" While the harassment and ill - treatment of Baha 'is continued uninterrupted during this period , they have been taken to new levels of intensity in recent years as certain elements that have historically been bent on the destruction of the Baha 'i community have assumed growing influence in the affairs of the country , " says the Baha'i International Community in the communication .
It notes that it was only in response to that persecution that small ad hoc groups were set up to " tend to the spiritual and social needs " of Iran 's 300,000 Baha 'is - and that for more than 20 years the government has worked with those structures .
At the national level , the group was known as the " Yaran , " which means " Friends " in Persian .
The " Khademin , " or " Those Who Serve , " performed a similar function at the local level .
" Then last year the seven members of the Yaran were imprisoned , one of them in March and the remaining six in May .
...
The conditions of their incarceration have varied in degree of severity over the course of the past several months , with the five male members confined at one time to a cell no more than ten square meters in size , with no bed , " the Baha'i International Community points out .
The seven are Mrs. Fariba Kamalabadi , Mr. Jamaloddin Khanjani , Mr. Afif Naeimi , Mr. Saeid Rezaie , Mrs. Mahvash Sabet , Mr. Behrouz Tavakkoli , and Mr. Vahid Tizfahm .
All but one of the group were arrested on 14 May 2008 at their homes in Tehran .
Mrs. Sabet was arrested on 5 March 2008 while in Mashhad .
" Finally , " the letter continues , " after some nine months of imprisonment , during which time not a shred of evidence could be found linking the members of the Yaran to any wrongdoing , they were accused of ' espionage for Israel , insulting religious sanctities and propaganda against the Islamic Republic , ' and it has been announced that their case will soon be submitted to court with a request for indictment .
" This announcement was followed almost immediately by news reports which indicated that you had written to the Minister of Intelligence stating that the existence of the Yaran and the Khademin in Iran is illegal , while at the same time raising the question of the constitutional right of Iranian citizens to freedom of belief .
You then made an official announcement to this effect .
" Your Honor , the events of recent years and the nature of the accusations made raise questions in the mind of every unbiased observer as to the intent behind the systematic perpetration of injustice against the Baha 'is of Iran .
Even if there might have been some misunderstandings about the motives of the Baha 'i community during the early turbulent days of the revolution , how can such suspicions persist today ?
Can it be that any member of the esteemed government of Iran truly believes the false accusations which have been perpetuated about the Baha 'is in that country ? "
The letter also notes that many prominent Iranians have recently arisen to defend Baha 'is , linking the overall struggle for human rights in Iran and the situation of the Baha 'is .
" And we hear in the voices raised by so many Iranians in defense of their Baha 'i compatriots echoes from their country 's glorious past .
What we cannot help noting , with much gratitude towards them in our hearts , is that a majority of those coming out in support of the beleaguered Baha 'i community are themselves suffering similar oppression as students and academics , as journalists and social activists , as artists and poets , as progressive thinkers and proponents of women 's rights , and even as ordinary citizens .

Cramer : Stewart attack on me ' naive and misleading ' David Edwards and Rachel Oswald
Published : Thursday March 19 , 2009
Print This Email This
One week after the now famous dressing down of CNBCs Jim Cramer by Comedy Centrals Jon Stewart , the host of Mad Money has backtracked significantly from the apologetic and conciliatory tone he struck last Thursday on The Daily Show .
Appearing on one of CNBC 's sister - networks and friendly media platform NBC , Cramer told Today Show host Meredith Vieira Thursday morning that Stewart was naive and misleading  for laying so much of the blame of the financial crisis on poor reporting by financial reporters at CNBC .
Noted Vieira of the interview ,  He was very tough on you .
He was very tough on CNBC .
He basically said that you guys had been cheerleaders for the financial bubble , that you had also allowed CEOs to come on the shows and essentially lie to the American public without really challenging them Did he have a point ?
 I dont think so .
I think it was naive and misleading to attack the media ,  Cramer responded .
CNBC , in particular , has been out front on this . 
He went on to praise individual CNBC reporters for their financial reporting work on the sub - prime housing mortgage crisis
 I think that there are people who bear so much more responsibility , that its just wrong - headed ,  Cramer said , naming specifically ,  the politicians , the regulators , the SEC , the lenders , the investment banks . 
Cramers remarks to Vieira stand in mark contrast to what he said on The Daily Show where he said criticism of him and CNBC was fair game . 
" We all should have seen it more ,  Cramer said to Stewart .
" Should we have been constantly pointing out the mistakes that were made ?
Absolutely .
I truly wish we had done more . "
Cramer appeared to hint that he felt Stewart and the rest of the media commenting on the interview had been unfairly hard on him .
 That was an attempt , as it was throughout the interview , to take a high road , which I was brought up to think was a good thing to do and to go in for discussion ,  Cramer said of his comments to Stewart .
 Sometimes high roads arent well greeted in the media , but I believe that you should always try to do better . 
Stewarts grilling of Cramer has received many accolades from the press .
The Atlantics Andrew Sullivan wrote of the interview ,  This was , in my view , a real cultural moment .
It was a storming of the Bastille There is a cloying familiarity among many cable show hosts and television personalities .
We all have to get along , even though some of us may believe that others of us are very much part of the problem , rather than the solution .

Even though the Pittsburgh Pirates carry a history that goes back to 1887 , they are often forgotten in historical conversations about baseball these days , perhaps because they have n’t really done anything of consequence in decades .
This may be the reason , then that their immaculately built stadium seems to be overlooked when discussions about the great modern parks around baseball occur .
When compared to most parks built in the last 20 years , PNC Park would top many in more than a few categories .
Many in Pittsburgh , and even around the country , thought that a new ballpark might bring new hope to a floundering franchise when it was designed and built for the 2001 season .
Unfortunately , the Pirates did not experiences nearly as much national , or even local attention , as other teams did with these new parks simply because it really did n’t help them play any better .
In recent years , teams have chosen to build new ballparks because they will enjoy increased revenue and attendance , as well as possibly having better play on the field .
If those statistics from Pittsburgh are compared to other teams who built stadiums in the past two decades , they rank near the bottom in every one of them .
One of the most memorable parts of PNC Park is the view that most fans will enjoy when attending the Pirates ’ home .
With home plate just 443 feet from the Allegheny River , fans have a treat with that well known river right outside of the ballpark .
It would also be difficult to find a place with a better view of downtown Pittsburgh than fans receive when they arrive at the ball park .
This view of the city past the outfield wall will remind many of the thriving city that Pittsburgh once was .
Fans will also be able to catch a glimpse of the yellow steel bridges that have become a well known staple of the city .
If fans are taking a look at the ball park on a game day , they will find that the bridge closest to the ballpark is closed and filled with interactive activities along with places where fans have the opportunity to get their Pirates merchandise for less than what they would be charged inside the stadium .
The stadium is within walking distance of many places in the city , making it a convenient place to stop for anyone who happens to be traveling to , or through , Pittsburgh .
The outside of the stadium is unlike any in the big leagues .
With yellow tinted bricks and pillars , it creates a feeling for fans that they are walking through some sort of fancy complex instead of heading to see a baseball game .
The top of the stadium illustrates the city ’s rich history in steel with black steel rods accentuating the overhead structure .
If there is a turnoff of the ballpark , it would be the name of the stadium , but in today ’s world of stadiums named after soda brands and telephone companies , it ’s no surprise that this park is named after a bank .
There is some saving grace in the company that was chosen as the namesake for the stadium though and that is that the company is actually from Pittsburgh .
The ballpark cost $ 216 million to build and seats just over 38,000 fans .
Most of the seats are individual folding chairs with more than enough room between them so that fans do not feel like sardines .
While their team shop does not necessarily blow the patrons away , it is n’t so small that fans cannot find merchandise that interests them .
In addition to having memorabilia for the team , the shop also has a more than usual number of items that are geared towards the stadium and that are marketed after the architecture of the ball park .
It is truly unfortunate that this ballpark is not given the publicity it deserves simply because the teams it has hosted have not played well enough to garner it many nationally televised contests .
Fans who truly appreciate nice stadiums regardless of who is playing in them will enjoy a trip to PNC Park .

Even " The Simpsons " are n't immune to the economic slowdown .
Plans to immortalize the animated sitcom family in granite and possibly give them a home in the Hollywood neighborhood have been put on hold .
The statue is a project of KPDX ( 49 ) , which wanted to commemorate two anniversaries this year -- 20 years of airing the show since it began in 1989 and the station 's 25 years of operation .
" It was going to be our way to mark these dual milestones , " says Chloe Houser , host of " PDX TV Reports . "
" Hopefully , we 'll be able to revisit it . "
While other sites are being considered , Hollywood has expressed an interest .
The idea was greeted warmly in late January at a neighborhood association meeting .
" The Simpsons " creator , Matt Groening , was raised in Portland .
Houser , who is handling the project , says the statue would replicate the five - member family sitting on a couch watching TV , a scene in the 2007 " The Simpsons Movie . "
Success for the Far Right The Ghost of Haider Dominates Vote in Austria
Austrian right - wing populist Jörg Haider may have died last October , but his presence was impossible to ignore in a regional election in the Austrian state of Carinthia on Sunday .
His party did better than ever before .
I do n't know about you , but when I 'm jonesing for something sugary at work around 3 p.m. ( that 's usually about when I hit my wall ) , the last thing I 'm thinking about as I 'm jamming my quarters into the machine is , " I wonder what the history behind the Reese 's Peanut Butter Cup is .
How did it come to be ?
And who invented it ? "
But in case you are thinking that , here are seven candies that you will no longer have to wonder about .
Now if you 'll excuse me , I 'm suddenly craving something highly caloric and bad for me .
Oh Henry !
Bar
Lots of people think the Oh Henry ! bar was named for author O. Henry , but the bar was actually named for its creator , Tom Henry .
He ran the Peerless candy factory in Kansas and created the famous bar made of fudge , peanut and caramel in 1919 .
He cleverly called it the Tom Henry bar .
When the rights to the Tom Henry bar were bought out in 1920 , they new company renamed it the Oh Henry ! as part of a publicity stunt .
People were curious about bumper stickers and ads simply reading " Oh Henry ! " and sales spiked as they bought the bars to find out what the deal was .
Tom Henry 's family still runs a candy company in Kansas and sell the " Momma Henry " bar .
However , Hershey tells a different story on their Canadian website ( although Oh Henry ! is produced Hershey , Nestle owns it .
Weird , no ? ) : George H. Williamson made the candy originally and supposedly named the bar after boy who used to walk through the candy factory to flirt with the girls working there .
When the girls needed something or had an errand for the boy , they would call , " Oh Henry ! " and Henry would come running .
I think this sounds a lot like a publicity story , myself , but perhaps I 'm cynical .
Baby Ruth
Likewise , there are a couple of different tales as to where the Baby Ruth name came from .
As you 've probably noticed , it sounds suspiciously like the name of a certain famous baseball player .
But the Curtiss Candy Company claims they never intended it that way , that the bar was named for Ruth Cleveland .
Ruth was born between her dad's two terms as president and the nation was indeed crazy for her .
But the Baby Ruth bar came out in 1921 , and Ruth Cleveland died in 1904 at the age of 12 .
Ruth - mania had definitely subsided by the time the Baby Ruth bar came out .
Snopes says that the rumor that the bar was named for a baby is bunk .
It seems more likely that the company was capitalizing on Ruth 's name without having to pay him for the honor .
They say that Ruth was n't even well - known in 1921 and it would have been silly to name a candy bar after an obscure slugger , but Ruth had been playing the major and minor leagues since 1914 and by 1921 , he had already thrown a shutout in a World Series game , established himself as a power hitter , been involved in a highly - publicized salary feud , recorded a batting average that would n't be broken until 2001 , and had been traded from the Red Sox to the Yankees .
But I 'll let you decide - was the Baby Ruth named for Ruth Cleveland or George Herman " Babe " Ruth ?
Tootsie Roll and Tootsie Pop
This one is a lot easier to explain - no controversy here .
Leo Hirshfield opened his candy business in New York City in 1896 .
He invented a candy with the taste of chocolate , but it did n't melt in the heat like regular chocolate .
Another bonus : it was cheaper than real chocolate .
He named the product after his daughter , Clara , whom he called Tootsie .
Reese 's Peanut Butter Cups and Reese's Pieces
Harry Burnett
Reese was a candy maker who made " penny cups " - peanut butter cups that sold for a penny each - in his basement in the mid ' 20s .
He made an assortment of candy , actually , but when the Great Depression hit , he ceased production on his other products and concentrated on the popular peanut butter cups .
After his death in 1957 , the Reese empire was sold to Hershey for $ 23.5 million .
Heath Bar
In 1913 , a teacher by the name of L.S. Heath bought a sweet shop for his two sons , thinking it would be a good business venture for them .
The business - a combination candy store , manufacturer and ice cream parlor , was a big hit .

The story goes that they somehow got a toffee recipe from a traveling salesman and started selling it as " Heath English Toffee - America 's Finest . "
By 1928 , their dad owned a dairy , so the brothers started offering their toffee bars on the same order form as milk and cheese - customers could have the confection delivered right to their doorsteps , no muss , no fuss .
The popularity only increased when it was considered to be a good value during the Depression , and the Heath Bar 's place in history was cemented when the U.S.
Army bought $ 175,000 worth to include in the soldier 's rations during WWII ( the bar had a very long shelf life ) .
Amidst family feuds , the Heaths sold the company in 1989 and it was then acquired by Hershey in 1996 .
Hershey Bar , Hershey 's Kisses
Of course , the Hershey company and its namesake products are named after the company 's founder , Milton Hershey .
At first , though , the Hershey Chocolate Company was just a part of his first successful candy business , the Lancaster Caramel Company .
He sold it for $ 1 million in 1900 ( an astronomical sum in those days ) , but kept the Hershey Chocolate Company for himself .
The Hershey bar was first produced in 1894 and Kisses showed up in 1907 , likely a copycat of Wilbur Buds , produced by the competing Wilbur Chocolate Company since 1893 .
Clark Bar
Now owned by NECCO , the Clark Bar was named for its original owner and inventor , David L. Clark .
Although the D.L. Clark Company had been around since 1886 , it really hit paydirt in 1917 with the Clark Bar , the first " combination bar " that combined multiple confections in one product .
The D.L. Clark Company had success not just with the Clark Bar , but also with Zagnut .

If the EU has an answer to the intensifying financial firestorm in eastern Europe , it is keeping it to itself .
But the longer member states fiddle about , the greater the risk of a pan-continental conflagration – and of lasting damage to the EU 's core aspiration for wider and deeper union .
A fractious meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels this week seemed to sum up all that is wrong and does n't work in the EU .
Rather than urgently address massive Hungarian debt defaults , plunging Polish output , splintering Baltic coalitions , or Ukrainian street protests , they wasted time arguing over Slovenia 's arcane Adriatic fishing boat dispute with Croatia .
Richer west European states , led by Germany , fear eastern instability could further harm their struggling economies .
Austrian bank lending in eastern Europe , for example , is equivalent to about 80 % of Austria 's entire GDP .
Eastern borrowers must repay $ 400 bn in debt owed to western banks this year – or else everybody gets burned .
But worries about spreading contagion did not prevent " old Europe " holding up an EU commission plan to spend € 5bn on energy and other infrastructure projects , part of a € 200bn stimulus package that southern members like Spain and Greece say unfairly favours the east .
The main concern of Gordon Brown 's Eurosceptic Britain , meanwhile , seems to be stopping its pocket being picked by recent arrivals .
Robert Zoellick , the president of the World Bank , says the EU should take the lead in rescuing eastern Europe .
But the commission has reportedly already spent nearly half of its € 25bn emergency fund on Hungary and Latvia .
Much more will be needed .
But wealthier EU governments have yet to cough up – while private capital is moving in the opposite direction as western banks reduce their exposure .
It 's far from clear who , other than the eager - to - please Japanese , will fund the EU 's weekend call , backed by the US , for a doubling of IMF rescue resources .
Yet this gambit was itself evidence of political weakness – an indirect admission that Europe , where many new members ( and two old ones , Britain and Denmark ) have yet to adopt the euro , lacks union - wide financial institutions with the clout to deliver effective bail - outs .
The financier , George Soros , argued recently the unfolding crisis " has convincingly demonstrated the advantages of a common currency " .
Creating a " eurozone government bond market " would help raise much - needed rescue funds , he said .
Other commentators also want rapid expansion of the eurozone , to draw in laggards such as Poland .
Yet even if these ideas provided sure - fire solutions to eastern Europe 's woes , they remain political anathemas , for different reasons , in Britain and Germany .
The political ramifications of the EU 's indecision , if it continues , are many – but two main effects stand out .
One is the prospective definitive ending of an eastwards enlargement policy already crippled by the Lisbon treaty stalemate .
Not just Serbia , held back in any case by its failure to arrest accused war criminal Ratko Mladic , but also Montenegro , Macedonia , other Balkan countries , and Turkey have all seen their EU membership chances recede sharply in recent months as Europe 's weaknesses , economic , political and institutional , have been cruelly exposed .
Other casualties may include Armenia , Azerbaijan , Georgia , Moldova , Belarus , and Ukraine , potential members of the EU 's new " eastern partnership " due to be launched in May .
The scheme involves expanded free trade and economic and security cooperation , part of an ambitious nation and democracy - building programme .
In return , the EU hopes to expand its influence , secure non-Russian controlled energy routes and more broadly , to reduce Moscow 's influence in the former Soviet sphere .
Yet all this could now be jeopardised by the disarray in Brussels over the basic question of what to do about the swath of eastern Europe it already has .
The divisive , disillusioning impact of all this shilly - shallying on recent EU entrants is the other main political effect .
While wealthier states have boosted fiscal spending to mitigate the downturn , some new members are being forced to cut budgets .
" The immediate feeling of helplessness of the central and east Europeans is compounded by a more profound sense that their post - cold war growth model is broken , " said Katinka Barysch of the Centre for European Reform .
" The ingredients of past success – opening up to trade and investment and selling local banks to west European ones – have left these countries vulnerable .
The EU , which acted as an anchor for reform , has lost clout and credibility . "
In other words , faith in the vision of a Europe whole and free is in danger of eroding .
The crash of ' 09 , not unlike previous historical calamities , is calling into question the future of a united Europe .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Fresh off victory on President Obama 's signature $ 787 billion economic recovery plan , several top White House aides say they 're planning an ambitious agenda for the rest of February .
President Obama waves as he boards Air Force One for Chicago , where the Obamas were to spend the weekend .
The Senate had waited for the return of Democrat Sherrod Brown , who was returning from his mother 's wake in his home state of Ohio , to close the voting late Friday .
For the rest of the month , the White House agenda will focus on addressing the housing crisis , cleaning up the banking mess and laying the groundwork for reform of the health care system and entitlement programs like Medicare .
Obama 's economic stimulus plan , which top aides say will be signed into law as early as Monday at the White House , received no Republican votes in the House and just three in the Senate despite his heavy emphasis on drawing bipartisan support .
There have also been several Cabinet miscues in the early days , but top White House aides are confident the president has gotten off to a strong start .
" Does the road to change have some bumps ?
Sure , " said one senior White House aide .
" But we 're feeling good . "
Several White House aides noted that in addition to the stimulus win , the president has signed into law an equal pay act and legislation expanding a children 's ' health insurance program for an extra 4 million kids .
" There 's an enormity to what 's happened so far , " said one of the White House aides .
" It 's hard work , but it 's worth it .
We 're sprinting . "
Aides say they plan to pick up the pace next week with a stimulus signing ceremony as early as Monday , though it could slide to Tuesday morning depending on how quickly congressional leaders wrap up the legislative details .
Do n't Miss Senate OKs economic stimulus package
Then Obama starts his first trip out West as president because White House aides say they believe Obama himself is their best salesman on the big agenda items coming .
He will hold an economic event in Denver , Colorado , on Tuesday followed by the long - awaited unveiling , in Phoenix , Arizona , of his plan to deal with the foreclosure crisis on Wednesday .
White House aides are holding back on details of the housing plan as top officials continue to weigh the best approach .
Top Democrats like House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank have been pressing the White House for details , but White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Friday the goal is to get it right rather than rush it out .
" It 's not intended to be measured by one day 's market scorekeeping , but instead to ensure that the 10,000 Americans each day that have their homes foreclosed on , and the millions more that are barely getting by , are protected , " Gibbs said .
Several White
House aides say it is unlikely the president will reveal his choice for either commerce secretary or health and human services secretary next week .
As for which pick will be unveiled first , one aide said it depends on " whenever the next cake is baked " -- meaning the White House is so eager to get both nominations behind them that they will move forward on either one when the president makes up his mind on the picks .
The following week , the president will host what the White House is billing as a " fiscal responsibility " summit on February 23 .
The goal of the summit is to begin weighing the impact of massive federal programs like Social Security and Medicare just days before the president plans to unveil his first annual budget to Congressional leaders .
Then on February 24 , the president will deliver his first speech to a joint session of Congress .
Top aides say that while other topics like foreign policy could be addressed briefly , the speech will be heavily focused on the economy and the domestic agenda .
The president is expected to start taking on a role in selling the administration 's plans for fixing the financial regulatory system during the speech and in his travels , according to top aides .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner began rolling out a plan to bail out more banks and bring more accountability to the existing government bailout program known as TARP , but that unveiling received harsh reviews on Capitol Hill and on Wall Street .

Floral tributes were laid at the base
Two soldiers have been shot dead during a gun attack at an army base in County Antrim , the Ministry of Defence says .
A spokesman said " four other personnel " were injured , one of them critically , in the attack at Massereene army base in Antrim , 16 miles north of Belfast .
No one has said their gunmen carried out the attack , but it is thought to be the work of dissident republicans .
Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward condemned the shootings as " an act of criminal barbarism " .
Earlier reports suggested all those killed and injured were male .
The MoD said the next of kin of the dead soldiers had been informed .
' Murderous attack '
Mr Woodward added : " My thoughts are with the families of those killed and injured in this murderous attack .
" The contrast between those who serve the community and those who would destroy it could not be clearer .
The people who did this will be pursued and they will never stop the political process in Northern Ireland . "

The soldiers are the first to be murdered in Northern Ireland since Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick was killed by an IRA sniper in 1997 .
All four injured men have been taken to Antrim Area Hospital , about a mile away from the scene .
The condition of some were said to be serious .
' Loud bangs '
It is believed that there were two long busts of gunfire during the incident .
A major security operation is under way and the area surrounding the barracks , which is home to 38 Engineering Regiment , has been sealed off .
Eyewitness reports have suggested the victims were taking a pizza delivery when the shooting began .
One witness who lives near the base told the BBC how he looked to the sky after hearing what he thought were fireworks .
For the last 10 years , people believed things like this happened in foreign countries ...
Unfortunately it has returned to our doorstep

Democratic Unionist Party Antrim shooting : Political reaction Testing time for Northern Ireland
He added : " Then I heard a lot of loud bangs again , only it was a lot more than there was initially - maybe between 10 and 20 .
" Then the siren at the army barracks went off .
Then all you heard was the police sirens and ambulances and there was at least six ambulances .
" There was definitely six of the ambulances and God knows how many police cars - they just came out of the police station one after the other . "
In a statement , Downing Street said everything possible would be done to ensure those responsible would be brought to justice .
" This is a terrible incident that we utterly condemn and the prime minister 's thoughts , first and foremost , are with the families of those killed and with those seriously injured in this attack , " it continued .
Northern Ireland 's First Minister and Democratic Unionist Party leader Peter Robinson offered his sympathies to the families of the victims , and said he would postpone a scheduled trip to the United States .
Mr Robinson said the attack was " terrible reminder of the events of the past " .

David Ford , the leader of the Alliance Party , said it was " inconceivable " that the attack could have been carried out by anyone other than dissident republicans .
" The important thing is that we must not see politics and the peace settlement that we have , fragile though it is , destabilised by this kind of action , " he added .
The attack comes shortly after Sir Hugh Orde , the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland , requested the Special Reconnaissance Regiment 's help to gather intelligence on dissident republicans .
He had said the threat against his officers and military personnel was at its highest for almost a decade .
Mr Robinson said the Massereene attack vindicated his decision , which had been criticised by Sinn Fein .
In 2008 , dissident republicans attempted to kill PSNI officers during separate incidents in Derry City and Dungannon , Co Tyrone .
Security forces defused a 300 lb ( 136kg ) bomb in Castlewellan , Co Down , close to a barracks in February 2009 .

He said : " For the last 10 years , people believed things like this happened in foreign countries , places like Basra .
Unfortunately it has returned to our doorstep . "
The leader of the nationalist SDLP , Mark Durkan , condemned the " murderous " attacks .
" Those who committed it are steeped in the mindset and means of past violence , " he added .
" They need to understand this is not an attack on British army but the Irish people who have voted for and value above all else peaceful politics and democratic accommodation . "

In the Queen ’s speech , the Government said that it would introduce a Communications Data Bill in this session which would include the transposition of EU law into UK law .
This would have given the opportunity for full scrutiny of important issues affecting security , the powers of the state and the privacy of the citizen .
They have not so far brought forward the Bill and it is not clear that they will do in this session .
Or ever .
Currently service providers are required by the state to retain mobile and land line telephone records .
The SI will require them to retain records about the source , destination , date , time , duration and type of our online communications .
That is to say , our use of the internet through computers including all our email traffic .
Tomorrow the House of Lords will consider a Home Office statutory instrument ( SI ) on data retention – the Data Retention ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2009 .
This may seem like a technical little measure and the Government would like us to believe this .
In fact , this SI , which transposes EU legislation into UK law , will substantially extend the range of information on our personal communications that service providers must collect and make available to government agencies on demand .
Recently the Home Secretary said in a speech that primary legislation might be required , which gives rise to the suspicion that the Government may think it possible to proceed with the Intercept Modernisation Programme without coming to Parliament for primary legislation .
It is against this background that the Government have brought forward the SI separately , which minimises the chance for proper discussion .
The Government says this extension is necessary because information about communications is vital to the fight against terrorism and organised crime .
As Shadow Security Minister
I know that communications data plays a central role .
The Government have a right to make the case and be listened to carefully .
But what they are not entitled to do is to sneak powers into law without giving a proper chance for scrutiny – SIs do not go through a full legislative procedure – nor bring about a situation in which the already abusively wide powers of the Regulation of Investigation Powers Act 2000 ( RIPA ) are extended still further .
RIPA was introduced on the grounds of national security but now has immense scope .
It authorises public bodies to have access to data not just for the purposes of preventing and detecting crime but also in relation to such vaguely defined matters as ‘ economic well - being ’… , ‘ protecting public health ’… and ‘ tax collection ’ .
Moreover , it ’s not just the security and intelligence services and the police which have powers under the Act but all 474 local councils in England , every NHS trust and fire service , 139 prisons , the Environment Agency and even Royal Mail .
Among others .
It is this intrusive right of investigation put in the hands of quite middle - ranking public officials that has led to the pernicious misuse of the power of the state against ordinary citizens for trivial things – to see whether children at a village shop have the right paperwork to deliver papers , whether a nursery is selling pot plants unlawfully , to check on your dustbins , to stop dog fouling , and to check if children are going to the right local school .
After lots of pressure – not least from our party – the Government finally admitted last December that RIPA went too far .
The Home Secretary announced that the Act that had led , in her words , to the ‘ dustbin stasi ’ , would be cut back .
So before introducing the SI with its further increment of power for the state , one might have expected the Government to keep its promise about cutting back the abusive power of the legislation to which it is linked .
But not a bit of it .
The Explanatory Memorandum attached to the SI tells us that ‘ no changes to the safeguards set out in that Act [ RIPA ] are planned ’ which it smoothly goes on to say ‘ provide a rigorous check against disproportionate interferences with individuals ’ right to respect of their privacy ’ .
Unbelievable , I hear you saying .
So much for promises only three months old .
The Conservative Party is opposed to a Statutory Instrument introducing sensitive new powers in a way that short circuits Parliamentary scrutiny and which is tied to an outrageously intrusive law which stands in urgent need of curtailment .
Moreover , we do not know - because there is no guidance with the SI - how its provisions sit with what we have heard about the Government ’s ideas on how the data should be stored – in particular whether a large centralised Government controlled data base will come into being .
It looks as if we are being asked to take a lot on that precious commodity called trust .
As it is not possible just to vote down the SI in the Lords , I have tabled a motion calling on the Government to withdraw this instrument and bring forward primary legislation on the retention of communications data that will enable detailed – and rigorous – Parliamentary scrutiny to take place .
Whale hedge sculpture proves a big hit in seaside town
This gardener must have had a whale of a time sculpting this giant hedge .
The enormous sculpture , with its big smile and flicked - out tail , has proved a big hit in the seaside town of Whitstable , Kent .
Its creator , Nicki Leggatt , 59 , a senior lecturer at Canterbury Christ Church University , said she decided to transform the hedge outside her detached home when she first moved to the area .
Having a whale of a time :
The marine - themed hedge is popular with the residents of Whitstable
She said : ' It was just a huge overgrown privet hedge when I first moved here in 2003 .
' In my first year here , I cut it into a rough shape by hand and then I bought some electric trimmers and I 've been cutting it ever since . '
The marine sculpture has attracted plenty of attention and has become a popular attraction for parents and children .
' Loads and loads of people have noticed it and bring their kids down to have a look at him which is just lovely , ' she said .
' I normally cut it in the summer - I 'm growing the end of the tail which is why it looks a bit messy at the moment .
' I feel like I have a duty to maintain it now . '
Flashback : A seasonal Christmas pudding hedge by Roger Holley from Yeovil
For Christmas this year , she put an oversized Father Christmas hat on his head for a bit of festive fun , but it was stolen - twice .
She found the hat in a nearby road after the first incident , but after replacing it , another thief made off with it .
' I do n't really mind , it 's quite funny in a way , ' she said .
' But it is strange that some people feel a need to ruin things that are started for other people 's enjoyment . '
In 2006 , a similar whale - shaped hedge in Brixton , South London , had to be trimmed back after Lambeth council complained that it was a health and safety danger .
Its creator , architect Zac Munro , 36 , denied that it was a hazard and said it was popular with the local community .

Here is a LINK to the network of seed dealers , distributors , and wholesalers that market Seminis / Monsanto seeds to the retail outlets and professional grower .
The list is too extensive to print here .
The Seminis patents , located HERE , are mainly for hybrids and cross-breeding to develop certain traits .
With Monsanto in the mix however , I expect we can see some changes .
Here is a LINK to the 4,336 Monsanto patents .
When you buy seeds , make sure they are heirloom seeds , and not hybrid or genetically modified .
Check out the companies , and if they purchase their seeds from Seminis , find another company because you are supporting Monsanto when you buy their products .
Save the seeds from your heirloom crops and start your own seed bank , because very soon , clean seeds will be unavailable unless they come from you or your neighbor .
It is up to us to do the research , ask the questions , then follow through by action .
Boycott Monsanto / Seminis seeds .

In Sector 3 - 4 repair work on the cryogenic pipeline that supplies liquid helium to the magnets has been completed .
During the incident in September last year some of the connecting pipes between the magnets and the pipeline were damaged .
These have now been completely repaired .

WikiLeaks Press Releases
Coleman leak update
By Staff
WIKILEAKS PRESS RELEASE
Wed Mar 12 11:39:23 GMT
2009
Many of you have had questions in relation to the Coleman database leak .
Wikileaks can not reply to all inquiries individually , so we have prepared what we hope will be answers suitable for everyone :
1 ) Wikileaks is a non-partisan public service :
Wikileaks is an international public service primarily based out of Stockholm , Nairobi and Washington .
Wikileaks protects confidential sources trying to get information to the press and journalists who have been censored .
We protect all our sources under the Swedish Press Freedom Act , which provides criminal sanctions against those attempting to breach source - journalist confidentiality .
We are also personally bound by this law as are all our contractors .
Wikileaks protects sources regardless of country or political alignment .
In practice , most of our work is related to human rights violations , corruption and preventing censorship .
We are banned in the United Arab Emirates and China .
We do n't just talk about neutrality -- we practice it .
Many of you have asked whether we would publish similar material from the Democrats .
The answer is yes .
All documents that fit our simple , transparent guidelines are released to the public .
We are non-partisan and have published many documents considered to be supportive of Republican interests that have become major news items .
Examples :
If you have confidential or censored documents on a matter of political , diplomatic , ethical or historical importance you can be confident that we will protect you .
For more information about our work , including contact details in various cities , see :
For secure access :
2 ) Coleman released full credit details , but Wikileaks did not .
Although the Coleman database contains full credit card numbers , security numbers and all personal necessary details needed to make a transaction .
Wikileaks did not release these .
Wikileaks released the last 4 digits and the security numbers only , and then only after notifying those concerned :
A number of people tried to raise the issue back in January , without releasing any information at all .
There was no response from the Coleman Campaign and the material had been " floating around " the Internet for at least six weeks .
Please try to avoid the quite natural desire to shoot the messenger .
Coleman supporters only know about the issue because of our work .
Had it been up to Senator Coleman , they would never have known .
As part of our public benefit maximization strategy , we privately contact concerned parties before releasing a major leak .
That is why we contacted Coleman supporters directly .
We would have liked donors to have had several days to digest the findings in private , but Senator Coleman decided to publicly " spin " the issue , including denying that any leak had occurred , forcing us to respond .
References :
3 ) The database was made public by the Coleman Campaign .
There was no " hack " .
The database was made publicly available for a short period of time by Coleman staff as http://colemanforsenate.com/db/database.tar.gz on Jan 28 and possibly other days .
This is clearly due to sloppy handling by the Coleman Campaign .
References : Several articles from January 28-30
This updated article is the most approachable :
Attempts by the Coleman Campaign to blame others , rather than just admitting fault and getting on with it are to be condemned .
4 ) By Law , the Coleman Campaign should never have stored donors ' security details
The idea behind " back of the card " security numbers is that they are never to be stored but only used to authenticate the transaction at the time it is made .
The Coleman Campaign stored " back of the card " security numbers for donors .
This is both illegal under Minnesota law , which requires their destruction within 48 hours , and a breach of the contract credit card companies demand .
References :
Minnesota Law H.F. 1758 : Subd .
2 . Security or identification information ; retention prohibited .
No person or entity conducting business in Minnesota that accepts an access device in connection with a transaction shall retain the card security code data , the PIN verification code number , or the full contents of any track of magnetic stripe data , subsequent to the authorization of the transaction or in the case of a PIN debit transaction , subsequent to 48 hours after authorization of the transaction .
A person or entity is in violation of this section if its service provider retains such data subsequent to the authorization of the transaction or in the case of a PIN debit transaction , subsequent to 48 hours after authorization of the transaction .

Because the Coleman Campaign violated these standards it may be liable for any associated fraud .
5 ) By Law , the Coleman Campaign should have notified notified donors
Although aware of the public exposure of the data since January , the Coleman Campaign did nothing to notify donors , in violation Minnesota law .
References :
Section ( 3 ) , as stated above , showing that the Coleman Campaign had been informed in January , that the information was public and that it had been downloaded .

Recent statements by the Coleman Campaign showing they were aware of the exposure at the time .
Minnesota Statute 325E.61 " Notice Required for Certain Disclosures " .
Subdivision 1 . Disclosure of personal information ; notice required .
(a) Any person or business that conducts business in this state , and that owns or licenses data that includes personal information , shall disclose any breach of the security of the system following discovery or notification of the breach in the security of the data to any resident of this state whose unencrypted personal information was , or is reasonably believed to have been , acquired by an unauthorized person .
The disclosure must be made in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay ,

" The Big Bad Database of Senator Norm Coleman "
By Staff
WIKILEAKS PRESS RELEASE
Wed Mar 11 13:00:43 GMT 2009
Senator Norm Coleman , explaining
Wikileaks has released detailed lists of the controversial Republican Senator Norm Coleman 's supporters and donors .
Some 51,000 individuals are represented .
Although politically interesting in their own right , the lists , which are part of an enormous 4.3 Gb database leak from the Coleman campaign , provide proof to the rumors that sensitive information -- including thousands of supporter 's credit card numbers -- were put onto the Internet on January 28 as a result of sloppy handling .
Senator Coleman collected detailed information on every supporter and website visitor and retained unencrypted credit card information from donors , including their security codes .
Although made aware of the leak in January , Senator Coleman kept the breach secret , failing to inform contributors , in violation of Minnesota Statute 325E.61 .
The statute states that organizations that become aware of such a disclosure of sensitive unencrypted personal information must notify the individuals concerned " in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay " and " immediately following discovery . "
The information circulated on the Internet for six weeks before a warning was sent by Wikileaks to those affected , pending its analysis of the material .
Yesterday Wikileaks sent two notifications to Coleman 's supporters as a courtesy prior to releasing a subset of the data .
Today Senator Coleman 's Campaign manager Cullen Sheehan tried to spin the issue , claiming somewhat fantastically that no data had been downloaded , that the culprits would be caught and that all donors should cancel their credit cards .
No apology was made for the initial leak or its cover up .
In response Wikileaks has had to bring forward its public announcement .
The open government group has released two files , a detailed list of 4,721 on - line donors with the last four digits of their credit cards as proof and a list of some 51,641 supporters .
The full database comprises over 30 tables of information , including personal details , full credit card numbers , passwords and " back of card " security numbers .
Wikileaks will release other material from the extensive Coleman database once those affected have time to be informed .
The initial whistleblower letter to Wikileaks stated :
TO WIKILEAKS / TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN / TO INTERESTED MEDIA :
The attached files comprise a snapshot of the website database of the Norm Coleman campaign as of January 28 , 2009 .
The database was exposed by the incompetence of Coleman 's website personnel , making the information public for a period of time .
The fact that this database was improperly exposed by Norm Coleman 's own staff , can be verified here : http://butyoureagirl.com/2009/01/28/did-norm-coleman-fake-his-own-website-death/ and http://www.politicsinminnesota.com/2009/jan30/1770/epic-recount-website-fail-one-dot-one-dot-one-dot-one
That said , I feel it is very important that the actual database be provided to a trusted media liaison , for several reasons : A ) The Coleman campaign 's effort to impugn the election processes in the State of Minnesota have gone beyond mere political rigor into partisan malfeasance of the sort that has plagued this country for the past eight years , to the benefit of nobody and the great detriment of the citizens of this State ; B ) The Coleman campaign has illegally collected personal financial details of its donors , in the form of unencrypted credit card numbers , without reporting this as required in the Minnesota Government Data Practices
Act ( under which citizens are entitled to such notification for each significant unit of data stored ) ; C ) The Coleman campaign 's incompetence in managing said personal information has lead to the release of this information to the Internet at large , potentially exposing the donors to fraud , identity theft , financial harm and potential political persecution ; D ) The citizens and donors have a right to know that their personal information was exposed ; E ) Notification to users of such exposure of personal information is also required under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act : https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/statutes/?id=325E.61
however the Coleman campaign has made no attempt to contact their supporters over the issue , despite being made aware of it , and despite the database floating around the Internet .
F )
The failure of the Coleman campaign to faithfully disclose the above to the citizens of the State of Minnesota will result in further such indiscretions by its elected officials by fostering an atmosphere of impunity in matters of campaign finance and personal data privacy .
G )
The public has a right to know .

WikiLeaks notifying mails to Coleman supporters
On Tuesday 10th and early Wednesday 11th of March 2009 , WikiLeaks informed the supporters listed in Norm Coleman 's database about the security breach and that the information will be released online .
As with other cases of mass disclosure , like the BNP membership list , WikiLeaks is sending out notifications to victims of security breaches to ensure they become aware of the leak and can act up on it .
While Norm Coleman and his campaign team were aware of the breach back in January , and the lists had circulated for months on the Internet and various file - sharing portals , they decided not to inform their supporters , which while being plain disrespectful , also violates Minnesota Statute 325E.61 .

Coleman Campaign " spin " letter to supporters
Wed 11 Mar 2009 from the Cullen Sheehan , Coleman Campaign Manager to response to a pre-release courtesy note sent to Coleman supporters by Wikileaks informing them of the upcoming publication .
Nearly all of the Sheehan claims are false or " spin " .
Dear Supporter , Last evening , we began receiving emails and phone calls from donors - and non-donors - who reported receiving messages from an email address : press-office@wikileaks.org stating that they possessed information about the individual and were threatening to post that information online .
We immediately contacted the appropriate federal law enforcement authorities and they are aggressively investigating this matter .
We take the privacy and confidentiality of our donors and supporters extremely seriously .
In January , an event occurred that made us fearful that our firewalls might have been breached .?
We contacted federal authorities at that time , and they reviewed logs from the server in question as well as additional firewall logs .?
They indicated that , after reviewing those logs , they did not find evidence that our database was downloaded by any unauthorized party .
Let me be very clear :?
At this point , we do n't know if last evening 's email is a political dirty trick or what the objective is of the person who sent the email .
What we do know , however , is that there is a strong likelihood that these individuals have found a way to breach private and confidential information .
But because of this uncertainty , and out of an abundance of caution , we have begun contacting our supporters to provide them with as much information as we currently have available .
Given the nature of this threat , if you have concerns about whether or not your credit card that was used to make a donation to the campaign has been compromised , we encourage ou to contact your credit card company to cancel the card .?
If you have any questions , please contact us at the Coleman for Senate Campaign at ( 651 ) 645-0766 .
All of our donors and supporters should be assured that our campaign will work with all appropriate federal and state law enforcement agencies to take all appropriate legal action to identify the individual or individuals who may be involved in this matter and to pursue all appropriate legal action against them .
Sincerely , Cullen Sheehan Campaign Manager

The Vatican gave the Creationist lobby a left right sign of the cross today , announcing it would stage a conference on Darwinism next month and declaring that it was one of the Fathers of the Church that thought up the idea in the first place .
At one point the conference at the Pontifical Gregorian University was n't going to give Creationism or Intelligent Design a hearing at all .
But apparently the organisers have relented , and will consider Intelligent Design as a " cultural phenomenon " rather than as a valid scientific theory , giving US - based IDers the chance to be smirked at by a room full of Monseigneurs , Cardinals and Bishops .
Previewing the conference yesterday , Archbishop Gianfranco Ravasi , head of the Church 's Pontifical Council for Culture , conceded the Church had been hostile to Darwin on occasion .
But , he said , the Church had never formally condemned Darwin , and he noted that in the last 50 years a number of Popes had accepted evolution as a valid scientific approach to human development .
Indeed , he said , evolution could be traced back through Scholastics such as St Thomas Aquinas to St Augustine in the fourth century , who had noted that " big fish eat smaller fish " .
Augustine is probably more famous for praying " God , make me good - but not yet . "
Which also has some evolutionary overtones if you think about it .
Marc Leclerc , a natural philosopher at the University went further , saying Creationists were mistaken in arguing that that Darwinism was " totally incompatible with a religious vision of reality " .
The conference , and the Church 's endorsement of Darwin , represents another curve ball from the Holy See at other , arguably more fundamentalist , streams of Christianity .
In December Pope Benedict tipped his hat to Galileo - who definitely was condemned by the Church - while simultaneously going all New Age by blethering on about the Solstice .
Last May , the Vatican astronomer really went out on a limb , claiming there was nothing incompatible between being a Catholic and believing in Aliens .
He even suggested Aliens could be free of the stain of original sin , the stubborn blemish that has condemned humanity to a progressive decline from the Garden of Eden , through slavery , the dark ages , religious strife , atomic war , and now , the credit crunch and Simon Cowell .
But a wholesale worldview rejig this is not .
Other branches of modern science get shorter shrift , with genetic manipulation fairly high on the Vatican 's current do n't - like list . ®
It 's no secret that North America is going through some tough financial times .
And in spite of the common perception that video games are recession proof , the industry has been hit pretty hard , with layoffs and studio closings dominating the headlines .
Of course , even gamers are n't immune to the recession .
And while game sales have remained relatively strong , many gamers are seeking other ways to get their gaming fix from a limited budget .
So we talked to the minds behind online marketplaces Dawdle and Goozex to learn about some of the options that frugal gamers have .
Online marketplaces are nothing new , but it can often be frustrating to find specific items , such as a hard - to - find game , on sites like eBay .
Dawdle aims to fix this with an market designed specifically for the gamers .
" Dawdle 's built just for gaming , " President and CEO Sachin Agarwal told Ars .
This includes a streamlined system for listing , selling , and buying games .
" You just search by name — or if you 're fancy , search by UPC — pick from the drop downs , and you 're done . "
The site also features another added benefit in these economic times : no listing fees .
This all seems to benefit Agarwal 's venture , as site activity has actually increased over recent months .
" Things have picked up for us , certainly , " he explained .
According to Agarwal , one of the reasons that consumers are still buying games in an economy like this is the fact that they know that those games can later be resold on services like Dawdle , recouping at least a portion of whatever money was spent .
" It 's risk mitigation , " he explained .
The used games market has come under fire of late — especially by publishers — for having a negative effect on the industry .
But unlike the way popular dedicated game retailers handle it , Dawdle is attempting something that will benefit everyone : publishers , consumers , and retailers .
" If someone sells their used game for $ 40 on Dawdle instead of trading it in for $ 20 in - store credit at GameStop , we can do things to incent the seller to spend those cash money proceeds on new games , " Agarwal told Ars .
" Either by partnering with the publisher or a retailer to bankroll that incentive . "
This technique is paying off , as Dawdle is currently in talks to partner with a number of different developers and publishers — and possibly even some retailers — though nothing has been announced at this point .
But for those who'd rather not go out and purchase games at all , even used ones , there is always the trading route .
And with the advent of online trading sites , this process is now simpler than ever .
" There is no bartering with others , no money lost on trade - ins at stores , and no time spent negotiating a price , " Goozex founder Jonathan Dugan told Ars.
Goozex is the largest video game - trading site in North America , which allows gamers to swap games using a points system .
" To ensure fair trades , Goozex provides a standard value in Goozex points for every individual video game on each system available on the site , " Dugan explained .
" The points system was developed and based on a patented algorithm that allows Goozex to assign value to each and every game in the system .
By removing the idea of cash , members can game and participate on Goozex without having to worry about allocating significant portions of their budgets to gaming . "
Like Dawdle , Dugan has seen activity on his site increase recently , given the rise in demand for more affordable gaming solutions .
" As gamers and their families continue to weather the current economic storm , we see the trend to find an escape from reality via gaming , " Dugan told Ars .
" Game trading volumes continue to rise , as well as values that gamers receive when they offer their games available for trade . "
And while many people in the industry believe that the used game market is a bad thing for gaming , naturally , Dugan does n't agree .
" I think overall , secondhand games only help the industry , " he explained .
" Say you ’re an Xbox 360 RPG fan and you can only afford Fable II or Fallout 3 .
The person can purchase the game they want , play it , and then trade it to get the other game they could n’t afford at the time .
What you then get is more and more people viewing and experiencing a game that they may not otherwise have access to . "
With both Goozex and Dawdle seeing a steady increase in business , it looks like gamers agree .
They claimed the unidentified black metal object stands out clearly against the blue sky , where it can be seen darting up and down for more than 10 minutes .
In a few weeks time , members of the European Parliament will vote on the Medina report , which proposes a wide range of anti-piracy measures and regulations .
The report specifically mentions
The Pirate Bay , and it approves actions by national courts against the popular BitTorrent tracker .
The proposals in the report , drafted by the 73 year old Spanish socialist Manuel Medina Ortega , show many similarities to the wish lists of the RIAA , IFPI and MPAA we published earlier .
The report calls for more responsibility and liability for ISPs , while copyright infringing content has to be filtered from the Internet .
Even though the European Parliament has voted against so called “ three - strikes ” proposals twice before , this is also suggested as a viable measure against piracy .
It ’s proposed that ISPs should disconnect subscribers who share copyrighted content , based on information provided by the entertainment industry .
In addition , national courts are encouraged to take action against BitTorrent sites such as The Pirate Bay .
Apparently , the report deems BitTorrent sites to be illegal – which is a bold statement without any legal backup .
Last year , Italy imposed a nation wide block on The Pirate Bay , but this was reversed in court due to a lack of jurisdiction ; this might change if the new proposals are adopted .
In a draft of the report we read “ The activities of websites that are part of the peer - to - peer phenomenon and which allow downloading of protected works or services without the necessary authorisation are illegal , and no exception can be applied to them .
So the activity of internet users who send files to their peers must be regarded as an illegal act of communication to the public without the possibility of exceptions being applied . ”
ISPs are further encouraged to identify and filter copyright infringing content on their networks .
As we ’ve said before , this might work on networks such as FastTrack / Kazaa , but it remains unclear what methods the ISP will have to implement to distinguish between copyright infringing and legal content on more tricky networks , such as BitTorrent .
That will be a tough job , if not impossible .
In common with RIAA recommendations , the report suggests that ISPs should be held liable for the actions of their customers .
More details are available on La Quadrature , with Jérémie Zimmermann , co-founder of the site commenting , “ The Medina report is ridiculous and full of repressive measures .
It is in total contradiction with what MEPs voted twice against ‘ graduated response ’ and with the realities of Internet .
It only favors entertainment industries and does n’t contain anything for culture , the artists , or their public . ”
Of course , we encourage all of our European readers to write to their representatives in the European Parliament , as this is clearly not the right path to take .

Mother ' held like a prisoner for three days ' as hospital staff threatened to call police over baby 's radiator burn
A mother has spoken of how she was ' held like a prisoner ' in a hospital , after her baby was burned by a radiator .
Hospital staff suspected Mandy Stopler of abusing daughter Madison , after the 10 - month - old suffered an inch - long burn on her bottom .
The 26 - year - old was told that the police would be called if she tried to leave the hospital with her daughter .
Madison endured 18 X - rays and two distressing brain scans in order to ensure that she had not come to harm at the hands of her mother .
Mandy Stopler was held in hospital for three days after staff suspected her of abusing 10 - month - old daughter Madison
Despite the hospital 's fears , mother and daughter slept in the same room , but were checked upon every four hours to make sure Madison was not being abused .
Both social services and Madison 's health visitor had provided the hospital with a glowing reference for the mother , however Miss Stopler and her daughter were only allowed to leave the hospital after doctors were satisfied with the results of the tests .
' I expected to be in the hospital for a few hours while Madison was treated for the burn mark , ' said Miss Stopler .
' But they were n't interested in that at all , in fact they did n't even give her any cream or anything . '
' I ended up being held like a prisoner for three days and threatened with arrest if I tried to leave with Madison .
' Madison is a very happy baby , she is the world to me and has n't got a bruise on her .
' I can understand the hospital being extra-cautious in the wake of the Baby P scandal but Baby P went to the doctors 16 times with injuries and bruises .
' My daughter had nothing like that and has no history with social services . '
Suspect : Miss Stopler had rushed baby Madison to hospital after suffering a minor burn on a radiator pipe
Madison 's injury was caused when she was crawling around her bedroom without her nappy on .
The 10 - month - old accidentally burnt her bottom on the radiator pipe while her mother was running her bath .
Miss Stopler had just moved into the house in Bournemouth , Dorset , and her father had been due to lag the bare pipe the very next day .
She had taken Madison to the doctor , but was referred to Poole Hospital .
Doctors there waited five hours to treat the minor injury before telling Miss Stopler she was ' under caution ' .
Miss Stopler , a cleaner , said : ' After five hours a doctor said to me that I was under suspicion of child neglect or abuse .
' I was told I was n't allowed to take her home otherwise they would call the police who would bring us straight back .
I was in total shock .
' I think they thought I had been shaking her and she had some internal injuries .
' She had X - ray after X - ray and she was so distressed when she had the brain scans .
' She had to be starved from 7 am to 2 pm because she had to be sedated for the scans .
' They were pulling her about because she was struggling .
She was screaming and I was in tears and so was my mother who was with us . '
Miss Stopler was told that she could leave the hospital , but not with her daughter and so lived there for the three days .
' A mother would never leave her baby , never , ' she said .
' At night they locked us in a room and checked on us every four hours to make sure I had n't harmed her .
' They came in and switched the lights on , woke Madison up , picked her up and checked her temperature . '
On the day Madison left the hospital Miss Stopler returned to her home to meet with social workers .
' I was glad when the social services got involved because I knew there was nothing wrong with Madison , ' she said .
' Madison 's health visitor , who I see once a week , kept calling the hospital to say what a good mother I was . '
Miss Stopler is now seeking an apology for her and her daughter 's three day ordeal .
' Nobody has said sorry to me and they are n't going to , ' she said .
' Are they going to treat every parent who takes their child into hospital in this way in the future ?
' Now I 'm scared to go back if Madison so much as grazes herself . '
A spokesman for Poole Hospital said : ' We take the welfare and safety of children very seriously .
' When a child presents with injuries we need to be absolutely sure that those injuries are accidental .
' There are clear policies and procedures which we must observe .
' We realise that this may be disturbing for the parents or family but the safety of the child is our priority . '
Whenever some new perceived crisis comes along , Americans typically look to the state as a problem solver .
Are we running out of oil ?
The government should increase CAFE standards so that cars are more fuel - efficient .
Is gas too expensive ?
The government should limit the profits of oil companies .
Is the planet getting warmer ?
The government should mandate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions .
Are too many Americans without health insurance ?
The government should expand Medicaid and SCHIP to address the problem .
Will taking drugs destroy your life ?
The government should ban them .
My applause is muted , however , for conservatives who rightly criticize the state ’s decreeing solutions to these “ problems . ”
Most conservatives never met a federal program they did n’t like as long as it furthered their agenda .
As we have seen regarding its support for the Iraq war and lack of support for presidential candidate Ron Paul , the conservative movement has of late exalted the state and its leaders above all else , including liberty .
As Lew Rockwell of the Ludwig von Mises Institute has explained ,
“ The problem with American conservatism is that it hates the left more than the state , loves the past more than liberty , feels a greater attachment to nationalism than to the idea of self - determination , believes brute force is the answer to all social problems , and thinks it is better to impose truth rather than risk losing one soul to heresy .
It has never understood the idea of freedom as a self - ordering principle of society .
It has never seen the state as the enemy of what conservatives purport to favor .
It has always looked to presidential power as the saving grace of what is right and true about America . ”
Thus , the same conservatives who condemn the welfare state ( while typically accepting it anyway ) have no trouble condoning the nanny state .
Liberals , of course , generally accept both , although they can be quite selective when it comes to the extent of the nanny state ’s reach .
A nanny state is a government that majors in micro-managing the behavior of its citizens .
From federal warning labels to state seat - belt laws to local school - district bans on dodgeball and tag , instead of “ father knows best ” it is government that knows best .
Making people criminals
The nanny state garners the most support when it comes to criminalizing the advertising , sale , or use of what it deems to be harmful substances .
Although tobacco is n’t illegal ( cigarette taxes are a nice source of revenue for federal and state governments ) , cigarette advertising has been banned on television and radio since 1971 .
Ads for smokeless tobacco ceased in 1986 .
On the state level and local level , more than 50 percent of Americans live in an area where smoking anywhere outside their own home — including bars and restaurants — has basically been banned completely .
A law that took effect in California earlier this year outlawed smoking in a car in the presence of a minor .
I knew that the drinking age in my state ( Florida ) was 21 .
I knew that alcohol could not be sold after a certain time at night .
I knew that alcohol could not be purchased on Sunday until after a certain time .
But I did n’t know that many parents in Florida who probably support those laws were themselves criminals because they let their children have a beer or a glass of wine at home .
I have seen posted in several convenience stores around the state of Florida the following sign :
“ Notice .
It is unlawful for anyone ( including parents ) to sell , give , or serve an alcoholic beverage to a person under 21 years of age . ”
I confirmed that this is in fact the case by consulting Florida statute 562.11 , which states that “ it is unlawful for any person to sell , give , serve , or permit to be served alcoholic beverages to a person under 21 years of age . ”
Those under 21 who were served alcohol would also be criminals under Florida statute 562.111 , which states that “ it is unlawful for any person under the age of 21 years , except a person employed under the provisions of s. 562.13 acting in the scope of her or his employment , to have in her or his possession alcoholic beverages . ”
Yet , even though possessing and drinking alcoholic beverages is permitted for adults in the state of Florida , making more than 100 gallons of your own beer or wine is forbidden by state statute and federal law , as is selling any of it .
The war on drugs is another of the government ’s bogus wars that we are all too familiar with .
It , more than anything else , is responsible for the rise of a police state in America .
It has also resulted in a prison state .
The United States , with less than 5 percent of the world ’s population , has almost a quarter of the world ’s prisoners .
The United States has one of the highest per-capita prison populations in the world .
One in 32 American adults is in prison , on probation , or on parole .
Yet more than half of all U.S. prisoners are incarcerated for low - level drug offenses .
The nanny state is at its prime when it comes to monitoring consensual behavior that some people find objectionable , e.g. , gambling , pornography , and prostitution .
Since I live in Pensacola , Florida , I will give some examples from incidents that happened here within the last year .
Four businesses were shut down , and their computers , cash , and records were seized , following an undercover investigation of illegal gambling .
The state attorney ’s office alleged that special plastic credit - type cards were being used at the four establishments to go online and gamble for cash prizes .
The computer games replicated the sounds of a slot machine , with the clamor of bells greeting a winning spin .
Since the state of Florida has a lottery , it is obvious that gambling itself is not the problem .
The problem is gambling in which the state does n’t get a cut of the action .
Before the illegal - gambling crackdown , five men were arrested for illegally producing and distributing pornographic videos .
The films were made by adults in their homes or at local hotels and then posted on the Internet where subscribers paid $ 30 a month to watch them .
The state attorney ’s office charged the men with racketeering , which means that they face up to 60 years in prison , despite the fact that hardcore pornographic magazines can be purchased at newsstands and convenience stores throughout Pensacola and the state of Florida .
More than a dozen men from Pensacola were recently arrested across the border in Alabama following a two - week , undercover sex sting .
They are all being charged with soliciting prostitution , a misdemeanor .
Yet , picking up the tab for dinner and a movie for the same purpose does not violate the law .
What makes this case even more egregious is that it was undercover female officers posing as prostitutes who ensnared the men .
The world ’s oldest profession is , of course , not limited to Pensacola , Florida .
Down in Orlando three employees of the Orlando Weekly newspaper were charged with aiding in the commission of prostitution because they helped prostitutes design ads masked as escort services .
Once again , female undercover officers were the ones who placed the ads in the newspaper .
Examples like these in Florida could be multiplied many times over if we looked at what goes on in the other 49 states and the District of Columbia .
Yet , the nature of crime , the nature of government , and the nature of liberty are contrary to what we call “ law enforcement . ”
Vices and crimes
The problem with the moral crusades of the nanny state is that vices are not true crimes .
As the 19th - century classical - liberal political philosopher Lysander Spooner explained it ,
“ Vices are those acts by which a man harms himself or his property .
Crimes are those acts by which one man harms the person or property of another . ”
Every crime needs a victim .
Victimless crimes such as drug use , purchasing beer on Sunday morning , giving your teenager a glass of wine , making a pornographic video , gambling without the state ’s permission , or using the services of a prostitute have no victim .
They are consensual acts between two or more parties that harm only the sensibilities of puritanism , which , as H.L. Mencken once said , is “ the haunting fear that someone , somewhere , may be happy . ”
There should be no vice agents , no undercover sting operations , and no jail time for growing a plant .
Coercing morality
There are two reasons that no one should look to the government as a nanny to enforce morality .
First , the purpose of government is supposed to be the protection of life , liberty , and property from the violence or fraud of others .
It is simply not the business of government to prohibit the advertising , sale , and use of what it deems to be harmful substances .
Likewise , the government should not be concerned with regulating any activity that takes place between consenting adults .
A government with the power to outlaw harmful substances and immoral practices is a government with the power to ban any substance or practice .
A nanny state is a perversion of government .
Second , all governments , including the U.S. government , eventually degenerate into the greatest violators of the life , liberty , and property they are supposed to protect .
As former Foundation for Economic Education president Richard Ebeling has said ,
“ There has been no greater threat to life , liberty , and property throughout the ages than government .
Even the most violent and brutal private individuals have been able to inflict only a mere fraction of the harm and destruction that have been caused by the use of power by political authorities . ”
The state is some nanny .
It is the only nanny that forces you to hire her .
It is the only nanny that employs coercion , compulsion , threats , fines , and imprisonment .
The state is the last entity that should be entrusted with enforcing morality .
Not only are questionable substances and practices none of the state ’s business , they are none of anyone else ’s business either .
The problem is that since the beginning of time there has been no shortage of busybodies who thought it was their business to mind everyone else ’s business .
A busybody who becomes a government bureaucrat merely exacerbates the problem .
Liberty means liberty for everyone , even those who use substances and engage in practices that others in society do n’t use or find offensive .
Our liberty is compromised and society is made worse off when we deprive a select few of liberty who are not themselves violating anyone ’s liberty .
The libertarian position is the only consistent position .
But , it should be emphasized , libertarianism is not libertinism .
Libertarianism is a political philosophy , not a lifestyle .
The essence of libertarianism is that it is wrong to threaten or initiate violence against a person or his property .
As explained by Murray Rothbard , one of the 20th century ’s greatest proponents of liberty , libertarianism “ holds that the only proper role of violence is to defend person and property against violence , that any use of violence that goes beyond such just defense is itself aggressive , unjust , and criminal .
Libertarianism , therefore , is a theory which states that everyone should be free of violent invasion , should be free to do as he sees fit except invade the person or property of another . ”
A nanny state is hostile to liberty .
Any attempt to institute or continue it should be opposed , root and branch .
Government intervention is never the solution ; it is always part of the problem .

The Best of Laurence M. Vance
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Through its control of the printing press the Federal Reserve may be able to push down government bond yields as low as it wants , though it will eventually face a day of reckoning with inflation .
The Federal Reserve Building in Washington while the Fed is inside meeting , October 29 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Larry Downing
The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it would buy up to $ 300 billion in longer - term Treasuries , effectively printing money in order to lower yields and bring down borrowing costs throughout the economy , particularly in the troubled mortgage sector .
Not all analysts agree the plan is a good idea or that it will cure what ails the heavily indebted economy , but many expect it to bring the benchmark 10 - year note yield back down to the 50 year lows seen around 2.0 per cent seen last December .
“ They can hold them down as low and as long as they want because they can print as much money as they want , ” said Marty Mitchell head of government bond trading at Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore .
“ Yields can stay low and probably are headed lower . ”
Inflation will ultimately become an issue , Mitchell said , but the more immediate concern was the prospect of a downward deflationary spiral in prices , wages and economic activity .
This means inflation is not on the agenda and will not be for at least a matter of months and possibly a couple of years .
“ Inflation is tomorrow ’s end game , ” Mitchell added .
“ Right now they ’re fighting off a deflationary environment . ”
FOUR PERCENT MORTGAGE RATES ?
In the wake of the Fed ’s announcement on Wednesday , 10 - year yields fell as far as 2.47 percent from near 3.0 percent for the biggest one day fall since the 1987 stockmarket crash , but on Thursday 10 - year yields actually rose to 2.59 percent .
Mary Ann Hurley , vice president of fixed - income trading at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Seattle , also said the 2.0 percent level on 10 - year yields would come into play , but was not sure how long the Fed could hold yields at that level .
“ I think their desire is to get conventional mortgage rates down to four percent and I think they ’re going to keep buying Treasuries to achieve that level , ” Hurley said .
Interest rates on 30 - year fixed - rate mortgages fell more than 0.40 percentage point to 4.79 percent on Thursday , according to the Zillow Mortgage Rate Monitor , compiled by real estate website Zillow.com .
The Fed has made clear it wants to support mortgage market , and pushing rates down may indeed help overly indebted home owners switch out of onerous loan terms and into cheaper ones .
Still , it remains to be seen whether credit easing will help an economy suffering from the effects of rampant over borrowing by consumers more broadly .
The Fed may take comfort , though , from the fact that it is not alone , with the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan involved in similar debt - buying endeavors .
CROSSING THE RUBICON
And then , there ’s the nagging issue of inflation .
“ While we ’re not concerned about inflation right now , boy we potentially have a huge problem down the road , ” said Hurley .
“ I do n’t think it ’s this year or next year ’s problem but maybe 2011 . ”
“ We ’ve got a huge amount of stimulus and how is the Fed going to unwind all this ?
I can see a scenario where interest rates go up dramatically , which will hurt the economy .
So , it ’s a mess . ”
It ’s not just interest rates that may facing greater volatility .
The dollar too might be in for a wild ride if Wednesday ’s plunge is any guide .
Against a basket of currencies , the dollar sank 3.0 percent , its largest percentage drop since 1985 .
DXY .
This result of the Fed plan may be the biggest concern .
Even though the central bank may have some initial success in depressing rates , analysts worry that monetary policy has passed a point of no return with the printing of money .
“ We ’ve crossed the Rubicon , ” said Howard Simons , strategist at Bianco Research in Chicago .
“ We have absolutely severed any connection between our dollar and reality .
It ’s as fast as you can print it right now . ”
That ’s right .
It seems Lieberman played a crucial role in talking several Republicans off the ledge , thereby vindicating President Obama ’s refusal to be vindictive toward the Connecticut Senator , who had some nasty things to say about Obama and Democrats in general during the presidential campaign .
Lieberman has always been a moderate - progressive on economic issues so his vote should not be a surprise–but his active lobbying for the bill has to be considered directly attributable to the grace with which Obama treated him .
Those who wonder about the President ’s efforts to be nice to Republicans–a singularly ungracious lot , cult - like in their devotion to failed economic policies past–should bear this particular example in mind as we go forward .
UK Housing Market Crash and Depression Forecast 2007 to 2012
Recent house price data as released by the Halifax showed that UK house prices have plunged by more than 20 % from the peak of August 2007 , which has fulfilled much of the original forecast made in August 2007 for a minimum fall of 15 % for the UK housing market and 25 % for London , therefore this analysis seeks to project the forecast trend for UK house prices for the next 3 years into 2012 .
UK Housing Market Background and Re-cap .
August 2007 Forecast Conclusion - The UK Housing market is expected to decline by at least 15 % during the next 2 years .
Despite the 2012 Olympics , London is expected to fall as much as 25 % .
UK
Interest rates are either at or very near a peak , as there is an increasingly diminishing chance of a further rise in October 2007 .
After which UK interest rates should be cut as the UK housing market declines targeting a rate of 5 % during the second half of 2008 .
The implications for this are that the UK economy is heading for sharply lower growth for 2008 .
The Credit Crunch Trigger -
The first signs of the housing market moving towards an imminent peak occurred in February 2007 following clear evidence that the subprime mortgages were defaulting in ever greater numbers in the United States , the assumption here was that this could lead to a unraveling of the carry trade which would lead to deleveraging of the credit boom .
However the initial financial markets wobble of February 2007 failed to show outward evidence of a credit crunch , thus the UK housing market continued to rise despite rising interest rates that had been forecast in November 2006 to rise to a peak of 5.75 % by September 2007 as the Bank of England would battle with inflation during 2007 .
The housing market took off into what would be its final spike higher with many commentators declaring at the time a new paradigm , with many reasons put forward as to why house prices could be supported indefinitely .
Reasons Given as to Why the Housing Market would not Fall :
Immigration -
There had been a large influx of over 800,000 migrants from the Accession states who contributed towards the buy to let market bubble .
Lack of Home Building -
Up until early 2007 there had not been a building boom in the UK housing market in the form of traditional terrace and semi-detached properties .
However this hid the speculative boom going on in the construction of the off the plan flats and apartments that proceeded to transform many city centre developments that were due to be completed during 2007 and 2008 , this would bring online a huge supply of over priced properties that would require ridiculously high rentals to prove profitable as frenetic property speculators grossly over paid for the flats .
Strong UK Economy -
The UK economy at the centre of the worlds credit bubble continued to outperform mainland Europe , which looked on with envy from the less flexible and more regulated European countries of France and Germany , though as we find out during 2009 , not participating in the credit boom did not help them as many of the European banks become belatedly suckered into buying U.S. subprime mortgage backed toxic securitized debt as one the last to fling themselves onto the debt derivatives pyramid .
Already dark clouds had starting forming over the UK housing market during the summer of 2007 , as I voiced on 1st of May 2007 ( UK Housing Market Heading for a Property Crash )
The credit market conditions continued to deteriorate at an increasing rate during the summer months as the spread between the base rate and sterling LIBOR widened from .
The situation came to a head during July 2007 with the blow of the Bear Stearns hedge funds at a cost of $ 5 billion and later led to the credit crunch occurring in August 2007 which to derivatives market participants implied that the housing market could not rise any further under these conditions and had in fact peaked in the month of August , which is what actually transpired on release of subsequent house price data .
UK Housing Market 2008 Crash Trigger - Following the peak in UK house prices , the initial trend was inline with the original forecast , however it was recognised following Northern Rocks bust that the pace of deterioration of credit markets as well as the capital gains tax changes as implying that the UK housing market 's rate of decent would start to accelerate from April 2008 and could be termed as a housing market crash - November 2007 - Crash in UK House Prices Forecast for April 2008 As Buy to Let Investors Sell . -
The timing for the sharp drop is likely to coincide with Labour 's change on capital gains tax which effectively cuts the tax payable on gains accumulated over the last few years to 18 % from 40 % .
This tax change comes into force on 1st of April 2008 and thus the expectation is for an avalanche of selling amongst buy to let investors to lock in profits .
This also means that the market will to some degree be artificially supported going into April 08 , but still will not be enough to prevent a wider decline in UK house prices but rather could register a drop of as much as 5 % in the quarter April 08 to June 08 , which would represent a crash in UK house prices .
July 2008 - UK House Price Crash In Progress ! -
The summer months subsequently witnessed the crash in UK house prices come to pass as house prices look set to fullfill the original forecast for a 15 % fall well ahead of the original time line with the risks that despite soaring inflation data , the housing bear market threatened imminent deflation , which has now increasingly become the mainstream story which was originally highlighted in the analysis of March 2008 .
The Government Starts to Panic - House prices continued to fall into September 2008 as increasingly bankrupt banks started to topple over one after another as governments scrambled with ever more panicking measures to prevent a collapse of the global financial system .
First came the ban on short selling of financial stocks , then nationalisation of Bradford and Bingley , followed by the panic interest rate cut of October 2008 , and the unprecedented £ 500 billion bank bailout package .
As the financial markets continued to experience extreme volatility by registering daily movements of as much as 10 % that have not been seen since the days of the 1987 Crash , the Government effectively took control of interest rates in all but name away from the Bank of England which announced the panic interest rate cut of 1.5 % at the November MPC meeting that truly brought home how quickly the economy was falling off the edge of the cliff and the subsequent emergency VAT cutting budget in an attempt to get consumers to spend immediately which brings us up to the present .
HBOS - Britain's Biggest Mortgage Bank
In August 2007 , I warned about the precarious state of Northern Rock Bank and how the prospects for its survival during the the imminent housing bear market were not looking good .
Fast forward 12 months and we found Britain 's biggest mortgage Bank the Halifax , a financial institution that lies at the very heart of the British housing market that teetered on the brink of collapse in mid September under fierce hedge fund short selling assault that smelled blood for the third time this year , the first time was way back in March 2008 , with analysis of the latest assault published a good 24 hours before the mainstream press began reporting on the HBOS crisis .
It was the short selling of HBOS towards financial oblivion that forced the FSA to ban short selling of financial stocks some 3 days later .
The HBOS Share price has crashed by over 94 % , and is indicative of the severe nature of the current housing bear market , trading at just 73 p the once mighty HBOS has now become another penny stock with the value of shareholdings further diluted via state capital injections to keep the zombie bank from flat - lining .
Vested Interests Try to Talk the Market Higher
To date the Nationwide and Halifax have not made a forecast for 2009 , which is not surprising given the failure to date to accurately track the housing market decline as all mortgage banks have a vested interest in talking up the market just as transpired in the early stages of the 1990's housing bear market as I highlighted in the September 2007 article - UK Housing Market on Brink of Price Crash - Media Lessons from 1989 !
The whole of the decline for 2007 was associated with the phrase ' Soft Landing ' which continued into early 2008 after which the phrase disappeared from the mortgage bank press releases .
Still in early 2008 the Halifax continued to imply that UK house prices would not turn negative during 2008 .
On the other side of the equation there were the perma bears such as Capital Economics which had been repeatedly calling for a 20 % to 30 % drop in UK house prices since 2002 .
CURRENT UK HOUSING MARKET ANALYSIS AND FORECAST TRENDS
UK Mortgage Supply Crash
The panic interest rate cuts from 5 % straight to 2 % in 2 months and the £ 600 billion bank bailout package are aimed at unfreezing the UK banking system so as to enable the banks to resume near ' normal ' lending operations and support the economy and housing market as the number of mortgage approvals collapses .
The most recent data from the British Bankers Association ( BBA ) shows a sharp fall in the number of mortgages approved for house purchases to 17,773 against 64,014 in July 2007 , a fall of 72 % .
Similarly loans for equity withdrawals which has been pivotal to Britain 's consumer boom as home owners borrowed against equity to spend has fallen by 49 % .
The net effect of this is that the total amount of mortgage loans outstanding has shrunk by some £ 35 billion , against a stable mortgage market which would have required an increase of at least £ 25 billion over the same period .
At the same time as supply has fallen so has the average value of loan offered for house purchases which peaked at £ 159,600 in June 2007 , and now averages at just £ 116,700 .
This is highly deflationary for UK house prices and implies a reduction in house prices of £ 42,900 against an actual price fall of £ 38,000 ( Nov08 ) and therefore acts as a leading indicator for the continuing downtrend in house prices as the amounts made available for mortgages contracts inline with the tightening lending criteria both in terms of salaries and Loan to Value ratios of 75 % or less .
The deep interest rate cuts on face value seem like a great time for home owners to seek to remortgage , however there is a hidden price to pay if home owners are not careful , and that is firstly in the clauses of penalties for early remortgaging , and secondly in that distressed mortgage banks are reluctant to take on new mortgage customers , which means that home owners need a sizeable level of equity in the order of 25 % or more .
Now here is the crunch point , the equity percentage is based on the valuation that the mortgage bank puts on your house and NOT at the peak price or imagined current valuation that the homeowner may have had in mind , and in that respect expect the mortgage banks surveyor will tend to discount your home valuation against further price falls so as to arrive at a worse case scenario for the bank .
What this means is that home owners imagining that they are sitting on equity of 25 % despite the fall in house prices to date may in fact on attempting to remortgage find that the mortgage bank under values to the degree where they are in actual negative equity for mortgage purposes and hence not offered any loan at a favourable interest rates .
This therefore negates much of the recent deep rate cuts whether passed on or not as the best the mortgage borrowers can obtain are the standard variable rates that do not better the existing expiring fixed deals .
This is highly bearish for the housing market as a self feeding mechanism has an inbuilt freeze for the remortgage market which is reflected in the crash the number of mortgages .
The mortgage market clearly remains frozen as extreme measures are taken to prevent the collapse of Britain 's biggest mortgage banks .
The situation remains dire with little appetite amongst the banks to open their doors and invite in borrowers to take on debt into the second year of a literally crashing UK housing market .
Today 's mortgage market is not going to support the current salary to house price ratios of between X4.5 and X6 , lending criteria 's have become increasingly tight with demands of 25 % deposits becoming the norm and loans maxing out at X3.5 salaries so as to reduce the risk and volume of new business .
The banks do not want to take on risky borrowers in the middle of a house price crash , the days of easy mortgages of 100 % at X6 salary or higher are gone .
Therefore as the banks credit market positions are deleveraging so is the housing mortgage market deleveraging towards trend , and in that trend is measured by X3.5 earnings which suggests house prices have some 20 % further to drop .
UK Housing Market Affordability Index
The 19 % fall in UK house prices coupled with continuing rise in average earnings has led to a sharp fall in the Market Oracle affordability index which attempts to more accurately track affordability than the traditional salary to mortgage ratio .
The trend over the last 18 months continues to target a rapid decline towards a low of between 7.0 and 7.5 by late 2010 .
However given the rapid pace of decline there exists a serious risk of overshoot to the downside i.e. for the UK housing market affordability index to bottom at a rate that would make housing cheaper than that of the mid 1990 's in relative terms .
This implies that the UK housing market is approximately half way towards its lows and therefore equates to a 38 % fall from the August 2007 high .
Buy to Let Investors Rush for the Exit
According RICS rents are falling for the first time since 2003 which turns the tables on landlords as tenants can force landlords to not only freeze rents but ask for deflationary cuts in rents which therefore puts further pressure on the buy to let business models that relied heavily on capital gains which has now been replaced by severe capital losses .
Therefore buy to let investors are losing thousands on each property every month that they continue to hold onto loss making investments .
This coupled with evidence that the flood of eastern european workers demand for rental properties is diminishing as european migrants are increasingly deciding to return home in the face of the increasingly severe UK recession that ensures that the prospects for buy to let investors is dire for several years and it is this which has contributed towards the severe nature of the UK housing market crash which has all the hallmarks resulting in an unprecedented rate of decline .
Middle Eastern Investors Dumping London Properties ?
To make matters worse for London which is already reeling from the depression in the financial sector , what support the London housing market had from the flood of petro dollars has evaporated following the great Oil Price crash of 2008 , that has seen the inflation hedging of the first half of 2008 turn into the Deleveraging deflation of the second half following the peak at $ 147 .
Inexperienced Middle eastern and asian sovereign wealth funds that have plowed billions into the bankrupt banks starting late 2007 are now in no mood to lose even more on plunging london properties , therefore Londoners should not delude themselves into thinking cheaper prices will entice foreign investors to return any time soon , therefore expect much deeper falls for London house prices than the rest of the country as my original analysis and forecast concluded .
Corporate Housing Market Goes Bust
Having warned in August 2007 to avoid property and related investment funds due to the risk that in a crisis they could literally freeze , this actually came to pass in December 2007 as Britain 's fourth biggest insurer , Friends Provident froze its Property Fund .
The reason for the freeze was that once the cash reserves had been consumed the funds would be forced to liquidate assets , which means sell properties , which applies to all commercial property funds that saw the smart money attempting leave the scene before the avalanche of redemptions began .
This was later followed during September 2008 by the great deleveraging crash that threatened to consume across the board funds as financial markets teetered on the brink of a collapse .
Repossessions - Extreme Government Pressure
In an attempt to limit the number of repossessions during 2009 , the government is putting extreme pressure on the mortgage banks to ensure repossessions are a last resort .
Up until September 2008 this amounted mostly to hot air from the politicians , however after having taken major stakes in most of Britain 's biggest banks there are strong signs that the banks are starting to comply with their new majority shareholder 's wishes ( the government ) , that look set to increasingly introduce initiatives to reduce the number of repossessions .
The most recent action on this front was by RBS which stated that it would give a 6 month reprieve to its mortgage customers that are in arrears before initiating court repossession orders .
Whilst the measures will undoubtedly mean that less homes will now be repossessed than would have otherwise been the case , however it does act as a two edged sword in that whilst supply of repossessed homes onto the market will be less , at the same time the mortgage banks are being forced to carry loss making loans that prove costly to administer and without bringing in much needed revenue i.e. tieing up resources that could have gone to more profitable mortgage customers .
The Governments initiatives to reduce repossessions will have no discernable impact on the housing market price trends either positive or negative due to the points about tieing up capital in loss making costly to administer loan accounts .
The number of homes expected to be repossessed during 2008 is now revised lower to 55,000 with the expectations of 65,000 homes for 2009 in advance of further government interventions in the housing market to prevent repossessions on an larger scale .
UK Interest Rates - House Price Deflation Vs Mortgage Interest Rate Relief
The government is engaged on a programme of forcing down mortgage interest rates by a series of deep unprecedented cuts in UK interest rates towards the target of 1 % , and possibly even lower to make up the shortfall in the lack of responsiveness by mortgage lenders in cutting their rates , who at the same time have tightened lending criteria due to the increased risk of defaults .
The mortgage interest rates have fallen significantly from the credit crisis extremes and are heading to below 4 % which implies a strong pointer for support for house prices as the cost of servicing mortgages falls and therefore ' should ' support a recovery in housing prices .
However the housing market has always been that of being driven by sentiment , in that it is the trend in house prices that is most significant and NOT the cost of servicing the mortgages , it is this which pushed house prices to above X7 earnings , where people were prepared to take on large mortgages at high interest rates for the prime reason that house price gains in the order of 15 % per annum or more were far above that of the mortgage interest payments of typically 6 % .
However now that the housing bubble has burst has resulted in the trend and sentiment reversing as house prices have already fallen by nearly 20 % , which equates to a loss of £ 40,000 on an average £ 200,000 house that is now worth £ 160,000 , which averages to a fall in value of £ 2500 per month .
Against which a typical mortgage of say £ 160 k on a £ 200 k property at 6 % would result in monthly interest charge of £ 800 per month .
Now with mortgage rates having typically fallen to 4 % which is resulting in an reduced interest payment of £ 533 per month or a significant fall of £ 277 per month that many commentators are taking as a cue for imminent price stability .
Unfortunately the £ 277 saving is just above 10 % of the amount that home owners are typically losing in value per month !
Therefore the interest rate cuts are having little if no effect on the housing market , I first warned of this likely outcome back in February 2008 that interest rate cuts will not stop house prices from falling .
This therefore implies that low interest rates are not an important factor at this point in determining house price trend during 2009 , as housing market sentiment is decidedly bearish and will take time to first stabilise and then start to recover .
LIBOR
The credit markets as measured by the headline London Interbank Offered rate ( LIBOR ) has fallen inline with the deep interest rate cuts .
However the true measure of the credit crisis and the reluctance of the banks to lend to one another as measured by the spread between the LIBOR rate and the base interest rate remains at credit crisis extremes as the above graph illustrates , which suggests the banks are still not prepared to lend to one another , and if they are still reluctant to lend to one another that means that the mortgage freeze is expected to deepen further as the economy moves into a deep recession .
Many banks led by the nationalised banks are eagerly seeking to reduce their exposure to the UK housing market by forcing borrowers to either stay and pay the premium of a high standard variable rate or to remortgage elsewhere , as their fixed rate deals expire .
The implications are extremely severe for the UK housing market as there is nothing to suggest that a turnaround in mortgage credit markets is around the corner regardless of what happens to the LIBOR rate , therefore this supports the view that falling house prices will be eventually followed by a housing market depression i.e. a resurgent bull market is many years away , perhaps as long as 5 years .
UK Economic Recession - Unemployment
UK unemployment has probably already risen above 2 million by the time Decembers data is released in March , with the original UK unemployment forecast for a rise to 2.6 million by April 2010 now destined to be breached as the UK economy targets a severe recession on par with that of the early 1980 's rather than the more milder one of the 1990's .
Increasing expectations are that the UK economy will contract by 3 % GDP during 2009 which implies that the UK is heading for an unemployment rate that could pass above 3,000,000 by early 2010 .
Therefore this confirms that the UK housing market is at least 15 months away from a period of stabilising in nominal terms i.e. where house prices stop falling .
The actual trigger for a resumption of the housing bull market would be a sustained period of falling unemployment with the trigger level of 2,000,000 expected to act as a strong marker for year on year housing market recovery as occurred following the last housing bear market .
This suggests that the housing market may not embark on an sustainable up trend for as longs as another 4 years and thus points to a period of house price stagnation that will following the current crash in UK house prices .
UK Government Debt Levels Explode Higher
Gordon Brown for 10 years banged the drum of the 40 % public sector debt rule as a sign of fiscal responsibility .
However following Northern Rocks collapse , the government has increasingly employed creative accounting to hide the fact that the rule has long since been broken .
The nationalisation of Northern Rock and then Bradford and Bingley put paid to that .
This was followed by the budget busting bank bailouts of September totaling £ 600 billion .
Having thrown in the towel , the Labour government is going for broke with ever larger spending announcements that look set to take UK debt towards £ 1 trillion by the end of 2009 , lifting public debt to more than 80 % of GDP .
However the consequences of the borrowing binge is the crash in sterling , as investors adjust to the new climate of growing budget deficits .
The government 's deficit spending will continue into 2010 and right upto the general election deadline as the government is expected to announce even more tax cuts and spending programme 's in an attempt to win votes .
Therefore the first 5 months of 2010 could also witness another £ 100 billion additional debt , which would push government borrowing beyond 90 % of GDP onwards and upwards towards 100 % of GDP that will leave a huge inflationary hangover for many years following the 2010 election deadline .
However the true level of liabilities as the above graph highlights are significantly above £ 1 trillion that may prove to be officially recorded public debt level , instead of the actual levels of above £ 3 trillion by 2010 .
The consequences of government borrowing and ever expanding liabilities is below trend economic growth and high inflation .
This supports the view that the UK housing market will enter a real terms depression following the ongoing crash , with little on the horizon that could ignite a new bull market for at least the next 4 years .
There also exists the doomsday scenario that the government may yet be forced to nationalise the entire banking sector that would involve liabilities expanding by an additional £ 5 trillions .
Under those circumstances Britain would be heading for hyper- inflation which whilst supporting house prices in nominal terms , would greatly erode their value an real terms as Britain 's real GDP would contract by significantly more than the 4 % that the current recession is expected to shave of the economy .
UK GDP House Prices Trend
Whilst many methods have been utilised in determining future housing market trend such as on the basis of average earnings , mortgage interest rates , currency valuation , inflation adjusted , comparison against other housing markets and real disposable earnings , this item brings to the table housing market analysis against UK GDP growth .
The assumption here is that the value of assets after stripping out inflation should increase in inline with the countries actual growth rate as measured by gross domestic product .
The above graph illustrates that the UK housing market is very sentiment driven , and in many ways exhibits the same sort of behaviour as that of stock market by moving between extremes of over valuation and under valuation against the UK 's GDP growth trend .
Despite house prices having fallen by about 19 % to date , the trend from an extreme reading of more than 45 % above the GDP valuation has barely begun its decline , this is as a consequence of contracting GDP and the crash in inflation , both factors will put a continuing severe strain on the UK housing market as an economy in recession is unlikely to halt the pace of house price declines let alone suggest a bottom any time soon .
At worst this is suggesting a further 50 % fall in house prices .
However the government has at its disposable the ability to ignite inflation possibly towards the end of 2009 , therefore this more probably suggests a further fall in nominal house prices of 30 % , i.e. implying a total fall approaching 50 % .
Similarly should the economy start to recover starting 2010 , then this will contribute towards the equalisation of house price values without anywhere near as severe a fall as the above graph suggests at this time .
UK Real House Prices - Inflation Adjusted
The real house prices graph illustrates why the housing bust of the early 1990 's contributed to the UK heading for recession and a loss of confidence in the housing market that persisted for over 5 years .
The question as to why people were reluctant to buy houses in the period 1993 to 1997 when nominal house prices had stabilised and started to rise .
The answer is that in real terms house prices were still falling and in fact did not bottom until 1996 with the up trend only being confirmed during the beginning of 1998 .
Therefore it is only when house prices stopped falling in real terms that the house price up trend started to gain momentum and trigger the following bull market .
It took a further 4 - 5 years before house prices crossed the previous peak of 1989 some 13 years later .
The subsequent up trend fed by low inflation and low interest rates proved to be remarkably strong .
The above implies that UK house prices in real terms are expected to fall by 45 % with the downtrend projecting into mid 2010 .
USA / UK Housing Market Trends and Sterling Currency Crash
UK house prices had risen by 177 % from January 1999 , against US house prices that rose by 150 % to their peak .
However taking into account the currency trend , UK house prices rose by 238 % with most of the gain occurring in the last 2 years of the bull market exaggerated by the U.S. Dollar Bear market .
Whilst the rate of decline for both housing markets is similar allowing for the lag between each markets respective peak , what does stand out is the impact of sterling 's crash over the past few months which has wiped out a further 30 % of the value of UK house prices in terms of other major currencies including the U.S. Dollar and Euro , which therefore translates into a crash in UK house prices to date of 49 % .
What this means is that the Labour government whether by design or circumstances is embarked on a programme of severe currency devaluation the effect of which is to inflate UK assets in nominal terms including the housing market .
The immediate effect of the currency crash is to mask the crash in UK house prices from the public , however going forward this will result in much higher inflation and therefore a stagnating housing market for many years .
Therefore the implications are for UK house prices to fall at a much lower rate than during the previous year .
Japan's House Price Depression
Many of the reasons put forward during the UK housing boom as to why house prices would not fall in the UK as elaborated earlier could equally apply to the Island of Japan .
However , whilst we in the UK enjoyed a booming housing market the Japanese endured a severe bear market as the below graph illustrates .
Japan 's house prices peaked in 1991 and 18 years later still stand an average 60 % below their peak .
Whilst I am not saying that Britain 's house prices could replicate Japans housing crisis some 18 years from now , however the Japanese experience does illustrate that house prices are NOT a one way bet , even on a long - term basis .
Credit Crisis Warning from Japan
The big warning from Japans credit crisis that resulted in what has come to be called the " lost decade " was that the bankrupt banks and corporations were NOT allowed to go bust , instead Japan cut and kept interest rates near 0 % which ignited the overseas carry trade that fueled the asset price booms around the world as financial institutions borrowed at 1 % from Japan and invested / loaned it out elsewhere , which was further magnified by the use of leverage .
This coupled with America 's own experience with ultra low interest rates of just 1 % laid the ground for investor cash ever seeking riskier returns at increasingly leveraged levels that helped magnify U.S. subprime mortgage exposure by several orders of magnitude than the originating loan values .
Clearly the lessons from Japan have not been learned , instead of UK interest rates trending towards 3.5 % , they are now at 2 % and destined to hit 1 % in January .
This coupled with the money printing presses in full swing pumping out record amounts of debt is repeating the same mistakes as Japan , however with some major differences , both of which are negatives for the UK i.e. we do not have a trade surplus with the rest of the world , and nor are we sitting on foreign currency reserves north of $ 1 trillion .
Therefore unlike Japan , economic deflation is likely to be followed by stagflation for the UK .
It is far too early to say how high inflation will go as we have yet to feel the fill force of deflation .
However this suggests that we wo n't experience prolonged asset price deflation Japanese style on nominal terms basis at least .
For more on the credit crisis see the Free Credit Crisis Survival toolkit .
UK Money Supply
UK Money supply M4 ( blue ) has risen sharply from the 10 % targeted low of mid 2008 to the current level of 16.6 % , on face value this is highly inflationary and has been taken by many economists and market commentators to suggest much higher forward inflation .
However the money supply adjusted for the velocity of money which takes into account the state of the economy as a consequence of the credit freeze tells a completely different story .
The UK economy is now in extreme real monetary deflation of approaching - 5 % .
The leading indicator of the implied money supply , is suggesting recent deep interest rate cuts of Novembers 1.5 % and Decembers further 1 % cut will lift future money supply growth out of extreme deflation , however it will still be far from supporting the levels north of 15 % which accurately forecast forward inflation during 2008 .
This therefore implies that that the whole of 2009 will be a deflationary period and thus supports a continued sharp downtrend in house prices on par with that of the last 12 months at the rate of 16 % per annum .
UK Inflation / Deflation
Recent analysis concluded that UK is heading for real deflation during 2009 as the below graph illustrates in that the RPI inflation measure is expected to go negative and spike lower around July 2009 as the RPI is sensitive to falling mortgage interest rates .
The CPI will also continue to fall sharply into July 2009 , which is targeting a rate of just below 1 % .
This therefore supports the view of a much weaker housing market during the first half of the year than the second half of 2009 .
UK House Price Crash and Depression Forecast 2007 to 2012
In conclusion , the sum of the above analysis suggests that house prices having fallen by 19 % are about half way to the lows , and therefore suggest that house prices will decline by 38 % from the August 2007 peak .
The housing market trend is clearly currently in the panic stage as we are witnessing near unprecedented house price falls at the rate of more than 16 % per annum , far beyond that of the 1990 's bear market .
This rate of decline is not sustainable , and I am expecting this phase of the housing bear market to come to an end during the second half of 2009 .
However my expectation is that following the crash the market will enter a period of depression spanning several years after the market puts in a nominal price low and then embarks upon a weak up trend as the below graph illustrates .
Risks to the Forecast
The prime risk to the nominal house price forecast is the currency crash induced inflation , as earlier analysis suggested that house price falls can be brought to a halt by a significant currency devaluation , which has already taken place to the tune of 30 % .
This will mask the real terms house price falls that will make itself evident in the protracted housing market depression where house prices are not able to keep pace with inflation and therefore continue to erode in real - terms .

24 Sep 09 , 21:49 UK House Prices and Unemployment - Update Aug 09
This is the first in a series of analysis as part of an in depth up - date to the UK house price forecast of August 2007 that correctly called a peak in UK house prices and forecast a 2 year bear market that would see UK house prices fall by 15 % to 25 % .
This analysis seeks to compare UK house prices against unemployment data .
To ensure that you receive the full final analysis and conclusion / forecast for the UK housing market covering the trend for the next 2 - 3 years subscribe to my always free newsletter .
UK Unemployment Data
I have long questioned the accuracy and validity of the official unemployment data which over several decades and much manipulation by successive governments has been tweaked many hundreds of time to under report true unemployment for political purposes .
Current official unemployment stands at 2.435 million for May data release against which the total are recorded as economically inactive of working age stands at 7.955 million which in my opinion is reflective of the true rate of unemployment as the below graphs illustrate .
Another poignant reminder of the lack of accuracy in the unemployment data is observed in the announcement today that now 1 in 6 house holds have no wage earner , i.e. all adults are unemployed in a total 3.3 million households , which clearly suggests a number of unemployed significantly above the 2.435 million official data of those unemployed .
UK Unemployment Data Forecast
The original forecast of October 2008 ( July 08 data ) as illustrated by the below graph , forecast UK unemployment to hit 2.6 million by April 2010 .
The actual data to date of 2.43 million to May 2009 clearly continues to suggest a much higher peak which remains on track to hit 3 million , as unemployment tends to lag economic recoveries by anywhere from between 6 to 12 months .
UK House Prices Against Unemployment Trend Analysis
The above chart indicates that there does exist a strong relationship between house price trends and the unemployment benefit claimant count , more so than the unemployment data .
The possible reason for this is that those made unemployed that do not claim benefits are not in as financially distressed state than those that have no choice but to claim benefits , therefore house prices can and have risen in the past whilst the official rate of unemployment rose , if at the same time the claimant count did not rise .
The recent bounce in house prices is tracking quite closely with the stabilisation of the unemployment claimant count numbers , which therefore suggests that as long as those claiming unemployment benefits continues to stabilise at the current level of 1.6 million then the outlook remains positive for UK house prices to continue drifting higher , this is despite official unemployment data that looks set to continue to rise towards 3 million from 2.43 million .
Existing UK House Prices Analysis and Forecast
As mentioned earlier the original forecast of August 2007 concluded with a forecast drop in UK house prices of between 15 % and 25 % by August 2009 , which has materialised .
August 2007 Forecast Conclusion - The UK Housing market is expected to decline by at least 15 % during the next 2 years .
Despite the 2012 Olympics , London is expected to fall as much as 25 % .
UK
Interest rates are either at or very near a peak , as there is an increasingly diminishing chance of a further rise in October 2007 .
After which UK interest rates should be cut as the UK housing market declines targeting a rate of 5 % during the second half of 2008 .
The implications for this are that the UK economy is heading for sharply lower growth for 2008 .
This has been supported by over a hundred pieces of analysis on the UK housing market with several warnings not to pay any attention to the vested interest as they continued to remain in denial right upto the summer of 2008 with announcements such as that of a soft landing or that house prices would not fall , as Sept 07's article illustrated - UK Housing Market on Brink of Price Crash - Media Lessons from 1989 !
UK Housing Market 2008 Crash Trigger - Following the peak in UK house prices , the initial trend was inline with the original forecast , however it was recognised following Northern Rocks bust that the pace of deterioration of credit markets as well as the capital gains tax changes as implying that the UK housing market 's rate of decent would start to accelerate from April 2008 and could be termed as a housing market crash - November 2007 - Crash in UK House Prices Forecast for April 2008 As Buy to Let Investors Sell . -
The timing for the sharp drop is likely to coincide with Labour 's change on capital gains tax which effectively cuts the tax payable on gains accumulated over the last few years to 18 % from 40 % .
This tax change comes into force on 1st of April 2008 and thus the expectation is for an avalanche of selling amongst buy to let investors to lock in profits .
This also means that the market will to some degree be artificially supported going into April 08 , but still will not be enough to prevent a wider decline in UK house prices but rather could register a drop of as much as 5 % in the quarter April 08 to June 08 , which would represent a crash in UK house prices .
July 2008 - UK House Price Crash In Progress ! -
The summer months subsequently witnessed the crash in UK house prices come to pass as house prices look set to full fill the original forecast for a 15 % fall well ahead of the original time line with the risks that despite soaring inflation data , the housing bear market threatened imminent deflation , which has now increasingly become the mainstream story which was originally highlighted in the analysis of March 2008 .
January 2009 - UK Housing Market Depression Forecast -
In depth analysis of 4th January 2009 , forecast a continuing crash that would morph into a prolonged depression for several years that despite containing bounces , that house prices were unlikely to see a final bottom until late 2011 / early 2012 as the below graph illustrates .
March 2009 - House Price Bounce Warning Signs -
The mainstream press as epitomised by the Telegraph ran with a ridiculous story that Uk house prices could fall by another 55 % , which prompted analysis that concluded that the forecast for a possible another 55 % fall in UK house prices EXTREMELY unlikely .
If anything the extreme measures of zero interest rates and quantitative easing implied a far shallower trend that suggested a stagnating market rather than anything like another 55 % drop .
Summer Bounce 2009 -
The unfolding bounce or blip in UK house prices prices is inline with my May analysis that concluded that UK house prices will experience a bounce during the summer months from extremely oversold levels as a consequence of liquid buyers returning to the market and the debt fuelled economic recovery which ' should ' be reflected in rising house prices during the summer months that is increasingly being taken by the mainstream press and vested interests to announce that the house prices have bottomed .
My next analysis will compare UK house prices to the GDP growth rate .

idk get it at all i need help on a description on how the current housing market has negetivly impacted the united states .
Issue # 116 • March / April , 2008
A typical residential - size solar system installation will involve properly sized and installed AC and DC electrical wiring to reduce the risk of electrical fire , a proper grounding system to prevent shock and lightning damage , proper battery installation and venting to prevent gas explosions , and a properly installed solar array to maximize performance while avoiding roof damage .
In almost all of my past articles I have described many different types of solar power systems , but did not go into detail on how to install them yourself , since most systems should be sized and wired by licensed solar professionals .
However , the Backwoods
Home website continues to receive many e-mail questions related to smaller do - it - yourself solar projects for remote weekend or vacation cabins in areas not served by power lines .
If this is your situation , and you are willing to stick to the basics , I will show you how to install a very simple battery - based off - grid solar system just to power a few lights , and possibly a DC well pump or freezer .
Otherwise do n’t try this at home .
I am staying with all 12 - volt DC equipment which has a limited shock hazard and allows using many of the electrical components you can find locally .
However , a word of warning .
Just because everything will be the same low voltage wiring as used in your car or boat , this still does not mean there are no safety concerns .
Prepackaged solar lighting kit including solar modules , charge controller , fuses , DC lighting , and sealed battery
Any deep - discharge battery contains hundreds of amps of stored energy that can easily melt heavy gauge wire or electrical components if not sized and installed properly .
I have seen electrical cable the size of your thumb quickly glow red and melt due to an improperly installed battery .
This glowing cable could easily ignite any nearby walls , floors , or roofs .
This means if I say to use a specific type or size component , there is a really good reason .
You should not assume you can substitute anything you have lying around that is “ almost the same . ”
If you want to really simplify the equipment selection , all of the components required are available in pre-packaged solar lighting kits of various sizes .
Battery sizing
The first decision we need to make is system size .
If you only need to power a few lights in two or three rooms in a remote cabin , then you can get by with one or two 12 - volt batteries .
If you want to also power a small DC freezer or DC well pump , then you will need two to four 6 - volt batteries .
Do not , under any circumstances , use standard car or truck batteries , as they have very thin lead plates to reduce weight and they will not last long under daily cycling .
Normally in this application I would recommend using either 12 - volt RV / marine batteries or 6 - volt golf - cart batteries .
These are available locally and are fairly inexpensive .
However , if you purchase the sealed GEL or AGM version , this will significantly reduce any risk of vented explosive gases or the need for battery maintenance .
Sealed batteries cost almost 40 % more than the same size open cap batteries that require watering , and they do not last any longer .
However , since you will not need to build a special battery room or vented enclosure , this will be an advantage in a smaller cabin installation with limited storage space .
Regardless of battery type , the battery bank should be insulated in colder regions since battery charge drastically drops when it gets below 35 degrees .
Solar array
The size and number of solar modules needed depends on the capacity of your battery bank and where your off - grid cabin will be located .
If possible , you want the solar array to face south .
In my geographic area , most mornings are foggy and late afternoons are blue - sky sunny , so I favor a slightly southwest orientation .
A solar module produces the best year - round performance with a tilt angle equal to your latitude .
A lesser angle will improve summer output , and a steeper angle will do better in winter .
For most of the United States , this is from 37 to 42 degrees .
If your cabin will only be used for part of the year , you should use the tilt angle that will produce more energy during that part of the year .
Your solar array can be mounted on your cabin ’s roof , on a nearby pole , ground - mounted on a raised frame , or mounted on a nearby storage shed .
Solar modules are fairly lightweight so your main mounting concern is wind uplift , not caving in your roof .
Any mounting system should use only stainless - steel bolts or lag screws penetrating into rafters or blocking , since a strong wind will easily pull out any screws that only penetrate sheeting plywood .
Array sizing
RV / Marine 12 - volt DC fluorescent lighting fixtures are good candidates for smaller off - grid applications .
Most of the 12 - volt solar modules sold today are smaller than 100 watts .
The current market trend is for larger modules , which require a nominal 24 volt output .
One deep - cycle 6 - volt golf - cart battery or 12 - volt RV battery will store approximately 1 kWh of electricity when discharged 50 % .
As a rough estimate , this means you will need about 200 watts of solar array to recharge one battery in one day , assuming five hours of direct sunlight .
This is typical for most summer months , but for many parts of the northern United States , you may only receive three hours of direct sun during short winter days .
This means you will need to increase the solar array to battery ratio , or simply reduce your power usage during periods of cloudy weather .
There are many design problems associated with multiple “ parallel ” wired solar modules and batteries , so it is much easier to use larger - capacity solar modules and batteries than smaller ones .
Keep this in mind when purchasing batteries and solar modules .
Ordering larger unit sizes will work out better in the long run than buying the smaller and cheaper brands typically found locally .
Wiring safety
You need to understand that the same watt size electric loads at 120 volts AC require 10 times the amp current at 12 volts DC .
Watts for a given load do not change regardless of voltage , so two 100 - watt light bulbs that require 1.7 amps at 120 volt AC ( 200 watts /120 volts ) , can be wired using a # 14 size wire which has a 15 amp rating .
However , at 12 volts DC , this same load will draw 17 amps ( 200 watts / 12 volts ) , which exceeds the # 14 wire ’s 15 amp rating .
In addition , these two 100 - watt light bulbs would only operate about five hours before draining your deep - cycle battery ( 5 hrs x 100 watts x 2 bulbs = 1 kWh ) .
So right from the start you need to use only the most efficient DC lighting and DC appliances you can buy , and do not base your wire sizing on 120 - volt AC loads .
Just because we are using low voltage DC power does not mean we do not need fuses or circuit breakers .
Each wire supplying a load in your cabin must have a properly sized fuse or circuit breaker to prevent overload and possible fire .
Normally you will find a DC rated fuse or circuit breaker to be physically larger and more expensive than the same amp size AC device .
It is also much harder to find a local supplier for DC rated circuit breakers .
However , we are in luck since the Square D “ QO ” line of AC circuit breakers are also dual rated for up to 48 volts DC , but this only applies to the “ QO ” line by Square D .
The 30 amp DC Morningstar solar charge controller also includes load wiring terminals and a low - voltage safety disconnect to prevent battery damage .
I am not aware of any other low cost circuit breaker typically found in a local builder supply that is also rated for low voltage DC service .
I suggest using the eight circuit Square D “ QO ” subpanel and single - pole 10 or 15 amp “ QO ” circuit breakers for all your load wiring .
You may be tempted to use lower cost automotive type DC fuses , but these are not approved for residential wiring .
Your local RV or boating supply store will have a great selection of 12 - volt DC lighting fixtures that should easily meet all your lighting needs .
These are also available in weatherproof designs for outdoor lighting applications .
Purchase DC light fixtures that include an internal on / off switch , since DC rated switches are hard to find and make wiring installation more costly .
Water system
An on - demand RV or boat 12 - volt DC pressure pump can provide pressurized water to a kitchen sink or shower from a storage tank .
This generally simplifies plumbing costs and the high electrical demand for a deep well pump .
This tank can be refilled from rain water , a nearby creek , or spring .
Easily accessible drain valves should be provided at all low points for quick system draining to prevent freezing when not occupied .
Obviously , this water is not suitable for drinking or food preparation without proper treatment , but you can always drink bottled water you bring during each visit and avoid the cost of drilling a well or additional solar cost to power a well pump .
Refrigeration
For an off - grid remote cabin , having an electric refrigerator or freezer greatly increases the size and cost for the solar power system .
The most obvious solution for shorter periods of cabin use is to bring along a high quality ice chest full of ice .
I have found that the better insulated models can hold ice for up to four days .
The RV and boating industry offer several 12 - volt DC and propane - powered refrigerators and freezers , but most have a very high daily electrical load .
You may want to review my article in Issue # 102 , ( Nov / Dec 2006 ) which provides much more
information about DC powered refrigerators and freezers .
If you are willing to spend $ 900 to $ 1,500 , there are several excellent 12 - volt DC refrigerators and freezers designed specifically for off - grid solar homes which require much less solar power to operate .
SunFrost and SunDanzer offer a good selection of low energy 12 - volt DC refrigerators and freezers for off - grid solar applications .
Although expensive , these super - efficient models will save thousands of dollars since you can get by with a much smaller solar array and battery .
If you will be using your off - grid cabin for longer periods , the solar refrigerator should be your most important appliance purchase .
Wire sizing
Wire your lighting and DC appliances using the same wiring procedures and materials as specified by the National Electric Code ( NEC ) .
My only exception is to upsize the wire size to reduce wire resistance , since we are operating at 10 times the current required at 120 volts AC .
The table in Figure 1 gives the NEC amp rating for the most common size house wiring , followed by my suggested wire size for all 12 volts DC wiring :
If your wire run is longer than 50 feet , I would go to the next larger size wire even though the load is still small .
Also , use only copper wire .
Aluminum wire is less expensive , but it has a lower amp rating than copper for the same wire size .
All aluminum wire connections require special anti-corrosion joint compounds , so keep it simple and stay with all - copper wiring , and solid copper wiring devices and connectors .
You can keep the wiring simple by locating your circuit breaker panel near the front door , and use the circuit breakers for switching loads on and off that do not have internal switches .
This is because the 120 - volt AC wall switches you buy in any hardware or building supply cannot be used on DC electric service .
Due to the constant flow characteristic of DC electricity , it ’s not unusual for AC switch contacts to “ weld ” together from the arcing or even melt when used in DC wiring systems .
Since your simple DC electric system will serve only a few DC lights and DC appliances , you will not have any perimeter wall outlets since most electrical loads will be wired to terminals installed in each device .
However , if you do need to “ unplug ” an appliance , they do make a wall receptacle and plug designed for low voltage DC service .
The two prongs of DC outlets and plugs are rotated 90 degrees in reference to a standard 120 - volt AC outlet to prevent accidently plugging an appliance into the wrong voltage service .
Solar and battery wiring
After mounting your solar array modules , proceed with the interconnection wiring .
Larger wattage solar modules sold today come with prewired male and female connectors with several feet of wire .
Smaller modules still have an electrical junction box on the back , so you can use standard flexible PVC waterproof conduit and conduit connectors between each module ’s junction box .
Remember that these solar models will be wired in “ parallel ” since you are using a 12 - volt battery system .
This means your wiring may require separate wire runs for each module back to a central roof - mounted combiner box .
You will also need a solar charge controller which controls the rate of battery charging and prevents overcharging .
You should not connect any solar module directly to the battery without a charge controller in between .
If you are using sealed GEL or AGM batteries , it is critical to use a high - quality charge controller that includes a “ GEL / AGM ” switch or jumper that switches to a lower charging voltage .
This will prevent damaging your new battery bank since the standard wet cell charging voltage setpoint will damage sealed batteries .
If you need more than four solar modules , this makes it harder to wire them all in parallel , so you may want to consider using a charge controller that allows using a higher - voltage solar array with a 12 - volt battery .
This means you may be able to wire your solar modules in series to reduce the parallel wiring and have a 24 or 48 - volt solar array , supplying a 12 - volt battery bank .
This will all depend on the model solar charge controller you purchase .
Most likely you will be installing two to four solar modules under 100 watts each , but on larger systems you can add a solar combiner box .
This is like a fuse or circuit breaker panel , but is made for mounting outside next to the solar array .
When you have multiple solar modules , you wire each separately to this nearby combiner box which has separate terminals to make this wiring easier .
Finally , be sure to include a fuse in the positive wire between the solar array and charge controller , and between the charge controller and the battery .
On systems this small , you can use a two - pole Square D fused - disconnect , and use each fuse separately for each wire which allows using a single disconnect to break both connections to the charge controller .
System grounding
You may be building your off - grid system where it will never have an electrical inspection and the low 12 - volt wiring will not electrocute anyone , but this is no reason to not use safe wiring practices , and this includes grounding .
The National Electric Code requires all professionally - installed roof - mounted solar arrays to include a ground - fault circuit breaker and separate grounding wire connecting each solar module directly to an earth - ground .
Many grid - connected solar arrays produce over 400 volts , so any electrical short to frame could actually electrocute someone , or the electrical short could arc and cause an electrical fire .
Smaller 12 - volt DC solar systems like this and designed for boat , RV , or camping applications do not usually include this added safety device due to the much lower voltage , and I cannot recommend leaving it out of your solar array wiring .
However , if you decide your small solar array has very limited safety risk , it is still important to provide a good array ground to reduce the risk of lightning damage since you are bolting large metal objects high up on a roof in an open area .
Typical solar module to combiner box wiring .
Note lightning arrestor .
Every solar module has a predrilled and labeled hole in the frame for a ground wire , and you should use a bare solid - copper ground wire to connect each module .
Do not just connect the ground wire only to the array mounting rack and assume this will ground the entire group of modules .
Aluminum quickly corrodes when bolted to other metals which makes a very poor electrical connection .
Without cutting the bare copper wire , connect to each module ’s grounding point using a stainless - steel sheet - metal screw , then route down to a standard 8 - foot copper - clad ½- inch steel groundrod driven next to the cabin ’s foundation .
You also need to add a separate bare copper wire from this same groundrod to the grounding buss bar inside the main circuit breaker panel and array fused disconnect .
For a system this small , a # 8 or # 10 bare - copper ground wire meets code , but the code also requires ground wires smaller than # 6 to be in conduit to prevent damage to the smaller wire .
It ’s usually easier to just use the larger # 6 wire and forget the conduit .
Testing and setup
Never , never connect any wiring to a new battery until you have checked each wire separately with a volt - ohm meter to make sure there is no short , and that all positive (+ ) leads are connected to only the positive (+ ) battery post , and all negative ( -) leads are connected to only the negative ( -) battery post .
When using multiple 6 - volt batteries or multiple 12 - volt solar modules , it is very easy to end up with the wrong voltage output , so also check to make sure there is no mismatch of voltages .
A typical 12 - volt solar module will actually measure between 17 and 21 volts when in full sun and not connected to any load , so do n’t let this higher voltage concern you .
However , if you measure over 21 volts , then you have a problem unless you are using a solar charger designed for these higher input voltages .
I do not recommend installing a 120 VAC inverter on a system this small due to limited solar and battery capacity , and added complexity of having two separate sets of wiring .
Keep it simple and buy a DC powered radio or TV if you must have entertainment .
Now you are ready to turn on each circuit breaker and start enjoying the benefits a little solar electrical power can bring to almost any remote application .

Watch NBC ’s “ Kings , ” Or I ’ll Shoot This Dog
Last Sunday , I pleaded with you , the readers of Premium Hollywood , to watch the premiere of NBC ’s “ Kings , ” describing it as “ an epic drama with the kind of scope that you rarely see on television in series form ” and assuring you that “ it needs to be a hit right out of the box , lest it be canceled without ever having a chance to build on its concept . ”
How did that request pan out ?
Well , I think the opening sentence of the Hollywood Reporter ’s piece – “ NBC ’s ‘ Kings ’ had a devastating premiere Sunday night . ” – says it all , does n’t it ?
( Actually , the headline did a pretty good job in its own right : “ NBC ’s ‘ Kings ’ dethroned in ratings . ” )
To borrow a line from another great yet under - appreciated series , the facts were these : the premiere of “ Kings ” drew only 6 million viewers and was the lowest - rated program between 8 and 11 p.m. on a major broadcast network .
The ever - snarky but nonetheless generally well - informed Nikki Finke over at L.A. Weekly ‘s Deadline Hollywood Daily was n’t afraid to lay the blame for the series at the feet of NBC ’s long - suffering executive , Ben Silverman :
I ’m told NBC Universal spent a whopping $ 10 million on Sunday ’s two - hour opener for ‘ Kings ’ and another $ 4 million per episode .
That ’s a staggering amount of money to lavish on any drama series , especially one that ’s a bomb .
Nor does Jeff Zucker have anyone to blame but himself for this disaster .
Because I hear that Ben Silverman was hands - on .
‘ Kings ’ was supposed to move into the Thursday 10 PM ‘ ER ’ slot ( once coveted when the network was still Must - See TV ) but has now been banished to Sunday at 8 PM where it ca n’t do any harm since no one is watching NBC that night anyway .
This latest failure follows NBC ’s derivative restaurant reality series ‘ The Chopping Block , ’ also receiving a pathetic 4 share in 18 - to - 49 demos for its debut Wednesday .
No wonder Ben has less and less to do with programming — which was why he was hired in the first place — and more and more to do with liaising with advertisers .
Y’know , I ’d say , “ Ouch , ” but it ’s not like this is anything even remotely close to the worst thing Ms. Frinke has had to say about Mr. Silverman .
The worst part of all of this is that , despite being a ratings failure , “ Kings ” really is just as good as I said it was .
Some of you did indeed take my suggestion to heart , and I get the impression that most of those who did so came away extremely glad that they did so .
For those of you who either forgot to watch or just plain chose not to , I come to once again to beg and plead with you to tune in .
Here ’s a nutshell summary of last week ’s premiere , for those who did n’t catch it :
King Silas Benjamin ( Ian McShane ) is the leader of a land known as Gilboa ; aside from the difference in government , it seems an awful lot like America .
Despite Silas ’s optimism , Gilboa finds itself in a war with the neighboring nation of Gath .
During the war , a young soldier named David Shepherd ( Chris Egan ) makes a snap decision to save a couple of his comrades who ’ve been kidnapped by the enemy ; as it turns out , one of those comrades is Jack Benjamin ( Sebastian Stan ) , King Silas ’s son .
David becomes a national hero , the king tells David that he owes him a thank you , “ even if you ask for half my kingdom , as the saying goes . ”
What luck : David falls head over heels in love with the king ’s headstrong daughter , Michelle ( Allison Miler ) .
Behind the scenes , Silas is offered a truce between Gath and Gilboa , but despite the bloodshed that might be prevented , the despicable William Cross ( Dylan Baker ) , a businessman who has a significant financial stake in the war , tells the king , “ This truce might not be the best thing for the country right now . ”
When Silas decides to go against Cross ’s “ suggestion , ” explaining that David ’s actions have made it impossible for him to ignore the the opportunity for peace , Cross angrily decides to launch into the most evil revenge tactics in his repertoire .
That was last week .
I ’ve seen this week ’s episode , and it ’s just as solid .
Silas is concerned that , although David might make for good P.R. , his complete lack of knowledge about political dealings will prove to be a liability .
The solution ?
Have him knocked off .
( Boy , if that ’s not straight out of the Al Swearengen playbook , I do n’t know what is . )
Fortunately for David , however , the representatives from Gath – Premiere Damien Shaw ( Mark Margolis ) and General Malek ( the always - awesome Miguel Ferrer ) – decide that they want to meet this near - mythical member of the Gilboan armed forces while the specifics of the truce are given a final once - over .
Cross continues to make things miserable for Silas , and while Michelle bonds with David ’s mom , Jack ’s annoyance at his omission from the state dinner guest list leads him to offer some rebellion aginst his father … though , due to Cross ’s shenanigans , it does n’t go quite as planned .
Please watch “ Kings ” tonight , even though I ’m not going to be the asshole who tacks on the additional line , “ Because it ’s a damned sight better than ( INSERT SHOW HERE ) . ”
I will , however , say that there ’s no show running against it that can’t readily be downloaded or watched online , so have a heart and give “ Kings ” a chance .
Quicklook for markdown
10 Feb 2009 » permalink
Update :
My changes were merged into the original code .
As services such as DropBox become more mature , it makes again sense to store simple textual content ( ie. notes ) as files — instead of going for Everything Buckets .
For simple text files DropBox provides an actually working synchronization , offline access to the data and a pretty good integration with the native platform ( be it GNOME or OSX ) .
I usually store my notes and other simple text snippets as markdown - formatted plain - text files .
The simple markdown format is exactly the amount of syntactic sugar I need to get along .
Additionally , the markdown format is supported by all popular editors ( gEdit , TextMate , vi… ) and many web - writing platforms .
On OSX by default the markdown files ( .markdown ) have two limitations when compared to standard ( . txt ) files :
Ca n’t be Quicklook'ed
Contents are not indexed by Spotlight ( ca n’t be searched )
Installing an editor such as TextMate gives support for the .
markdown extension but does not solve either of the above problems .
Phil Toland did a great work and created a markdown quicklook plugin .
I took his code and improved a bit on it .
In particular , my version does 3 things more :
Uses discount C library to render markdown ( instead of calling - in Perl )
Styles the output a little bit ( Helvetica vs. Times )
Adds spotlight indexing
To get going you need to install the compiled binary plugin in ~ / Library / Quicklook / ( create if it does n’t exist ) .

Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 is here at last -- the newest entry into the ongoing browser wars .
Microsoft packed a healthy number of new features into IE 8 , and made security a top priority in its newest version of this venerable Web browser .
But just as important as all that is browsing speed -- that is , how quickly can IE 8 render your favorite Web sites ?
To get an idea of how IE 8 compares , we put it to the test .
Our Speed - Test Methodology
Artwork : Chip Taylor
In our browser speed comparison , we pitted a near - final build of Internet Explorer 8 against Firefox 3.0.7 , the current non-beta version of Mozilla 's browser .
We used a set of nine popular Web sites in our testing : Amazon , MySpace , Yahoo , PC World , YouTube , Microsoft , Apple , eBay , and Wikipedia .
To ensure we could gather as accurate page - loading times as possible , we recorded our testing sessions for review later on .
We loaded each site ten times in each of the browsers and repeated the process the following day to rule out any network traffic or server issues .
Prior to each test run , we cleared the browsers ' caches as well .
We also repeated the load tests to ensure that we had sufficient data to identify loading speed trends .
To ensure consistent results , we performed testing on a fresh Windows Vista installation , and we reinstalled the operating system before each round of testing .
Additionally , we removed the two best and two worst scores for each page load test to produce more consistent results .
Browser testing can be tricky , as different browsers measure page loading progress differently , so getting a read of page load times strictly by the browser 's progress bar could result in inaccurate or inconsistent results .
Have all the images appeared ?
Are there elements of the page that have yet to load even though the browser 's status indicator suggests otherwise ?
These are questions we take into account when testing browsers .
Given this , we took into account visual indications of a page 's loading progress , rather than relying on what the browser 's progress bars told us .
The Speed - Test Results
By and large , we found that Internet Explorer 8 performed well , and beat out Firefox 3.0.7 in the majority of our time trials .
However , IE 8's performance advantage is relatively negligible .
In most of our testing , IE 8 's advantage was half a second or less .
One notable exception , however , was in loading the English - language Wikipedia home page , where IE 8 beat out Firefox by an average of one second ( IE 8 took about 2.2 seconds to load the page on average , while Firefox 3 took about 3.3 seconds ) .
Also of note : on average , IE 8 loaded Apple 's home page nearly twice as quickly as Firefox .
IE 8 is Faster , But Will You Notice ?
In practical , everyday use , you likely wo n't notice much of a difference between IE 8 and Firefox 3 .
Due to the fact that broadband connections are so commonplace today , and the fact that browsers in general can load pages faster than they could even a couple years ago , the page load time differences between the two are relatively moot .
If you use Firefox and are happy with it , you may as well stick with it .
That said , it is encouraging to see browser vendors compete with each other , and aim to ship the fastest Web browsers they possibly can .

SAMSON , Ala. , March 10 ( UPI ) --
A gunman killed at least nine people in a small town and one more elsewhere in the worst mass homicide in Alabama history , police said .
The man died in a confrontation with police after wounding a sheriff 's deputy , the Dothan Eagle reported .

" It is truly one of the most horrific things that anyone in law enforcement can remember in Alabama , " Col. J. Christopher Murphy , director of the Alabama Department of Public Safety , told The New York Times .
" We 're still getting victims coming in . "
Nine of the dead were in Samson , a town of about 2,000 people a few miles north of the Florida Panhandle , the Eagle said .
They included the wife and child of a sheriff 's deputy .
The tenth was in Kinston , an even smaller town about 10 miles northeast of Samson .
Many of the dead were in one house in Samson .
" You want to talk about a horrific scene , " Alina Knowles , a neighbor , told the Eagle .
" You see what I saw .
I went to get the baby .
There was blood all over that porch .
The baby was covered in her mother 's blood . "
As the man fled east along Route 52 , a highway that roughly parallels the state line , police officers tried to stop him , rear - ending his car .
He shot and wounded Geneva Police Chief Frankie Lindsey , the Eagle said .
The man took his own life in the parking lot of Reliable Products in Geneva after firing at police .
Internet Explorer is used by the majority of computer users Microsoft has issued a security patch to fix a critical vulnerability in its Internet Explorer browser which it said has attacked over 2 m Windows users .
The flaw is believed to have already infected as many as 10,000 websites .
The " zero day " exploit let criminals take over victims ' computers by steering them to infected websites .
Microsoft 's Christopher Budd said the software giant " encourages all IE customers to test and deploy this update as soon as possible " .
He also said the threat led Microsoft to mobilise security engineering teams worldwide to deliver a software cure " in the unprecedented time of eight days " .
MICROSOFT SECURITY ADVICE
Change IE security settings to high ( Look under Tools / Internet Options ) Switch to a Windows user account with limited rights to change a PC 's settings
With IE7 or 8 on Vista turn on Protected Mode Ensure your PC is updated Keep anti-virus and anti-spyware software up to date
The company 's security response team said the patch consists of more than 300 distinct updates for more than half - a- dozen versions of IE in around 50 languages .
" Even with that , the release Emergency Response process is n't over , " said Security Response Alliance director Mike Reavey .
" There is additional support to customers and additional refinement of our product development efforts . "
Microsoft stressed that the flaw was proven to exist only in IE 7 on all applicable versions of Windows , but that IE 6 and the " beta " release of IE 8 were " potentially vulnerable " .
Users who have automatic updates turned on will receive the patch over the next 24 hours while others can access it via a download .
' Wildfire '
The AZN Trojan has been making the rounds since the beginning of December but became public knowledge in the last week .
Unlike other exploits , users only have to visit a malicious site with Trojans or other malware in order to become contaminated .
Microsoft developed a patch for the " Zero day " flaw in record time
Once an infected web page is opened , malicious downloaders are installed on the computer designed to record keystrokes and steal passwords , credit card details and other financial information .
The sites affected are mostly Chinese and have been serving up programmes to steal passwords for computer games which can then be sold for cash on the black market .
Internet Explorer is the world 's most widely used web browser with nearly three quarters of the market share .
Microsoft estimated that one in every 500 Windows users had been exposed to sites that tried to exploit the flaw and the number of victims was increasing at a rate of 50 % daily .
Researchers at the software security firm Trend Micro said attacks were spreading " like wildfire " .
" This vulnerability is being actively exploited by cyber - criminals and getting worse every day , " said the company 's advanced threat researcher Paul Ferguson .
Microsoft labelled the bug as " critical , " the most serious threat ranking in its four - step scoring programme .
Firefox update
The update is something of an unusual move for Microsoft and underscores the seriousness of the zero day flaw .
The company rarely issues security fixes for its software outside of its regular monthly patch updates .
Firefox will soon end its support of earlier versions of its popular browser Meanwhile Mozilla has released a scheduled update for its open source Firefox web browsers for at least 10 different vulnerabilities .
The bugs in the browser could have been " used to run attacker code and install software , requiring no user interaction beyond normal browsing , " said Mozilla .
It is also reissuing calls for users to upgrade from Firefox 2.0 to Firefox 3.0 as soon as possible and said it is " not planning any further security and stability updates for Firefox 2 " .
This means Mozilla will no longer support the Firefox 2 browser against future online scams and attacks .

FOR some people in this world , the glass always seems to be half - full .
For others it is half - empty .
But how someone comes to have a sunny disposition in the first place is an interesting question .
It has been known for a long time that optimists see the world selectively , mentally processing positive things while ignoring negative ones , and that this outlook helps determine their health and well - being .
In recent years , it has also become clear that carriers of a particular version of a particular gene are at higher risk than others of depression and attempted suicide when they face traumatic events .
The gene in question lies in a region of the genome that promotes the activity of a second gene , which encodes a protein called the serotonin transporter .
Serotonin is a messenger molecule that carries signals between nerve cells , and it is known to modulate many aspects of human behaviour , although the details are complex and controversial .
The transporter protein recycles serotonin back into the cell that produced it , making it available for reuse , but also reducing the amount in the junctions between cells and thus , it is presumed , the strength of the signal .
It has looked increasingly likely , therefore , that genes — particularly those connected with serotonin — have a role to play in shaping a person 's outlook .
So Elaine Fox and her colleagues at the University of Essex , in Britain , wondered whether genes play a part in the selective attention to positive or negative material , with consequent effects on outlook .
To find out , they took samples of DNA from about 100 people and then subjected these people to what is known as the dot - probe paradigm test to see how they reacted to different stimuli .
In this test participants are briefly shown photographs that may be positive , negative or neutral in tone .
They then have to press a keypad to indicate when a dot has appeared on the screen .
It has been found by experience that the more distracting an image is , the longer a person takes to respond when the dot appears .
That allowed Dr Fox and her team to discover how distracting particular people found particular images .
In a paper just published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B they report that , sure enough , gene - related variation caused a bias in attention towards positive and negative material .
Some people had two “ long ” versions of the promoter gene ( one inherited from each parent ) , a combination that reduces the amount of serotonin in the junctions between nerve cells .
These individuals were biased towards positive images and away from negative ones .
By contrast , those who had either a long and a short version of the gene , or two short versions ( and thus , presumably , more serotonin in the junctions ) , did not have such protective biases .
In other words , the optimists really did see the world differently .
Rose - tinted spectacles may be good for one 's health , as these results fit in with wider ideas about how a tendency to look on the bright side of life is part of being resilient to stress .
Those with short variants of this gene are expected to have an increased susceptibility to mood disorders following such stress .
It is not all good news , though , for optimists .
Because these results suggest that a person 's attitude to life is inherited , they serve as a stark warning to all buoyant optimists that trying to cheer the rest of the world up with nothing more than a smile and an effortlessly sunny disposition is doomed to failure .
I recently became friends with Charlie Sheen -- but not exactly .
It 's a little complicated .
You see , I 've spent the past three months moving up the Facebook social ladder , " friending " more and more important people every day .
My online social aspirations evolved shortly after publishing a piece in this newspaper supporting George W. Bush .
My real - life friend Charlotte Wilcher told me that the president 's nephew , Pierce Bush , had posted my article on his Facebook profile .

In 2009 , Formula One ( F1 ) motor racing is introducing new rules that will lower the environmental impact of the sport .
Part of this is to recover deceleration energy that can be stored for acceleration .
The first commercial product resultant from this mandated new direction in technology will come from vehicle transmission design and manufacturing company Xtrac .
A licence arrangement will enable Xtrac to exploit Torotrak ’s full - toroidal traction drive technology to develop highly efficient and compact continuously variable transmissions ( CVTs ) for use in the new kinetic energy recovery systems ( KERS ) proposed for F1 .
Whatsmore , the system holds much promise for use in road cars .
Very cool technology indeed !

The fact that Formula One had so directly contributed to a technology destined for road use , was not lost at the announcement when Peter Digby , managing director of Xtrac , commented : “ The transfer of world - class transmission technology from Torotrak , combined with the added value of Xtrac ’s expertise in the design and manufacture of transmissions for motorsport – and with clear potential to feed the resulting technical solution back into mainstream automotive use – is a good example of what I believe FIA president Max Mosley had in mind when he announced that Formula
One should embrace an energy efficient future and open up the world of motorsport to new manufacturers . ”
Dick Elsy , chief executive at Torotrak , added : “ We are delighted to be working with Xtrac on this exciting new application of our transmission technology , to provide a highly efficient KERS solution for initial application in motorsport , but with a clear opportunity to apply the system in mainstream road cars to provide performance , economy and greenhouse gas emission benefits . ”
How Torotrak ’s full - toroidal traction drive technology works
The components within each variator include an input disc and an opposing output disc .
Each disc is formed so that the gap created between the discs is ‘ doughnut ’ shaped ; that is , the toroidal surfaces on each disc form the toroidal cavity .
Two or three rollers are located inside each toroidal cavity and are positioned so that the outer edge of each roller is in contact with the toroidal surfaces of the input disc and output disc .
As the input disc rotates , power is transferred via the rollers to the output disc , which rotates in the opposite direction to the input disc .
The angle of the roller determines the ratio of the Variator and therefore a change in the angle of the roller results in a change in the ratio .
So , with the roller at a small radius ( near the centre ) on the input disc and at a large radius ( near the edge ) on the output disc the Variator produces a “ low ” ratio .
Moving the roller across the discs to a large radius at the input disc and corresponding low radius at the output produces the “ high ” ratio and provides the full ratio sweep in a smooth , continuous manner .
The transfer of power through the contacting surfaces of the discs and rollers takes place via a microscopic film of specially developed long - molecule traction fluid .
This fluid separates the rolling surfaces of the discs and rollers at their contact points .
The input and output discs are clamped together within each variator unit .
The traction fluid in the contact points between the discs and rollers become highly viscous under this clamping pressure , increasing its ‘ stickiness ’ and creating an efficient mechanism for transferring power between the rotating discs and rollers .
Future developments
Some of the new KERS systems under development will be mechanically based and will utilise a flywheel to recuperate , store and subsequently discharge a moving vehicle ’s kinetic energy , which is otherwise wasted when the vehicle is decelerated .
The kinetic energy is stored during a braking manoeuvre and is then released back into the driveline as the vehicle accelerates .
The toroidal traction drive variator , being developed with Torotrak and using Torotrak ’s patented technology , is a central element in these mechanical flywheel - variator KERS systems as it provides a continuously variable ratio connection between the flywheel and the vehicle driveline , via the vehicle ’s gearbox .
Torotrak has granted a licence to Xtrac to design , manufacture , assemble and distribute components or complete variator systems incorporating Torotrak ’s technology to its F1 customers .
The innovative combination of a Torotrak variator – providing mechanical efficiency that should be in excess of 90 per cent – with a flywheel of advanced construction , results in a highly efficient and compact energy storage system .
Whilst Xtrac will supply variator units to its customers , the flywheels for these energy recovery systems are being developed separately by the Formula 1 teams themselves and their specialist suppliers .
Torotrak will provide the control system expertise .
Torotrak and Xtrac believe that the variator - flywheel solution provides a significantly more compact , efficient , lighter and environmentally - friendly solution than the traditional alternative of electrical - battery systems .
“ The variator weighs less than 5kg in these applications and provides a high level of mechanical efficiency , enabling the overall mass of the mechanical KERS systems to be minimised , ” says Chris Greenwood , technology director at Torotrak .
“ This mechanical efficiency , combined with the variator ’s ability to change ratio very rapidly , helps to optimise flywheel performance . ”
The two companies consider that the system is applicable to other motor sports and everyday vehicles and see the potential for wider applications – particularly on high - performance road cars – as an aid to performance and also as a means of developing future vehicles with reduced CO 2 emission levels .
The system supports the current trend in powertrain design for engine downsizing by providing a means of boosting acceleration , overall performance and economy independently of the vehicle ’s engine and without the need for complex electrical - battery hybrid architectures .
A CVT - controlled flywheel is particularly suited to stop - start driving situations when real - world fuel economy is often at its worst .
In these conditions , the variator - flywheel system can assist the launch of a vehicle which has slowed down or come to a standstill , by utilising the kinetic energy stored in the flywheel .
In heavily congested traffic , where a car is frequently stopped and restarted , the system can help alleviate the heavy fuel consumption and emissions of greenhouse gasses normally associated with these conditions .
For the F1 applications , the stored kinetic energy can be applied by the driver on demand whenever required – at a rate and for a time period set by the regulations – to boost performance for rapid acceleration .
The device is particularly beneficial when exiting corners or for tricky overtaking manoeuvres .
“ The mechanical efficiency , compactness and mass of the variator system is critical since it directly influences the size and the ability to package such a system into an F1 car , or into a road vehicle , ” says Adrian Moore , technical director at Xtrac .
“ The size , torque capacity and response of the unit is critical to take the full advantage of having a flywheel KERS system . ”

Looks like a great idea for those keen to increase bottle sales …..
The House of Lords report on Britain 's surveillance society is a devastating analysis of the systems that have been installed by the authoritarian Labour government and the controlling forces emerging in local government .
There is no question now that Britain 's free society is under threat , and it is time for the public and opposition parties to declare an end to this regime of intrusion .
Until today it has been the work of activists , journalists and a handful of academics like Clive Norris of Sheffield University to warn of the dangers to our freedom and privacy posed by the database state .
Now it is official .
There could be no more authoritative judgment than this measured report , Surveillance Citizens and the State , produced by the Lord 's constitution committee .
The report says that mass surveillance " risks undermining the fundamental relationship between the state and citizens , which is the cornerstone of democracy and good governance " .
It paints a picture of a governing class that has become obsessed with the collection of personal data .
The public is " often unaware of the vast amount of information about them that is kept and exchanged between organisations "
This will be greatly increased if Jack Straw 's coroners ' and justice bill is allowed to pass through the Commons , with Labour manipulating the parliamentary schedule so that the data - sharing proposals contained in it go largely unscrutinised .
The report says that successive governments have constructed an advanced surveillance society on the pretext of dealing with the menace of crime and terror .
It amounts " to one of the most significant changes in the life of the nation since the end of the second world war " .
I would add that it is the greatest threat to our democracy since Britain faced Hitler 's military machine .
Such remarks have in the past been dismissed by the government as paranoia .
Government supporters in the media have talked about activists seeking a kind of victimhood when they raised the alarm .
How many times have we heard that sinister and dishonest line , " if you 've nothing to hide , you have nothing to fear ? "
Well , it is plain that we all have something to fear from the society that ministers like Straw , David Blunkett , Charles Clarke , John Reid and Jacqui Smith have brought into being .
Not one of these Labour home secretaries has stood against the agenda that has been quietly implemented by the Home Office , Ministry of Justice and police forces .
But of course it is not just central government that is responsible .
One of the strengths of the Lords ' report is its criticism of the local authorities which have used the Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act – terror laws known as RIPA – to mount secret spying operations on people suspected of littering , fly - tipping , fishing illegally and applying to a school outside their catchment area .
Among 44 recommendations , the report asks the government to reconsider the use of RIPA laws by local councils .
The cross party committee is particularly good on the principle that privacy is essential to any healthy democracy .
Lord Goodlad , a former Conservative chief whip , said :
The huge rise in surveillance and data collection by the state and other organisations risks undermining the long - standing traditions of privacy and individual freedom which are vital for democracy .
If the public are to trust that information about them is not being improperly used there should be much more openness about what data is collected , by whom and how it is use .
The Lords suggest that all future plans to collect and share information should be exposed to a procedure which they describe as " privacy impact assessment "
This is welcome because it underlines the point that personal information is precisely that and that any government must explain why it needs our data and what it proposes to do with it .
Up until now the government has treated our information as if it were state property .
It is regrettable that the Lords did not comment on the proposals of the communications data bill which will allow the government to seize data from every phone call , text message , email and internet connection .
But they have commented on the DNA database and recommended that the DNA of all innocent people should be removed .
And they have commented on the spread of CCTV systems .
They say that four million cameras are watching us , but that is an old statistic and I suspect that we are approaching the figure of five million – roughly one camera for every 12 people .
We have got used to the little black orbs attached to lampposts throughout our city centres and public spaces , but when foreigners see the evidence of such pervasive suspicion they are astounded and also amazed that the British have slept while sinister forces mount a silent coup .
Last night I was talking to an Israeli who simply could not believe the number of cameras he came across every day .
The report calls for a profound change in the attitudes and behaviour of the government .
But that is not going to happen .
Labour is committed to its course of eroding the traditions , procedures and respect on which our free society is based .
It will not rest until all its costly systems are in place and its legacy of control and disrespect is assured .
This report is a grave warning to us all , especially to an opposition that has been so feeble in defending our privacy and rights .
Many of us feel vindicated this morning , but the battle has yet to begin .
Top 10 Reasons Why Terrell Owens Signed With The Bills
Total Pro Sports –
We have no idea why Terrel Owens choose the Buffalo Bills as his preferred destination to play this upcoming 2009 season .
With the economy being so bad we are stunned that Ralph Wilson , the owner of the Bills , can actually afford to pay this contract .
The Terrell Owens signing does n’t surprise us one bit ; he has always been known for his antics and craziness throughout his career .
We hope he does n’t expect too much from the city of Buffalo and the Bills because it ’s definitely not like playing in a “ big market ” like Dallas .
Lets take a look at the possible Top 10 reasons why we think Terrell Owens may have signed with the Buffalo Bills .
10 . Buffalo
Is A Beautiful City – Wait a minute I can’t find the City of Buffalo anywhere on the web as a top ranked city in the United States , so this ca n’t be a reason .
[ Google ]
9. Niagara Falls –
One of the most amazing Wonders of The World , Niagara Falls is just a stone throw away from Buffalo .
The restaurants , hotels , casinos and nightlife is a reason to visit and is one of the most traveled destinations in the world .
[ Niagara Falls ]
8. Owens Wants To Show The World He Is Better Than Randy Moss – The Buffalo Bills play the division rivals New England Patriots twice a year and a chance that he can show the world he is a better player than Randy Moss … …
… But with no real quarterback , we are still trying to figure out how the Bills are going to throw the ball to him ?
7. Buffalo Chicken Wings – I mean if I were Terrell Owens I would play for the Bills just because of the Chicken Wings .
Buffalo Chicken
Wings are known all over the world and most people travel to Buffalo just to eat their famous wings .
Do n’t be fooled by other restaurant gimmicks because unless you ’re in Buffalo eating Buffalo chicken wings , then you are not eating the real thing .
[ The Anchor Bar ]
The phenomenon created in 1964 by Teressa Bellissimo has spread across the globe .
Although many have tried to duplicate Buffalo Wings , the closely guarded secret recipe is what makes Frank & Teressa ’s the proclaimed “ Best Wings in the World . ”
6. Buffalo Is North America ’s Team – Terrell Owens said it best during his press conference ,
“ I ’m leaving America ’s team ( for ) North America ’s team , ” Owens said at a news conference .
“ This may not be the most ideal place for a lot of people , but I ’m the guy .
I beat to my own beat sometimes , my own thinking , my own intuition . ”
Actually , if you did n’t know the Bills are actually Toronto ’s team , more than half of the fans that attend a Buffalo Bills game are either from Toronto or from north of the border .
If the Bills were not located on the border of Canada and the US , the team would have most likely relocated already .
[ Fox Sports ]
5. Terrell Owens Wants To Live In Toronto –
This may not be a bad thing for T.O.
He would fit in perfectly in Toronto .
It has always been rumored that some Buffalo Bill players own condos in the city of Toronto .
Players past and present like Takeo Spikes , Trent Edwards , and Josh Reed are just to name a few .
The commute is not bad from Downtown Toronto : it takes about 1 hour and 20 minutes , but being Terrell Owens he would probably rather take a private helicopter to work everyday .
[ Toronto ]
4 . The Toronto Nightlife – The City of Toronto is one of the best party destinations in the world .
It tops the list of destinations including places like New York , Las Vegas , Ibiza , Miami , Berlin .
So if you see Owens on a Saturday night at a local Night Club in Toronto this upcoming football season do n’t be surprised .
[ Toronto Night Clubs ]
3. Owens Is A Big Basketball Fan – Terrell Owens is a huge basketball fan that loves watching and playing the game .
At times he can be spotted sitting front row at different basketball venues or showing off his talent during the Celebrity NBA All Star Game .
Being only an hour away from Toronto he may have some interest in joining the Toronto Raptors .
The Raptors could use a energetic # 3 , ” The Raptors Should Look At Terrell Owens “ .
2. T.O. Likes The Snow – I do n’t know who would ever want to play in the snow and the freezing cold weather of Buffalo ?
Terrell Owens is in for a big surprise , do n’t let it shock you if you do n’t see him on the field with some unforeseen injury when the weather is not to his liking .
[ The Buffalo Snow ]
1. Terrell Owens Does Not Want To Win A Super Bowl – The Bills last year again missed the playoffs finishing the season off with a 7 - 9 record .
The problems do n’t end there , they have a troubled running back in Marshawn Lynch and unstable quarterback in Trent Edwards .
So the signing of Terrell Owens will not make the Buffalo Bills a Super Bowl contender !
Sorry Buffalo
I did n’t mean to burst your bubble .

Statistics prove prescription drugs are 16,400 % more deadly than terrorists .
According to the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) in 1998 , a report finds that prescription drugs kill about 106,000 Americans each year – that ’s three times as many as are killed by automobiles — making prescription drug death the fourth leading killer after heart disease , cancer and stroke .
http://www.marketingoverdose/
Last year , the Journal of the American Medical Association puts death from all drugs , illegal and prescription , second only behind car accidents as a cause of death .
The rise in deaths coincides with the direct marketing of prescription medication to the public .
Prescription drug sales have soared nearly 500 percent since 1990 .
The pharmaceutical industry is a multi-trillion dollar business .
Companies spend billions on advertising and promotions for prescription drugs .
Pharmaceutical companies claim their drug ads are " educational " to the public .
The public seems to genuinely believe that drugs advertised on TV are safe , in spite of the plethora of side effects listed .
Many of these drugs have proven deadly .

Every day it ’s estimated 2,500 teens abuse a prescription pain killer for the first time .
The White House Office of National Drug Control policy had been planning to unveil an ad campaign to target prescription drug abuse by teens .
It is time to stop this form of advertising by the pharmaceutical companies .

If we heard reports of George W. Bush or Barack Obama waking up and having a martini before going about their daily routines , there would definitely be an uproar .
But not too long ago , it was n't uncommon for world leaders to drink throughout the day , and it was n't that long ago that opium was considered a cure - all medicine .
Now that we 're more fully aware of how those things can mess with your brain , it seems astonishing that these people were running the world while under the influence of hallucinogens or alcohol .
This post was inspired by a great podcast , by the way - Dan Carlin 's Hardcore History .
If you 're interested in stuff like this , be sure to check it out .
1. Despite the image of youth and vitality he portrayed , JFK actually had a lot of health problems , including asthma , Addison 's disease , back problems and severe allergies .
To treat all of his problems , he was using any number of painkillers and opiate - based medicine .
A doctor nicknamed " Dr. Feelgood "  gave him shots that included vitamins , steroids , and amphetamines .
He was taking so many shots in such large doses that legitimate doctors told him he needed to back off of the stuff .
During both the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis , he was on steroids , painkillers , anti-spasmodics , antibiotics , antihistamines and an anti-psychotic drug .
This cocktail of drugs often left him feeling groggy or unfocused , so he would take anti-anxiety medicine to try to counter all of that .
2. Winston Churchill liked to drink " “ that was no secret .
He woke up drinking , in fact , and was known to keep a drink within reach throughout the entire day .
However , he also popped pills like they were candy .
He named his pills majors , minors , reds , greens , and " Lord Morans , "  after his physician who prescribed them .
He also took stimulants for the same reason JFK later did : to appear youthful and vigorous .
3. Churchill 's successor , Anthony Eden , liked his fair share of pills as well .
He had chronic gall bladder problems , which is why he carried a box of medicine with him at all times , including a healthy supply of morphine .
He also got hooked on Benzedrine and has even acknowledged that fact himself .
4. Stalin is another one who was probably an alcoholic .
When the Germans attacked the Russians in 1941 , Stalin pretty much disappeared off the face of the map for a week .
One theory is that he was pretty much out on a bender that entire week .
And a firsthand account says that he was able to drink a " khanty "  " “ a buffalo horn used as a glass that could easily hold three or four bottles of wine " “ with no problem whatsoever .
5 . Hitler reportedly took doctor - administrated amphetamine shots for the last several years of his life .
Then he took barbiturates to come down .
His doctor , Theodore Morell , meticulously recorded each of 73 medications he gave to Hitler , including sedatives , hormones , laxatives , narcotics , methamphetamine and cortisone .
6 . Some historians speculate that Alexander the Great 's decision to burn Persepolis to the ground was alcohol - fueled .
Alexander loved to drink , despite being scornful of his father 's drinking problem .
The story is that Alexander , his men and some courtesans were celebrating their victories with copious amounts of alcohol when one of the courtesans gave a drunken speech about how Persepolis should be burned to the ground " “ the Persians burned Athens when they conquered it , so it would be only fair , she said .
In their drunken revelry , everyone thought this sounded like a great idea ( I think most of us have thought an idea was fabulous when under the influence , only to sober up and realize how stupid it was ) and proceeded to do just that .
Some historians think this was calculated , but the argument against it includes the fact that when Alexander 's troops saw the city burning ( they were camped out beyond city limits ) , they thought it was accidental and came running to help .
If it was premeditated , Alexander probably would have informed his troops that it was about to happen .
7. Herman GÃ¶ring , Hitler 's designated successor , was a morphine addict .
In fact , in the " ˜20s , he was placed in a mental asylum because he was such a violent drug addict .
But by the time he was a big cheese with the Nazis , he would shoot himself up before staff meetings and then fall asleep mid-meeting .
By the end of the war , most of the people around him thought he was pretty incompetent .
8 . It 's speculated that Napoleon 's performance at Waterloo was so awful because he was heavily under the influence .
Reports say that on the day of the battle , he was sluggish , indecisive and slow , probably due to the fact that he was in pain the night before and took a dose of opium .
This was a time when opium was commonly used as a medicine for a wide variety of ailments , so it really would n't have been thought of twice .
9 . If the name James Wilkinson does n't ring a bell , it 's probably because history has n't been kind to him .
He led an invasion of Canada during the War of 1812 , but he was so soused on alcohol and hopped up on opium that his directions were terrible , misleading and confusing .
An army of 180 Canadians managed to fend off Wilkinson 's force of more than 4,000 .
10 . Lyndon B. Johnson may or may not have been an alcoholic , but he certainly had alcohol - related bouts of rage .
One Air Force
One Steward recalls that Johnson threw a drink on the floor after declaring it too weak : his preference was three - quarters of a glass of scotch and one - quarter soda water .
George Reedy , Johnson 's press secretary , said he would drink scotch after scotch for days on end , and then abruptly just stop for months .
by Christopher Allen & Shannon Appelcline
[ This is the second of a series of articles on collective choice , co-written by my collegue Shannon Appelcline .
It will be jointly posted in Shannon 's Trials , Triumphs & Trivialities online games column at Skotos . ]
In our previous article we talked about the many systems available for collective choice .
There are selection systems , which are primarily centered on voting and deliberation , opinion systems , which represent how voting could occur , and finally comparison systems , which rank or rate different people or things in a simple , comparative manner .
One purpose of our previous article was to create a dictionary of terms for talking about these related , but clearly different , systems .
Another was to start offering analyses of these systems , many of which had not been well studied before their introduction onto the Internet .
However at best our previous article provided an overview of what should be further investigated in each system .
This article provides more in - depth coverage of one of the systems we previously outlined : rating systems .
As we wrote in our previous article , in comparison rating systems " the value of individual items ( most frequently goods ) rise or fall based upon the largely subjective judgment of individual users . "
Ratings systems should be clearly differentiated from the closely related ranking systems .
Ratings systems have a more subjective component , while ranking systems are largely objective .
Amazon , Netflix , BoardGameGeek , and even the Stock Market were offered up as examples of ratings systems .
Another example of a comparison rating system , and one of the earliest that appeared on the modern Internet , is eBay .
The techniques they use are now beginning to show their age .
eBay : A Failed Rating Experiment
Most rating systems center around rating content , often user - contributed content , and they frequently help apply community values and acclaim to that content .
However , the idea of ratings can go far beyond that narrow niche ( though that will doubtless be its greatest use as the Internet continues to expand ) .
Early Internet site , eBay , was one of the first to widely use user - submitted ratings , and it used them for a different manner : to determine the good traders on their auction site .
Unfortunately , as one of the first in this field , eBay made many mistakes which now leave their ratings system only slightly helpful .
However , its failures can also provide us with insights in creating new rating systems on the Internet .
e Bay allows you to leave positive , negative , or ( more recently ) neutral feedback for each transaction you conduct in their society .
These are aggregated into two numbers .
" Feedback Score " is calculated as unique positive feedback received minus unique negative feedback received , and results in a whole number like " 32 " or " 10,302 " .
" Positive Feedback " is calculated as positive feedback received divided by all feedback received , and results in a percentage like " 100 % " or " 99.8 % " .
Unfortunately , for reasons discussed below , almost all feedback is positive , and thus the Feedback Score acts almost entirely as a track record of how many trades someone has made .
The Feedback Score could be largely replaced by that single number .
You can look at a score of " 27 " , and say , " That 's an amateur trader , or someone just getting started " , at a score of " 3 " , and say , " That person may or may not know what they 're doing " , at a score of " 10,302 " , and say , " That person has done a lot of trades . "
But you still do n't know how good the trader is .
Theoretically , the Positive Feedback percentage should give a more meaningful number , but people so infrequently give bad ratings that , even when they do appear , they look like noise .
Does a percentage of " 99.8 % " on a user with a score of " 1,762 " mean that the seller has a genuine problem or not ?
Do those 3 unhappy customers really represent another 30 who were unwilling to actually click the negative feedback ?
And , did those people have slightly bad experience or really bad experiences ?
It 's pretty hard to say .
Overall , eBay has a few major problems with their rating system :
It 's non-granular , with only two options ( positive / negative ) , or more recently three ( positive / negative / neutral ) .
It 's non-distinct , with no useful guidelines on what behaviors should result in each rating .
It 's non-statistical , and thus ends up showing only a gross number of sales , not a real subjective measure .
It 's bilateral , with buyers and sellers rating each other simultaneously , and thus people are afraid to give bad ratings lest they get them in return .
It 's meaningless , because there are no good tools to control who bids on an auction based on Feedback numbers .
( Technically it may be legitimate to ban low feedback bidders from an auction , then cancel their bids if they enter the auction , but this is neither obvious , automatic , nor simple . )
We 're going to address each of these issues in turn , to offer insight into creating new comparison rating systems .
The first three topics -- granularity , distinction , and a statistical basis -- are the most important elements of a good comparison rating system .
Bilateral & meaningfulness issues will only be relevant on certain sites .
( As a final caveat : in some ways eBay falls closer in ultimate result to a reputation system , a topic which we 'll be covering more in a few articles down the road , but its lessons learned are still entirely accurate for rating systems of all sorts . )
Granular Ratings
In general , people want to be nice .
There are exceptions to that rule , perhaps even great numbers of them , but the average , well - adjusted person would prefer to make other people happy , not sad .
This has a notable effect on any comparison rating system , because it means that people are less likely to use the bottom half of any rating scale .
If you did a statistical run on eBay , you 'd certainly find that more than 99 out of every 100 ratings are positive .
This is largely influenced by concerns of bilateral revenge , as discussed below , and the fact that eBay suggests other means of dispute resolution when you try and leave negative feedback .
However , RPGnet , a roleplaying site which reviews games , comics , books , movies , and more shows a similar trend despite the lack of bilaterality .
RPGnet uses two 5 - points scales for reviews , resulting in a total rating of 2 - 10 .
Of all the ratings at RPGnet , 6,983 reviews have a total that 's above average , a total rating of 6 or more , and 795 have a total that 's below average , a total rating of 5 or less .
Perhaps there are more people who sit down to write a review because they really like a game than those who do so because they really hated it , but the result of ~ 90 % of reviews being above average is still stunning .
The following table shows all the ratings for each of the two categories that RPGnet uses , " Style " and " Substance " :
Rating Style Substance % 1 73 210 1.8 % 2 687 590 8.2 % 3 2127 1583 23.8 % 4 3337 3242 42.2 % 5 1554 2153 23.8 %
This evidence confirms what we 'd already suspected .
Only 10 % of raters use the bottom two ratings in a 5 - point scale , and only 2 % use the bottom rating .
The median of the 5 - point scale is actually the fourth point , with a neat bell curve arranged around it .
Because users are innately unwilling to give bad ratings , as evidenced here , useful comparison ratings truly come about only through fractional differences between good ratings .
In this case , the difference between " 3 " , " 4 " , and " 5 " is meaningful , and becomes more meaningful as more ratings are entered .
Eventually you can look at a ranked list of ratings and see that " 4.2 " is a good rating while " 3.5 " is not .
In order to do this , however , you need enough levels of good ratings to be able to distinguish between them .
eBay , only offering one positive rating , does not provide enough differentiation .
RPGnet , with its three positive ratings , might .
However , sites that offer a 10 - point scale are the ones that really seem to be able to produce meaningful statistics .
On those sites we can expect that 90 % of users will choose between six different numbers , from " 5 " to " 10 " , and as the number of ratings builds up , this will produce enough differentiation to be meaningful .
If you have already adopted a 5 - point scale , consider allowing users to select the half - points , giving users a greater ability to differentiate their ratings .
Distinct Ratings
No two users are ever going to rate the same ; different rating numbers will mean different things to each person .
This can introduce minor discrepencies into ratings , if a single individual rates particularly low or high .
However , because most ratings are eventually used for comparisons , if that low - or high - rater rates many different things , the ratings equalize .
" Item A " is rated low by this person , but so is " Item B " , and so they end up in the correct positions in relation to each other .
A bigger problem occurs when an individual is inconsistent in his ratings over time .
If an individual rates everything low for a while , then rates everything high , then he has a greater chance of biasing the overall rating pool .
Worse , his individual ratings are n't meaningful , because you can't look at two items , see that one is a " 6 " and another is an " 8 " , and truly believe that he likes the " 8 " a fair amount more than the " 6 " .
This reduces the usability of an individual recommendation system or a friends system where one user might look at what other users thought about products , because their unaggregated numbers are not accurate .
You thus want to help individuals to stay consistent , and the best way to do that is to make the criteria for your ratings distinct .
BoardGameGeek , a board game web site that supports a 10 - point rating system for games , does a good job of offering distinction in its ratings .
10 - Outstanding .
Always want to play and expect this will never change .
- Outstanding .
Always want to play and expect this will never change .
9 - Excellent game .
Always want to play it .
- Excellent game .
Always want to play it .
8 - Very good game .
I like to play .
Probably I 'll suggest it and will never turn down a game .
- Very good game .
I like to play .
Probably I 'll suggest it and will never turn down a game .
7 - Good game , usually willing to play .
- Good game , usually willing to play .
6 - Ok game , some fun or challenge at least , will play sporadically if in the right mood .
- Ok game , some fun or challenge at least , will play sporadically if in the right mood .
5 - Average game , slightly boring , take it or leave it .
- Average game , slightly boring , take it or leave it .
4 - Not so good , it does n't get me but could be talked into it on occasion .
- Not so good , it does n't get me but could be talked into it on occasion .
3 - Likely wo n't play this again although could be convinced .
Bad .

2 - Extremely annoying game , wo n't play this ever again .
- Extremely annoying game , wo n't play this ever again .
1 - Defies description of a game .
You wo n't catch me dead playing this .
Clearly broken .
If you offer a distinct rating listing like this , some users will still come up with their own rating ideas , but if they do , they 're more likely to remember what each number means to them .
For everyone else , a very clear , s rating system is the most likely to produce meaningful and consistent results .
As long as users are n't puzzled by the distinction , they 'll be consistent in picking the same numbers for the same rating every time .
Statistical Ratings
The last big topic that you have to think about in creating most comparison rating systems is whether they 're statistically sound .
The best way to make your ratings statistically sound is with volume .
If you can manage thousands or tens of thousands of ratings for each item , any anomolies are going to become noise .
However , the fewer ratings you have , the more likely it is that your ratings are inaccurate in relationship to your database of ratings as a whole .
( And thus one of the failures for eBay is that it tries to claim meaningfulness for users with very few ratings , where there 's clearly no statistical basis . )
Ideally what you want to do is give items with fewer ratings among your collection less weight , and those with more ratings higher weight .
One simple way to do this is to apply a bayesian average .
Variants of this are used by the aforementioned BoardGameGeek and by IMDB .
RPGnet is using it for some unreleased software as well .
The idea behind a bayesian average is that you normalize ratings by pushing them toward the average rating for your site , and you do that more for items with fewer ratings than those with more ratings .
The basic formula looks like this :
b( r ) = [ W( a ) * a + W( r ) * r ] / ( W( a ) + W( r ) ] r = average rating for an item
W(r ) = weight of that rating , which is the number of ratings
a = average rating for your collection
W(a ) = weight of that average , which is an arbitrary number , but should be higher if you generally expect to have more ratings for your items ; 100 is used here , for a database which expects many ratings per item
b( r ) = new bayesian rating
Say three " shill " users had come onto your site and rated a brand new indie film a " 10 " because the producer asked them to .
However , you use a bayesian average with a weight of 100 , and thus 3 ratings wo n't move the movie very far from the average site rating of 6.50 :
b( r ) = [ 100 * 6.50 + 3 * 10 ] / ( 100 + 3 )
b( r ) = 680 / 103
b( r ) = 6.60
WowWebDesigns uses a similar model and even offers a good explanation of their methods on their web site .
With everything that 's been described thus far , including granularity and distinction , a bayesian average ( or some other similiar method ) will probably be enough to give your ratings a good , sound statistical basis .
However , sites with low volume of ratings may still be concerned with " shills " or " crappers " who come in to your site just to put " 10 " s on their favorite items on " 1 " s on their least favorite .
RPGnet 's reviews are an example of a site that could experience this issue , because only a few people are going to ever write reviews for an individual item , and this small number of reviews could compromise the nature of any comparisons generated by the ratings sytems .
In short summary the following additional methods may help with this issue :
Rate the Raters : Reviews are low volume , but presumably readers of those reviews are high volume , and you can take advantage of that to then have your readers rate the reviews .
Amazon and Netflix are two examples of sites which use this method by asking " how many readers found this helpful " .
Altruistic Punishment :
An alternative method for rating raters is to use altruistic punishment .
Herein users can punish someone who does contribute to the community , but at a cost to themselves .
So , a reader could flag a poor rating or a poor review at some minor cost to their own rating .
Though this method may seems somewhat paradoxical , game theory suggests that it is a generally effective technique for improving the commons .
Adjust Ratings Based on Ratings : Ratings can be self - adjusted based upon the rater 's own behavior .
The simplest method here is to map a rater 's average rating to the average rating for a site .
For example , if the average rating of a site is 6.50 and a shill 's average rating is 10.0 , then those 10s should be treated as 6.50s .
This has the possibility for some intensive calculations , however , and may lead to additional bias in your rating pool if shills figure out the methods you use to adjust ratings .
Allow Editorial Fiat : Another method is to allow editorial fiat , where editors are expected to come in and remove bad ratings ( or proactively not release them ) .
This clearly results in time issues , but they may not be major since only sites with small numbers of ratings / item will have to do this type of adjusting .
Further , automated systems could flag " suspicious " rating patterns which are outside the norms for average , speed of rating , etc. ( RPGnet supports editorial fiat by requiring editorial release of all reviews . )
The idea of adjusting ratings based on ratings bears a bit of additional discussion because it 's somewhat similar to another well - knowing rating system : slashdot .
Herein you have both ratings and meta-ratings .
People can rate threads and articles , then other people can agree or disagree with those ratings , which in turn makes it more or less likely that the original rater will be allowed to rate in the future ( depending on if people agree or disagree with his ratings ) .
Under a more general classification , this is probably a meta-rating system based on a reputation system , so it 's something we 'll look at further a couple of articles down the road .
Other Issues : Bilateralism & Usefulness
90 % of the rating issues that sites will face are covered by the above .
However eBay in particular raised two other issues -- bilateralism and usefulness -- that are n't as generally relevant but do deserve some consideration .
Bilateralism :
One of the reasons that eBay 's ratings fall apart is that they 're bilateral .
Buyers and sellers rate each other simultaneously and thus there 's the fear of revenge if you rate someone badly .
It 's a sufficient issue that eBay has a FAQ on the topic , though they do n't offer any good answers .
The following solution would address some issues of bilateral revenge :
Put a time limit on bilateral ratings
Release bilateral ratings simultaneously at the end of the time limit
Do n't allow additional ratings after the time period
This would work well on an eBay , where you 're unlikely to conclude an additional deal with someone you rated badly , and thus there 's no possibility ever for rating revenge .
On a game site , however , where people are arbitrarily put into games with each other , and thus you could end up in a game with someone you rated poorly , there might be room for later revenge , down the road .
This would have to be addressed to truly feel comfortable with bilateral ratings .
Additional investigation might reveal more variations of this method , or offer good answers for alternatives , like anonymous ratings .
In addition , good privacy restrictions are really needed to make bilateral ratings work , as well as Terms of Service that protect users from lawsuits for ratings .
There have already been cases of physical threats based upon eBay ratings .
eBay has also produced cases where people threatened slander or libel lawsuits for bad ratings , and this even further chills the possibility of true ratings appearing on the eBay server .
Usefulness :
Finally , you want to make sure your ratings are useful at your sites .
Rankings are a good way to achieve this .
You can see the " best games ever " ranked , or you can see the most interesting user content rise to the top of a long listing , and the least interesting sink to the bottom .
e Bay offers a counter example of frustration with the usefulness of ratings .
As already mentioned , you can theoretically ban " bad " users from bidding on your items , and then cancel bids from these users if they appear .
However , there are multiple issues with this approach .
First , how do you define " bad " users on eBay ?
Insufficient feedback ?
Too much negative feedback ?
Too high a percentage of negative feedback ?
Second , there is no automated method for doing this , so you must remain ever vigilant on your auctions to make sure that " bad " users are n't involved .
Third , there 's no way to keep a bad bidder from returning after you 've cancelled his bid .
Fourth , these bad bids and cancellations have the possibility of corrupting your auction , as you could lose other bidders who came in , saw the higher bid when the bad bidder was involved , then left before the bid was reduced by his removal .
Finally , greed is a powerful motivator on eBay , which might lead to the retention of bad users .
You also need to be careful with your user interface for ratings .
Here is an example of a poor UI :
Conclusion
Comparison ratings are going to be an increasingly important force as the Internet continues to mature .
To produce meaningful comparison ratings for your site , you need to concentrate on four important factors : granularity , specifity , sound statistics , and usefulness .
And , if you offer bilateral ratings , make sure you understand the subtleties of that as well .

かつ てLinuxと並んで、フリーのPC-UNIXの代表であったFreeBSDやNetBSDといったBSD系のUNIXは、Linuxの急速な進化/普及と比較すると我が道を着実に歩いているといった感じだ。今回紹介する、DragonFly
BSDは、FreeBSD 4（4.8-STABLE）をベースに2003年からMatthew Dillon氏が中心となって開発されているBSD系のオープンソースUNIXシステムである。
その最新版は2009年2月17日にリリースされたバージョン2.2。今回のバージョンアップでは、同じくMatthew Dillon氏が開発し次世代ファイルシステムとして注目を集めているHAMMERファイルシステムが製品化段階（production-ready）となった。後ほど説明するが、HAMMERはスナップショットなどの高度な機能を備える現代的なファイルシステムで、他OSのユーザー／開発者からの関心も高い。
インストー ル
図 1：ブートメニュ ー
DragonFly BSD 2.2のインストールメディアは、CD、USB、DVDイメージとして用意されている。DVDイメージが完全版としての位置づけでGUI環境を含んでいる。なお、いずれもライブ版として使用可能だ。インストールメディアでシステムを起動すると、図1のようなメニューが表示される。
ここでデフォルト の「1」を選択すると、ライブ版として起動しログインプロンプトが表示されるので、「root」（パスワードなし）でログインすればよい。なお、DVD版の場合にはstartxコマンドを実行すると、X Window Systemが立ち上がる。ウィンドウマネージャにはシンプルで軽量な、fluxboxが使用される（図2）。
図2：ライブ版（DVD）のデスクトップ
ハードディスクにインストールするには、ユーザ名「installer」でログインするか、Xを起動している場合には左上のトンボのアイコンをクリックする。すると、CUIのインストーラが起動するので、その指示にしたがって進めればよい（図3）。なお、HAMMERファイルシステムを使用するには、「
Select file system」画面で 「 Use HAMMER 」を選択する。

パッケージシステムはpkgsrc
DragonFly BSDの標準パッケージシステムは、かつてはFreeBSDのportsシステムを採用していた。現在では、NetBSDから移植されたより強力なpkgsrcが標準となっている。このpkgsrcは、インターネットからのソースの取得、コンフィグ、コンパイル、インストールといった流れを自動で行うシステムだ。現在7,300を超える数のパッケージが用意されている。たとえば、ncftpをインストールするには、あらかじめCVSサーバから最新のコレクションをダウンロードした上で次のように実行する。
# cd /usr / pkgsrc/net/ncftp3/ # bmake install clean
これが 、DragonFly BSDにおけるソフトウエア・インストールの基本だ。もちろん依存関係は自動的に解決され、必要なパッケージがあればそれらもインストールされる。この方法は、柔軟なオプション指定が可能な反面、GNOMEのような大規模なソフトウエアはコンパイルに時間がかかる。
そのため、あらかじめコンパイル済みのバイナリパッケージ（tarボールの圧縮ファイル）をイントールすることも可能になっている。それには、pkg_addコマンドの引数にバイナリパッケージのパスを指定して実行すればよい。なお、pkg_addコマンドのラッパープログラムとして、インターネット上のサイトからダウンロード/インストールを行うpkg_raddコマンドも用意されている。たとえば、Ktermのバイナリパッケージをインストールするには次のように実行する。
# pkg_radd kterm -6.2.0nb11
HAMMER ファイルシステム
バージョン2.2の目玉は、なんといっても完成度が増したHAMMERファイルシステムだろう。マルチボリュームに対応し、最大ストレージ容量は1エクサバイト（2^60バイト）、クラッシュからの迅速なリカバリー機能や、過去のファイルシステムに簡単にアクセス可能なスナップショット機能、高速なミラーリング機能などが搭載されている。そのライバルとも言えるSun MicrosystemsのZFSは現在FreeBSDやMac OS X、Linuxにも移植されているがライセンス上の問題を抱えている（そのためLinuxのカーネルツリーに統合できない）のに対して、HAMMERはそうした問題がない点も重要な選択肢とみられている。
インストール時にデフォルトのファイルシステムとして「HAMMER」を選択した場合、ルートパーティション全体がHAMMERファイルシステムになる。dfコマンドなどで確認すると、HAMMERの疑似ファイルシステム( Pseudo File Systems : PFS）が、/varや/homeといったパーティションに分割されてマウントされていることが確認できる。
$ df -h Filesystem Size Used Avail Capacity Mounted on ROOT 56G 1.8G 54G 3 % / /pfs/@@0xffffffffffffffff:00001 56G 1.8G 54G 3 % /var /pfs/@@0xffffffffffffffff:00002 56G 1.8G 54G 3 % /tmp /pfs/@@0xffffffffffffffff:00003 56G 1.8G 54G 3 % /usr /pfs/@@0xffffffffffffffff:00004 56G 1.8G 54G 3 % /home /pfs/@@0xffffffffffffffff:00005 56G 1.8G 54G 3 % /usr/obj /pfs/@@0xffffffffffffffff:00006 56G 1.8G 54G 3 % /var / crash /pfs/@@0xffffffffffffffff:00007 56G 1.8G 54G 3 % / var / tmp procfs 4.0 K 4.0K 0B 100 % / proc
初期設定では、指定した周期でコマンドを実行するPeriodicによって、一日一回スナップショットが作成され、各仮想ファイルシステムの「snapshots/snap-日付-番号」ディレクトリから、その時点でのファイルシステムにアクセス可能になっている。
$ ls -l /home / snapshots / snap-20090227-1252/o2 ←スナップショットにアクセス total 0 drwxrwxr-x 1 o2 o2 0 Feb 27 04:31 japs - rw-r--r-- 1 o2 o2 9 Feb 27 12:22 readme
また、undoコマンドを使用することによって、消去したファイル復活させたり、現在のファイルとの差分をdiff形式で表示したりすることもできる。
$ undo -d / home / o2 / readme ←unified diff形式で差分を表示 diff -u /home/o2/readme@@0x0000000000000000 /home/o2/readme ( to 01 - Jan-1970 00:00:00 ) --- /home/o2/readme@@0x0000000000000000

Astronomers using the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes have just released an incredible image of the center of the Milky Way :
Wow .
Click to get access to much higher - res versions that will embiggen your brain .
They have HUGE versions too .
The image is in the infrared , showing piles of warm gas and dust that litter the galactic center .
The weird structures are carved out by massive star winds , supernova explosions , bursts of star formation , and more .
Lurking in this image , far too small to be seen , is the supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy .
Even though our past and future are intertwined -- the black hole formed around the same time the galaxy did , and evidence is that they helped shape each other -- the black hole is invisible .
It 's smaller than our solar system , and this map is millions of times wider ( 300 x 115 light years ) ; the black hole is far smaller than a pixel on this scale .
To get an idea of the scale of this image , here 's a closeup on the lower left portion :

There 's so much to see !
The fingers of stalagmite - looking gas on the left are actually columns of gas light years long being eroded by the winds of massive stars , probably that bright cluster to the right of the fingers .
On the right is a bright star surrounded by a halo of gas .
What 's that ?
I 'm not sure ; it 's probably another just - born massive star carving out a bubble of gas around it .
That bubble is several light years across !
And just look at the sheer number of stars in the image !
It 's hard to grasp just how big a number 200 billion is , but that 's how many stars are in the galaxy .
There are countless thousands in this one image , and it represents a tiny , tiny fraction of our galaxy .
Wow .
Eating and Driving : An Atmospheric Comparison
The greenhouse gas emissions from producing various foods can be appreciated by comparing them with the emissions from a gasoline - powered passenger car that gets 27 miles per gallon .
The estimated emissions from food production incorporate the assumption that 1,000 kilograms of carbon per hectare per year ( about 2,700 pounds of carbon dioxide per acre per year ) would have been absorbed by forests or other vegetation if the land had not been cleared for annual food crops or fodder ...

A NSW Catholic priest has been charged with a number of child sex offences .
He is the fourth priest to be charged by Strike Force Georgiana detectives , who are investigating a number of alleged sexual assaults on young boys in the greater Newcastle area in the 1970s , '80s and '90s .
The 47 - year - old Raymond Terrace man , who was arrested yesterday , was suspended from pastoral duties in May last year , pending the investigation by the strike force .
We had already used all our credit by January .
The rainy day had come and it was still pouring .
We used all the credit we had while doing painful restructuring .
We were paying it back , interest - only as allowed in the contract .
We were paying it back instead of taking paychecks for the partners in the firm .
We were paying it back .
Citi gave us a shove towards the edge .
The extra payments they are now demanding for early repayment of the loan will push us over the edge .
We had just closed enough business to survive until June , now we wo n't make it beyond April unless we get some help .
I am about to lay off 15 people and close the shutters if our business can't get help .
We bailed them out and they stabbed us in the back .
Fifteen jobs lost because of their greed .
When we needed them most they pushed us over the edge .
And then , another glimmer of hope ...
Yesterday I visited a small local bank to ask for help .
They do n't do investment , or risky mortgages or credit - default - swaps .
They 've been here for 130 years .
One state , a dozen branches .
You 've never heard of them ( good ! ) .
I went to them and begged them to help me save 15 jobs .
I showed them how all the managers had taken voluntary pay freezes to save the jobs .
How we had used credit cards to pay rent so as not to lay off any of our people .
I showed them our billing and receivables that show we have turned the corner .
I begged for help
As I was talking to the manager , a homeless man came in to cash a welfare check of some kind .
He could n't bring his dog into the bank and did n't want to leave it outside .
They called the security guard .
I expected trouble .
The security guard arrived with a bowl of water and offered to sit outside with the dog while the man did his business .
" You are not in Citi anymore Dorothy " I thought .
" We can help " , the manager said .
Screw the big banks .
I learned my lesson .
The only question is :
Will you remember this lesson when times are good again ?
I will .

Thank you all !
Your heartfelt support and comments have given me new strength .

Now it 's also about the local bank who might save us .
How to Clear Your DUI Record
DUI records are can follow someone for a long time and prove incredibly damaging when looking for a job or getting insurance .
But , even if you have faced one or more DUI charges , you have a chance to clear your records .
Use these tips to finally expunge your DUI records and have a clean slate .
Clearing Your DUI Records with the Help of an Attorney
Start researching local attorneys and find one that specializes in DWI or DUI cases .
An entire industry of these specialized lawyers have sprung up in recent years .
Just make sure your chosen attorney is certified as an operator of breath tests , certified as a trainer for Standardized Field Sobriety Test or SFST .
Having these credentials will insure that your DUI attorney will be able to see flaws in police actions or arrests that could help you walk away from your charges , no matter how long they have been on your record .
Clearing Your DUI Records Yourself - Click Here
It 'll be a much more arduous , but you can also clean your DUI records yourself .
This is possible by filling out forms and submitting them to public office .
DUI laws allow you to keep the charges off your background check and your records .
They will still show up for police , but hopefully you wo n't make the same mistakes again that got you DUI .
The forms are the same that an attorney would file , but without the clout of a lawyer , it will be hard to actually argue your case .
But if you just want to get your license back , you may as well save a lot of money and do it yourself .
Oftentimes , with either a lawyer 's help or your own efforts , anyone caught drunken driving will have to take one or more DUI classes .
DUI law changes dramatically from state to state , so check your local laws .
After a while , again depending on your state , your DUI charges will go away on their own .
You can check DUI records online through public record databases .

I ‘ve run into a number of self - proclaimed Christians ( both Catholic and Protestant ) who openly proclaim they favor torture of detainees in the “ war on terror . ”
I ’ve always thought that ’s a strange thing for a person whose Savior was tortured to death to say .
Arguments in favor of torture are particularly troubling for Christians .
Here ’s how pro-torture “ Christians ” typically start a conversation on torture : “ I ’m for torture .
We ’ve got to get information from detainees , and we are n’t going to get anything from them if we Mirandize every detainee on the battlefield and give them an ACLU lawyer and a comfortable prison cell with cable TV . ”
That statement assumes that people apprehended  on the battlefield or otherwise  should be immediately tortured in order to get timely information .
This means they should be tortured before being put on trial .
If officials wait for a trial and then torture only those found guilty , the information wo n’t be timely by the time the torture is administered .
That ’s not only the problem , it ’s the reason why many of those who have been tortured are innocent .
( For a longer list of some innocents and an explanation of how innocents could be apprehended among actual terrorists , check out this book or this book . )
The whole point of giving the accused a trial is to sort the guilty from the innocent .
While the effectiveness of torture is highly doubtful ( American experts claimed it does n’t work but were ignored by the Bush administration ) , there ’s no denying that torture must include accidental torture of innocents if it is to be done in a timely manner .
You simply can’t wait for a trial before the torture commences .
Torture of detainees has gone hand - in - hand with indefinite detention of these same detainees without trial under the Bush administration .
Our Constitution ’s Fifth Amendment requires that anyone apprehended be put on trial : “ No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces . ”
In other words , everyone apprehended or detained by the U.S. government must either be charged under the criminal justice system and given a jury trial or tried under the military justice system ( and therefore be accorded Geneva Convention military protections ) .
That ’s the unequivocal requirement of our Constitution , but the Bush administration did n’t follow the Constitution .
The guilty detainees were never sorted from the innocent .
Therefore , it ’s now common knowledge that innocent people were detained and tortured along with the guilty .
The Obama administration appears ready to continue this legacy , so long as it is not carried out at Guantanamo .
I also sometimes hear this particularly troubling argument among self - professed Christians : “ The U.S. Constitution does not apply to foreigners .
They are not entitled to the same rights as Americans . ”
The first part of this statement is correct , because the Constitution ’s Bill of Rights does n’t apply to American citizens either .
It applies to the government .
The Bill of Rights was written to restrict the government .
That ’s why the Fifth Amendment says “ No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime . ”
The amendment makes no reference to citizens or non-citizens , but restricts the government from imprisoning any “ person ” without due process .
The Eighth Amendment bans “ cruel and unusual punishments ” by the government , and it also makes no distinction between citizens and foreigners .
But the second part of the statement above that I often hear is particularly hypocritical for Christians .
It ’s an explicit repudiation of the Christian and American worldview that our “ Creator ” gave all men rights that are “ inalienable . ”
The un-Christian advocate of torture sees rights only as alienable gifts and help for criminals who will be able to use them against society , though it ’s hard to see how terrorist Timothy McVeigh was helped by having a trial .
The Christian worldview is that all innocent people were protected by honoring McVeigh ’s right to trial , as the right to trial prevents the execution of innocents .
And here the Christian worldview coincides with the explicit wording of the Bill of Rights : Everyone , citizen and foreigner alike , enjoys the same inalienable rights .
How do some so - called Christians justify their very unchristian position in support of torture ?
“ These people do n’t respect human rights .
They behead not only enemy soldiers , but also the civilians they capture . ”
And if we do the same thing to innocent detainees that will make it right , they seem to imply .
Here ’s an alternative counter - argument I hear : “ We can not afford to give full rights to detainees .
That ’s suicide . ”
Our Founding Fathers and laws state otherwise .
Moreover , the principles of Christianity the faithful claim to uphold also say the opposite .
Do they really think it ’s okay to occasionally torture an innocent detainee in order to save thousands ?
Occasionally , I do get a virtual “ yes ” to that question ; it goes something like this : “ I think it ’s unfortunate if an innocent person is detained , but that ’s the price we have to pay in the modern world for our safety .
Yes , torturing one to save thousands is the tough choice we have to make . ”
Ironically , Pontius Pilate might also have reasoned that he would save thousands who would have otherwise died in a violent rebellion by crucifying one innocent .
Whenever I mention this , I always hear the following response : “ You are really stretching things if you are comparing these scum - bag terrorists to Jesus Christ . ”
And finally we ’ve cut to the quick of why a Christian can’t possibly support torture .
A Christian is required to believe that Christ is in our fellow man , especially including the prisoner .
Recall the words of Matthew 25:34 - 46 :
“ Then the King will say to those on his right , ‘ Come , you who are blessed by my Father .
Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world .
For I was hungry and you gave me food , I was thirsty and you gave me drink , a stranger and you welcomed me , naked and you clothed me , ill and you cared for me , in prison and you visited me . ’
“ Then the righteous will answer him and say , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry and feed you , or thirsty and give you drink ?
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you , or naked and clothe you ?
When did we see you ill or in prison , and visit you ? ’
“ And the king will say to them in reply , ‘ Amen , I say to you , whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine , you did for me . ’
“ Then he will say to those on his left , ‘ Depart from me , you accursed , into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels .
For I was hungry and you gave me no food , I was thirsty and you gave me no drink , a stranger and you gave me no welcome , naked and you gave me no clothing , ill and in prison , and you did not care for me . ’
“ Then they will answer and say , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or ill or in prison , and not minister to your needs ? ’
“ He will answer them , ‘ Amen , I say to you , what you did not do for one of these least ones , you did not do for me . ’
“ And these will go off to eternal punishment , but the righteous to eternal life . ”
If they really believe Christ is not in the prisoner , then they do n’t believe the words of Christ himself .
If self - professed Christians really believe it ’s “ suicide ” to honor the Christ in the prisoner , can they really be believers ?
If they think that the Christian worldview is impractical , is n’t that a clear example of lack of faith ?
The final , desperate counter - argument I sometimes hear is the theoretical “ ticking time - bomb ” scenario in favor of torture : “ What if your wife or children were kidnapped , put in an underground chamber with only one hour left of air and you had the kidnapper before you .
Would you not then torture to get the information in time ? ”
But this scenario is a chimera .
It has never happened and probably never will outside of the fictional world of action movies and the television series 24 .
If the torture proponents had a real - world example , they would use it .
But instances of innocents being tortured are legion , including multiple examples of detainees who were tortured to death .
Here , the dishonesty in these “ Christians ” reveals itself .
They refuse to acknowledge the reality that would continually re-create the torture / death of Christ among innocents , taking refuge instead in a fictional , anti-Christian worldview .
Americans  and especially Christians  need to recognize that torture by our own government is a far graver threat to liberty than a small number of wackos out in the world blowing themselves up in car bombs ( and thereby taking themselves out of the gene pool ) .
Terrorism is a manageable outside threat , but torture by our own government is a direct attack on the U.S. Constitution and the very fiber of liberty and our way of life .
There ’s a confluence of interests among Christians and lovers of liberty on the issue of torture .
The denial of our inalienable rights to trial and due process goes hand - in - hand with the injustice of torture .
No foreign terrorist could impose such a sea-change in the nature of our government from without .
With all of the focus on the arrest of Ichiro Ozawa ’s secretary and the debate about whether or not Construction companies should be allowed to make official donations to political parties and candidates , the Japanese parliament seems to have come to a halt .
Normally I would n’t give two hoots if the Japanese parliament had a back log of laws to vote on because it is extremely rare that Japanese politicians have anything of interest to say .
But this month , I really wish that they would speed up their act .
If they do n’t pass an upcoming bill then your ( and my ) cheese bill could be 30 % higher from next month , thanks to the inept Japanese parliament .
Yes it is getting to the stage where I am very tempted to run to my local supermarket and start buying cheese in bulk to get me through the rest of 2009 !
Why ?
Because if the parliament does n’t get in order , focus its intended agenda for March , then it is highly likely that the tariffs on 415 different imported goods could go up by as much as 50 % !
How could that be if there has been no debate in the cabinet about raising tariffs .
That ’s a pretty good point .
The culprit is not in new legislation set to be passed , it is in old legislation that is about to end .
Remember the fiasco surrounding petrol prices this time last year when the opposition party refused to let the LDP force through a renewal of their ‘ temporary ’ tax cut on oil imports ?
Well this is a similar situation .
It seems that the Japanese government – in all their wisdom – designed their tariffs law ( called kanzeiteiritsuho , 関税定率法 ) so that any reductions that Japan had agreed to under WTO would only have a shelf life of 12 months and that if the government did n’t approve the existing tariff cuts every 12 months then they would automatically shoot back to the higher levels that they had before Japan signed onto WTO tariff cuts .
What ridiculous logic .
Can anyone tell me how that came about ?
Even though it does n’t feel like it when you go shopping at your local Seijo Ishii ( 成城石井 ) , right now cheese imports have no tariffs on them at all in Japan .
However , if the government is too busy with Ozawa ’s illegal slush funds from construction companies then from April 1 Cheese could all of a sudden be slapped with a fixed 30 % tariff .
That is a lot if you eat real cheese ( not that torokeru ( melty ? ) stuff they put on pizzas here ) .
Some other key items on the list of 415 imports include beef , malt , tobacco and alcohol .
How many other vices could they be targeting ?
Remember , it is a recession .
And where would you be in a recession without vices ?
So maybe it makes sense to stock up on a few steaks , fags , beer , and a lot of whiskey – not to mention the cheese !

The new chip is expected to be 50 percent more productive than the previous standard 54 - nanometer technology , the company said .
DDR3 DRAM is a random access memory technology used for , among other applications , high bandwidth .
Analysts say the DDR3 DRAM market will become the dominant chip market in the second half of 2009 .
The development of even smaller chips is on the way .
The news service reported Samsung Electronics Co. announced last week it has developed the world 's first 40 - nanometer DRAM chip .

20 Online Video De-Motivational Posters
by Brendan Lopez
The Internet has provided us with many amazing moments in online video over the years , moments that will be remembered for a long time to come .
As you 'll see in the images below , I 've captured some of these moments in the form of de-motivational posters .
One of the original pillars of Apple 's iLife suite , iDVD , has increasingly been given the cold shoulder to the point where it is not even depicted on the retail package anymore .
How much longer will the app stick around now that the company has focused on pushing media sharing online ?
The origins of iDVD
Apple introduced its iDVD authoring software in 2001 , originally shipping it only with SuperDrive - equipped Macs as a way to sell users on new DVD burning hardware .
While data and files could be burned to DVD as easily as standard CDs , mastering DVD movies that could playback on a standard DVD player required special software for titling and chapter definition as well as transcoding the video into the MPEG - 2 format .
Apple did n't want to waste any time entering the new market for DVD authoring , which it saw as a key element in its software - centric , digital hub strategy for differentiating its Mac platform from generic PCs in the late 90s , so it acquired Germany 's Astarte , the maker of DVDirector and the original developer of the CD burning app Toast .
While Apple was reworking the firm's DVDirector to become the original DVD Studio Pro , it also wanted a simple consumer version .
Astarte had a consumer version of its DVD mastering software in the works , but " it was terrible , " reported Mike Evangelist , who joined Apple from Astarte .
In an interview printed by Pioneer Press , Evangelist and a group of Astarte developers described pitching the simplified app concept to Steve Jobs .
" Jobs never glanced at their presentation , " the article noted .
" Instead , he walked up to a whiteboard and drew a square .
This is the program , he said .
Users will drag their movies here to create DVD menus .
Then they 'll click ' burn . '
That 's it .
' I do n't want to hear anything about drawers or pop - out ' windows , he said . "
Jobs also had harsh criticism for the Astarte team building DVD Studio Pro , calling the original interface " brain - dead stupid . "
Apple ended up spending an additional six months on the product .
It also released the simpler iDVD just in time for Macworld .
Both products helped set the Mac platform apart at a crucial period of Apple 's return to relevance .
DVD authoring was both computationally demanding , a factor that helped highlight the PowerPC processor 's particular savvy at tasks like video transcoding , and also complex enough to greatly benefit from Apple 's prowess at developing simple and easy to use software interfaces .
Part of the iLife digital hub
Shortly after introducing DVD Studio Pro , Apple bought Spruce Technologies and used its software to release DVD Studio Pro 2 in 2003 as an entirely new pro authoring app with a completely different interface .
The same year , iDVD 3 was bundled along with iPhoto , iMovie and iTunes as part of the new iLife package .
Previously , all of the individual apps had been free downloads .
Over the next three years , iLife expanded to include GarageBand and iWeb .
In 2006 , iDVD was opened up to enable burning to any DVD - R device rather than being exclusively tied only to Apple 's built in SuperDrive models .
From that point forward , iDVD was no longer helping to sell extra hardware by motivating users to upgrade to a SuperDrive .
Instead , all of the iLife apps were now being sold at retail , albeit at shareware prices , in order to add value to the Mac platform while generating enough revenue to sustain their development .
That left Apple with less motivation to push DVD authoring , but another product from Apple would help deflate the company 's interest in promoting iDVD to an even greater extent : online video sharing .
Gallery in the clouds
In 2007 , Apple announced iLife 08 at a special event that demonstrated a new Dot Mac web application called Web Gallery built using the SproutCore JavaScript framework .
The suite 's various apps were tied into the cloud computing service to allow users to easily share and present their work online rather than burning it to disc .
Jobs explained at the time that users could upload their vacation videos via iMovie at better than DVD quality and gave short shrift to the new version of iDVD that shipped in the box .
The next year , Dot Mac turned into MobileMe , and the fledgling Web Gallery became the harbinger for a new suite of web apps for handling email , contacts , calendar events , file transfers , and of course , a gallery of online photos and videos .
Apple 's aggressive software release schedule forced the new online suite into production to coincide with the release of the iPhone 3G .
That resulted in a weak introduction and lots of complaints from both Dot Mac users who experienced some transition issues as well as new users who found the apps overburdened to the point of being slow or even unreachable .
Even so , Jobs '
Apple was n't about to retreat back into a media sharing strategy centered on disc burning .
Jobs the creator , destroyer
After all , this was the Jobs that had decisively killed the 3.5 " floppy disc with the 1998 iMac after first introducing it in the 1984 Macintosh .
After initially falling behind the curve with CD burning in the late 90s , Jobs ' Apple had rushed to put CD burners on Macs but then largely obsolesced disc burning with the iPod just a few years later , using iTunes as a catalyst for the transition .
With the iPod , Jobs similarly pushed hard drive mechanisms into the limited capacity Flash - centric MP3 player market with the iPod Mini , only to then effectively kill off hard drive - based iPods with Flash models like the Nano , Touch , and iPhone , once flash RAM became cost effective enough to do so .
It should therefore not be too surprising that , after having jumped into DVD burning and become the leading prosumer authoring software vendor with DVD Studio Pro as well as a leader in consumer disc burning with iDVD , Jobs has now made it pretty clear that Apple sees the future of media sharing as happening through the cloud , not etched into plastic discs .
At this year 's Macworld event , iDVD got no mention when marketing chief Phil Schiller took the wraps off iLife '09 .
Even the iLife banners at the event excluded any mention of the product ( below ) .
Since then , Apple has issued two press releases on iLife ' 09 , and in both cases iDVD was relegated to one - off mentions as software capable of " creating DVDs . "
Similarly , references to the software on the company 's iLife product page are anything but standout .
The iLife landing page prominently features iPhoto , iMovie , GarageBand , and iWeb while , information on iDVD is tucked away and accessible only via an inconspicuous link near the page 's header .
If those instances are n't enough evidence of Apple 's lack of excitement for the software , bloggers pointed out Wednesday that the company fails to even mention iDVD on the retail packaging for iLife '09 .
Retail copies of iLife 08 referenced the software on both the front and back of the software jacket .
Thinking outside the disc
Apple 's software - centric strategy draws attention to the new MobileMe Gallery and iWeb publishing features of iLife , which allow users to upload their video creations to the web for playback from desktop computers , mobile devices such as the iPhone and iPod touch , as well as Apple TV , the company 's video distribution hobby .
Apple 's conspicuous lack of promotion of iDVD also underscores the company 's intentional snubbing of Blu - Ray , which the industry hoped would replace the DVD with an even more complex to author interactive menus , far greater transcoding demands , greater DRM security , and virtually unlimited storage .

こ の1年で日本のオンラインゲーム市場はどう変化したか
4 Gamer読者にみる国内コンシューマゲーム機市場の変化
全機種合わせたゲームの購入本数であり，いわゆる“ 装着数 ” ではない点に注意してほしい
2008年12月〜2009年1月にかけて行われた，毎年恒例の。今回の応募総数は，2007年末の8600通を大幅に超える，でした。毎度のことながら，やたら多くのアンケート項目があったにもかかわらず応募してくださった読者の皆様，たくさんのプレゼントを提供してくれたメーカーの皆様，あらためてここに御礼申し上げます。ありがとうございました。さて，好評を博した昨年の「
4 Gamer読者アンケート結果発表 」記事から約一年。「今年はいったいいつ載るんですか」「なぜ載せないんですか」「仕事していますか？」という応援（？）の声を読者，そして業界人の皆様から多数頂いていたわけで，ちょっとした分析記事と共に，今回もその集計結果を公開してみよう。本記事で公開するのは，1万3855の応募のなかから，多重投稿などで無効と思われるサンプルを除外した，を集計したもの。アンケート全体の集計はもちろんのこと，タイトルごとに絞ったプレイヤーの属性分析を今回も行ってみた。集計の対象となったタイトルは，実に140本以上。いやぁ，実にめんど……調べがいがありました。ともあれ，1万を超えるサンプル数というと，のはず。そんなアンケートの集計結果からは，日本のオンラインゲーム業界，そしてゲーム業界のどんな姿がうかがえるのか。早速その内容をお伝えしよう。細かい分析に入る前に，まずは4Gamer読者全体のデータから紹介していきたい。4Gamer読者の平均年齢は27.4歳と，ほぼ昨年（27.5歳）と同じ数値。ただ全体の割合からいうと，11〜15歳の層が2.2％から3.8％に，16〜20歳の層が17.8％から19.1％へと微増しており，若干ではあるが，“ 若い”
層が増加している。2008年10月から4Gamerで取り扱いを始めたコンシューマゲーム機関連の記事の影響かもしれない。ちなみに女性読者層の割合は，6.4％から5.1％へと減少（※注）。これについては，編集部で数時間にのぼる討議に及んだ結果，女の子の画像を探しては，いつも せっせと掲載 している編集部のKawamuraの責任ということにしておいた。ともあれ，ゲーム媒体としては比較的高めの年齢層であることは昨年と変わらずだ。職業別で「会社員（技術系）」の割合が高いところなども，Webメディアらしい特徴の一つだといえるだろう。また職業別のデータなどを見てみても，平均年齢からうかがえるとおり，会社員（技術系）を中心に，やはり社会人が中心の読者層となっている。次いで，大学生や高校生といった項目が続くわけだが，全体的なデータとしては，昨年とほとんど変わらない結果となった。……まぁ，そんな急激に読者層が変化してしまっては，我々編集部も困ってしまうわけで，これはこれで至極妥当な集計結果だといえるだろう。いずれにせよ，4Gamer全体の読者像としては，このような傾向になる。ただ注意してほしいのは，今回公開するデータは，あくまでも「4Gamer読者を通した」結果であり，下記に掲載しているタイトルごとの平均年齢や男女比などといった数値が，そのタイトルの実際のデータとまったく同じであるという保証はない。これらを踏まえたうえで，さらに突っ込んだ部分を見てみよう。2008年もたくさんのタイトルがリリースされた国内オンラインゲーム市場だが，今回も，平均年齢とPCスペックを軸としたタイトルの分布図を作成してみた。さっと見ただけでも，昨年とポジションが変化しているタイトルと，あまり変化していないタイトル，この2パターンがあることがお分かりだろう。基本的には，以前から続くタイトルのほとんどには，高齢化（右へシフト）とローエンド化（下にシフト）の傾向がある。まぁただ，PCスペックという観点でいえば，昨年は必要動作環境がハイスペックだと言われていたゲームでも，今やミドルクラスになっているというのは，至極当たり前の話だ。また年齢にしても，プレイヤーの緩やかな高齢化というのは，なかなか避けにくいものではある。そんな中から，目立つタイトルをいくつかピックアップするとすれば，プレイヤーの平均年齢が下がっている「
ファンタジーアース ゼロ 」 や 「 メイプルストーリ ー
」は，注目すべきタイトルかもしれない。プレイヤーの平均年齢が下がっているということは，すなわち新規プレイヤーの獲得ができている可能性を示すからだ。ほとんどのタイトルで現状維持あるいは高齢化の傾向が見られるなかで，平均値を大きく下げていたタイトルは，ほかには「 テイルズウィーバー 」 や「 トキメキファンタジー ラテー ル 」などごく僅かである。またハイエンド志向のプレイヤーが多かった昨年から，ローエンド寄りのプレイヤー層に変化している「 サドンアタック 」 や「 WarRock 」も，興味深い一例だ。サドンアタックなどは，昨年末に公式全国大会を開催するなど，積極的な運営展開が目立っていたタイトルだが，そうしたプロモーションが功を奏し，いわゆるカジュアルゲーマー層の獲得に成功しているのかもしれない。ただそうした一方で，ハイエンド向けFPSの分野は，「
Alliance of Valiant Arms 」 や「 Team Fortress 2 」といったタイトルが台頭しており，プレイヤーの棲み分けが進んだ結果とも見て取れる。ちなみに今回の分析で個人的に興味深かったのは，2008年の新規タイトルを中心として，高年齢＆ローエンド路線の分野が賑わっているという点だろう。また低年齢＆ハイエンド路線の分野で，MMORPGがほとんど存在していない（この図では一つもない）ことも，非常に示唆的な現象だ。MMORPGという分野自体が，かなり“右側に寄っている”（高齢化している）ものだということが見て取れるだろう。確かにMMORPGというジャンルは，「 ファイナルファンタジーXI 」や「 ラグナロクオンライン 」 「 リネージ ュII 」以降，それらに匹敵するような大ヒットといえる作品は，ここ数年登場してきてはいない。より若い，新しいプレイヤー層にどうアプローチしていくのか。MMORPGというジャンルは，今やそこが大きな課題となっているのは間違いなさそうだ。記事掲載後に，「
カウンターストライク （以下 ，CS ）がなぜハイエンドなのか？」という質問がいくつかきたので，かんたんに説明をしておきたい。このデータは，「CSがハイエンド向けのゲーム」という意味ではない。あくまで「CSを遊んでいる人のPCのスペックは，全体的に高い傾向にある」という意味である。また逆に，ファンタジーアース
ゼロなどに関しても，これは同作がローエンドPC向けのタイトルという意味ではなく，あくまでもプレイヤーの“ 傾向”
を表している点に留意してほしい。例えばCSについて詳しく説明をすると，CSのプレイヤーは，ハイエンドFPSやいわゆるPCシングルゲームとの相関が非常に高く，それらのタイトルを遊ぶために，比較的頻繁にハイエンドマシンに買い換えて（もしくはパーツの換装を行って）いる層であるということ。
World of Warcraft 」（以下 ，WoW）などがハイエンド志向であり続けている反面，「 モンスターハンター フロンティア オンライ ン
」などがローエンド化しているのも，同様の理屈からだと考えられる。つまり，モンハンを遊んでいるプレイヤーは「モンハンが動けば十分」なのに対して，WoWのプレイヤーは，「他のハイエンドPCゲームも積極的に遊ぶ」層というわけだ。こちらは，平均年齢と「月にオンラインゲームに使う金額」の平均を軸にしたタイトルの分布図だ。消費金額は，そのタイトルに対して使っている金額ではなく，あくまでも“遊んでいるオンラインゲームすべて”に使う金額となっているのだが，それでも，だいたいの傾向などは見えてくる分析結果となった。この分布図でポイントといえるのは，低スペックマシンで遊んでいるプレイヤーが，必ずしもお金を持っていないわけではないというところだろう。「 トキメキファンタジー ラテール 」 や「 R.O.H.A.N 」などが最も特徴的な例になるが，低スペックであること，あるいは低年齢層プレイヤーが多いことは，必ずしもゲームに使う金額の少なさを示すものではない。低年齢層プレイヤーが多いながらも高い収益性を示す，「 アラド戦記 」やトキメキファンタジー
ラテールの秘訣はなんなのか。また他のタイトルとは何がどう違うのか。オンラインゲームの運営に携わっている人は，そのあたりに思いを馳せると，いろいろと見えてくるものがあるかもしれない。先ほど示したPCスペックでの分布図，そしてこのプレイヤー単価の図を見比べていけば，各タイトルのプレイヤー層の面影がなんとなくつかめてくるはず。業界人の方は当然だが，プレイヤーの皆さんも，この図をもとに自分の遊んでいるタイトルの傾向などを考えてみると面白いだろう。昨年の東京ゲームショウ2008を皮切りに，4Gamerでも取り扱いを始めたコンシューマゲーム。今回は，そんなコンシューマゲーム機市場の動向を，4Gamer読者を通して分析してみよう。上記のグラフは，2007年末〜2008年末にかけての，4Gamer読者のゲーム機の所持率の推移を表したものだ。据え置き機，携帯ゲーム機を問わず，それぞれが順調にシェアを伸ばしていることが分かるわけだが，Xbox
360の比率が妙に多いのは，いわゆる洋ゲーファンを多数抱える4Gamer読者ならではの傾向といったところ。注目したいのは，ニンテンドーDS（以下，NDS）の伸び率が鈍化している一方で，ライバルであるプレイステーション・ポータブル（以下，PSP）が大きくシェアを伸ばしている点だ。PSPといえば，昨年「
モンスターハンターポータブル 2nd G 」が発売され，今では累計300万本を超える大ヒットを記録したことでも記憶に新しい。昨今，急速にゲーマー向けのタイトルが充実してきていることもあり，非常に勢いづいているのはご存じのとおりだ。4Gamer読者は，当然ゲーマー層が中心となっているわけだが，今回の調査結果は，PSPがゲーマー層の間で急速にシェアを伸ばしつつある，一つの実例ではあるだろう。据え置き機に目を向けてみても，PSPと同じソニー・コンピュータエンタテインメント（以下，SCE）が発売しているPLAYSTATION
3が，大きくシェアを伸ばしていることが見て取れる。総じて，SCEプラットフォーム陣営の好調ぶりが伺える内容だといえるだろう。これは，ゲーム機の所有率と，実際にゲーム機を利用している率，そして利用者数を所有数で割った「稼働率」をそれぞれグラフにしたものだ。据え置き機では，Wiiの稼働率が低いこと，携帯ゲーム機では，PSPの稼働率が高いことなどが分かる。なかでもとくに目を引くのは，Wiiの稼働率の低さだろうか。所持している数こそ据え置き機ではトップのWiiが，実際に利用している数では最下位になってしまっている。まぁ昨年の11月から年末にかけては，他のハードウェアでゲーマー向けのタイトルが盛り沢山だったこともあり，そちらにプレイヤーが流れてしまったという側面もあるだろうが，任天堂陣営からすれば，長い目で見るとこの傾向はあまり喜ばしい事実ではないだろう。とはいえWiiには，2009年夏に発売が予定されている「
モンスターハンター3（トライ） 」という，ゲーマー向けのいわば切り札的タイトルもあり，これがどういう影響をもたらすのか，気になるところだ。また，各ハードウェアの所有者ごとに絞って，年間の平均ゲーム購入本数も併せて調べてみた。結果は以下のとおりだ。結果はなんとなく予想どおりといったところか。据え置き機を持ってる人ほど“ゲーマー度”が高く，カジュアルな層は携帯ゲーム機が中心になっている雰囲気。とくにXbox
360ユーザーのロイヤリティの高さは，注目に値するだろう。Xbox
360は，販売台数こそ国内では最下位だが，昨今は「 テイルズ オブ ヴェスペリア 」 や 「 スターオーシ ャ
ン4 - THE LAST HOPE - 」など，ゲーマーにとって魅力的な国産の大作RPGを引っ提げ，積極的な展開が目立っている。また海外市場では大きなシェアを獲得していることもあり，今後の展開も期待したいところ。「
Gears of War 2 」をはじめとした海外産の名作タイトルなども，どんどん日本市場に持ち込んでほしい限りだ。ともあれ，前回の分析記事に比べるとタイトル個々の話などがあまり出来ていない気もするが，すでにかなり長くなってしまったので，今回はここまで。タイトルごとのプレイヤー属性を比較した記事なども掲載したいと思っているが，思っているだけで終わってしまったらごめんなさい。また最後に，現在サービス中のオンラインゲームの中から，任意で選んだタイトルの基礎情報をひとまとめにした表を掲載しておく。昨年とはちょっとだけ変わって，オレンジの部分がMMORPG系，青がFPS系，そして緑色の部分がそれ以外のジャンルのタイトルという区分けだ。表では，平均年齢，男女比，平均消費金額，そしてPCメモリという，四つの項目を用意。ちなみにPCメモリというのは，ゲーム用PCのメインメモリ量の平均値を表したもので，ゲーム用に使っているPCのスペックの一定の目安になるデータ。平均消費金額というのは，月にオンラインゲームに使う金額を示したもの（そのタイトルに使う金額ではない）である。冒頭でも述べたとおり，これはあくまでも4Gamer読者というフィルタを通してみた結果であり，このデータがそのままタイトルの正しい属性データであるかどうかはまったく保証できないが，複数のタイトルで同時に比較検討することで，各々のタイトルの傾向や属性は，それなりに正しく把握できるハズ。上記で挙げた分布図と併せて，日本のゲーム市場およびオンラインゲーム市場の傾向を分析する参考にしてもらえれば幸いだ。
But after nearly an hour of analysis bomb experts realised that the cause of the scare was in fact a copy of the " Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch " used by Eric Idle to slaughter a killer rabbit in the 1975 film Monty Python And The Holy Grail .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama voiced outrage on Monday over large bonus payments awarded to top employees of insurer AIG and ordered his treasury secretary to legally block them if possible .
The insurance giant is being kept alive by taxpayer dollars , having received a government bailout of up to $ 180 billion , and is now paying $ 165 million in bonuses .
“ This is a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed , ” Obama said .
“ Under these circumstances , it ’s hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses , much less $ 165 million in extra pay , ” he said in remarks at the White House .
“ How do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat ? ”
Obama said he had asked Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to pursue “ every single legal avenue ” to cancel the bonuses .
“ I want everybody to be clear that Secretary Geithner ’s been on the case .
He ’s working to resolve this matter with the new CEO , Edward Liddy , who , by the way , everybody needs to understand , came on board after the contracts that led to these bonuses were agreed to last year , ” Obama said .
Liddy told Geithner in a letter the insurer was legally obliged to fulfill 2008 employee retention payments but had agreed to revamp its system for future bonuses .
Obama said overall financial regulatory reform was vital to ensure this did not occur again .
He said the government needed “ some form of resolution mechanism in dealing with troubled financial institutions , so that we ’ve got greater authority to protect American taxpayers and our financial system in cases such as this . ”
Pausing to cough , Obama said he was “ choked up with anger . ”
“ We do n’t have all the ... regulatory power that we need .
And this is something that I expect to work with Congress to deal with in the weeks and months to come . ” ( Editing by Alan Elsner )
In the animation below we show how risks can be ‘ spun ’ to look bigger or smaller , how medical treatments can be made to seem useless or to be wonder cures , and how lifestyle changes might look worthwhile or not worth bothering with .
All by changing the words used , the way the numbers are expressed , and the particular graphics chosen .
You may like to open a new window on the animation so you can refer to it easily as you read the article .
Check back for updates to the animation which will allow you to adapt it to your own data .
Many medical findings about the effect of a treatment are summarised in reports which compare just two numbers ; the risk without the treatment and the risk with the treatment - or even just one number , the percentage change in risk .
But there has been a lot of research into how people 's perception of the magnitude of a risk can be manipulated by changing the way in which that risk is communicated .
We have taken a selection of the options that are available , and by putting them together we reckon the animation contains 2845 different ways of expressing the effect on the risk of an event of an intervention : we have chosen as illustration the effect of consuming processed meat , and the effect of taking statins ( cholesterol lowering drugs ) on a moderate - risk middle - aged man .
Absolute risks / relative risks / numbers needed to treat
A good example to start with is ‘ bacon sandwiches ’ .
A major report estimated that there was a 20 % increased risk of bowel cancer if you ate 50g of processed meat every day – that ’s a large bacon sandwich .
We 've discussed the way this story was handled by the media , including the wonderful headline from the Sun : " Careless pork costs lives ! " .
This is a relative risk , and can sound quite frightening .
But for an average person , the chance of getting bowel cancer at some point in their life is around 5 % .
A 20 % relative increase on this translates to a lifetime risk of 6 % , or an increase of 1 % in absolute risk , which now does not sound so bad .
Yet another way to think of this is to consider how many people would need to eat large bacon sandwiches all their life in order to lead to one extra case of bowel cancer .
This final quantity is known as the number needed to treat ( NNT ) , although in this context it would perhaps better be called the number needed to eat .
To find the NNT , simply express the two risks ( with and without whatever you are interested in ) as decimals , take the smaller from the larger and invert : in this case we get 1/( 0.06 – 0.05 ) = 100 .
Now the risks do not seem at all remarkable .
Try these buttons on the animation to see how the text changes – it has been shown in experiments that these different ways of expressing risk differences can carry very different messages to people .
One of the most misleading , but rather common , tricks is to use relative risks when talking about the benefits of a treatment , for example to say that " Women taking tamoxifen had about 49 % fewer diagnoses of breast cancer " , while harms are given in absolute risks - " the annual rate of uterine cancer in the tamoxifen arm was 30 per 10,000 compared to 8 per 10,000 in the placebo arm " .
This will tend to exaggerate the benefits , minimise the harms , and in any case make it unable to compare them .
This is known as ' mismatched framing ' , and was found in a third of studies published in the British Medical Journal .
Chance / population / possible futures
We can also change what we mean by the number we put on a ‘ risk ’ .
First , we can talk about the chance of getting bowel cancer , with the idea that this is an event that is like the flip of a coin or a throw of dice , unpredictable but with some physical basis .
This creates an image of life as a gamble with the outcome determined by some invisible mechanism over which we have no control .
A very popular alternative , used by most people trying to communicate risk , is to think of the frequency of the event is expected to occur in a population of similar individuals , that is a group of ‘ people like you ’ , some of whom will get bowel cancer and others wo n't .
A disadvantage if this analogy is that it is easy for me to think that 100 people like me do n't exist , and even if they do then I am going to be one of the lucky ones .
To make it impossible to see the problem as belonging to other people , we 've included the option of possible futures about the ways things may turn out for you in the future : in what proportion of these alternative worlds will you get bowel cancer ?
This may be a bit shaky philosophically ( and it is perhaps best to avoid ideas of parallel universes ) , but it personalises the risk while keeping in a simple frequency language .
Percentage / frequencies
Probabilities can be expressed as fractions ( eg 1/2 ) , decimals ( 0.5 ) , percentages ( 50 % ) or frequencies ( 5 out of 10 ) .
In the animation we just have percentages or frequencies , but allow you to decide whether to have 5 out of 10 , 50 out of 100 , or 500 out of 1000 .
It may seem these choices are irrelevant since they all express the same proportion , but it has been shown in experiments that the size of the numerator and denominator change people ’s perception of the size of the risk .
For example , people have been offered a prize if they drew a red ball from a bag , and then given the choice of two bags : one containing 1 red ball and 9 white balls , the other having 8 red balls and 92 white balls .
The majority chose the bag with 8 red balls , presumably reflecting a view that it gave more opportunities to win , even though the underlying chance was lower .
Similarly people confronted with the statement “ Cancer kills 2,414 people out of 10,000 ” rated cancer as more risky than those told “ Cancer kills 24.14 people out of 100 ” .
The potential influence of the size of the numerator and denominator is known as the ' ratio bias ' .
Frequencies are generally used in risk communication , but it is important to keep a common denominator in all comparisons : for example to describe what is expected to happen to 1000 women who go for screening for breast cancer , no matter whether they benefit or are harmed by the test .
Positive / negative framing
What would you prefer , a game in which you had a 10 % chance of winning , or one with a 90 % chance of losing ?
You may shake your head and say that they are exactly the same , but it has been shown that it can make a big difference whether an outcome is expressed positively or negatively .
For example , in a classic experiment , one group of people were told
‘ Of 100 people having surgery for lung cancer , 10 will die during treatment , 32 will have died by one year and 66 will have died by five years .
Of 100 people having radiation therapy , none will die during treatment , 23 will die by one year and 78 will die by five years . ’
When framed in these negative terms , the risks of surgery appear large and 42 % preferred radiation therapy .
Others were told
' Of 100 people having surgery , 90 will survive treatment , 68 will be alive at one year and 34 will be alive at five years .
Of 100 people having radiation therapy , all will survive treatment , 77 will be alive at one year and 22 will be alive at five years . ’
When framed in these positive terms , surgery appears much more attractive and only 25 % preferred radiation therapy .
Framing inevitably influences perception , so it best to provide both a negative and positive description of the chance of an outcome .
Words / graphics / animations
So far we have only looked at the words that can be used , but each of these phrases can be accompanied by a picture .
Pie charts are popular , and as we see below can reflect both a negative ( getting cancer ) , and positive ( being free of cancer ) framing .
Column charts are again very popular , but as we see below the perception of the importance of a change in risk can ve manipulated by altering the scale of the column - the effect of eating bacon looks a lot larger in the second chart .
Using frequencies naturally leads to using icons to represent people or possible futures .
We have allowed blobs , tallies , smiley faces , and even photographs to further personalise the information .
There is the choice to have the possible outcomes grouped or scattered : grouping makes them easier to count and can make the risks look larger .
Colour can also influence perception , for example with attention pulled towards the outcomes coloured red .
Conclusions
Experts in the area of risk communication have reviewed all the research but have been able to draw few firm conclusions .
People are different in their demands , tastes and understanding – there is no one - size - fits - all solution , and so it seems reasonable to use techniques that can be adapted to individuals .
However it is clear that certain practices should be avoided as they can clearly bias perception , for example mismatched use of relative and absolute risks , changing denominators , emphasising a negative or a positive frame , and so on .
It 's also important to ask - what is it all for ?
Are we just trying to interest people with attractive attention - drawing displays , or are we trying to increase their knowledge , or even change their behaviour ?
These multiple aims are not necessarily all achieved using the same technique .
And of course it is vital to remember that information plays a limited role in anyone 's perception of the size and importance of a risk .
Bigger influences will be their emotional response to the situation , their feelings of control , their dread of the outcome , how much they trust those giving the information , how familiar they are with the problem , what their friends and family think , and so on .
But even if people are not going to take a very mathematical approach to the numbers , it still seems essential that they should have access to this information in a fair and balanced way .

It is nice to know that amid the turmoil of the past year , there is at least one constant : Warren Buffett does n't like private - equity firms .
Buffett already was nursing ill - feeling for private equity , famously once comparing private - equity investors to " porn shop operators . "
Getty ImagesAnd that was before private equity faced off against Mr. Buffett 's MidAmerican Energy Holdings ' proposed - and eventually rejected - $ 4.7 billion offer to buy Baltimore 's Constellation Energy .
In September , MidAmerican , a unit of Berkshire Hathaway , was bidding against Electricite de France , then working with two private - equity firms , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and TPG .
TPG eventually stepped out .
In December , a solo EdF agreed to buy half of Constellation 's nuclear business for $ 4.5 billion .
That brings us to Buffett 's closely watched annual report , out Saturday , which including a bit of a dressing down for the private - equity business .
First , he dismissed private - equity firms for their " Orwellian " name change to the more upscale " private equity firms " from mere leveraged buyout shops .
Then he attacked the LBO model : " A purchase of a business by these firms almost invariably results in dramatic reductions in the equity portion of the acquiree 's capital structure compared to that previously existing .
A number of these acquirees , purchased only two to three years ago , are now in mortal danger because of the debt piled on them by their private - equity buyers .
" We have a decided advantage , therefore , when we encounter sellers who truly care about the future of their businesses , " Buffett said .
" I work at a major financial services company , " writes Seth .

When it 's not , the visitor is redirected to an error page that explains the website 's requirements . "
Definitively determining whether someone has JavaScript turned on or not can be a pretty challenging task , but fortunately , Seth 's colleagues developed a bulletproof method to figure this out .
They used JavaScript .
function javascriptEnabled ( ) { return true ; }
Clearly , if that function is successfully called , then JavaScript must be enabled .
Like the isComputerOn ( ) method that was ( allegedly ) part of the BeOS API , if it does n't return true , then clearly , it 's off .
So , by applying this logic later on in the code , Seth 's colleagues came up with this :
function validateSettings ( ) { if(!javascriptEnabled ( ) ) { location.href=" no_js.htm " ; } ... }
Seth added , " To their credit ... err , I think ... they said that they did n't realize JavaScript could be disabled in their browser .
They tested it by having javascriptEnabled return false . "

Advertisement Experts have warned there is a " high probability " that a fault which caused a British Airways jet to crash - land at Heathrow could hit other Boeing 777s .
US air accident investigators called for a component to be redesigned after a Delta Air Lines plane reportedly encountered a similar problem .
Manufacturers Rolls - Royce say the new part should be ready within the year .
It comes after tests proved a build - up of ice in the engine was the most likely cause of the Heathrow crash .
How the fault occurs The Boeing 777 , with 152 people on board , crashed in January 2008 , causing one serious injury .
The captain and co-pilot were praised for averting a major disaster .
On Thursday , a second interim report from the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch ( AAIB ) said that , during the flight from Beijing , ice may have developed in the fuel pipes .
US investigators simulated the icing on a plane 's heat exchanger
Then shortly before landing , owing to factors such as turbulence or engine acceleration , a large amount of ice may have been dislodged and suddenly released into the fuel system , causing a fuel blockage .
Ten months later , it is understood a Delta Air Lines Boeing 777 was affected by a similar problem , known in the industry as an engine rollback or sudden power loss .
The plane experienced a single engine rollback while cruising over Montana while en route from Shanghai to Atlanta .
The National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) in the US said this was because there had been a build - up of ice , from water normally present in all jet fuel , on a component known as the fuel / oil heat exchanger ( FOHE ) .
This had restricted the flow of fuel to the engine .
It has now issued an " urgent safety recommendation " , calling for a redesign of the FOHE to eliminate the potential for ice build - up .
With two of these rollback events occurring within a year , we believe that there is a high probability of something happening again
US official Mark Rosenker
Tests support BA crash ice theory Mark Rosenker , acting chairman of the NTSB , said : " With two of these rollback events occurring within a year , we believe that there is a high probability of something happening again . "
Rolls - Royce has said a new version of the component was already being developed and it should be ready within 12 months .
A Rolls - Royce spokesperson said there had been no issues with its equipment , adding that ice build - up in commercial " long - cold - high " routes was an industry - wide issue .
New guidelines
There are currently 220 Boeing 777s , with Rolls - Royce Trent 800 engines , in operation .
The planes are used by 11 airlines and British Airways owns 15 .
A Boeing spokeswoman confirmed it had issued a set of guidelines for pilots to prevent long - term build - up of ice and these procedures had been approved by the regulatory bodies .
But the NTSB report said : " While the procedures may reduce the risk of a rollback in one or both engines due to ice blockage , they add complexity to flight crew operations , and the level of risk reduction is not well established . "
Pilots know how to flush the problem out
David Learmount
Aviation safety expert
An AAIB spokesman said it had not called for the planes to be grounded and neither had its US counterpart .
It joined the NTSB in recommending that Rolls - Royce should develop changes which prevent ice from causing restriction to the fuel flow .
" Operators have put in place procedures to prevent this causing another safety incident , " the spokesman added .
David Learmount , safety editor for Flight International magazine , told the BBC the AAIB and the NTSB were essentially saying the same things but had a different " style " in the way they phrased them .
Both the AAIB and the NTSB acknowledged things had to be changed in the long term , he said , and both believed the problem had been resolved in the short term .
However , the NTSB had added " drama " to its warnings which Mr Learmount considered " alarmist " .
Such incidents would not reoccur because it was now known how to deal with the issue , he said .
" It wo n't happen again because now they have systems on board and the pilots know how to flush the problem out when it does n't make any difference - when there 's no danger , " he added .
FUEL ICING PROBLEMS ON BOEING 777 FUEL ICING PROBLEM 117,340 litres of fuel carried in tanks in both wings and main fuselage
Water occurring naturally in the fuel can freeze during " long - cold - high " flights such as the two examples above
Fuel / oil heat exchanger through which fuel passes on its way to engines failed to melt ice leading to build - up and blockage RECOMMENDED REMEDIES
In flight where fuel temperature falls below - 10C pilots should make periodic climbs to a higher altitude at full throttle
If aircraft has remained at the same altitude for more than two hours prior to descending to land , and fuel temperature is below - 10C , the pilot must " advance the throttle to maximum for 10 seconds " to clear any ice in the fuel system Source : Boeing / National Transport Safety Board

I love Stephen King ’s original novel , “ It . ” I think it was the best moment of his career , where he still had his dark and basic instincts as a storyteller in - tact , but he was also beginning to really come into his own as a storyteller who could create full characters and weave their stories together seamlessly .
” It , ” in fact , reads like a “ how - to ” of parallel storytelling .
I am a big fan of the Tommy Wallace directed mini-series as well .
It had problems and was kiddie - fied for TV , but Tim Currie as the clown was genius , and the movie holds together fairly well .
Now it looks like we ’ll get another version of King ’s story , this time on the big screen , produced by Lin Pictures and Vertigo Entertainment .
If you do n’t know the story , it ’s about a group of kids who have to band together to fight a shape - shifting monster who most commonly takes the form of a clown .
When the monster returns years later , they must come together once more to finish the job .
Apparently the movie will be updated to present day …a shame .
I would have loved to see them do 1986 and 1958 .
That would just be cool .
I always said this should be a four - part mini-series on HBO where they can go really really dark , cinematic , and scary .
But I ’m fine with a movie .
It ’s going to be terribly hard to get this whole story into two hours , though .

REUTERS / Jessica Rinaldi
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A jury in Baltimore County , Maryland on Thursday found oil company Exxon Mobil liable for a gasoline spill three years ago and ruled it must pay residents $ 150 million in damages .
But the jury found the company was not liable for punitive damages the case in which 26,000 gallons of gasoline leaked from a tank at a service station in Jacksonville , Maryland .
In a statement issued after the verdict , Exxon said it regretted the leak and it apologized to the community , but said it believed the $ 150 million award was too high and it would weigh its legal options .
“ We find the amount awarded inconsistent with the verdict in which the jury rejected the punitive damages claims , ” the company said .
Plaintiffs in the case had asked for $ 2.5 billion in punitive damages , according to a report in the Baltimore Sun .
It may seem like an overstatement of the issue , but it is not .
Even if ESPN fails at singlehandedly taking down the internet , the mechanisms it seeks to set in place most certainly will .
Most troubling is that people will not even know it is a problem until it is too late to do anything about it .
To borrow a phrase , “ This is one doodle that ca n’t be undid home skillet . ”
ESPN has just launched the most insidious attack ever on your right to unrestricted internet access .
Sure , internet access has never been free and lots of websites require payment to access premium features .
ESPN however , has figured out that while asking 0.0001 % of us to pay extra to access its premium features is good , forcing 100 % of us to pay for these premium features , whether we like sports or not , is even better .
How will ESPN force you to pay for premium access you do not even want ?
The plan is to start charging your Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) for access .
The ISP then spreads this increased cost on to you .
So why is this bad ?
The problem is that this will turn the internet into a glorified cable company .
Instead of paying $ 40 / mo for access to the entire internet , you get an à la carte bill straight from your ISP .
Want access to ESPN ?
add another $ 10 / month .
Access to YouTube ?
add another $ 15 / month .
Google ?
Another $ 20 / month .
Cousin Billy ’s website showing pics of his drunken in - laws ?
Sorry , we no longer carry that , or any of the other tens of millions of websites that refuse to pay up .
This is a one way street to a very bad place .
Once content providers successfully conspire with your ISP to destroy Network Neutrality , you will never ever have unrestricted access to the Internet again .
Most importantly , the 80 % or more of websites and blogs out there lacking the resources to pay your ISP to carry their content will see traffic drop to nothing and eventually disappear .
This “ new ” internet will be nothing more that a handful of 800 lb gorillas vying for who can push the most commercials .
I mean where else are you going to go ?
You unfortunately put all those commercial - free great content laden blogs out of business .
Even the Justice Department has gotten into the game , siding with telephony and cable companies , like AT&T , Verizon and Comcast .
Thankfully President Obama has stated that signing a guarantee of Net Neutrality will be a priority during his first year in office .
Although I am sure he has not forgotten , it may be worthwhile reminding him , and your congressional representatives of the importance of guaranteeing Net Neutrality .
Most importantly , let your ISP know how you feel about backroom deals to cram extra fees down your throat and cut off your access to 80 % of the internet .
If your ISP tries to couch these deals as free or low cost access plans , know that they will cost you , and everyone else , much much more in the end .

If you do n’t , do n’t say I did n’t warn you .
I would just write an I - told - you - so post but unfortunately , there would not be any way left for you to get to it .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
It 's no secret that the job market is bad .
The government reported Friday that the unemployment rate rose to a 25 - year high of 8.1 % in February , as employers cut 651,000 jobs from payrolls .
Still , as bad as those numbers are , some have argued that this jobs downturn is not as bad as the early 1980s .
The unemployment rate peaked at 10.8 % in late 1982 .
But several experts say it would be a mistake to come to that conclusion .
They argue that unemployment rate only hints at why this jobs downturn is worse than any since the Great Depression .
Steep decline
Over the last six months , 3.3 million jobs have been lost .
That 's the largest six - month job loss since the end of World War II .
Even adjusting for the large growth in the nation 's job base in recent decades , this is still the biggest six - month job loss since March 1975 .
Economists say the steepness of this decline will make it tougher for the job market to improve any time soon .
The increasing job losses create a downward spiral in which businesses , faced with lower demand because people can't afford to buy their products , lay off even more people .
" The dramatic hemorrhaging of jobs means we 're in this for the long - haul , " said Heidi Shierholz , economist with Economic Policy Institute , a Washington think tank supported by foundations and labor unions .
Another reason why this downturn is more painful is because the layoffs have come from companies in virtually all parts of the economy .
" There 's no place to hide in terms of job losses , " said Lakshman Achuthan , managing director of Economic Cycle Research Institute .
" And when measuring the impact of job losses , it 's very important how pervasive the losses are .
That 's what makes this the worst since the Great Depression . "
Achuthan points to something called the diffusion index of employment change , which showed that three out of four business sectors cut jobs in February .
Job losses were even slightly more widespread in December and January , meaning that 83 % of industries have lost workers over the last three months .
According to Achuthan , this was the first time in the past 30 years that there have been job losses in more than two - thirds of the sectors of the economy .
When the recession started in December 2007 , about 58 % of industries were still adding jobs .
Long - term pain
February marked the 14th straight month of job losses , the third - longest streak since 1939 .
This long period of job losses is swelling unemployment rolls to record levels and causing long - term unemployment to rise sharply .
In February , 3.4 % of the nation 's workers had been out of work for 15 or more weeks , with nearly 2 % of that total being out of work at least six months .
Several states ' unemployment funds have run out money as a result .
And most economists think the job market woes are far from over .
Many economists are projecting job losses through the end of the year .
But even when the job losses end , the unemployment rate is likely to continue rising .
That 's because the modest hiring that will follow the downturn wo n't be enough to make up for population growth and unemployed Americans who had become discouraged starting to look for jobs again .
With that in mind , Dean Baker , co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , said he thinks the unemployment rate will hit a peak of above 10 % sometime in 2010 .
Underemployed , or discouraged
Finally , economists caution that the unemployment rate only captures a portion of Americans unable to find full - time jobs .
It does n't count people working at part - time jobs but cannot find a full - time job , for example .
And the average number of hours worked per week is now at a record low , according to Labor Department readings .
The unemployment rate also does n't count many people who tell the Labor Department they want to work but have n't looked for work recently .
The government has a so - called underemployment reading which counts people working part - time jobs for economic reasons rather than by choice , as well as some who have become discouraged from looking for work .
That measure hit 14.8 % in February - the highest reading since the Labor Department started calculating it back in 1994 .
But there are other discouraged job seekers who are not looking because they do n't think they can find work , have decided to return to school , or for other personal reasons .
Counting all of those people in the underemployment rate takes it to 16.7 % in February .
Comparable figures are n't available from the Labor Department for the pre-1994 period , but there are full - year government estimates for those outside the labor force who wanted to work in earlier years .
Using those figures , the underemployment rate reached a high of 21.5 % in November 1982 .
While that 's higher than this February , it 's probably not fair to compare the current reading to the worst result of that downturn since most believe this jobs crisis is far from over .
" No one is going to tell you we 're at the trough , " said Baker .
The Japanese rolled in part because their relievers were impressive in following Matsuzaka .
DeRosa had a two - run double off Takahiro Mahara to slice the deficit to two runs in the eighth .
DeRosa scampered to third when the ball was misplayed in left field .
But Mahara rebounded to strike out pinch - hitter Evan Longoria and retired second baseman Brian Roberts on a tapper back to the mound .
Japan , still working hard , rebounded with three runs in the ninth .
Shane Victorino , a switch - hitter , was poised to pinch - hit in the eighth , but Manager Davey Johnson recalled him and used the right - handed - hitting Longoria against the right - handed Mahara .
Johnson said he wanted Longoria in that spot because he is “ an R.B.I. man . ”
A two - run homer would have tied the game .
The strategy failed .
“ It ’s a decision he makes as a manager , ” Victorino said .
“ There ’s nothing that can be done .
He probably had a gut feeling on something he wanted to do . ”
That was not Johnson ’s only debatable decision .
Johnson selected Roy Oswalt to start ahead of Jake Peavy , and he stayed with Oswalt when he got into trouble in the fourth .
With the United States ahead , 2 - 1 , Oswalt fizzled quickly .
After Japan had two singles to begin the fourth , Kosuke Fukudome hit a ball between the first - and second - base hole .
Roberts , who had opened the game with a homer , glided to his left , but did not field the ball cleanly .
It bounced off his glove for an error , skipped into right field and enabled Japan to tie the score , 2 - 2 .
Kenji Johjima ’s sacrifice fly gave the Japanese a 3 - 2 lead , but Johnson did not have relievers warming up .
Oswalt was laboring , and this was an elimination game .
But Johnson did not manage as if it were the decisive game in a seven - game series , with the Americans a couple of hits away from being in a perilous position .
Japan produced those hits soon .
Akinori Iwamura doubled , Munenori Kawaski had a run-scoring single and Hiroyuki Nakajima drilled a run-scoring double that dumped the Americans into a 5 - 2 ditch .
Oswalt slumped on the mound .
That is when Johnson replaced Oswalt , a call that clearly appeared to be too late .
The grandparents of teen gunman Tim Kretschmer have made a tearful apology to the victims of the school shooting – but are still dumbfounded as to why their beloved grandson would kill 15 people in cold blood .
Ruth K. ( 82 ) and her husband Wilhelm ( 80 ) say they still cannot grasp the tragic events which hit Winnenden in Germany on Wednesday , when 17 - year - old Kretschmer went on a killing spree .
School shooting Germany massacre leaves 15 dead
How could such a sweet - looking boy go on to carry out such a brutal string of murders ?
1 / 2 vorheriges Element nächstes Element
With tears in their eyes , the couple – along with Tim ’s great uncle Hermann A. ( 76 ) - spoke to BILD about their grandson .
They said there was no prior warning as to what the teenager was going to do : “ He was such a lovely chap .
He still used to eat Sunday lunch with us .
There were roasts with spätzle [ south German dough balls ] and sauce .
He liked it so much . "
Ruth and William K. were sitting in the darkened living room where they had affectionately helped to bring Tim up .
Pictures of the teen gunman as a child were hanging on the walls .
Granny Ruth said : “ Up until kindergarten he was often here , he spent a lot of time with us .
His parents were at work a lot .
“ His favourite game was with a ball .
I stood at the bottom of the cellar stairs , Tim above , and he would throw the ball down to me . "
The events at Albertville School in Winnenden are still difficult for Ruth to fathom : “ He was a completely normal , quiet boy with us .
We can not grasp it yet . ”
Tim ’s last visit to his grandparents was with his parents on the Sunday before the tragedy .
Wilhelm said : “ Tim was quiet , but not quieter than usual .
He lay with the cat on the ground and cuddled it .
He always liked doing that . ”
The family ate together at the table , like so often .
First there was lunch , then coffee and cake .
Nobody noticed anything amiss with Tim .
“ Also , as he went , we did n’t notice anything remarkable , ” Ruth said .
“ ’ Bye Granny , ’ he said .
Exactly the same as always . "
Wilhelm added : “ We have already racked our brains about whether there was something .
But here was nothing . ”
When Tim talked with his grandparents , it was often about table tennis , and Ruth and Wilhelm described him as a good brother who would look out for his sister .
But did they know about his passion for weapons ?
“ No , he did not talk about that much .
He grew up with that .
His father had already taken him at 14 to the shooting club .
“ But the weapons at home were always properly locked away . ”
Only great uncle Hermann A. felt at one point that all was not well with Tim : “ It was in the middle of February .
He sat with us in the armchair , and hardly said anything , he was remarkably reserved .
I have still thought about whether I should have spoke to him .
But I did not do it . ”
The day of the school shooting started like any other .
“ His parents did not see him on the day .
They left the house early to go to work .
Tim slept longer as he did n’t have to be at school until later .
Also he probably did not see his sister before he left . ”
Did they believe he had planned the school shooting for a long time ?
Hermann said : “ I am sure me that he had already prepared it for several weeks in his head . ”
Tim went on to carry out one of the bloodiest killing sprees Germany has ever seen .
“ Why he did it is a mystery , and will always remain a mystery , ” Wilhelm K. said .
“ We will try to keep good memories of him , ” Ruth added , “ as we knew him . ”
Was there something they wanted to say to the families of the victims and the whole world ?
The grandparents cried silently .
Eventually , Hermann finds his voice - moving words of a desperate family : “ One would like to apologize above all , even it was Tim who did it .
It has left all his relatives in tears that such a thing happened , that so many young people had to die , that we cannot grasp it at all . "
Three teachers killed at Albertville School by Tim Kretschmer were heroically trying to save the kids from harm .

The Management
Here we are discussing some basic strategies that can give you advantage , however microscopic it may be .
Of course there is always exception to the rules , but exceptions occur much less frequently than the normal situations , do n’t they ?
These strategies are described from White ’s point of view , so what is good for White is bad for Black and vice versa .
Pawn structures
Pawns are strong when they are in a chain ; try to avoid splitting them into isolated groups .
Isolated or hanging pawns tend to be a liability , try to avoid at least till the end game .
Pawn chain shapes that look like /\ ( an inverted V ) from your side tend to be stronger than those that look like a \/.
Doubled pawns are weak , try to avoid getting them .
If you can maintain center pawns , you get more options to organize attacks .
Your own pawn chains may block free movement of your pieces , mainly the bishops if stuck behind the chain .
Avoid this disadvantage .
Pawns can not move backwards .
Sometimes the opponent will deliberately lure you to advance your pawns to create weaknesses in your pawn structure .
So think carefully before pushing them forward .
Pawns in front of your castled king are there to guard the king .
Try to avoid breaking up their line unless you have planned to launch a king - side attack with those .
Check the possibility of getting a passed pawn and then defending it .
A passed pawn becomes a thorn in the opponent ’s flesh and even when it fails to become a queen , it can gain you significant material advantage through opponent ’s efforts to neutralize it .
Passed pawns in rook ’s file are weaker than passed pawns in other files in the end game as it is easier for the opponent ’s king to block the pawn in rook file .
Knights
Knights play well in complex and locked positions .
Assess their value and plan their movement accordingly .
A knight posted on d6 and e6 squares can be a nuisance to your opponent .
Try to get them there ( with adequate support of course ) .
Knights play well in the center part of the boards .
Try to avoid keeping them at the sides ( a- and h - files ) unless your tactical plan calls for such positioning .
Knight fork can be a very potent weapon .
Creating such possibility can upset the plans of your opponent .
Knights have a relatively poor play in the end game when the board is fairly open but with a number of opponent ’s pawns ready to advance .
In the end game , a knight may be helpless in preventing your opponent ’s pawns if those are on two sides of the board .
Bishops
Bishops , if not developed early , may get bogged by your own pawns blocking the diagonals .
Be aware of this .
Bishops play well if there are many open diagonals and a bishop pair in such situations can give you a great advantage .
For above reasons , bishops are more helpful in the end game .
If your bishop can control the long diagonal towards your opponent ’s castled position , it can give you considerable leverage in your attack on the king .
If you have only a single bishop in the end game , half the squares on the board are inaccessible to it .
But with a few linked pawns of your own , a bishop can be a great help to support your pawn march and delay your opponent ’s pawn advance ( if you can position it in time ) .
In the end game , a bishop can be better than a knight if the pawns are at two sides of the board .
In general , bishop pair is more advantageous than the knight pair during the end game .
Rooks
Rooks , like bishops , plays better if there are some open files .
Try to take control of open files with your rooks .
Two rooks in same open file provide a lot of opportunities for attack .
Rook positioned in the 7th or 8th row becomes a headache for the opponent .
Two rooks on that row can often provide mating attack or gain of material .
Two rooks with lots of maneuvering space can often stand up to the opponent ’s queen , particularly when minor powers and pawns are absent in the end game .
You will find many games in chess archives where one player has given up the queen in exchange for two rooks .
In endings with where you have King , Rook and Pawn against King and Rook , your rook should be behind the pawn and your king should be next to the pawn to get a win .
Queen
Even though it is the strongest piece , it needs a rook or some minor pieces for its most effective use .
Avoid taking the queen too far out during the openings as it is likely to get ‘ harassed ’ by opponent ’s minor pieces to cause you a loss of tempo .
King
Always a liability , is it ?
It becomes more so , if it is at its original position .
Aim to castle at the earliest opportunity .
Both kings castled on the same side normally do not get an immediate early attack .
You have to maneuver through the Queen ’s side .
But castled on the opposite sides allow both players to launch direct attack through pawn advances .
Kings come into their own in the end game with major pieces removed from the board .
Try to keep king near your pawn group for their advance .
Be aware of the ‘ Square ” and ‘ opposition ’ .
In the endings with King and Pawn vs. King , make the king lead the pawn , not the other way .
Make yourself familiar with the standard strategies for handling different types of endings with pawns , minor pieces , rooks etc .
Learn to identify situations that may give win or only a draw .

Officials at Nato HQ have opened dialogue with Iran for the first time in years
An Iranian diplomat has held informal talks with Nato officials for the first time in 30 years .
Senior Nato negotiator Martin Erdmann said he had met Iran 's ambassador to the European Union , Ali-Asghar Khaji , more than two weeks ago .
" This is another good step in engaging Iran in the international community , " said Mr Erdmann .
A Nato spokesman , James Appathurai , said the talks with Mr Khaji had concentrated on Afghanistan .
Iranian diplomats have confirmed their attendance at a US - backed talks on Afghanistan taking place at The Hague next week .
' New step '
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon , as well as delegates from more than 80 countries , are due to attend the conference .
" The fact that Iran has decided to go , " said Mr Appathurai , " is good news and constitutes a new step . "
In Washington , a spokesman at the State Department , Gordon Duguid , also welcomed the Iranian decision to go to The Hague talks .
" The Iranians will be around the table , " said Mr Duguid .
" We will hear their points of view and they will hear our points of view about Afghanistan . "
Some news reports have suggested that Nato countries with forces in Afghanistan might have an interest in using Iran as a supply route .
Correspondents also point out that the opening of a dialogue between Nato and Iran comes as President Barack Obama has set new priorities for the United States in Afghanistan and weeks after he signalled a willingness to revitalise American relations with Tehran .

It was supposed to be a landmark day in American TV history .
On Tuesday , the nation ’s broadcasters were going to make a permanent switch from analog to digital TV signals , a move that would bring broadcasting into the 21st century .
Changing to digital would open the door for the networks to offer the public all sorts of cool features , like extra channels ( Magnum P.I. reruns ! ) and pay - per - view movies , not to mention a better picture — and all this without having to deal with the cable guy .
The switch offered other public benefits , too .
The airwaves that used to deliver fuzzy broadcasts of Oprah and Days of Our Lives would be freed up for more critical uses , like improving emergency communications during hurricanes or terrorist attacks .
This shift would even lead to improved cell phone service .
Instead , most of those perks are going to have to wait another few months , and tack an additional $ 740 million to the cost of the already pricey transition .
Why ?
Because Congress and President Obama fear the wrath of an infinitesimally small percentage of the population that might , for a few brief minutes , see their unprepared TV screens go dark .
Older TV sets need a special converter box to receive the new digital signals , and not everyone has one yet .
To hear Obama and members of Congress tell it , February 17 was going to be some sort of doomsday , like Y2 K , a black hole of a moment when millions of Americans were going to suffer the unbearable misery of missing American Idol because they failed to upgrade their TVs or get converters .
The nation ’s political leaders act like the brief blip that ’s likely to occur in the switch from analog to digital TV qualifies as a major national crisis on par with the stock market collapse .
Congress has devoted no fewer than 13 hearings to the digital transition since 2007 .
It ’s much ado about nothing .
Despite all the dire warnings about all of Puerto Rico going dark when analog signals disappear , most people have new enough TVs that they do n’t need converter boxes to receive digital signals .
Those who do require a box ( which retail for $ 50 to $ 70 ) can often afford to pay for them without a coupon .
In fact , for a few more dollars , they could buy a new TV that would n’t even need one .
And really , if there ’s one thing Americans do n’t need , it ’s a TV - watching subsidy .
Nearly 85 percent of the country already has abandoned free broadcast TV for cable .
( Cable viewers are not affected by the changeover from analog to digital . )
The average cable customer spends more than a thousand dollars a year for it , according to the FCC .
Not only will Americans pay for TV , they ’ll sacrifice for it .
More than half of all households whose income is below $ 25,000 a year have cable .
TV is not a critical necessity .
You wo n’t die if your screen goes blank for a couple of days the way you might if your heat goes off for that long .
There are other sources of news if the hurricane is coming , namely that old reliable , the radio , or , God forbid , print media .
Is the government really obligated to ensure no one misses Oprah , especially when making the switch to digital offers so many other public benefits ?
The so - called experts have predicted that as many as 6 million people would have gone without TV service on February 17 without some major government intervention , because they either did n’t know the change was coming or they did n’t make adequate preparations for it .
Among those predicted to be disproportionately affected are the elderly and low - income Latinos .
Various interest groups have criticized the government ’s efforts to assist those people and fret that they will lose access to important government emergency warnings .
My colleague Jim Ridgeway recently bashed government officials for suggesting that nursing home residents download converter - box coupon applications off the Web , without considering that they might not have Internet access .
But here ’s the thing :
These folks are nursing home residents !
Someone else is most certainly going to fix their TVs .
This is what sons - in - law are for .
And a National Association of Broadcasters ’ survey [ pdf ] from October 2008 found that 92 percent of Latinos surveyed knew about the coming switch to digital , even if they might not have prepared for it yet .
As for the large population of Latinos who live along the southwest border , while some might not be able to watch American TV without a converter , they will still be able to receive Mexican TV signals , so it ’s not like they ’ll be cut off from civilization .
Nonetheless , Congress wants to allow more time to get the word out about the coming transition and to give these folks more time to get converter boxes , which will , incidentally , be obsolete in the not so distant future .
The government - issued coupons for these boxes ran out earlier this year and there are now long waiting lists to get them , hence the additional funding in the stimulus bill .
But here ’s the rub :
The government already has issued more than a billion dollars worth of converter - box coupons , yet only about half were redeemed .
As it turned out , many people who thought they needed a box actually did n’t .
Rather than issue another coupon that may or may not get used , Congress should have saved the taxpayers some money and just let broadcasters throw the switch .
Americans will survive .
TV , after all , is a powerful motivator .
The second screens go dark , no doubt clueless TV owners will leap off the couch and find out what ’s going on .
It will probably take people about a nanosecond to find out what happened to Law and Order and remedy the problem , without any help from the feds .
That ’s pretty much what happened in the first test .
In September , Wilmington , North Carolina , volunteered to be the first market to make the full switch from analog to digital .
Both the FCC and student researchers from Elon University studied the changeover closely .
The Elon students , who surveyed people who called local TV stations on the day of the switch , found that the largest number of complaints did come from people over 60 .
But the elderly often had someone else calling on their behalf .
They were n’t as isolated as the FCC might think .
Even the elderly , it turns out , will find a way to get their TVs turned back on .
If they can ’t , the problem is not one of TV service but of larger social failings that wo n’t be fixed with a coupon , though there ’s a chance it could be remedied by pulling the plug on some TVs for a while .
Who knows ?
The digital switch might provide a unique opportunity for stitching together isolated communities .
( In fact , something along those lines happened in Wilmington as people consulted with their neighbors about antenna angles , signal strength , and other aspects of the switch . )
It ’s entirely possible that a dark TV could prompt a humanitarian intervention as people reach out for help to get their tubes turned on .
Indeed , the FCC reports [ pdf ] that the world did not come to an end in Wilmington the day analog died .
On the first day of the transition , the agency ’s DTV help line logged calls from fewer than 800 people .
Of those , only nine callers were n’t aware that the digital switch was coming .
Of those who knew about it but failed to take appropriate measures , the vast majority ( all of 24 callers ) simply forgot to get a better TV or buy a box in time .
The majority of calls were of a technical nature :
Most people just could n’t figure out how to work the converter box .
Given that many people over 40 can’t program a DVD player , this should n’t come as a big surprise , nor does it rise to the level of a national emergency .
Yet Congress has just allocated more money to pay IBM and other private contractors to field questions from people who did n’t know they needed to put a battery in the converter box remote .
If those contractors would also field questions on how to program the DVD player , this might be a good idea .
But for the most part , spending $ 2 billion in borrowed money to subsidize American couch potatoes seems absurdly wasteful at a time when people are having trouble keeping the lights on , much less the television .
MIT Professor : Power Your House With 5 Liters of Water Per Day
March 27th , 2009 by Derek Markham
At the Aspen Environment Forum today , MIT professor Dan Nocera gave a revolutionary picture of the new energy economy with an assertion that our homes will be our power plants and our fuel stations , powered by sunlight and water .
And it ’s not science fiction .
Nocera stated that even if we put all available acreage into fuel crops , all available acreage in wind power , and build a new nuclear power plant every 1.5 days , and we save 100 % of our current energy use ( yes , you read that correctly ) , we will still come up short by 2050 .
His estimate is that we will need 16 TW of energy production by then , and with our current methods , we wo n’t get there .
But there is a solution .
And we do n’t need to invent anything new to get from here to there .
Nocera said that MIT will announce its patent next week of a cheap , efficient , manufacturable electrolyzer made from cobalt and potassium phosphate .
This technology , powered by a 6 meter by 5 meter photovoltaic array on the roof , is capable of powering an entire house ’s power needs plus a fuel cell good for 500 km of travel , with just 5 liters of water .
The new electrolyzer works at room temperature ( “ It would work in this water glass right here ” ) to efficiently produce hydrogen and oxygen gases from water in a simple manner , which will enable a return to using sunlight for our primary energy source .
This technology will decentralize power production and provide true energy independence .
The details of implementation still need to be worked out , but Nocera says that fears of hydrogen technology ( safety ) are unfounded , as companies that work with these gases have the capability to safely store and use them .
“ It ’s safer than natural gas .
You burn that in your house with an open flame .
Now that ’s dangerous . ”

( CNN ) -- Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed said Saturday he will give in to a rebel demand that he impose Islamic law , or sharia , in an effort to halt fighting between Somali forces and Islamic insurgents .
President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed says sharia law in Somalia will not be strict .
However , Ahmed told a news conference he wo n't agree to a strict interpretation of the law , which forbids girls from attending school , requires veils for women and beards for men , and bans music and television .
The president , speaking at his palace in the capital , Mogadishu , said local elders and religious leaders , acting as liaisons with the militants , brought him a message saying the rebels wanted a truce in the two - year - old fighting .
He also asked African peacekeepers to stand down .
Ahmed , who was elected January 31 , said he would ask the AU contingent to leave once there is a solid political solution to the conflict .
More than 40,000 Somalis have returned to abandoned neighborhoods in Mogadishu over the past six weeks , despite some of the heaviest fighting in months , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Friday .
They are part of the more than a million residents who have been displaced by fighting in Somalia , including 100,000 who fled to neighboring countries last year alone , according to the United Nations .
Ethiopian troops entered the country at its request in December 2006 .
The Ethiopians ousted the Islamic Courts Union , an Islamic movement that had claimed control of Mogadishu earlier that year .
Ethiopia 's action had the blessing of the United States , which accused the Islamic Courts Union of harboring fugitives from al Qaeda .
But various Islamist groups -- including al - Shabab , which the United States has designated a terror organization -- rejected the presence of Ethiopian forces and mounted an insurgent campaign against the Ethiopians and the transitional government .

( CNN ) -- Susan Lanier has always enjoyed getting out of her urban home in Chicago , Illinois .
Camping is a cheap travel alternative to staying in a hotel .
But her travel plan for this spring -- which includes riding on a Greyhound bus and camping in a national park -- is a new , more frugal version of how the 22 - year - old would normally spend a vacation .
" I'm in school and usually I 'll do some sort of trip , but usually I 'll go to a beach or something or I 'll fly to New York , " she said by phone while hitching a ride on a band 's tour bus , headed toward the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee .
" But [ finances have ] just been tight , and this is a cheap way to get out of the city and do something fun . "
With the economy in a slump , camping seems to be grabbing a new foothold in the travel industry .
Once considered by many to be an activity for nerdy families , nature geeks and Boy Scouts , sleeping outside in a tent has become chic -- likely because it is so much cheaper than paying for a hotel room .
The activity also strikes a new chord with Americans who want to get back to basics after an era of excess and overspending .
Outdoor camping 's popularity jumped 7.4 percent between 2007 and 2008 , according to a report from the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association .
Overnight backpacking is up 18.5 percent , the report said .
" That 's a significant change , " said Mike May , the association 's spokesman .
" One thing about camping is once you buy a tent , you do n't need to buy another one for a long time .
It can be an inexpensive way to spend some recreational time . "
The group estimated there are 33.7 million campers in the country .
May said he expects that number to continue to increase this year .
REI , the outdoor equipment company , said tent and sleeping bag sales are up this season , particularly when it comes to larger tents designed for three - and four - person families .
So far this spring , family tent sales are up 14 percent over last year , said Rick Meade , REI 's product manager for sleeping bags and tents .
For March , sales are up 28 percent over the same month in 2008 .
" We have a great sense that there is a resurgent interest in [ camping ] , especially on the family camping side , " Meade said .
State parks are among the cheapest places to sleep under the stars .
Many of the parks , which either are free or charge entry fees of about $ 10 per day , are seeing increased interest from tourists and campers , according to Phil McKnelly , executive director of the National Association of State Park Directors .
" Whether you 're talking about wanting to go to the ocean or the mountains , those are kinds of activities that can be done in a state park at a relatively low cost , " he said .
" For the cost of one of two nights in a hotel , you can spend a week in a state park . "
Still , the financial crisis is affecting states ' abilities to manage their park systems .
Most states have seen their parks budgets slashed by 10 to 15 percent , McKnelly said .
That means fewer park employees , which translates into dirtier restrooms and trails blocked by fallen trees , he said .
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department began offering classes for first - time campers last year .
Interest in the program , which teaches basic skills like how to pitch a tent and dispose of trash in an eco-friendly way , has been high , said Tom Harvey , spokesman for the department .
So far the state has offered the program to more than 1,200 people , according to the department .
iReport.com : How are you having fun for free ?
" We 'll hold them by the hand and we 'll show 'em how to pitch a tent , " he said .
" It 's been very popular . "
Harvey said the camping movement is geared at more than recreation .
People who live in cities often do n't understand natural systems , which he said can lead to detached and unhappy lives .
" We are now , most of us , creatures of the urban jungle and we 're losing our connection with the natural world , with reality , " he said , adding that camping helps fix that .
In California , many state parks are booked well into the spring , said Sheryl Watson , spokeswoman for California State Parks .
On the first day reservations became available , 20,407 people reserved a July trip to a California state park , she said .
That 's up nearly 13 percent over last year 's reservation numbers .
By comparison , reservations were up 4 percent from 2007 to 2008 .
Watson said parks near the state 's urban centers are especially popular , because camping can be an inexpensive way for someone to visit a city like San Francisco , where hotels can cost 10 or 20 times the price of a camping spot .
That idea also applies to international level , where hotel costs can add up over a long stay .
The economy has given people like Lanier , the student in Chicago , an excuse to spend more time outdoors .
The last time she went camping was six years ago , in high school .
Lanier said she bikes around Chicago often , but the city 's best outdoor offering is Lake Michigan , and that still feels pretty urban , she said .
Lanier is studying fiction writing in a masters ' program , and said she plans to record her campfire conversations with her traveling buddy , who plays in a band called I Need Sleep and will also offer some free musical entertainment .
She hitched a ride on the band 's tour bus to Tennessee .
The only part of the trip she dreads is the $ 50 , 18 - hour return trip by Greyhound bus .
While she felt pressured into the trip by the economy , she said that may be a good thing in the end .
" It just seems like an adventure -- something different , " she said .

back Newton and IP I 'm reading a great book , Einstein 's Mistakes google version ) , by Hans Ohanian .
Extremely intelligent physicist and fun writer -- very opinionated and spins great narratives of Galileo and Newton as a prelude to discussing Einstein .
The book is about all the mistakes Einstein made in his discoveries and papers , how he made his great insights sometimes despite the mistakes , and even sometimes because of them .
Ohanian acknowledges Isaac Newton as " the greatest physicist of all times " and " the greatest genius the world has ever known " , albeit a " mad scientist " and " the most awesome and the most aful physicist of all times . "
I was struck by this fascinating account of Newton 's views on credit for scientific discoveries ( pp. 62-63 ) : Newton held the odd notion that whenever he discovered some new result in physics or mathematics , it became his personal property , which he was entitled to keep as a secret for as long as he chose , without any need to publish it to establish his priority .
If another scientists later made the same discovery independently and published it first , Newton regarded this as trespass and as theft , and he would indignantly refuse to allow such a scientist any share of the credit .
...
In Newton 's days , the criterion for credit for a discovery was not yet rigidly established .
Claims for unpublished discoveries were sometimes accepted , especially if the scientist had the vociferous support of influential friends and patrons -- sometimes the early bird got the worm , and sometimes the squeaky wheel got the grease .
Newton 's secretiveness about his discoveries led him into many silly but savage disputes with other scientists about what they knew and when they knew it .
Driven by his intense paranoia about his scientific accomplishments , he accused Robert Hooke , Gottfried Leibniz , and other scientists and mathematicians of stealing ideas from him .
In his treatment of these scientists he was vicious and vindictive .
Hooke was a talented scientist , best known for his investigations with microscopes , but he was a dwarfish man , with a stooped back .
When Hooke asked for an acknowledgment that he had anticipated some of Newton 's investigations of the colors in sunlight , Newton wrote a sarcastic refusal , in which he made an oblique reference to Hooke 's diminutive size : " If I have seen farther , it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants . "
The German mathematician and philosopher Leibniz discovered the calculus independently , and , in contrast to Newton , he published his discoveries -- by the modern criterion , Leibniz would have had full credit for the calculus and Newton none .
But when Leibniz asked a committee of the Royal Society to prepare an impartial report judging his share in the invention of the calculus , Newton not only packed the committee with his cronies , but he also wrote the report himself , and then wrote a favorable anonymous review of the report .
In his private journal he gleefully recorded that he had bested Leibniz and " broke his heart . "
As can be seen from these remarks , Ohanian is delightfully opinionated .
For other examples , see his snarky coments on Aristotle ( pp. 39 - 40 ) , where he says that Aristotle was popular because middle ages scholars confused quantity with quality -- he ridicules Aristotle 's misconceptions about the animal kingdom , and his assertions about the speed of falling bodies being proportional to their weight , without ever simply dropping two different weight objects from his hands to test out this theory .
On p. xii , he acerbically criticizes botched translations of Einstein 's German writings ; on p. xi , he refers to the mistakes " misguided souls imagine they perceive in [ Einstein's ] theories of special and general relativity " ; on p. 9 and elsewhere he skewers Creationists as adherents of " delusional pseudoscientific theories " ; and on p. 59 he refers offhandedly to " the usual eccentricities of Englishmen . "
And I love this comment about Galileo : according to Ohanian , " Galileo had a talent for making enemies -- as Koestler said , he provoked ' the cold , unrelenting hostility which genius plus arrogance minus humility creates among mediocrities .

WASHINGTON , Feb. 21 ( UPI ) -- Former U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge says the United States was wrong not to give terror suspects due process protections .
Speaking on the BBC's ' World Today " program , the former Pennsylvania governor and first federal homeland security chief said he accepts some of the criticisms levied in a recent report International Commission of Jurists .

The group 's report found that the U.S. treatment of detainees undermined international law .
" When you are taking upon ( yourself ) the responsibility to prevent acts I think you do need to engage in slightly different tactics in order to ensure that it happens , " Ridge told the British network .
He said the commission was on " solid ground " in its commentary " with regard to torture and sustained detention without due process . "
He added that regardless of what terror suspects are accused of doing , they deserve " some sense of due process . "
" It has taken a while for us to get to that point but we are certainly there now , " he said .
( CNN ) -- Fourteen city workers and one retired city worker in the western Ohio town of Piqua claimed a $ 207 million 12 - state lottery prize Wednesday .
After five years of buying Mega Millions Lottery tickets , a group of 15 people in Ohio finally hit the jackpot .
The workers posed for pictures behind an oversized replica of the check , smiled for photographers and described their plans , which range from buying a new truck to quitting a job and traveling .
As they had done twice a week for the past five years , the group pooled their money to buy Mega Millions Lottery tickets .
Last Friday , a ticket bought at a Kroger supermarket in Piqua changed their lives .
See what the winners have to say »
" I 'm going to set my mom and dad up for life , " said Loyal Davis , who bought the lottery ticket and then got the job of telling his co-workers they had won .
One of them was his father - in - law , Tom Hill .
" He goes , ' You wo n't believe it , ' " Davis recalled .
" ' Somebody hit the lottery at Kroger 's in Piqua . ' "
" You 're kidding , " Davis said he responded .
Then Hill asked what he would do if he won .
Davis took out the ticket .
" Here you go , Tom , you 're a millionaire , " he recalled saying .
Hill erupted with excitement .
His wife , Brenda , began crying .
Davis said he plans to continue working for the street department , where he has been employed for more than eight years .
" I love my job , " he said .
Asked if he is worried that his sudden change in financial status could have a negative effect , he said , " I hope not . "
" I 'm always happy and positive , and I do n't want no negativity , " he said .
" I hope nothing negative comes out of this .
I think I got a good head on my shoulders to hopefully not let that happen . "
But he does plan to make a few changes .
" The first thing I 'm going to buy I 've never had : a brand - new vehicle , " Davis said .
Amos Steinbrunner , 30 , who 's the youngest of the winners , said he had not yet figured out what to do with his winnings beyond helping his father retire .
" Right now , I 'm in shock and surprised , and I do n't know what it really means to me right now , " said Steinbrunner , who has been working at the job just two months and plans to marry in April .
" I 'm going to take it day by day and see how everything goes . "
But the potential effect of the event was not lost on him .
" It can change all my family 's lives , and it means a lot , " he said .
Cindy Hershberger said she plans to give some of her money to her mother , who is retired .
" It was wonderful to call and say , ' Mom , I 'm buying you a house , ' " she said .
" It 's a great feeling to know that you can help people . "
Now , at age 45 , Cindy is planning to retire , too .
The decision was not a difficult one , she said .
" I like my job , I really do .
I love my job , but there are other things . "
She said she will spend time with her children and mother , and will be doing volunteer work , traveling with her boyfriend " and just relaxing . "
The winnings will not be divided evenly -- one of the winners paid for two tickets .
All About Lottery Results
Back in late 2007 i started seeing news about some revolution that was coming to sound in Linux .
I remembered reading about it being the :
next generation sound server for Linux , making all sorts of “ ear - candy ” possible : from dynamically changing the volume of individual applications to hot - plugging support for many different devices .
source : http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2007/10/pulseaudio-to-bring-earcandy-to-linux.ars
one of the PulseAudio Dev in describe it said
One of the things !
PulseAudio is supposed to be is a “ Compiz for sound ” .
source : http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Interviews/LennartPoettering
Such was the hype around PulseAudio that many Linux users were expecting it to be the next best thing since compiz fusion .
well fast forward to 2009 and Pulse Audio is one of the most hated , curse at application on the linux Desktop .
Although to be fair most of the issues people have with PulseAudio have much to do with the way Verious distributions packaged it than the progam itself .
Ok enough ranting back to the reason for this blog post
One feature i found interesting about PulseAudio was the ability to independently control the volume of individual applications on the fly , and its one feature that i have found missing in various implementation of PulseAudio i have used from Ubuntu 8.04 , Ubuntu 8.10 to Fedora 10 ..
HOLD IT THERE !
i did n’t say it was n’t possible .
just could n’t be done on the fly with a few clicks .
Well gnome - pulse - applet makes you do just that .
gnome - pulse - applet is a very useful gnome applet that makes it easy to control the individual Volume of applications using PusleAudio in gnome .
To install , download the latest Installation package for your distribution here http://code.google.com/p/gnome-pulse-applet/downloads/list
( as at the time of this writing only deb and rpm packages for ubuntu 8.10 and fedora 10 respectively were avalaible for download )
Once installed all you have to do is right click on an empty space in your gnome panel and add PulseAudio Volume Control .
you can even change the appearance from vertical to horizontal by right clicking on the applet and going to preference .
screenshots
Gnome - Pulse - Applet is a cool program that brings one of the much talked about feature of PulseAudio to the masses .
Although the project is still at an early stage , i tested it on my ubuntu 8.10 and it worked fine without any problem .
I was able to control , mute and increase the individual Volumes of VLC , Firefox ( streaming with Toteem ) and Rhythmbox .
Anyway i saw a post about this applet on identica and i thought i should share .
Hope someone find this usefull
2009 NFL Mock Draft Version 1.0
It would probably be good for me to do an intro to this piece , but I ’m going to skip all the foreplay and just get right to the action .
And let ’s be honest – you probably would n’t have read the intro anyway .
Below is my first mock draft of the year .
You can disagree all you want , but just make sure you go into detail in the comments section so I know you care .
I hate those bastards that trash my work and do n’t have the common courtesy to tell me how much of a moron I am in print …
Let ’s mock !
1. Detroit Lions : Matthew Stafford , QB , Georgia
Jason Smith ( Baylor ) , Eugene Monroe ( Virginia ) and Aaron Curry ( Wake Forest ) are all possibilities for new GM Martin Mayhew with this pick .
But the offensive tackle and linebacker positions are deep in this year ’s draft – the quarterback position is not .
Mayhew can get his franchise quarterback in Stafford , select an offensive tackle at No. 20 and then fill the middle linebacker need in the second or third round .
There , I just fixed the 0 - 16 Detroit Lions in less than 100 words .
2. St. Louis Rams : Jason Smith , OT , Baylor
If Smith goes No. 1 to the Lions , then I fully expect the Rams to take Virginia offensive tackle Eugene Monroe .
With the jettison of long - time veteran Orlando Pace this offseason , St. Louis needs to address their need at left tackle and they ’ll do so with either Smith or Monroe depending on who ’s available .
If it ’s Smith , then they land one of the most athletic offensive lineman in the draft .
3. Kansas City Chiefs : Aaron Curry , LB , Wake Forest
The Chiefs could really use a right tackle to pair with last year ’s first round pick , Branden Albert , but Curry would be too good to pass up here .
GM Scott Pioli put a premium on versatile defenders while he was in New England , and that ’s exactly what Curry is .
The Wake Forest product could play either outside or inside in a 4 - 3 or 3 - 4 scheme and is easily the best defensive prospect in this year ’s draft .
4. Seattle Seahawks : Eugene Monroe , OT , Virginia
The Seahawks would love to see Curry fall to No. 4 , but it ’s doubtful that he would slip past the Chiefs at No. 3 unless KC values Monroe more .
Walter Jones is still extremely effective for his age , but the Hawks need to start grooming someone to take his place .
Monroe does n’t have a high ceiling , but he ’s solid nonetheless and a very safe pick .
5. San Francisco 49ers ( via trade with Cleveland ) : Mark Sanchez , QB , USC
My first curve ball of the day ; fearing rumors that the Jaguars could take Sanchez at No. 8 , the Niners swap picks with the Browns and give up their second round pick ( which Cleveland could desperately use ) in the process .
Do I think Sanchez is worthy of a top 5 pick ?
No , but he ’s a hometown product and clearly San Fran is n’t sold on Alex Smith ever developing .
6. Cincinnati Bengals : Michael Oher , OT , Ole Miss
Offensive tackle is one of the Bengals ’ biggest needs and while there ’s a great chance they could go with Alabama ’s Andre Smith instead , Oher remains a safer choice .
Smith has been a complete disaster since being suspended for the Sugar Bowl , which is exactly why some project him to go to the dysfunctional Bengals .
But for the moment , let ’s give Paul Mike Brown the benefit of the doubt ( I think just threw up a little ) and believe he ’ll choose Oher , who has less natural talent than Smith , but who is definitely blessed with more motivation and determination .
7. Oakland Raiders : Michael Crabtree , WR , Texas Tech
As always , the Raiders need to address their offensive line and they could stand to add a defensive end , too .
But Al Davis likes flash in the first round and nothing says flash like drafting a receiver .
There are some concerns about Crabtree ’s foot , but he remains one of the best prospects in this year ’s draft and would make a nice toy for JaMarcus Russell .
( Assuming Russell can get the ball to Crabtree without throwing it over his head . )
8. Jacksonville Jaguars : Jeremy Maclin , WR , Missouri
The Jags could stand to upgrade their defensive tackle and cornerback positions , but unfortunately there are n’t any worth taking at No.
8 . So they try to address the black hole that is their wideout position with Maclin , and pray he does n’t become the next in a long line of receiver busts .
9. Green Bay Packers : Brian Orakpo , OLB , Texas
If the Browns stay pat and do n’t / ca n’t trade out from No. 5 , there ’s a chance Orakpo could wind up in Cleveland .
But with Orakpo still on the board here , the Packers select the Texas product in hopes that he can provide a decent pass rush as an outside linebacker in their new 3 - 4 scheme opposite Aaron Kampman .
What the Pack could really use is a 3 - 4 defensive end , but they wo n’t find one worthy of the No. 9 overall pick .
Florida State outside linebacker / defensive end Everette Brown is also a possibility here .
10 . Cleveland Browns : Everette Brown , OLB , Florida State
After signing Eric Barton to play inside next to D’Qwell Jackson in Eric Mangini ’s 3 - 4 defense , the Browns could use an outside linebacker opposite Kamerion Wimbley to help rush the passer .
Brown and Texas ’ DE / OLB Brian Orakpo would be reaches at No. 5 ( where the Browns are currently slated to pick ) , but at No. 10 , Cleveland gets a better value for their selection and would also scoop up another draft pick .
( This of course is assuming the aforementioned trade with the 49ers . )
Cornerbacks Vonte Davis ( Illinois ) and Malcolm Jenkins ( Ohio State ) would also be considerations for the Browns , although they would also be reaches at No. 5 .
11 . Buffalo Bills : Aaron Maybin , DE , Penn State
The Bills desperately need a guard , but there are n’t any available worthy of the No. 11 pick .
Instead , Buffalo addresses their pass rush need with Maybin , who has better athleticism and quickness to get after the quarterback than LSU ’s Tyson Jackson , who would also be available at this spot .
12 . Denver Broncos : B.J. Raji , DT , Boston College
This seems like a slam dunk pick , although if the Packers do n’t feel that Ryan Pickett makes an adequate nose tackle in their new 3 - 4 , Raji could be off the board when Denver selects .
Raji is the best defensive tackle prospect in the draft and could be the new centerpiece of the Broncos new 3 - 4 front .
13 . Washington Redskins : Tyson Jackson , DE , LSU
The Skins might address their need at offensive tackle if Alabama ’s Andre Smith and Ole Miss ’s Michael Oher are still on the board .
But taking a defensive end makes more sense at this point , especially after the team released Jason Taylor .
Jackson does n’t have the quickness to rush the passer like fellow defensive end prospect Aaron Maybin ( who I have going to the Bills at No. 11 ) , but he usually gets a good push up front and rarely gets knocked backwards .
14 . New Orleans Saints : Brian Cushing , OLB , USC
Once again the Saints will be looking to address their defensive needs on draft day .
After signing safety Darren Sharper in free agency , outside linebacker becomes New Orleans ’ biggest need and Cushing certainly helps fill that void .
One of four Trojan linebackers that could be taken on day one , Cushing is a flat out workhorse and a football player in every sense of the word .
15 . Houston Texans : Chris “ Beanie ” Wells , RB , Ohio State
The Texans could use a hard - hitting strong safety , but prospects like Western Michigan ’s Louis Delmas and Missouri ’s William Moore would be reaches at No. 15 .
Houston could also upgrade the outside linebacker spot , but with Brian Cushing coming off the board a pick earlier , Beanie Wells looks awfully intriguing .
Steve Slaton proved that he can get it done at the next level , but he needs a complement and Wells , who can run between the tackles and outside , could help in that department .
16 . San Diego Chargers : Rey Maualuga , ILB , USC
The Chargers do n’t have a ton of holes to fill and while an offensive tackle would be nice , only Alabama ’s Andre Smith is worthy of a selection at this spot and he does n’t really seem like an AJ Smith kind of player .
So the Chargers take the best player available in Maualuga to address their need for depth at linebacker .
17 . New York Jets : Vonte Davis , CB , Illinois
With the hiring of new head coach Rex Ryan , the Jets have mainly focused on defense this offseason .
While the need at quarterback is urgent , the Jets could also use a cornerback to play outside Darrelle Revis and Davis proved at the combine that he has more physical skills than Ohio State ’s Malcolm Jenkins .
Davis has been accused of freelancing too much , but perhaps Ryan can turn that into a positive with his schemes .
18 . Chicago Bears : Percy Harvin , WR , Florida
I ’m not thrilled about this selection for the Bears , but they seem intent on starting Frank Omiyale , who they picked up in free agency , at right tackle .
So with that need filled ( and I use that term loosely ) , wide receiver becomes Chicago ’s biggest need and either Harvin or Maryland ’s Darrius Heyward - Bey should be available .
If the Bears sign veteran Torry Holt , then GM Jerry Angelo ( who always screws the pooch in the first round ) might lean towards drafting a defensive end such as Tyson Jackson , Aaron Maybin or Larry English .
19 . Tampa Bay Buccaneers : Josh Freeman , QB , Kansas State
The Bucs could look at a defensive end at this spot , but if Freeman falls , he might be too good to pass up .
The K - State product has the best physical tools of any quarterback in the draft , but he may be the biggest long - term project , too .
He has raw skills that ’ll need time to develop , which is why Tampa could go with Luke McCown until Freeman is ready .
20 . Detroit Lions : Andre Smith , OT , Alabama
Smith arguably has the most talent of any offensive tackle in the draft , but there ’s no telling where his head is at after disappearing at the scouting combine and turning in a lackluster pro day .
Still , if he falls to the Lions here ( which might not be a possibility given how many teams ahead of them also need an offensive tackle ) , he might be too good to pass up .
For the record , I would n’t touch this kid with a 10 - foot pole if I were a GM .
But I ’m not a GM and Smith will probably turn out to be a Pro Bowler in spite of my comments .
21 . Philadelphia Eagles : Knowshon Moreno , RB , Georgia
The Eagles need to address their left tackle position at some point , but in this mock , all of the top offensive tackles are off the board .
With Brian Westbrook ’s health always a concern and Correll Buckhalter jetting to Denver , Moreno is the do - everything back the Eagles ’ covet .
He does n’t have tremendous speed or power , but Moreno ’s instincts and vision are outstanding and he could one day take over as Westbrook ’s replacement .
22 . Minnesota Vikings : Alex Mack , C , California
Center is n’t the sexiest pick in the first round ( in fact , it ’s about the least sexiest outside of kicker and punter ) , but the departure of Matt Birk left a gaping hole in the middle of the Vikings ’ offensive line .
Mack is extremely smart ( not unlike Birk ) and is physical and aggressive at the point of attack .
23 . New England Patriots : Clint Sintim , OLB , Virginia
The Patriots have been mentioned in trade rumors surrounding Julius Peppers , but those appear to be dead now .
The Pats obviously want to upgrade their outside linebacker position and Sintim is the best available .
Sintim flashed the ability to get to the passer in college and Bill Belichick could have a field day designing ways for him to do that .
24 . Atlanta Falcons : Clay Matthews , OLB , USC
After contract negotiations broke down with free agent L.J. Smith , many expect the Falcons to take a tight end at this spot – especially if Oklahoma State ’s Brandon Pettigrew is available .
But despite making the playoffs last year , Atlanta has a ton of holes to fill defensively and after re-signing Chauncey Davis , defensive end does n’t seem to be a bigger need than outside linebacker , defensive tackle or safety .
Matthews is n’t the most physically gifted prospect , but he has a non -stop motor and could compete with Coy Wire and Mike Peterson on the outside .
25 . Miami Dolphins : Malcolm Jenkins , CB , Ohio State
There ’s a good possibility that Jenkins will be long gone by this point , but he certainly did n’t help himself at the combine .
He timed slow in the 40 - yard dash and dropped multiple passes in drills .
But that does n’t mean he ca n’t play .
Jenkins is a big corner with solid instincts and if he does fall this far , he would be a steal for Miami .
26 . Baltimore Ravens : Alphonso Smith , CB , Wake Forest
After releasing Samari Rolle , the Ravens have a major need at cornerback and if Smith is still available , he would be an instant upgrade .
He ’s on the smaller side , but he ’s a good athlete and has excellent athleticism and quickness .
27 . Indianapolis Colts : Peria Jerry , DT , Ole Miss
Much like B.J. Raji going to Denver with the No. 12 pick , this just seems like a slam dunk .
The Colts need a run-stuffing defensive tackle and while Jerry does n’t have a ton of size or bulk , he fits Indy ’s style of defense because he ’s quick and explosive .
28 . Philadelphia Eagles : Brandon Pettigrew , TE , Oklahoma State
After allowing L.J. Smith to bolt via free agency , the Eagles could use an upgrade at tight end if they do n’t feel that Brent Celek is ready to be a full - time starter .
Pettigrew might not drop this far , but he ’s the best tight end prospect in the draft and not only is he a solid pass - catcher , but he ’s a decent blocker as well .
29 . New York Giants : Darrius Heyward - Bey , WR , Maryland
If Bey lasts , he would be a steal for the Giants at this spot .
New York is in obvious need of a wideout with Plaxico Burress ’s situation still up in the air and while Bey was inconsistent catching the ball at times in college , there ’s no denying his deep threat capabilities .
Think Eli Manning would love to have a receiver that runs a 4.30 and that can go up and get the ball ?
30 . Tennessee Titans : Darius Butler , Connecticut
The Titans could use a corner to play opposite Cortland Finnegan once Nick Harper decides to call it quits .
Butler has excellent quickness and athleticism , although he comes with some durability issues .
Still , the former Huskie is a smart , confident player and someone that Tennessee could bring along slowly to eventually replace Harper .
31 . Arizona Cardinals : Ron Brace , DT , Boston College
Starting nose tackle Bryan Robinson is 34 and although the team re-signed Gabe Watson , he ’s not a long - term solution at the position .
Brace definitely benefited from playing alongside B.J. Raji at Boston College , but he projects into a 3 - 4 nose tackle because he has the ability to shoot the gaps and give a good push up front .
He has excellent size at 6 ’ 3 ” , 334 pounds .
32 . Pittsburgh Steelers : Duke Robinson , G , Oklahoma
Considering he ’s the best guard prospect in the draft , Robinson might not last to the 32nd pick in the first round .
But if he does , the Steelers would instantly upgrade their guard position with the 6 ’ 5 ” , 329 - pound former Sooner .
Robinson has outstanding strength and is very power .
The films only worked in DVD players made in North America and the words " wrong region " came up on his screen .
Although he mournfully had to put the popcorn away , he is unlikely to jeopardise the special relationship – or " special partnership " , as we are now supposed to call it – by registering a complaint .
Introducing the Karmic Koala , our mascot for Ubuntu 9.10
Ladies and gentlemen , allow me to introduce the * Karmic Koala * , the newest member of our alliterative menagerie .
When you are looking for inspiration beyond the looming Jaunty feature freeze , I hope you 'll think of the Koala , our official mascot for Ubuntu 9.10 .
And if you 'll bear with me for a minute I 'll set the scene for what we hope to achieve in that time .
Server A good Koala knows how to see the wood for the trees , even when her head is in the clouds .
Ubuntu aims to keep free software at the forefront of cloud computing by embracing the API 's of Amazon EC2 , and making it easy for anybody to setup their own cloud using entirely open tools .
We 're currently in beta with official Ubuntu base AMI 's for use on Amazon EC2 .
During the Karmic cycle we want to make it easy to deploy applications into the cloud , with ready - to - run appliances or by quickly assembling a custom image .
Ubuntu - vmbuilder makes it easy to create a custom AMI today , but a portfolio of standard image profiles will allow easier collaboration between people doing similar things on EC2 .
Would n't it be apt for Ubuntu to make the Amazon jungle as easy to navigate as , say , APT ?
What if you want to build an EC2 - style cloud of your own ?
Of all the trees in the wood , a Koala 's favourite leaf is Eucalyptus .
The Eucalyptus project , from UCSB , enables you to create an EC2 - style cloud in your own data center , on your own hardware .
It 's no coincidence that Eucalyptus has just been uploaded to universe and will be part of Jaunty - during the Karmic cycle we expect to make those clouds dance , with dynamically growing and shrinking resource allocations depending on your needs .
A savvy Koala knows that the best way to conserve energy is to go to sleep , and these days even servers can suspend and resume , so imagine if we could make it possible to build a cloud computing facility that drops its energy use virtually to zero by napping in the midday heat , and waking up when there 's work to be done .
No need to drink at the energy fountain when there 's nothing going on .
If we get all of this right , our Koala will help take the edge off the bear market .
If that sounds rather open and nebulous , then we 've hit the sweet spot for cloud computing futurology .
Let me invite you to join the server team at UDS in Barcelona , when they 'll be defining the exact set of features to ship in October .
Desktop First impressions count .
We 're eagerly following the development of kernel mode setting , which promises a smooth and flicker - free startup .
We 'll consider options like Red Hat 's Plymouth , for graphical boot on all the cards that support it .
We made a splash years ago with Usplash , but it 's time to move to something newer and shinier .
So the good news is , boot will be beautiful .
The bad news is , you wo n't have long to appreciate it !
It only takes 35 days to make a whole Koala , so we think it should be possible to bring up a stylish desktop much faster .
The goal for Jaunty on a netbook is 25 seconds , so let 's see how much faster we can get you all the way to a Koala desktop .
We 're also hoping to deliver a new login experience that complements the graphical boot , and works well for small groups as well as very large installations .
For those of you who can relate to Mini Me , or already have a Dell Mini , the Ubuntu Netbook Edition will be updated to include all the latest technology from Moblin , and tuned to work even better on screens that are vertically challenged .
With millions of Linux netbooks out there , we have been learning and adapting usability to make the Koala cuddlier than ever .
We also want to ensure that the Netbook Remix installs easily and works brilliantly on all the latest netbook hardware , so consider this a call for testing Ubuntu 9.04 if you 're the proud owner of one of these dainty items .
The desktop will have a designer 's fingerprints all over it - we 're now beginning the serious push to a new look .
Brown has served us well but the Koala is considering other options .
Come to UDS for a preview of the whole new look .
UDS in Barcelona , 25 - 29 May
As always , the Ubuntu Developer Summit will be jam - packed with ideas , innovations , guests and gurus .
It 's a wombat and dingbat - free zone , so if you 're looking for high - intensity developer discussions , beautiful Barcelona will be the place to rest your opposable thumbs in May .
It 's where the Ubuntu community , Canonical engineers and partners come together to discuss , debate and design the Karmic Koala .
The event is the social and strategic highlight of each release cycle .
Jono Bacon , the Ubuntu Community Manager has more details at http://www.jonobacon.org/2009/02/19/announcing-the-karmic-koala-ubuntu-developer-summit/ including sponsorship for heavily - contributing community members .
More details of the Ubuntu Developer Summit can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDS.
A newborn Koala spends about six months in the family before it heads off into the wild alone .
Sounds about perfect for an Ubuntu release plan !
I 'm looking forward to seeing many of you in Barcelona , and before that , at a Jaunty release party .
Till then , cheers .

The browser market is stronger than ever .
There are no less than five mainstream browsers and dozens of off - shoot projects such as Flock and Maxthon .
Web developers have become passionate about their weapon of choice and spend many hours tweaking the software to perfection and evangelising the product to whoever will listen .
Opera has been around longer than most .
Originally started in 1994 , the browser was publicly released in 1996 .
Version 3 arrived in 1997 and deserved high acclaim for being far more advanced than Internet Explorer and Netscape .
Opera has remained at the forefront of innovation .
It was certainly one of the earliest browsers to support :
a multitude of operating systems , including Windows , Mac , Linux , FreeBSD , Solaris , QNX , OS / 2 , and BeOS
small - screen devices such as mobile phones and PDAs
game console browsers such as the Nintendo DS and Wii
web standards , CSS , XML , and WML
tabbed browsing and MDI interfaces
voice - controlled browsing and reading
mouse gestures
developer tools and assistance from the Opera.com website
Opera is lightweight and fast .
The early versions would fit on a single floppy disk and , even today , the download is a little over 5 MB .
That is far less than other browsers , especially when you consider it includes an email client and perhaps the best integrated RSS reader .
Unlike competing projects , Opera uses its own HTML rendering engine which has a reputation for being one of the fastest around .
Opera was also a successful commercial product until 2003 ; it was IE ’s main competitor given that the early versions of Mozilla and Netscape 6 were awful .
Version 7 introduced advertising but , from version 8 in 2005 , the product has been ad - free and free to use .
However , despite all the plaudits and a cult - following , Opera usage has remained far lower than IE , Firefox , and even the newer Safari and Chrome browsers .
The statistics vary , but Opera in unlikely to have more than 2 % of the market .
It may not have the marketing clout of Microsoft , Mozilla , Apple and Google , but Opera is well - known .
So why do so few people use it ?
I can not claim to have a definitive answer , but I suspect reasons for Opera ’s niche usage include :
Opera has been installed by many users – especially developers – but it may not be their default browser .
I use several versions for website testing , but still use Firefox for general browsing .
The interface is too OS - agnostic .
Opera is attractive , but it does not always look like a native application .
There are too many options .
User preferences can be tweaked extensively , but the range of options and some of the terminology can be confusing .
Extensions and widgets have only recently started to appear .
Opera is great , but offers few compelling reasons to switch from your favorite browser .
Even these reasons do not explain why Opera has not become more successful .
Do you use Opera ?
Why do you think adoption rates have remained lower than competing browsers ?
A frowny face is not what most electric customers expect to see on their utility statements , but Greg Dyer got one .
He earned it , the utility said , by using a lot more energy than his neighbors .
“ I have four daughters ; none of my neighbors has that many children , ” said Mr. Dyer , 49 , a lawyer who lives in Sacramento .
He wrote back to the utility and gave it his own rating : four frowny faces .
Two other Sacramento residents , however , Paul Geisert and his wife , Mynga Futrell , were feeling good .
They got one smiley face on their statement for energy efficiency and saw the promise of getting another .
“ Our report card will quickly get better , ” Mr. Geisert wrote in an e-mail message to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District .
The man himself may insist , in his customary rasp , that he feels quite at home tending to his craft in a room 100 floors beneath Hank Williams in the Tower of Song .
The music - buying public , however , appears to have decided that Leonard Cohen - poet , novelist , singer - songwriter and ladies ' man - has been selling his talent too short for too long .
If the fans behind an audacious internet download campaign get their way , the 74 - year - old Canadian could find his 1984 anthem Hallelujah making chart history by becoming the first song to hit the top two slots at the same time .
Cohen , alas , will not be ensconced in either place .
The No 1 spot is all - but - certain to go Alexandra Burke , who won ITV's X Factor final last week and whose cover of Hallelujah has already been downloaded more than 150,000 times since Saturday evening .
And second place is almost within the posthumous grasp of Jeff Buckley .
The American singer - songwriter , who drowned in 1997 , recorded what some believe to be the definitive version of Cohen 's Old Testament - informed love song for his 1994 album Grace .
Such is the awe in which Buckley 's cover is held that horrified fans from all over the world embarked on a campaign to get it to No 1 as soon as it emerged that Hallelujah would be released as a single by the X Factor winner .
Last week their pleas had propelled the Buckley version to No 30 on the strength of downloads alone , and yesterday an unofficial provisional " mid- week " chart suggested it had shot up to No 3 .
According to the figures , it was trailing Leona Lewis 's cover of Run by Snow Patrol - last week 's
No 1 single - by just under 10,000 sales .
Were Buckley 's cover to canter past Lewis , and maintain that lead until the official Christmas chart comes out on Sunday , musical history would be made and a serene , if knowing , smile might break out beneath Cohen 's grey fedora .
The double honour , albeit one shared by Buckley and Burke , would crown a triumphant year for Cohen , which saw him forced into his first tour in 15 years after his former business manager allegedly misappropriated the millions that he had put aside as his retirement fund .
In March the septuagenarian was inducted into the Rock 'n ' Roll Hall of Fame and ushered , officially , into " the highest and most influential echelon of songwriters " .
The cover bonanza should ease his financial pain a little , bringing royalties of at least £ 250,000 his way .
Hallelujah has already been reinterpreted by everyone from John Cale - whose take many purists judge to be the finest - to Rufus Wainwright , whose version graced the Shrek soundtrack .
A spokesman for Sony BMG , which counts Cohen , Buckley and Burke among its artists , said the company hoped Burke would take the top spot , but conceded : " Obviously it would be brilliant if Jeff got to No 2 . "
Although it remains to be seen exactly how things will turn out on Sunday , some in the record industry are expecting a unique Christmas chart .
" We suddenly have the very real prospect of two different covers of the same song occupying the No 1 and 2 slots , " said Gennaro Castaldo , a spokesman for the retailer HMV .
" I do n't think this has ever happened in UK charts history , and certainly not for Christmas . "
Cohen could not be contacted yesterday for his thoughts on chart - topping success .
Or Christmas .
A bionic eye could potentially restore sight
They used electrodes to stimulate an area of the brain that processes visual information , the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported .
The results in monkeys increase the chance that people with conditions such as glaucoma will one day have their vision restored with a prosthetic eye .
But experts warned it would be a big hurdle to implant enough electrodes to recreate an entire image in the mind .
Researchers have looked at several ways of restoring sight to people who have become blind because of an accident or common diseases such as macular degeneration .
In such patients , the eye has ceased to function but the visual centres in the brain are intact .
We need to increase the number of electrodes 100 - fold before this would be useful in patients
Dr John Pezaris , lead researcher
The goal is to bypass the eye and stimulate the visual parts of the brain to recreate an image in the mind .
Visual signal
The team used normal - sighted monkeys to test whether stimulating an area of the thalamus deep in the brain could produce a visual signal .
First they trained the monkeys to look at suddenly illuminated points of light .
Then they placed one or two very fine electrodes into the appropriate area of the brain to see what their reaction would be .
The device would help people see via a camera and electrodes
They found that the monkeys moved their gaze in the same way they would if a point of light appeared .
Lead researcher , Dr John Pezaris , research fellow at Harvard Medical School , said the experiment was an important step but one of the major hurdles to a human prosthesis would be to get many more electrodes in place .
" We need to increase the number of electrodes 100 - fold before this would be useful in patients . "
He explained that lots of electrodes would need to work together for patients to distinguish patterns and therefore full images .
The idea is that eventually a patient would wear a special set of glasses with a small digital camera mounted in the lens .
An external signal processor would translate the image from the camera into impulses and transmit them wirelessly to a stimulator implanted in the brain , which would deliver images to the visual system .
" This research is an important step , " Dr Pezaris added .
Ian Andolina , researcher in the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology in the UK , said the experiment demonstrated the principle worked .
" The way this bit of the brain is structured allows you to stimulate the central part of the vision very well , which would be important for conditions such as macular degeneration , " he said .
" But there is a fairly big problem for the future , which is how they are going to increase the number of stimulating electrodes as it sits deep in the brain . "
A renegade group of legislators in the House wants the state to grow , dispense and assess a tax on medical marijuana .
" Oregonians have voted to authorize the use of medical marijuana , yet the Legislature has failed to provide adequate safeguards for citizens who have a legitimate need for it , " said Rep. Carolyn Tomei , D - Milwaukie , in a prepared statement .
House Bill 3274 would levy a $ 98 per ounce tax on marijuana , to cover the state 's production and distribution costs .
" Many patients have no assurance that their marijuana is not laced with pesticides or other toxic chemicals , " said Rep. Jim Thompson , R - Dallas .
" If passed into law , this legislation will implement safe standards to dispense the drug through a tightly - controlled system . "
Rep. Ron Maurer , R - Grants Pass , and Rep. Chris Harker , D - Beaverton , are also sponsors of the bill .
Now that 's what we call bipartisanship .

Warren Buffett is getting some heat from CNBC's Jim Cramer for Berkshire Hathaway 's sales of big chunks of stock last fall , including billions of dollars worth of Johnson & Johnson .
On a CNBC Special Report Tuesday , Cramer advised investors not to follow Buffett 's lead this time around .
Then Cramer wrote on his site , TheStreet.com , that Buffett was " selling America " even as he was writing an op - ed piece titled Buy American .
I Am. for the New York Times .
Last night , on his Mad Money program , Cramer revisited Buffett as he listed what he sees as the 10 biggest myths and misperceptions in the market today .
Cramer is not only accusing Buffett of making bad decisions , he 's implying that Buffett has been hypocritically ignoring his own public call in the Times to buy U.S. stocks , misleading all those investors who ' copy ' Berkshire 's buys and sells .
But there is another way of looking at it .
Buffett was clear in his Times piece that he was buying U.S. stocks for his personal account .
For himself , and for many investors , he saw cheap equities as the best way to put cash to work .
But Berkshire has other opportunities to make money that simply are n't available to everyone else .
Most notably it can become a lender of last resort to solid companies going through a difficult time , and it can collect a very hefty interest rate for those loans .
Last fall , Buffett was n't " buying American " for Berkshire , but he was " loaning American . "
A total of eight billion dollars went to General Electric and Goldman Sachs .
Those loans pay 10 percent a year , guaranteed .
The major risk is a collapse of these enormous icons of American business , a risk small enough for Buffett to accept .
And those billions of dollars of loans may very well have come from stock sales .
After all , Buffett always wants to have a base level of cash on hand and resists borrowing money to finance investments .
Even if Buffett thought Johnson & Johnson would ultimately generate a solid return , it seems unlikely to expect that return would be 10 percent a year .
Buffett is not just looking for good investments for Berkshire , he 's looking for the best investments he can find , that carry as little risk as possible .
Loaning billions to GE and Goldman at 10 percent over a few years could easily be a better use of that money than letting it ride in the stock market .
( It does imply that he saw the stocks he sold as less likely to move higher than other equities in the portfolio . )
Buffett does not encourage anyone to replicate his Berkshire investments .
He was n't necessarily trying to send a " sell " signal on J&J and P&G , or U.S. stocks in general .
He was probably raising money to take advantage of GE and Goldman 's need for quick cash , an opportunity unique to Berkshire Hathaway .
Current stock prices :
Berkshire Class A : ( NYSE : US ;BRK .A )
Berkshire Class B : ( NYSE : US ;BRK.B)
Johnson & Johnson : ( NYSE : JNJ )
Procter & Gamble :( NYSE : PG )
General Electric :( NYSE : GE )
Goldman Sachs :( NYSE : GS )

Addressing a crowd of about 300 financial executives this morning , a professor of human resources soundly denounced the corporate HR profession for being mostly unable to provide analytics that are useful in making workforce decisions that build economic value .
Most companies today spend too little effort on attracting and retaining top strategic talent and too much on satisfying the rest of the employee base , asserted Rutgers University ’s Richard Beatty , who spoke at a general session during the CFO Rising conference in Orlando .
In fact , he claimed that typical human resources activities have no relevance to an organization ’s success .
“ HR people try to perpetuate the idea that job satisfaction is critical , ” Beatty said .
“ But there is no evidence that engaging employees impacts financial returns . ”
Beatty based this conclusion on employee surveys done at IBM and other companies that found little relationship between job satisfaction and performance ratings .
Not only is employee engagement very expensive , but “ how do you know you ’re not satisfying a lot of people you really wish were n’t there ? ”
To buttress his argument , Beatty presented data from a Gallup survey on the performance of about 4,500 customer service employees at an unnamed major financial firm .
The survey results , which were based on customer feedback , showed that the employees who scored in the top quartile had a positive effect on 61 percent of the people they talked to .
The next two quartiles registered 40 percent and 27 percent positive responses , respectively , but there were enough neutral responses that the employees ’ net performance was positive .
The lowest quartile , however , scored a net 2 percent negative impact .
“ You ’d be better off had you paid these people not to come to work , ” Beatty said .
“ You ’d be a lot better off if you paid them to work for your competitor . ”
The financial firm paid about $ 30 million in salaries and benefits to the employees in the lowest quartile , whose performance cost the firm as much as $ 50 million worth of business .
However , Beatty pointed out that this kind of performance variability means there is an opportunity to build a more valuable work force .
Usually in such a situation , HR professionals try to figure out what the top performers are doing right , then train the others accordingly .
That is faulty thinking , insisted Beatty , who asserted that selection is a more powerful predictor of performance than training .
In addition , training may not be the problem – some employees may know what to do , but choose not to do it , opined the professor .
“ HR wants to treat most employees the same way , and they spend considerable time trying to defend or fix poor performers , taking on the St. Bernard role , ” he said .
“ Low turnover is n’t necessarily a good thing .
Think about where you might want to disinvest . ”
Human resources is also behind what Beatty called the “ silly ” idea that a company should try to be the “ employer of choice . ”
If you are the employer of choice , he asked rhetorically , who ’s going to be applying for your jobs ?
“ Everybody and their dog ’s brother , ” he said .
“ You want people who are excited , enthused , and understand how to contribute to what you do , as opposed to those who simply want to find a good place to hide out . ”
Beatty said that it is most important to think outside the HR department box when it comes to filling the strategic positions that create the bulk of a company ’s value .
To that end , he suggested that companies might be better off appointing someone from outside the HR department to manage strategic talent .
He pointed to Precision Castparts Corp. , a $ 7 billion machine - parts manufacturer , as one company that has bypassed HR in several situations .
For one , it reassigned an operations executive who ran a third of the company ’s 150 plants to take control of scouting for and retaining strategic talent .
Such tactics are warranted because while “ the language of organizations is numbers , HR is n’t very good at data analytics , ” Beatty said .
“ They do n’t think like business people .
Many of them entered human resources because they wanted to help people , which I ’m all for , but I ’m also for building winning organizations . ”
It ’s the CFO ’s job to make sure that the work of analyzing and , as necessary , reconstituting the work force gets done by someone qualified to do the job , added Beatty , and there has never been more at stake than there is now .
“ The labor market is in a position to provide you with better talent than you have ever had , ” said Beatty , co-author of the new book , The Differentiated Workforce .
“ If you do n’t emerge from this market with better talent in the roles that really make a difference , I do n’t think you ’re trying . ”
The human brain ’s sensitivity to unexpected outcomes plays a fundamental role in the ability to adapt and learn new behaviors , according to a new study by a team of psychologists and neuroscientists from the University of Pennsylvania .
Using a computer - based card game and microelectrodes to observe neuronal activity of the brain , the Penn study , published March 13 in the journal Science , suggests that neurons in the human substantia nigra , or SN , play a central role in reward - based learning , modulating learning based on the discrepancy between the expected and the realized outcome .
“ This is the first study to directly record neural activity underlying this learning process in humans , confirming the hypothesized role of the basal ganglia , which includes the SN , in models of reinforcement including learning , addiction and other disorders involving reward - seeking behavior , ” said lead author Kareem Zaghloul , postdoctoral fellow in neurosurgery at Penn ’s School off Medicine .
“ By responding to unexpected financial rewards , these cells encode information that seems to help participants maximize reward in the probabilistic learning task . ”
Learning , previously studied in animal models , seems to occur when dopaminergic neurons , which drive a larger basal ganglia circuit , are activated in response to unexpected rewards and depressed after the unexpected omission of reward .
Put simply , a lucky win seems to be retained better than a probable loss .
Similar to an economic theory , where efficient markets respond to unexpected events and expected events have no effect , we found that the dopaminergic system of the human brain seems to be wired in a similar rational manner -- tuned to learn whenever anything unexpected happens but not when things are predictable , " said Michael J. Kahana , senior author and professor of psychology at Penn ’s School of Arts and Sciences .
Zaghloul worked with Kahana and Gordon Baltuch , associate professor of neurosurgery , in a unique collaboration among departments of psychology , neurosurgery and bioengineering .
They used microelectrode recordings obtained during deep brain stimulation surgery of Parkinson ’s patients to study neuronal activity in the SN , the midbrain structure that plays an important role in movement , as well as reward and addiction .
Patients with Parkinson ’s disease show impaired learning from both positive and negative feedback in cognitive tasks due to the degenerative nature of their disease and the decreased number of dopaminergic neurons .
The recordings were analyzed to determine whether responses were affected by reward expectation .
Participants were asked to choose between red and blue decks of cards presented on a computer screen , one of which carried a higher probability of yielding a financial reward than the other .
If the draw of a card yielded a reward , a stack of gold coins was displayed along with an audible ring of a cash register and a counter showing accumulated virtual earnings .
If the draw did not yield a reward or if no choice was made , the screen turned blank and participants heard a buzz .
“ This new way to measure dopaminergic neuron activity has helped us gain a greater understanding of fundamental cognitive activity , " said Baltuch , director of the Penn Medicine Center for Functional and Restorative Neurosurgery .
The work is supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health , the Conte Center and the Dana Foundation .

PORTSMOUTH �
When Britta Osberg�s ex-boyfriend asked her to return a ring , she punched him in the face twice , leaving the ring 's imprint on his cheek , police allege .
Based on those allegations , Osberg , 19 , of 110 Perkins Road , Rye , is scheduled to be arraigned in Portsmouth District Court Monday on two class A misdemeanor counts of simple assault .
According to an affidavit by Officer Eric Kinsman , the alleged victim told police he went to a city gas station to retrieve the ring from Osberg , she refused to return it and they began to argue .
During the argument , Osberg is alleged to have twice punched her ex in the face .
Kinsman�s report to the District Court alleges he photographed injuries on the man�s face , including a cut on his upper right cheek that matches the design of the ring .
Following her arrest , Osberg was released on $ 2,500 personal recognizance bail .
Green light for new generation of reactors in Sweden reflects change in sentiment towards nuclear power , government says
Nuclear power received a significant boost today when the Swedish government announced plans to overturn a near 30 - year ban on atomic plants as part of a new drive to increase energy security and combat global warming .
Ministers said they would present a bill on 17 March which would allow the construction of nuclear reactors on existing sites and introduce a new carbon tax as part of a programme to cut carbon emissions by 40 % on 1990 levels by 2020 .
The decision is significant because Sweden was at the forefront of anti-nuclear sentiment following the Three Mile Island accident in America in 1979 and voted in a referendum a year later to phase out its existing stations .
It also coincides with a statement today from Fortum Corporation that it wanted to build a second new atomic plant near Helsinki in Finland .
The company is already building the first new nuclear station in Europe for more than 30 years .
Fredrik Reinfeld , the Swedish prime minister , said he did not feel bound by his nation 's previous referendum result because it did not specify how the power from the nuclear stations should be replaced , but the government must still convince parliament before it is turned into law .
The proposal was made possible after a compromise by the Center party , a junior coalition member which has long held a sceptical stance toward nuclear power .
" I 'm doing this for the sake of my children and grandchildren , " said Center party leader , Maud Olofsson .
" I can live with the fact that nuclear power will be part of our electricity supply system in the foreseeable future . "
This follows a series of public opinion polls indicating a change in sentiment as the country becomes increasingly dependent on energy imports from Norway and climate change has become a matter of increasing concern .
Sweden 's 10 nuclear reactors at three plants – Oskarshamn , Ringhals and Forsmark – supply roughly half of the country 's electricity , while two other reactors at the Barseback site have been closed over the past decade .
The country has been at the forefront of efforts to find ways of burying the highly toxic waste produced during the nuclear cycle .
The current generation of nuclear generating plants around the world came into operation between 1972 and 1985 but the industry fell into disrepute with the public following the Three Mile Island accident and the image of nuclear was further tarnished when there was a meltdown at the Chernobyl plant in Ukraine seven years later .
But since then there have been no scares and climate change has risen up the global agenda .
Nuclear power emits virtually no carbon although critics claim significant amounts of CO2 are released if one takes into account the mining of uranium and other aspects of any full - lifecycle programme .
Finland is the first to European country to start to construct a new nuclear plant , and has been followed by France .
Britain is preparing for new reactors to be constructed to replace those coming to the end of their useful lives .
Germany - like Sweden - has been seen as a firm opponent of atomic power but chancellor , Angela Merkel , has made clear that she too thinks a new debate should take place on whether new plants should be constructed .
Environmentalists opposed to nuclear power said the decision in Sweden was one taken by a small majority in parliament and did not represent a significant swing back to favour for atomic power .
" No way can this be seen as a ringing endorsement given the parties concerned only hold 180 of 349 seats .
The largest party in Sweden is still against nuclear and the people are not enamoured by it either , " said Jean McSorley , a senior nuclear adviser at Greenpeace .
McSorley believed the construction of an new nuclear plants would be hampered by the long lead times and huge expense at a time when the global recession means money is in short supply .
" There are very long lead times for new nuclear plants giving plenty of time for faults to emerge , " she explained , noting that the Finnish reactor , Olkiluoto 3 currently under construction , has already fallen behind schedule and is over cost .
Nuclear consultant John Large said it was not very surprising that Sweden should want to recommit to nuclear .
" If you looked at the wording of the moratorium it was was pretty liberally worded .
I think [ the latest decision ] is as much to do with being overly dependent on Norway for power than the fight against climate change . "
But Swedish ministers also outlined plans to lift the proportion of renewable energy consumption to 50 % of the total .
In the transport sector alone , the target was set at 10 % and Sweden has become a major importer of sugar - based ethanol from Brazil .
Sweden already gets much of its power from hydroelectric and biomass schemes .
The new energy package also included plans to expand wind power and tough new taxes on CO2 and energy .
" We 'll talk with the [ Department of Public Prosecutions ] and we 'll also make some inquiries with the blogging side of it , whether we can have it removed .
" We do n't want anything to take place , we do n't want anything to be done , that might jeopardise a fair trial down the track . "
Sokaluk , 39 , of Churchill faces one count of arson causing death , one count of intentionally lighting a bushfire and one count of possessing child pornography .
The charges relate to the Churchill fire that burnt out more than 30,000 hectares , killed 10 people and destroyed about 200 homes .
He has been remanded in custody to appear at a committal mention on May 26 and has not entered a plea nor applied for bail .
The fight to quell the flames continues as police search the wreckage for more victims of Australia 's worst bushfire disaster , which has claimed at least 189 lives .
" It is a very difficult task , a very painstaking task , but it has to follow a particular methodology .
We will do it as quick as we can so people can get in [ to their home towns ] , " Mr Walshe told the Nine Network today .
Police are also investigating blazes that were possibly deliberately lit and specifically appealed for information from anyone in the area of the Murrindindi fire around Alexandra .

Why do you always have to serve Bill beans when it ’s my night for him to come over ?
It ’s been eight long months since we got our last Lost fix , and , if you ’re anything like us , the itch for new intel has been pretty much unbearable for at least the past six .
But while there ’s been no shortage of ABC - sanctioned sneak peeks at the new season , we ’re always way more interested in what the mad , minutiae - analyzing geniuses on the internet have to say about what it all means .
So , we scoured the web for some choice hypotheses ( and couple of crackpot ones ) relating to tomorrow night ’s season - five premiere .
Happy theorizing !
• Now that we know John Locke is the one in the coffin , and that he goes by the name Jeremy Bentham in the future , we can begin to guess what that signifies .
For one thing , you should know that the real Bentham denounced many of the real Locke ’s philosophical views , so look out for Locke ’s drastic character shift as he becomes the leader of the Others .
Also , the wheel Ben pushed to move the island apparently has all sorts of religious and philosophical importance and may be a huge key to understanding the show .

• Remember how Daniel Faraday could n’t remember meeting Desmond at the end of “ The Constant ” ?
That could be the case because his present consciousness had not been linked with his past consciousness , but perhaps a major event ( like an island disappearing ) will make his mind shift in time .
Or something like that .

• Doc Jensen weighs in with his first big theory of 2009 , which concerns the “ ghosts ” of Charlie and Claire , who brought warnings that Jack should not raise Aaron , and that Kate should n’t bring him back to the island .
But maybe they were n’t talking about Aaron at all .
Rather , Jensen thinks these may have been warning not to resurrect a certain dead character .
You know , like one who might have been spotted in a coffin . [ EW ]
• Has the island become unstuck in time ?
If so , then it might constantly shift time periods as though it has some sort of consciousness that can only be stabilized by a constant .
( Is that why Jacob ’s cabin moves around so much ? )
And maybe that constant is the Oceanic Six . [ EYE M SICK ]
• Forget the science ;
Lost is all about the supernatural .
With a distinct consciousness , the island is — what else ? — the mind of God .
Yeah , we ’re not going to read into this one too much .

Skype has , at last , come to the iPhone .
Everyone ’s favorite VoIP application is Wi-Fi-only — of course — but what is there works great .
The best news , though , is for iPod Touch owners .
Because Skype is Wi-Fi-only , if you have a 2G Touch and headphones with a microphone , you get the same functionality as the iPhone .
Let me make that clearer .
This official , Apple - sanctioned application turns an iPod into a telephone .
And it ’s free .
I took it for a very quick spin to see how it worked .
Skype is a very solid and polished application for a first release — it ’s good to see that some developers resisted the urge to release crap in the App Store 's first week .
After installing the 2.7MB app , you enter your username and password .
You then see your contacts list .
You can either see all contacts and narrow them down by typing into the search field , or opt to see only online contacts .
It looks just as you would expect :
Touch a contact and you get the usual Skype choices : call or chat .
Chatting works just like IM , with you and your chat partner ’s pictures showing up next to speech bubbles containing the text .
Neat and easy .
You can also switch between chats and the app keeps your old chats so you can pick up where you left off .
But you really want to know about the phone part , right ?
In short , it works fine .
Or , more accurately , it works as well as Skype on the desktop which means mixed quality and reliability .
That ’s a network issue , though —
Skype for iPhone as software is probably even better than the desktop version .
I hooked up my Apple - made iPod headphones with remote and microphone .
A test call to the Lady ( after I woke her up ) worked fine :
Although the sound was very low on my end , she could hear me very clearly .
There is , of course , no video .
Here are a couple of shots :
As you can see , all the usual phone features are there , arranged in a very iPhone - like way .
If you have a Skype account which includes Skype Out or you have a Skype number , you can use those to make and receive calls from regular phones .
Dial just as you would with an iPhone :
The address book icon at the bottom calls up the standard iPhone / iPod Touch address book and will paste in numbers therefrom .
I could n't try this part as I no longer use Skype Out since my parents entered the 21st century and came off dialup .
The conclusion ?
If you are a Skype user , you should have this application .
It 's free , it is easy to use and just works .
Being limited to Wi -Fi means it wo n't change the face of telephony – yet .
But for Skype the move to mobile devices is an inevitable step , and when the iPhone OS 3.0 surfaces , we should get call and chat notifications showing on the home screen and maybe even a plugin mic for the iPod Touch , making it a proper VoIP handset .

Tom Brady Goes Shopping For Gisele At Best Buy
Total Pro Sports – I guess now we all know who wears the pants in the Brady - Bundchen household !!
Obviously not Tom Brady !!!
After getting married less a week ago it is clear that their short lived honeymoon is over .
Thanks to our friends over at TMZ who reported today that newlyweds Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen were spotted at a Best Buy in Los Angeles buying a few things in the “ Ink and Paper ” section .
“ The honeymoon is clearly over — because yesterday in L.A. , Tom Brady was back to running errands as his new wife , Gisele Bundchen , kept the car running with Tom ’s son in the back seat . ”
Like any other good husband ( Or maybe not like any other good husband ) , Gisele sat in the car with Tom ’s son waiting in front of the Best Buy for him to return .
I wonder what they are going to do with all that ink and paper for their printer ???
Maybe Tom and Gisele did it old school and instead of making a sex tape they went with photographs instead ????
Just a little something to throw out there , but you never know !!

The Israeli military yesterday officially condemned as " unacceptable " shocking images printed on T - shirts ordered by some soldiers to commemorate the end of their basic training or field duty .
The Israeli daily Haaretz disclosed that some T - shirts are emblazoned with " dead babies , mothers weeping on their children 's graves , a gun aimed at a child and bombed - out mosques " .
One , which the paper says was a sharpshooter 's T - shirt , shows a pregnant Arab woman with a bullseye superimposed on her belly , accompanied by the slogan " 1 shot , 2 kills " .
It adds that another shirt for infantry snipers is inscribed " Better use Durex " next to a picture of a dead Palestinian baby with his weeping mother beside him .
The report quotes one soldier as explaining : " These are shirts for around the house , for jogging , in the army .
Not for going out . "
The practice came to light following disclosures that soldiers who took part in Israel 's military offensive in Gaza complained about rules of engagement allowing them to kill civilians and destroy property .
The Israel Defence Forces said yesterday that the T - shirts " are not in accordance with IDF values and are simply tasteless .
This type of humour is unacceptable .
Commanders are instructed to use disciplinary tools against those who produce T - shirts of this type . "
Another day , another parenthetical note .
It 's probably worth repeating that these are just personal impressions , take them with a salt lick .
François - René Rideau spoke about XCVB , a packaging system for Common Lisp .
Slides here .
From what I gather , XCVB tries to make separate compilation of Lisp libraries more robust via mechanisms that isolate compile - time side - effects .
More interesting was where he headed at the end of his talk , and expanded on in a lightning talk : that the things that we do are intertwined with the stories we tell others and ourselves .
The bad stories are about things .
The better stories are about people making things .
Next up was a presentation by Gary King from Franz Inc. , about AllegroGraph , a massive RDF triple - store capable of storing and searching billions and billions of triples .
Specifically , as far as I could tell , it was about adding temporal and geospatial capabilities to queries -- so you could ask " Of the people that Bob called last week , who has a friend within 5 miles of the Boston area ? "
It was quite impressive , but it makes me queasy too .
Who has billions and billions of facts and needs to query them ?
Well , the CIA , the NSA , and similar organizations .
Others too of course , epidemiologists for example , but that does n't ease the quease .
Next up , something totally different .
John Hastings lives in Nebraska and has a problem with grasshoppers -- they tend to eat up all of the grass that cattle graze on .
Ranchers out there would douse their land with chemicals at any word of a grasshopper outbreak .
But that 's not good for the land , and it 's also expensive .
So he wrote an expert system to help ranchers say what the conditions are where they live , in Lisp , and help them decide what to do .
The program gets deployed into peoples ' web browsers via one of the Lisp - on - the - JVM projects .
Voilà fewer chemicals !
Next , a talk by an engineer at Cadence Design Systems , on how they use Lisp to lay out certain kinds of electronics called " systems - in - a - package " , such as the circuit boards and the amplifiers and conditioners and such .
His point appeared to be that giving the user a way to extend and specialize certain designs via generic functions lets them deliver applications without source , but still allow some extensibility .
I did n't care for the " freedom subtracted " aspect , but seeing more about chip design processes was interesting .
Jorge Vallejos from the Vrije Universiteit in Brussels took the floor next .
His talk was on distributed computing within the Actors paradigm , whereby objects on different machines can reference and send messages to each other .
The interesting part was how he used actors as containers for unadorned objects , and used generic functions to " invoke " remote objects .
The meta - object protocol allowed him to extend base Lisp to have remote asynchronous procedure calls , while keeping a natural Lisp feel .
It was fine , but something about RPC as a distributed programming metaphor does n't sit right with me .
I probably missed something .
Didier Verna followed , with a delightful talk comparing the speed of Common Lisp and C ++.
He works at a lab in France that does lots of numerical processing on images , and is the only Lisper in a roomful of C++ wizards .
The funny thing is that he says he does n't care about speed , because things are fast enough , but that he was tired of getting shit from his C++- loving coworkers , so he decided to do some measuring .
This guy is serious .
This is his second paper in a projected series of 5 or so ; his last installment showed that Lisp and C are comparable in speed .
This talk compared instantiation time for C++ objects to instantiation of Lisp structures and CLOS objects , showing again that Lisp was comparable in speed with C++.
Unfortunately the paper and slides do n't appear to be online ; I 'll ask him about this .
Also , Verna gave a lightning talk in which he explained that Lisp is Jazz and Jazz is Lisp .
When asked by the audience about other things , he explained that they were Jazz too .
Also Lisp is Aikido , and buy his CD .

In a later post , I 'll get to Sussman 's talk on evolvability and robust design .
It will take some thinking to summarize .
The Tata Nano , the world 's cheapest car , has been launched in India .
Costing just 100,000 rupees ( $ 1,979 ; £ 1,366 ) , the Nano will now go on sale across India next month , with deliveries starting in July .
Tata hopes the 10 - foot ( 3 - metre ) long , five - seater car will be cheap enough to encourage millions of Indians to trade up from their motorcycles .
Tata owner Ratan Tata has described the Nano as a " milestone " .
Analysts say it will not make a profit for six years .

Nano : ' Triumph of Indian ingenuity ' Tata 's managing director Ravi Kant said that from the first orders , a ballot would then select the initial 100,000 people to get their Nano .
" I think we are at the gates of offering a new form of transport to the people of India and later , I hope , other markets elsewhere in the world , " Mr Tata added .
" I hope it will provide safe , affordable four - wheel transportation to families who till now have not been able to own a car . "
Environmentalists are warning that the Nano will add to India 's already clogged up roads , and pollution levels will soar .
Tata says the Nano will be the least polluting car in India .

The basic model has no airbags , air conditioning , radio , or power steering .
However , more luxurious versions will be available .
A slightly bigger European version , the Nano Europa is due to follow in 2011 , and is expected to cost nearer to £ 4,000 .

Send us your comments Analysts said that if the car proves an immediate hit in its home market , Tata may struggle to meet demand .
This is because the main Nano factory in the western state of Gujarat , which will be able to build 250,000 cars a year , is not due to open until next year .
In the meantime , Tata will only be able to build about 50,000 Nanos at its existing plants .
The delay happened when Tata had to abandon plans to build the Nano in a new plant in the eastern state of West Bengal due to a row over land acquired from farmers .
This caused the launch of the Nano to be put back by six months .
Global slowdown
Even if Tata can sell 250,000 models a year , it will add only 3 % to the firm 's revenues , says Vaishali Jajoo , auto analyst at Mumbai 's Angel Broking .

" And for the bottom line , it will take five to six years to break even . "
Yet with seven million motorcycles sold last year in India , Tata is eyeing a huge marketplace for the Nano .
Like almost all global carmakers , Tata has seen sales fall as the global economic downturn has continued .
The firm made a 2.63 bn rupees loss for three months between October and December .
In addition , Tata is struggling to refinance the remaining £ 2bn of its £ 3bn loan it took out to buy the Jaguar and Land Rover brands from Ford in June of last year .

NASA ’s Hubble Space Telescope has identified a star a million times brighter than the sun that exploded as a supernova in 2005 — well before it should have , according to current theories of stellar evolution .
The doomed star , estimated at about 100 times our sun ’s mass , was not mature enough , according to theory , to have evolved a massive iron core of nuclear fusion ash .
This is the supposed prerequisite for a core implosion that triggers a supernova blast .
“ This might mean that we are fundamentally wrong about the evolution of massive stars , and that theories need revising , ” says Avishay Gal - Yam of the Weizmann Institute of Science , in Rehovot , Israel .
The finding appears in the online version of Nature Magazine .
The explosion , called supernova SN 2005gl , was seen in the barred - spiral galaxy NGC 266 on October 5 , 2005 .
NGC 266 is about 200 million light years away , in the constellation Pisces .
The progenitor was so bright that it probably belonged to a class of stars called Luminous Blue Variables ( LBVs ) , “ because no other type of star is as intrinsically brilliant , ” says Gal - Yam .
But there ’s a wrinkle : as an LBV - class star evolves , it sheds much of its mass through a violent stellar wind .
Only at that point does it develop a large iron core and ultimately explodes as a core - collapse supernova .
“ The progenitor identification shows that , at least in some cases , massive stars explode before losing most of their hydrogen envelope , suggesting that the evolution of the core and the evolution of the envelope are less coupled than previously thought , a finding which may require a revision of stellar evolution theory , ” co-author Douglas Leonard , from California ’s San Diego State University , said in a press release .
One possibility is that the progenitor to SN 2005gl was really a pair of stars — a binary system — that merged .
This would have stoked nuclear reactions to brighten the star enormously , making it look more luminous and less evolved than it really was .
“ This also leaves open the question that there may be other mechanisms for triggering supernova explosions , ” says Gal - Yam .
“ We may be missing something very basic in understanding how a superluminous star goes through mass loss . ”
Gal - Yam and Leonard located the progenitor in archival images of NGC 266 taken in 1997 .
They then used the Keck telescope to precisely locate the supernova on the outer arm of the galaxy .
A follow - up observation with Hubble in 2007 unequivocally showed that the superluminous star was gone .
Extremely massive and luminous stars topping 100 solar masses , such as Eta Carinae in our own Milky Way Galaxy , are expected to lose their entire hydrogen envelopes prior to their ultimate explosions as supernovae .
“ These observations demonstrate that many details in the evolution and fate of LBVs remain a mystery , ” said Mario Livio , of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore .
“ We should continue to keep an eye on Eta Carinae – it may surprise us yet again . ”

Screenshot of Megaphone Desktop Tool
The Megaphone desktop tool was a Windows " action alert " tool developed by Give Israel Your United Support ( GIYUS ) and distributed by World Union of Jewish Students , World Jewish Congress , The Jewish Agency for Israel , World Zionist Organization , StandWithUs , Hasbara fellowships , HonestReporting , and other pro-Israel public relations organizations .
The tool was released in July during the 2006 Lebanon War .
By June 2011 , the tool was no longer available through the GIYUS website .
An RSS newsfeed is available . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
Software [ edit ]
The Megaphone Desktop Tool acted as a wrapper around an RSS feed from the GIYUS website .
Originally , it gave the user the option of going to a particular site with a poll , and if the user chooses to go to the site , the software then casts a vote automatically , when this is technically feasible , but that feature had been discontinued .
Giyus tries to save you the time and effort of locating the voting form inside the website , a seemingly simple task that may prove quite confusing at certain sites .
Whenever we technically can we direct you straight to the voting action .
If you have arrived at the poll results , it means that you were directed straight to the voting action and have already successfully voted .
If for some reason you do n't care to vote , you can always use the " No Thanks " link in the article alert popup . [ 8 ]
In later versions , the voting concept was removed entirely and the tool directed users to anti-Israel websites , giving users and option click a button labeled " act now ! " which would direct the user to a poll or email address .
The software license provides for remote updates : " You understand and agree that Giyus .
Org may provide updates , patches and / or new versions of the Software from time to time , including automatic updates that will be installed on your computer , with notice to You , as needed to continue to use the Services , and You hereby authorize such installations . " [ 9 ]
Press coverage [ edit ]
According to The Jerusalem Post , Amir Gissin , head of the Public Affairs Department of the Foreign Ministry of Israel , has expressed support for the tool 's use .
" The Foreign Ministry itself is now pushing the idea , urging supporters of Israel everywhere to become cyberspace soldiers in the new battleground for Israel 's image . " it reports . [ 10 ]
Computing website
The Register has described use of the software as " highly organised mass manipulation of technologies which are supposed to be democratising " and claimed Megaphone is " effectively a high - tech exercise in ballot - stuffing " [ 11 ]
The Register also reported that the BBC History magazine website " noticed an upsurge in voting on whether holocaust denial should be a criminal offence in Britain .
But the closing date had already passed and the result had already been published , so the votes were invalid anyway . "
Stewart Purvis , former editor - in - chief of ITN , has noted that an independent panel reviewing the BBC's Israeli - Palestinian coverage received a large number of letters from North America which accused the BBC of being anti-Israeli .
He states there was evidence of " pressure group involvement " . [ 12 ]
Commercialization [ edit ]
Following the success of the Megaphone tool , the developers formed the company Collactive . [ 13 ]
In 2007 , Collactive released their " Web Assistant " , a general - purpose commercial version of the Megaphone tool . [ 14 ]
Reception [ edit ]
The tool has received a wide range of reactions , from praise to criticism .
Amir Gissin , head of the Public Affairs Department of the Israeli Foreign Ministry , praised the tool , [ citation needed ] noting its efficacy during the Adnan Hajj photographs controversy in obtaining an admission from the Reuters news agency that a photograph by Adnan Hajj had been improperly edited with photo editing software . [ 10 ]
The tool has similarly been praised by a number of pro-Israel organizations [ citation needed ] for helping to fight what they perceive to be anti-Israel media bias .
At the same time , it has been criticized by Independent Television News , and others for stuffing the ballot of online polls , generating excessive comments and ' spam ' on internet message boards , and stifling online discussion and what is seen by some as a mass , participatory form of propaganda .

$5 BILLION IN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS BOUGHT WALL STREET FREEDOM FROM REGULATION , RESTRAINT , REPORT FINDS
Steps to Financial Cataclysm Paved with Industry Dollars
March 4 - The financial sector invested more than $ 5 billion in political influence purchasing in Washington over the past decade , with as many as 3,000 lobbyists winning deregulation and other policy decisions that led directly to the current financial collapse , according to a 231 - page report issued today by Essential Information and the Consumer Education Foundation .
The report , " Sold Out : How Wall Street and Washington Betrayed America , " shows that , from 1998 - 2008 , Wall Street investment firms , commercial banks , hedge funds , real estate companies and insurance conglomerates made $ 1.725 billion in political contributions and spent another $ 3.4 billion on lobbyists , a financial juggernaut aimed at undercutting federal regulation .
Nearly 3,000 officially registered federal lobbyists worked for the industry in 2007 alone .
The report documents a dozen distinct deregulatory moves that , together , led to the financial meltdown .
These include prohibitions on regulating financial derivatives ; the repeal of regulatory barriers between commercial banks and investment banks ; a voluntary regulation scheme for big investment banks ; and federal refusal to act to stop predatory subprime lending .
" The report details , step - by - step , how Washington systematically sold out to Wall Street , " says Harvey Rosenfield , president of the Consumer Education Foundation , a California - based non-profit organization .
" Depression - era programs that would have prevented the financial meltdown that began last year were dismantled , and the warnings of those who foresaw disaster were drowned in an ocean of political money .
Americans were betrayed , and we are paying a high price -- trillions of dollars -- for that betrayal . "
" Congress and the Executive Branch , " says Robert Weissman of Essential Information and the lead author of the report , " responded to the legal bribes from the financial sector , rolling back common - sense standards , barring honest regulators from issuing rules to address emerging problems and trashing enforcement efforts .
The progressive erosion of regulatory restraining walls led to a flood of bad loans , and a tsunami of bad bets based on those bad loans .
Now , there is wreckage across the financial landscape . "
12 Key Policy Decisions Led to Cataclysm
Financial deregulation led directly to the current economic meltdown .
For the last three decades , government regulators , Congress and the executive branch , on a bipartisan basis , steadily eroded the regulatory system that restrained the financial sector from acting on its own worst tendencies .
" Sold Out " details a dozen key steps to financial meltdown , revealing how industry pressure led to these deregulatory moves and their consequences :
1 . In 1999 , Congress repealed the Glass - Steagall Act , which had prohibited the merger of commercial banking and investment banking .
Regulatory rules permitted off - balance sheet accounting -- tricks that enabled banks to hide their liabilities .
The Clinton administration blocked the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from regulating financial derivatives -- which became the basis for massive speculation .
Congress in 2000 prohibited regulation of financial derivatives when it passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act .
The Securities and Exchange Commission in 2004 adopted a voluntary regulation scheme for investment banks that enabled them to incur much higher levels of debt .
Rules adopted by global regulators at the behest of the financial industry would enable commercial banks to determine their own capital reserve requirements , based on their internal " risk - assessment models . "
Federal regulators refused to block widespread predatory lending practices earlier in this decade , failing to either issue appropriate regulations or even enforce existing ones .
Federal bank regulators claimed the power to supersede state consumer protection laws that could have diminished predatory lending and other abusive practices .
Federal rules prevent victims of abusive loans from suing firms that bought their loans from the banks that issued the original loan .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac expanded beyond their traditional scope of business and entered the subprime market , ultimately costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars .
The abandonment of antitrust and related regulatory principles enabled the creation of too - big - to - fail megabanks , which engaged in much riskier practices than smaller banks .
Beset by conflicts of interest , private credit rating companies incorrectly assessed the quality of mortgage - backed securities ; a 2006 law handcuffed the SEC from properly regulating the firms .
Financial Sector Political Money and 3000 Lobbyists Dictated Washington Policy
During the period 1998 - 2008 :
Commercial banks spent more than $ 154 million on campaign contributions , while investing $ 363 million in officially registered lobbying :
Accounting firms spent $ 68 million on campaign contributions and $ 115 million on lobbying ;
Insurance companies donated more than $ 218 million and spent more than $ 1.1 billion on lobbying ;
Securities firms invested more than $ 504 million in campaign contributions , and an additional $ 576 million in lobbying .
Included in this total : private equity firms contributed $ 56 million to federal candidates and spent $ 33 million on lobbying ; and hedge funds spent $ 32 million on campaign contributions ( about half in the 2008 election cycle ) .
The betrayal was bipartisan : about 55 percent of the political donations went to Republicans and 45 percent to Democrats , primarily reflecting the balance of power over the decade .
Democrats took just more than half of the financial sector 's 2008 election cycle contributions .
The financial sector buttressed its political strength by placing Wall Street expatriates in top regulatory positions , including the post of Treasury Secretary held by two former Goldman Sachs chairs , Robert Rubin and Henry Paulson .
Financial firms employed a legion of lobbyists , maintaining nearly 3,000 separate lobbyists in 2007 alone .
These companies drew heavily from government in choosing their lobbyists .
Surveying 20 leading financial firms , " Sold Out " finds 142 of the lobbyists they employed from 1998 - 2008 were previously high - ranking officials or employees in the Executive Branch or Congress .

The story of the movement , led by Dr Kai Frobel , that set out to save the wildlife of the no-man 's - land created in Europe by the Iron Curtain .
When communism crumbled in 1989 , it created an opportunity for wildlife .
The Iron Curtain that divided communist Eastern Europe from the capitalist West had created a no - man 's - land protected by barbed wire and minefields - a last haven for many rare animals and plants .
This film tells the story of the movement , led by biologist Dr Kai Frobel , that set out to save the wildlife of this precious strip .
Now as we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Iron Curtain , we can also celebrate the birth of the biggest conservation movement in the world , a ribbon of life stretching 13,000 kilometres across Europe , protecting everything from bears and wolverines in Finland to rare eagles in Bulgaria .
Still , the proceedings were a bit of a letdown .
After all the anticipation  some reporters had begun lining up outside the courthouse at 5:30 in the morning  it was a perfunctory affair , completed in an hour .
Much of it was legal boilerplate .
Mr. Madoff was expressionless throughout ; when he read a statement recounting his crimes and expressing “ remorse , ” he sounded like a man reading a speech he had n’t bothered to rehearse .

Judge Denny Chin had made clear that he was not going to allow the Madoff guilty plea to turn into a Wailing Wall for the victims , so most of them stayed away .
Though Judge Chin allowed them to speak , he insisted they stick to the issue before the court : whether he should accept Mr. Madoff ’s guilty plea .
One woman argued that the judge should not and force a trial instead , for the “ opportunity to find out where the money is . ”
But of course there is no money  certainly nothing close to the supposed $ 60 billion plus he was “ investing . ”
That is the whole point of a Ponzi scheme : the fraudster uses money coming in from new investors to pay old investors , pretending that that is their gain .
Afterward , the TV cameras surrounded a woman named Sharon Lissauer .
She had not been wealthy , she said , but she ’s lost everything .
She did n’t know what she was going to do .
She was weeping .
It was hard not to feel sad for her  indeed , for all the victims of Mr. Madoff ’s evil - doing .
But one also has to wonder : what were they thinking ?
At a panel a month ago , put together by Portfolio magazine , Mr. Wiesel expressed , better than I ’ve ever heard it , why people gave Mr. Madoff their money .
“ I remember that it was a myth that he created around him , ” Mr. Wiesel said , “ that everything was so special , so unique , that it had to be secret .
It was like a mystical mythology that nobody could understand . ”
Mr. Wiesel added : “ He gave the impression that maybe 100 people belonged to the club .
Now we know thousands of them were cheated by him . ”
And yet , just about anybody who actually took the time to kick the tires of Mr. Madoff ’s operation tended to run in the other direction .
James R. Hedges IV , who runs an advisory firm called LJH Global Investments , says that in 1997 he spent two hours asking Mr. Madoff basic questions about his operation .
“ The explanation of his strategy , the consistency of his returns , the way he withheld information  it was a very clear set of warning signs , ” said Mr. Hedges .
When you look at the list of Madoff victims , it contains a lot of high - profile names  but almost no serious institutional investors or endowments .
They insist on knowing the kind of information Mr. Madoff refused to supply .
I suppose you could argue that most of Mr. Madoff ’s direct investors lacked the ability or the financial sophistication of someone like Mr. Hedges .
But it should n’t have mattered .
Is n’t the first lesson of personal finance that you should never put all your money with one person or one fund ?
Even if you think your money manager is “ God ” ?
Diversification has many virtues ; one of them is that you wo n’t lose everything if one of your money managers turns out to be a crook .
A man who raped women as an on -duty Los Angeles police officer , threatening them with arrest and jail if they did not submit , was hired by Los Angeles County as an X - ray technologist after he got out of prison , even though the job would leave him working alone and unsupervised with female patients .
His hiring at County - USC Medical Center a decade ago was not an oversight .
The man -- whose actions cost the city of Los Angeles nearly $ 300,000 in settlements for his victims -- disclosed his criminal history in his county job application .
Both the head of hospital human resources and a chief aide then signed papers that said there was no reason his convictions for rape should prevent him from doing the job , according to newly obtained records and interviews .
It would not be the last time managers in the county health department would evaluate his criminal record .
Each time he was promoted , someone at a management level reviewed his history .
It was reviewed again in 2004 , when he transferred to Martin Luther King Jr. - Harbor Hospital , then known as Martin Luther King Jr. / Drew Medical Center .

County officials quietly fired Gariner Beasley , 48 , last August -- a month after The Times uncovered the widespread incidence of serious criminal histories among King ’s staff -- saying managers had erred repeatedly in allowing him to be hired and remain on the job .
The employment of a convicted rapist at a hospital indicates a significant breakdown in the county ’s vetting of health department staffers , county officials said .
Perhaps most seriously , it raises questions about how many more county employees have criminal histories incompatible with their jobs , something county supervisors have yet to address .
“ We had real pinheads working for us , ” said Supervisor Gloria Molina , referring to managers who cleared the hires .
The county , including Beasley , after the findings became public .
Details of his case were obtained by The Times after Beasley , who had no record of disciplinary problems as a county employee , appealed his termination from his $ 73,000 - a- year job and his name became public .
The disclosure of his identity allowed the first in - depth look at any of the 152 workers found to have criminal histories at King .

When The Times reported that 11 % of employees undergoing new background checks had criminal histories , Los Angeles County supervisors portrayed the management breakdown as isolated to King .
They offered only scant details of the offenses and blocked repeated efforts by The Times to obtain records identifying the crimes and job titles held by the former offenders , citing the employees ’ privacy rights .
But Supervisor Mark Ridley - Thomas , who took office in December , said the fact that Beasley was initially hired by County - USC officials demonstrated “ systemic ” failings .
He said county officials need to think hard about whether the criminal histories of employees at all health facilities need to be reexamined .
“ The public is right to expect the highest level of care at the county health facilities , ” Ridley - Thomas said , adding that he believes that county officials , to the fullest extent possible , should release information about the jobs and crimes of known offenders .

Beasley ’s history
The large - scale review of the King employees happened only because the hospital was being closed and its workers reassigned .
Criminal background checks on county employees occur only when someone is hired , promoted or transferred .
In Beasley ’s termination letter , Christopher Arevalo , King ’s interim chief executive , said Beasley ’s criminal convictions were “ incompatible ” with a job that left him alone with patients in “ very vulnerable and compromised positions . ”
Beasley ’s responsibilities , the letter noted , included interacting with obstetric and mammography patients .
His employment , Arevalo said , “ may very well potentially expose the county to liability and unnecessary scrutiny . . . and could jeopardize our health facilities ’ licensing / accreditation . ”

In an interview last summer , Supervisor Yvonne B. Burke acknowledged that one employee had been convicted of rape , but suggested the case might have been an instance of statutory rape between consenting teenagers .
But Beasley ’s case -- the only rape conviction identified by The Times -- was far different , according to court records and one of his victims .
The woman , now 46 , spoke on the condition that The Times identify her by her nickname Chee Chee .
At the time of the 1991 attack , she worked as a prostitute south of downtown Los Angeles .
Just after 6 a.m. one day , Beasley , in uniform , honked at her from his squad car as she walked on South Figueroa Street .

“ He yelled , ‘ Come here , I need to talk to you , ’ ” she said .
“ He said I had a $ 200,000 warrant on me , which was a total lie .
He said , ‘ You better give me something to make this go away . ’ ”
He ordered her into the passenger seat , removed his badge and drove her to a back alley where he popped the trunk so they would not be seen through the rear window , she said .
“ What he did to me was terrible , ” she said .
“ I just remember how he thought he was a great comedian , patting me on the knee after he was finished with me .
He said with a chuckle , ‘ Now , that was n’t so bad , was it ? ’
And there I was curled over in tears . ”
Beasley was arrested in January 1992 in connection with an assault on another woman , according to court records of his case .
In June 1992 , he was charged with assaulting four women .
In a deal with prosecutors , Beasley pleaded no contest to the rape under the color of authority of two women , including Chee Chee , according to court records .

He was sentenced to three years in prison and paroled in January 1994 .
That same year the city of Los Angeles paid Chee Chee and another victim $ 290,000 , with Deputy City Atty .
Cory Brente noting that “ there is clear legal precedent for the city being held liable for the acts of Officer Beasley . ”
Chee Chee said Beasley had been caught after he accidentally grazed a woman with a gunshot during another rape .
She said investigators looking into that incident began interviewing other women and she came forward .
“ Once he was no longer on the street , only then did I not fear him , ” she said .
The Times was unable to confirm Chee Chee ’s account of the shooting .
The transcript of his criminal proceedings has been destroyed , which court officials said is routine in non-death penalty cases more than a decade old .
The account Chee Chee gave of her assault was also detailed in the lawsuit the city settled 14 years ago .

Chee Chee said she was shocked to learn her rapist had been working for the county for years in a position that left him alone with female patients .
Marvin Mathis , who is representing Beasley in his termination appeal , said he will argue that Beasley should be reinstated because of his positive work evaluations .
“ It ’s just a tragedy .
He was a go - to person for the department .
They knew about his history .
Every time he was promoted or transferred , he filled out an application and disclosed it .
There was a discussion each time , ” Mathis said .

Data not provided
Mathis said he believes that Beasley may have been unfairly targeted because he is black .
“ We just think it ’s odd that the county is focused on cleaning up Martin Luther King hospital and not the others as well , ” he said .
County officials have declined to provide information that would shed light on managers ’ rationale for Beasley ’s hiring , promotion and transfer .

“ I really could n’t tell you , ” said John Schunhoff , interim director of the county ’s Department of Health Services .
“ I do n’t know . ”
A recent report by the county Auditor - Controller said some King employees with criminal histories were retained in part because managers took pity on their economic situation .
Schunhoff identified Human Resources Director David Zamorano and a lieutenant , Robert Navarro , as the County - USC officials who originally permitted Beasley ’s hiring despite his criminal history .
Both are now retired and could not be reached for comment .
No one has been disciplined for the handling of the case , and the county has not broadened its review of criminal histories beyond King since Beasley ’s case came to light , Schunhoff said .

Five county bureaucrats , ranging from very high - ranking to mid-level , privately said Supervisor Burke helped set the tone for hiring and retaining people with criminal histories when she campaigned to remove a question on county forms asking applicants if they had ever been convicted of a crime .
The 2006 effort to “ ban the box ” failed after Human Resources Director Mike Henry told the board of supervisors that he worried that criminal histories might fall through the cracks if they were not vetted upfront .
Burke , who represented the district that includes King until she retired in December , declined to comment for this story .
Her proposal , supported by state Sen. Gloria Romero , U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters , the American Civil Liberties Union and prisoner reentry programs , argued that criminal records should be disclosed later in the application process , after applicants had the opportunity to explain their abilities .

ACLU officials said their support for Burke ’s measure was never intended to clear the way for the county to employ someone with Beasley ’s record .
“ He clearly should not have been hired , ” said Eric Greene , senior policy advisor for the ACLU of Southern California .
“ In no way did we advocate hiring people whose crimes conflict with the job . ”
At the time of the 2006 debate , the possibility that a large number of people with criminal histories could make it past screeners seemed far - fetched .
“ I assume that the odds of anybody with a criminal record getting a job with anybody was slim or none , ” Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said at a board meeting .
“ I think most people probably feel the same way because otherwise , why are we asking ? ”

If you think all wrestling fans are 8 - year - olds and southerners , brace yourself for the flying clothesline of knowledge : many geeks love professional wrestling as well .
Smart people who obsess over comic books , and attend large conventions about said books , also enjoy the WWE .
As we approach Wrestlemania 25 this April , let us shine a spotlight on a wrestling demographic that gets overlooked .
Pro wrestler Jimmy Jacobs told MTV why he named his signature move " The Contra Code , " after a famous video game cheat code .
" I think wrestling just attracts a lot of nerds , " he said .
In college , I was surprised when all my nerdy friends wanted to watch pro-wrestling .
At first , I thought they were just being ironic , but they knew all the player 's names and histories , the current story - lines , and were shelling out real money for the pay - per - view matches .
That 's true devotion .
So why do some nerds enjoy wrestling ?
I think there are lots of reasons .
Like superhero comics , wrestling is a soap opera about muscle - bound " heroes " and " villains , " with larger than life personalities , fighting a seemingly endless battle .
For a group stereotyped as introverted weaklings , seeing these guys in action over - exaggerates the definition of manhood to the point where nerds can enjoy it .
Wrestling is driven by written narratives rather than stats and strength , which appeals to a dork 's love of story speculation .
Nerds want to predict what 'll happen on Lost and figure out what the next Star Trek movie is about based on rumors .
Week after week , wrestling evolves its characters and takes them in odd directions , like when Hulk Hogan famously did a " heel turn " and became a bad guy in the mid-90's .
There 's also plenty of merchandise to collect , including action figures and video games , and the WWE universe is vast and full of details to memorize .
Taking all these factors into account , pro-wrestling is actually the perfect nerd sport .
Now that I 've started watching , I 'm kind of hooked .
My favorite wrestler is Santino Marella , the Italian villain who only wins matches by accident or with the help of his girlfriend Beth Phoenix .
I just read his Wikipedia page and made him my desktop background .

Andrew Malcolm has a particularly nasty piece in the Los Angeles Times about a visit Michelle Obama made to Miriam ’s Kitchen , a food pantry and soup kitchen near the White House .
When I first saw the headline , “ Michelle Obama Serves Food to D.C. Poor and Homeless , But … ” I assumed that this was going to be some kind of hit piece on the First Lady , with the “ But … ” referring to something she said that the press could seize on as a gaffe , or to something she might have worn , like maybe a sleeveless dress .
But that was not it at all .
Malcolm had no critical words whatsoever for Mrs. Obama .
It was the impoverished recipients of the food aid that he attacked .
And in a singularly vicious way .
He sets the reader up with a straightforward recounting of Michelle Obama ’s visit , bringing food from the White House , serving it up to the men and women there , her comments about the importance of doing this kind of volunteer work , etc. , etc. — and then , after this very mild , innocuous lead - in , Malcolm saves these three short paragraphs for the end :
It does n’t detract from the first lady ’s generous gesture or the real needs she seeks to highlight to ask two bothersome journalistic questions about these news photos :
If this unidentified meal recipient is too poor to buy his own food , how does he afford a cellphone ?
And if he is homeless , where do they send the cellphone bills ?
Can it really , actually be that Andrew Malcolm , “ [ a ] veteran foreign and national correspondent [ who ] served on the Times Editorial Board and was a Pulitzer finalist in 2004 , ” who has written 10 nonfiction books and raised four children , and who looks to be quite of the age one would have to be to have accomplished all of those things , has never heard of pay - as - you - go phones ?
I have a Go Phone .
The phone cost $ 15 .
There is no contract or monthly payment plan .
There are no bills .
You load the phone with a $ 15 or $ 25 card and pay only for the minutes you use .
When the money is used up , you can reload the phone , or not , as you choose .
You only need to pay $ 25 every 90 days to keep the phone activated .
And if you can’t , and the phone is deactivated , no problem : six months or a year later , or whenever , if you get through the hard times , you can buy another prepaid phone for $ 15 .
You do n’t get second and third notices to pay your bill , you do n’t get thrown into collections , you do n’t get into debt .
If you have the money you can use the phone ; if you do n’t , you do n’t have to , with no repercussions .
Now , it does not ( or should not ) take an Einstein to figure out that housing and food cost much much more than a $ 15 prepaid cellphone .
And anyone who thinks that having a prepaid $ 15 phone with $ 15 or $ 20 worth of minutes on it means that you have the ability to pay $ 800 or $ 1,000 or more for a rental apartment or a mortgage , and pay hundreds of dollars a month for groceries , is out of their minds .
Or , to put it in a slightly different way , anyone who thinks that a $ 15 prepaid cellphone is the reason a homeless or poor person cannot afford to buy food on a regular basis or pay the rent on an apartment is both insane and hopelessly stupid .

Editor 's note :
This story is part of an ongoing series of profiles CNN is doing about economic survival in this time of financial crisis .
Married couple Lindsay De Vore and Eliot Kohan on their delayed honeymoon to Orlando , Florida .
( CNN ) --
At age 23 and fresh out of college , Eliot Kohan was diagnosed with an aggressive form of leukemia .
He was told he had four months to live .
He survived .
But the disease left him and his wife , Lindsay De Vore , who live in St. Paul , Minnesota , saddled with thousands of dollars of medical bills on top of their student loans and daily expenses .
But their struggles taught them an important lesson in saving money .
" When you have medical issues , it 's easy to spiral into some sort of depression , " the 26 - year - old a technology analyst for a private contracting company in St. Paul said .
" My goal was to keep moving forward .
I wanted to create some stability for our us . "
All of that hard work saving for the past few years has paid off .
The couple is elated to be closing next month on their first home in St. Paul , thanks to the troubled economy .
De Vore and Kohan first told their story on CNN's iReport.com .
Share your economic survivor story with CNN .
The timing could n't have been better for the couple to purchase a modest three - bedroom , one - story stucco house .
De Vore and Kohan locked into a historically low mortgage rate of 4.9 percent this month .
The couple selected a foreclosed home , slashing nearly $ 20,000 off the final price .
" We would n't have been able to buy this house if the economy were n't the way it is , " said De Vore , 25 , who works in the financial aid office at a private college in St. Paul .
" We were in the perfect position . "
There were more than 300,000 foreclosure filings reported nationwide in December , marking a 17 percent increase from the previous month and a 41 percent increase from December 2007 , according to RealtyTrac , a foreclosure listing service .
Meanwhile , unemployment continues to climb to rates unseen in decades .
Yet the rocky economy is having a positive effect on some Americans , who are finding it the ideal time to buy a home .
Similar to many married couples , Kohan and De Vore envisioned owning a house perhaps two or three years down the road , they say .
Soon the couple says they noticed interest rates and home prices dipping so low that they found themselves nabbing a home as soon as they could afford the down payment .
But the couple 's ability to afford their first home is a story about fiscal responsibility , patience and determination .
De Vore and Kohan , who met in their freshman year at St. Paul 's Hamline University in 2002 , moved into a two - bedroom apartment during their last year of college .
For the past five years , they have remained in the same collegiate apartment , furnished with Craigslist finds and family hand - me - downs .
" Money was a reason we 've stayed here so long , " Kohan said last week , bundled up with his wife because their apartment 's heater broke .
" But at a certain point , we felt like we were growing out of it in more ways than just physically .
We wanted a change of pace . "
The couple says they 've always been tight with money , keeping credit card usage limited to emergencies and being picky about what they spend their money on .
But they became more " money - conscious " in June 2006 , when Kohan was diagnosed with leukemia .
He needed a costly stem cell transplant , and the couple did not have enough money .
The sickness was evident in his frail face and bruised body .
Luckily , when he went on leave from his job , his employers offered to hold his position until he recovered .
Back in his hometown of Fergus Falls , a small city in western Minnesota , Kohan 's family and friends threw a benefit , raising $ 12,000 toward the costly medical bills .
He soon recovered , but the experience forced him to refocus his goals in life , including buying a house ..
The couple began saving in small ways .
They bring their lunch to work and eat out only once or twice a month .
They cut extra expenses that many couples in their 20s enjoy , such as nights at bars with friends and date nights to the movie theater .
To save on gas money , Kohan takes public transportation , a 45 - minute bus ride each way , to downtown Minneapolis for work .
" The house was a big motivation , " says De Vore , who tracks their expenses meticulously each month .
When the couple married a year after his leukemia diagnosis , she opted for a small , intimate wedding .
That helped cut costs too , she said .
They waited nearly nine months before heading on their honeymoon trip .
Instead of a grand trip abroad , they settled for a smaller trip to Orlando , Florida .
Knowing that higher education would help her earn more , De Vore is taking night classes to earn her master 's degree in student affairs .
Her tuition is free because she chose to attend the university where she works .
By December , the couple began to realize all the saving had amounted to a down payment on a home .
They wanted to invest in a home for at least 10 years , they say , so they can try to build equity .
De Vore found the home through a real estate agent on her lunch break one afternoon in early January .
It was " nothing fancy , " she says , but the 1960s ranch - style house had a spacious kitchen and a small yard with enough space for a dog that they want .
She knew instantly that it would be their new home , she says .
" We worked hard .
We did n't cut corners , " she said .
" We did everything we did to get here , and it 's worth it , to our opinion . "
All About National Economy
Right now , the final frontier of space is only open to a select few .
But in the coming decades , you wo n't need to be a supersoldier to go into orbit .
You 'll just need your wallet .

On the 1st of February , 2003 , America 's first operational space shuttle , the Columbia , broke up over the skies of Texas , leading to the deaths of the seven crew members on board .
An analysis of the crash in the weeks afterward revealed that damage caused by a foam strike on the orbiter 's wing allowed plasma into the internal structure of the shuttle , reducing its integrity and leading to disaster .
This disaster , much like the 1986 one that destroyed Space Shuttle Challenger during lift - off , has fueled debate as to the viability of crewed spaceflight , a debate that is sure to continue .
It also revealed a number of problems within the space program , namely that the shuttle fleet is overworked and outdated .
Using shuttles continuously as one of the only ways into orbit in the US can be detrimental - and that 's why we 're seeing so many people seeking out spaceflight alternatives in the private sector .

Currently , almost all of the United State 's space flight activities are projects headed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , and in their relatively short history , they have undertaken a number of incredible feats - sending people to space , landing on the moon six times , maintaining two space stations and launching satellites that have increased our knowledge of our surroundings in the galaxy .
However , NASA is largely unequipped to handle the growing demand for commercial space endeavors such as satellite launches and tourism because they 've focused mainly on scientific and exploration missions .
NASA 's original charter , The National Aeronautics and Space Act , established NASA in 1958 , just as space flight was beginning with the launch of the Soviet Union 's Sputnik 1 .
In a move to catch up with the Russians and close the perceived gap in technology and security , NASA 's mission was laid out in the first sections of the bill :
DECLARATION OF POLICY AND PURPOSE
Sec. 102 . ( d) The aeronautical and space activities of the United States shall be conducted so as to contribute materially to one or more of the following objectives : ( 1 ) The expansion of human knowledge of the Earth and of phenomena in the atmosphere and space ;
(2) The improvement of the usefulness , performance , speed , safety , and efficiency of aeronautical and space vehicles ;
(3) The development and operation of vehicles capable of carrying instruments , equipment , supplies , and living organisms through space ;
(4) The establishment of long - range studies of the potential benefits to be gained from , the opportunities for , and the problems involved in the utilization of aeronautical and space activities for peaceful and scientific purposes ;
(5) The preservation of the role of the United States as a leader in aeronautical and space science and technology and in the application thereof to the conduct of peaceful activities within and outside the atmosphere ;
(6) The making available to agencies directly concerned with national defense of discoveries that have military value or significance , and the furnishing by such agencies , to the civilian agency established to direct and control nonmilitary aeronautical and space activities , of information as to discoveries which have value or significance to that agency ;
(7) Cooperation by the United States with other nations and groups of nations in work done pursuant to this Act and in the peaceful application of the results thereof ;
(8) The most effective utilization of the scientific and engineering resources of the United States , with close cooperation among all interested agencies of the United States in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort , facilities , and equipment ; and
(9) The preservation of the United States preeminent position in aeronautics and space through research and technology development related to associated manufacturing processes .
While NASA 's charter does indicate that it should encourage commercial enterprises , the focus of the agency has largely been one of exploration .
Crewed missions to space brought back a wealth of knowledge flight after flight , while missions to the moon helped to piece together some of the secrets of the solar system 's origins , while even today , robotic missions to the outer planets have reported back the existence of water on Mars , and the mineral compositions of our nearest neighbors .

In the 1970s was a shift in focus from the lunar landings that heralded the birth of NASA .
David Hitt , in his book Homesteading Space , notes :
Developed in the shadow of the Apollo moon missions and using hardware originally created for Apollo , the Skylab space station took the nation 's astronauts from being space explorers to being space residents .
Advertisement
Where the Lunar landings were somewhere between politics and genuine scientific exploration , Skylab was the turning point , when it was launched in 1973 .
The idea of living in space would continue through the six - year lifespan of the Skylab space station to the birth of the Space Shuttle to today 's International Space Station .
Trying to maintain the pace of its missions , NASA had to strain its resources to undertake commercial endeavors .
From early on , private companies such as AT&T have used NASA to launch their own commercial satellites , and that is a policy that has continued through to today .
While the US Military also launches a bulk of commercial satellites , there are other problems with the agency as well .
As NASA 's budget gets further cut down as the economy worsens , job cuts have begun to force people away from the agency , including some higher level members , such as Martin Kress , who left his position at NASA as Deputy Director of the Glenn Research Center for National Space Science and Technology Center in Huntsville , Alabama .
In his statement that was released by NASA , he noted that " The world is changing rapidly , and I see an opportunity for doing some very innovative things at the National Space Science and Technology Center " ( Source ) Innovation here is a key element , and is something that is difficult within such a large bureaucratic structure such as NASA .
Private companies have already proven that they can accomplish much the same tasks as NASA , but at a much lower cost .

Even as the military also launches satellites , the demand has placed a burden on the launch capabilities of NASA .
According to Science Fiction author Allen M. Steele , in his testimony to the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics in 2001 , commercial enterprise had led to the Challenger disaster :
As stated before , NASA is ill - suited for dealing with commercial space enterprise .
This was demonstrated during the early 1980s , when the demands of the satellite launch industry contributed in part ot the circumstances which led to the Challenger disaster ; the Reagan administration responded by barring Commercial payloads from the space shuttle fleet .
More recently , we 've also seen the indecision over the purpose of the International Space Station ; no one could decide whether the ISS should be a government R&D lab , a commercial space outpost , or neither or both .
As a result , the ISS has been redesigned several times , causing enormous construction overruns .

In his testimony , Steele argues that the creation of a federal agency devoted to private space enterprise is needed .
While NASA maintains a busy schedule of scientific missions and its own launch capabilities , this agency would encourage private space flight interests .
This has yet to happen , but there has been considerable development in private space flight , most obviously with SpaceShipOne 's dramatic capture of the Ansari X - Price in October of 2004 .
There are many commercial alternatives to NASA which are in their early stages .
These companies , and the ones that are likely to follow , will be essential in easing the burden that has been placed upon NASA 's aging space fleet .
They will likely do this by taking control of the more routine tasks in space :
Delivering crews to their destinations , bringing up consumables and equipment to those crews , and servicing satellites in orbit .
In this scenario , we would likely see NASA 's duties shift to what they have traditionally been : science and exploration , rather than an all - encompassing service for ferrying everything into space .

We can see the shift towards commercialization already with Richard Branson 's Virgin Galactic , which is considered the first spaceliner .
In the four years since Virgin Galactic tickets went on sale to the general public , over two hundred have been sold , at over $ 100,000 each .
The price is likely to drop after that , but this highlights the demand for a space tourism industry .
Branson 's company has the right idea , and has signed contracts with Spaceport America , the first commercial spacesport , which is currently under construction .
It was recently announced that a sister spaceport , Spaceport Sweden , would also sign contracts with Branson 's Virgin Galactic .

The demand for commercial spaceflight exists beyond tourism of course .
Another privately owned company , Space Exploration Technologies Corporation ( Space X ) , made history last year when it launched the first commercial rocket into orbit , the Falcon 1 .
Founded by Elon Musk , the creator of PayPal , the company has been working to create a low - cost alternative to deliver payloads to space .
According to Musk :
Satellites and spacecraft urgently need a more reliable and cost effective launch vehicle than the options available today .
SpaceX is confident that our Falcon rocket will achieve that end in the near future .
In only nine months we 've designed , built and initiated testing of our rocket 's main engine , which is a testament to the capability and determination of the SpaceX team to deliver on promised goals in record time .

After several failed launches , the first successful Space X flight was in September of 2008 , with another launch scheduled for 2009 .
In addition to these unmanned rockets , the company has announced the plans for the Dragon , a crewed module .
Additionally , NASA announced in 2006 that it was awarding a contract with the company to provide resupply missions for the International Space Station .
According to the company 's website , there are already twenty - five planned missions on both the Falcon and Dragon vehicles , performing duties for both public and private interests .
With the grounding of the space shuttle fleet projected for 2010 , the United States will need to rely on foreign powers such as Russia or the European Space Agency to resupply the International Space Station , a costly affair that will likely draw criticism from taxpayers .
Companies such as Virgin Galactic and Space X both fill a growing need for alternative launch capabilities , and will likely be at the forefront of future space exploration .
After all , there are entire worlds to be explored , and numerous commercial possibilities .

In the meantime , there is certainly evidence of what haste does to a program such as NASA , when safety is inadvertently compromised in order to meet a packed schedule .
NASA is essentially the sole means to get cargo into orbit , but it cannot remain so .
Explorers and entrepreneurs will seek out alternative means of sending equipment and humans into space , and shifting this burden to the commercial sector makes sense .
This is especially true because private companies can fund their own hardware - this takes the burden off the taxpayers , who only really see the failures of the space program , and not its enormous benefits .
Eventually , the private sector will reveal the true benefits of space travel , which is n't just economic , as satellites such as Hubble continually show us .
Engineers in the south of France are working on a car that they hope will radically change the way motorist fuel their vehicles .
It is powered by compressed air , emits zero pollution – from the exhaust - pipe at least – costs one euro per fill - up and boasts a top speed of 70 kilometres per hour .
President Barack Obama is poised to offer an olive branch to Cuba in an effort to repair the US 's tattered reputation in Latin America .
The White House has moved to ease some travel and trade restrictions as a cautious first step towards better ties with Havana , raising hopes of an eventual lifting of the four - decade - old economic embargo .
Several Bush - era controls are expected to be relaxed in the run-up to next month 's Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago to gild the president 's regional debut and signal a new era of " Yankee " cooperation .
The administration has moved to ease draconian travel controls and lift limits on cash remittances that Cuban - Americans can send to the island , a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of families .
" The effect on ordinary Cubans will be fairly significant .
It will improve things and be very welcome , " said a western diplomat in Havana .
The changes would reverse hardline Bush policies but not fundamentally alter relations between the superpower and the island , he added .
" It just takes us back to the 1990s . "
The provisions are contained in a $ 410 bn ( £ 290 bn ) spending bill due to be voted on this week .
The legislation would allow Americans with immediate family in Cuba to visit annually , instead of once every three years , and broaden the definition of immediate family .
It would also drop a requirement that Havana pay cash in advance for US food imports .
" There is a strong likelihood that Obama will announce policy changes prior to the summit , " said Daniel Erikson , director of Caribbean programmes at the Inter - American Dialogue and author of The Cuba Wars .
" Loosening travel restrictions would be the easy thing to do and defuse tensions at the summit . "
Latin America , once considered Washington's " backyard " , has become newly assertive and ended the Castro government 's pariah status .
The presidents of Brazil , Chile , Dominican Republic , Ecuador and Guatemala have recently visited Havana to deepen economic and political ties .
Brazil 's president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , is expected to tell Obama on a White House visit this week that the region views the US embargo as anachronistic and vindictive .
Easing it would help mend Washington 's strained relations with the " pink tide " of leftist governments .
Obama 's proposed Cuba measures would only partly thaw a policy frozen since John F Kennedy tried to isolate the communist state across the Florida Straits .
" It would signal new pragmatism , but you would still have the embargo , which is the centrepiece of US policy , " said Erikson .
Wayne Smith at the Centre for International Policy , Washington DC , said : " I think that the Obama administration will go ahead and lift restrictions on travel of Cuban Americans and remittance to their families .
He may also lift restrictions on academic travel .
" There are some things that could be done very easily - for example it 's about time we took Cuba off the terrorist list .
It 's the beginning of the end of the policies we have had towards Cuba for 50 years .
It 's achieved nothing , it 's an embarrassment . "
Wayne Smith , a former head of the US Interest Section in Havana , famously said Cuba had the same effect on American administrations as the full moon had on werewolves .
Cuban exiles in Florida , a crucial voting bloc in a swing state , sustained a hardline US policy towards Havana even as the cold war ended and the US traded with other undemocratic nations with much worse human rights records .
To Washington 's chagrin , the economic stranglehold did not topple Fidel Castro .
When Soviet Union subsidies evaporated , the " maximum leader " implemented savage austerity , opened the island to tourism and found a new sponsor in Venezuela 's petrol - rich president , Hugo Chávez .
When Fidel fell ill in 2006 , power transferred seamlessly to his brother Raúl .
He cemented his authority last week with a cabinet reshuffle that replaced " Fidelistas " with " Raúlistas " from the military .
Recognising Castro continuity , and aghast at European and Asian competitors getting a free hand , US corporate interests are impatient to do business with Cuba .
Oil companies want to drill offshore , farmers to export more rice , vegetables and meat , construction firms to build infrastructure projects .
Young Cuban exiles in Florida , less radical than their parents , have advocated ending the policy of isolation .
As a senator , Obama opposed the embargo , but as a presidential candidate he supported it - and simultaneously promised engagement with Havana .
A handful of hardline anti-Castro Republican and Democrat members of Congress have threatened to derail the $ 410 bn spending bill unless the Cuba provisions are removed , but most analysts think the legislation will survive .
Compared to intractable challenges in Afghanistan , Pakistan and the Middle East , the opportunity for quick progress on Cuba has been called the " low - hanging fruit " of US foreign policy .
That Obama has moved so cautiously has frustrated many reformers .
But after decades of freeze , even a slight thaw is welcome , and there is speculation that more will follow .
Old enemies
President Kennedy imposed an economic and trade embargo on Cuba on 7 February 1962 after Fidel Castro 's government expropriated US property on the island .
Known by Cubans as el bloqueo , the blockade , elements have been toughened and relaxed under succeeding US presidents .
Exceptions have been made for food and medicine exports .
George Bush added restrictions on travel and remittances .
The sanctions regime
• No Cuban products or raw materials may enter the US
• US companies and foreign subsidiaries banned from trade with Cuba
• Cuba must pay cash up front when importing US food
• Ships which dock in Cuba may not dock in the US for six months
• US citizens banned from spending money or receiving gifts in Cuba without special permission , in effect a travel ban
• Americans with family on the island limited to one visit every three years .
MOSCOW – Prime Minister Vladimir Putin warned that Russia would cut natural gas to Ukraine if it was n’t paid by a Saturday deadline , a threat that revived worries aboutsupply cuts to Europe .
Ukraine ’s national gas company told The Associated Press that payment would come by the end of Thursday .
Ukraine ’s ability to pay has been undermined by a severe economic crisis .
Clouding the situation , Ukraine ’s national security service searched the offices of the gas company , Naftogaz , on Wednesday in a raid seen as part of a political fight between the president and prime minister that could hinder payments to Russia .
Comments on California Assembly member Ammiano's marijuana tax bill , AB 390 ( as introduced )
The problems begin early , in fact with the title of the bill itself - the term " marijuana " is slang and should not be used in legislation .
The proper terminology would incorporate all of the words cannabis , sativa , indica and ruderalis .
The definition offered in the bill only includes sativa .
Much worse are all the new crimes created and the fact that cannabis actually remains illegal except when obtained through state authorized channels .
Deepening the offense , the idea that cannabis should be treated like alcohol and only allowed for age 21 years and up is just flat wrong and certainly unenforceable .
Even killer tobacco is available to 18 year olds .
Further , alcohol kills thousands in a variety of ways .
No such harm has come to millions of regular cannabis consumers , except at the hands of their own government .
Cannabis is SAFER than alcohol and it is a slippery slope to allow cannabis to be classified in the same category .
So let 's wade into the bill 's text to unravel this unholy 59 page proposed new law .
Section 1 begins well enough and would be complete with just subsection ( a ) , which states : " To legalize marijuana and its derivatives . "
Regrettably it is mostly downhill from there .
Subsection ( b ) says that 18,19 and 20 year olds are not adults and makes them into a whole new batch of criminals if they have anything at all to do with cannabis .
Hope subsides upon reading subsection ( c ) , which requires federal permission for any of the law to be valid anyway .
So much for states rights .
Next , subsection ( d ) funds drug war propaganda and treatment centers with a " substantial fee " on the " legal sale " of marijuana .
To clarify what " legal sale " may mean subsection ( e ) seeks to " impose a set of regulations and laws concerning marijuana comparable to those imposed on alcohol . "
This means licenses , background checks and restrictions on a plant that has never killed anyone , unlike alcohol .
This apples and oranges comparison perpetuates the lie that cannabis is a " dangerous drug " and puts unreasonable restrictions on private citizens .
The people that pay the tax should benefit from it with reduced fees for government services , assistance with research and development , small business loans and services that benefit the cannabis consumers .
Pot smokers do n't cause alcoholism or drug addiction and should not be forced to pay for the treatment of those who become addicted to the products of drug , alcohol and tobacco corporations .
The magnitude of damage this bill could do only begins to come into focus deep into the language , but a hint is seen in subsection ( f ) " To impose substantial fines for violations of the noncommercial regulations and laws concerning marijuana , which will be applicable until and after commercial marijuana is available by virtue of future changes in federal law . "
So there you have it - marijuana is even more illegal than it was , unless obtained from a state licensed retailer , who must get it from a state licensed wholesaler , who must get it from a state licensed producer .
Subsection ( g ) seems to be pro-reform , but look closely and note there are still " crimes related to marijuana " .... " in this bill .
" Exempting industrial hemp and medical marijuana from the tax in subsection ( h ) seems unfair .
This is like saying gala apples are taxed but fuji apples are not .
It does n't make sense .
If there is a to be a tax on cannabis , let all who benefit from the plant pay their fair share .
The subsection ( i ) legislation authorizing state funded lobbyists to Washington DC is a waste of taxpayer resources .
We have elected representatives and their staff to do this on our behalf already .
States do not need to " encourage the federal government " to do anything other than respect states rights .
Sections 2 and 3 set up the tax and licensing regime that must be complied with to avoid prosecution .
First year applicants must pay $ 5,000 ( $ 2,500 annual renewal ) and submit to a background check , however no guidance is offered as to whom the " department " may consider worthy of the license .
The state 's power increases with " significant fees " and " regulations " to enforce .
These regulations , fees and taxes cover " all stages of cultivation , harvesting , drying , processing , packing , and delivery " .
This seems to be taking things out of order .
Before we start taxing pot smokers let 's stop prosecuting them and work on making restitution for the harm done by the government 's dishonesty and outright hostility to cannabis consumers .
It is really insulting to suggest cannabis consumers agree to any kind of taxation until after the government has ceased its declared war on them and made restitution for harm done .
Section 4 falls far short of the reparations needed in order for the government to earn back the peoples trust on this matter .
Many have been badly burned by the hostile actions of government agents and agencies .
This bit of window dressing to address the stigma created by records of past legal issues is a step in the right direction , albeit a very small one .
Section 5 seems to further extend government control and tax authority to include every possible market segment from bongs to baggies to growing supplies and equipment .
Section 6 modifies Schedule I of the controlled substance list by removing the terms " marijuana " and " Tetrahydrocannabinols " , which is replaced by " Synthetic tetrahydrocannabinols not derived from cannabis plants .
Synthetic equivalents of the substances contained in the plant , or in the resinous extractives of Cannabis , sp. and / or synthetic substances , derivatives , and their isomers with similar chemical structure and pharmacological activity such as the following : delta 1 cis or trans tetrahydrocannabinol , and their optical isomers ; delta 6 cis or trans tetrahydrocannabinol , and their optical isomers ; delta 3,4 cis or trans tetrahydrocannabinol , and its optical isomers .
( Since nomenclature of these substances is not internationally standardized , compounds of these structures , regardless of numerical designation of atomic positions covered ) . "
Does this mean Marinol is now Schedule I and exempt from the new tax ?
Section 7 establishes the punishments for 18,19 and 20 year olds who use cannabis , especially on school grounds .
Sections 8,9 , 10 and 11 repeal three laws that made cannabis illegal .
Hooray !
These are keepers .
Section 12 further codifies the restrictions on every market possibly related to cannabis .
In short , everything is illegal , unless the state grants an applicant permission , based on fees , a background check and proof of financial resources to sufficient satisfy their requirements for security etc.
Section 13 exempts felons and others with previous legal trouble from eligibility for a state license to retail , wholesale or produce marijuana .
This would be unfair to those who have been unfairly prosecuted for cannabis in the past and will likely restrict the industry to a select few .
Section 14 clarifies that every asset is subject to forfeiture for violation of any of these laws .
This devastating practice is often used in place of legal proceedings to persecute individuals and prevent them from fighting back .
Section 15 authorizes law enforcement officials to destroy any amount of a " suspected controlled substance " over 10 pounds .
Later , when it is time to return the victims property , much of it is likely to have been destroyed by hostile government agents .
Section 16 repeals property rights of owners .
Section 17 instructs any peace officer , subsequent to making or attempting to make an arrest , to " notify the Franchise Tax Board of a seizure where there is reasonable cause to believe that the value of the seized property exceeds five thousand dollars ( $ 5,000 ) . "
Yep , the government always gets their share , legal or not .
Section 18 modifies the H&S code to remove marijuana and hashish " drug paraphernalia " from consideration as items that create " probable cause " for illegal drug dealing .
In other words , having a pipe or bong is no longer evidence that the person was dealing .
This seems like a keeper .
Section 19 removes marijuana and hashish from the list of prohibited " drug paraphernalia " and language banning cultivation , possession or sale of marijuana .
This is a keeper .
Section 20 removes marijuana from the list of controlled substances that a person can be sued for damages related to abuse .
This seems like a keeper .
Section 21 adds an incomplete definition of what " marijuana " is and sets forth conditions under which it is " lawful " and ( still ) " unlawful " to do anything regarding cannabis .
Highlights include 11725 ( c ) sets a 10 - plant limit per person and 11725 ( d ) authorizes a nursery to cultivate and sell " seedlings " but clones are not mentioned .
11725 ( e ) forbids the nursery from growing any plants to maturity and may ONLY sell seedlings , no marijuana .
11727 seems to exempt industrial hemp and hemp products .
Section 22 adds " Marijuana Fees " to the Revenue and Taxation Code .
It exempts industrial hemp and medicinal marijuana from said fees .
It also establishes the initial fee of $ 50 per ounce , which is subject to review but not to an increase .
The money goes into a special account to fund drug war propaganda and treatment centers .
Sections 22 , 23 and 24 amend the motor vehicle code to remove some penalties related to marijuana possession .
Further study is needed here .
It is premature to treat marijuana intoxication or the presence of its active compounds as impairment when driving or operating machinery .
( Some evidence suggests the opposite . )
It ’s bad policy to agree to this knee jerk reaction just for the sake of " baby - steps . "
Science should guide policy , not unproven presumptions based on drug war propaganda .
In summary , it is good the debate has been energized , and there are a few good things about this bill .
Here is my proposed revised bill language : THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS : SECTION 1 .
It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this , the Marijuana Control , Regulation , and Education Act , to do all of the following : (a ) To legalize cannabis sativa , indica and ruderalis and its derivatives .
(b)
To remove all existing civil and criminal penalties ( c )

Smith said Brim was accused of exiting a bus while he was on duty at about 2:30 p.m. Feb. 28 and punching Officer Tyrone Hardy , who was wearing a McGruff costume , in the head .
Brim drove away in his bus but was soon stopped by police and told the officers he had struck Hardy " to be funny , " Smith said .
Police said several young people witnessed the attack .
Brim has been charged with misdemeanor assault .

Found this vintage 10 minute short film and thought it had some relevance to the issues we see in the economy today .
This country allowed politicians to sell them a load of crap back then , and nowadays it looks as if we are bellying up to trough for another helping .
By Robert Pigott
Religious Affairs correspondent
John Hunt was baptised in the parish church of St Jude with St Aidan in Thornton Heath in south - east London .
But 50 years later he stands outside and regards its brick facade without much affection .
Baptism represents death and rebirth for Christians Mr Hunt was then sent to Sunday school in west London and later to confirmation classes , but he decided early on that he had no place in what he felt was a hypocritical organisation .
He recalls that his mother had to get lunch ready early for him to attend the classes .
" One Sunday I came back home and said ' Mum , you need n't get lunch early next Sunday because I 'm not going to the class any more ' .
And she decided not to argue . "
Now Mr
Hunt has become the pioneer in a rejuvenated campaign for a way of cancelling baptisms given to children too young to decide for themselves whether they wanted this formal initiation into Christianity .
However , baptism is proving a difficult thing to undo .
The local Anglican diocese , Southwark , refused to amend the baptismal roll as Mr Hunt had wanted , on the grounds that it was a historical record .
" You can't remove from the record something that actually happened , " said the Bishop of Croydon , the Right Reverend Nick Baines .
Expunging Trotsky
" Whether we agree whether it should have happened or not is a different matter .
" But it 's a bit like trying to expunge Trotsky from the photos .
Mr Hunt was baptised and that 's a matter of public record . "
Instead the diocese suggested that the best way for Mr Hunt to renounce his baptism was to advertise it in the London Gazette , a journal of record with an ancestry going back to the 17th Century .
I reject all its creeds and other such superstitions , in particular the perfidious belief that any baby needs to be cleansed of original sin .... "
John Hunt Bishop Baines is willing to see such notices inserted into the baptismal roll to indicate decisions such as Mr Hunt's , but the Church of England 's national headquarters made clear that such a concession was not official policy .
A letter from the the Archbishops ' Council said that the Church of England did not regard baptism as a sign of membership , so any amendment to the record would be unnecessary .
The Roman Catholic Church does view a person 's baptism as incorporating them into the Church - and membership is later important to the Church if , for example , the same person wants to get married in a Catholic church .
It is willing to place an amendment in the record .
The National Secular Society would like the Church of England to devise a formal procedure for cancelling baptisms , with a change in the baptismal roll as part of it .
Debaptism certificate
In the face of resistance from the Church , the society has come up with a document of its own .
The " Certificate of Debaptism " has a deliberately home - made look , with its mock - official decoration and quasi- official language .
Sitting on a bench in the grounds of St Jude 's Church , John Hunt intoned the opening lines .
" I , John Geoffrey Hunt , having been subjected to the rite of Christian baptism in infancy ... hereby publicly revoke any implications of that rite .
I reject all its creeds and other such superstitions in particular the perfidious belief that any baby needs to be cleansed of original sin . "
The society 's president , Terry Sanderson , says the certificate is not designed to be taken too seriously , and he suggests displaying it in the loo .
However , he says , it has now been downloaded more that 60,000 times , and has taken on a life of its own .
" The debaptism certificate started out as a kind of satirical comment on the idea that you could be enrolled in a church before you could talk , but it seems to have taken off from there .
" People are beginning to take it seriously .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement " It was a comment originally , a rebuke to the Church if you like , but now it 's become something else entirely . "
Among those taking it seriously is a man whose son was baptised into the Roman Catholic Church by his former partner against his wishes .
" He now has custody of his son and wants to debaptise him " , says Mr Sanderson .
The Church wonders aloud why , if atheists and secularists believe baptism is so meaningless , they are letting it upset them .
Mr Hunt supplies his own answer .
" Evangelical noises are getting louder and louder .
" The recent change in European legislation has led to religious beliefs not being challenged at all , and there 's no limit at all on what anybody can claim as a valid religious belief .
" I think it 's important that more people speak out and say they do n't subscribe to the historic beliefs of the Church . "

Update : Apple has allowed the new version of Tweetie into the App Store .
To read about the comedian who accidentally caused the initial rejection , continue reading below .
Tweetie is a full - featured and popular Twitter client for the iPhone , and Apple recently rejected the latest version of the application because one of the top Twitter trends at the time Apple reviewed the update contained a swear word .
Specifically , the offensive and trending topic in question was “ # FuckItList . ”
Following ‘ trends ’ via
Tweetie is hardly a new feature in the program , and there are a number of other Twitter clients currently available that also had the same offensive topic on their trendlists .
This is clearly an obvious mistake on Apple ’s part , and hopefully they ’ll rectify it soon and allow Tweetie version 1.3 into the App Store .
Now its common for people to jump out of their seats anytime Apple rejects a program from the app store , and even more so in cases like this where the rejection is so obviously rooted in a misunderstanding .
The App Store is still relatively young and Apple is still working on getting some of the kinks out , but in a case as obviously transparent as this , Apple will hopefully fix it sooner than later .
What the hell is the “ FuckItList ” ?
Now you might be wondering what in the world is a “ FuckItList ” , and how in the hell did it manage to become one of the top trending topics on Twitter .
Well , as luck would have it , we happen to be big fans of the comedian who started it , Michael Ian Black .
Michael Ian Black , for those who have n’t had the pleasure , was a cast member on the hilarious early 90’s MTV sketch comedy show The State , and went on to star in the cult comedy film “ Wet Hot American Summer ” , and the short - lived Comedy Central series “ Stella ” .
But most people probably recognize him best as the sarcastic talking head from VH1 ’s “ I Love the 80’s ” .
( And the 70’s , 90’s , and millennium versions as well )
Anyways , on Twitter today , Michael Ian Black tweeted that he was creating a list of all the things he does n’t need to do before he dies .
An anti bucket list of sorts that he aptly titled the FuckItList .
Some of the initial items on the FuckItList included touring Europe ’s great cathedrals , learning about birds , and attending a MLB baseball game in every stadium .
Ian Black proceeded to ask his 71,000 followers to come up with their own FuckItLists , and they apparently responded en masse , causing the term “ # FuckItList ” to rise to the top on Twitter Trends .

WARNING !
This web page has disturbing information an graphic images due to the nature of violence acts against Buddhists around the world .
In no way do we seek to discredit or abuse any religion such as Islam or Christianity or any nationality .
The BFF wishes only to expose the reality of religious persecution in the past and present .
As a consequence to the continuing persecutions committed by many non-buddhists and ideologues around the world .
Let it be known that in the 21st century , many Buddhists continue to be martyred and experience great suffering , discrimination and tragedy because of their faith in the Dharma .
" Though in their ignorance many will curse and
abuse us and beat us with swords and staves ; we will endure it all . "
Lotus Sutra : 13
Since the days of Buddha 's ministry over 2,500 years ago , there have been attempts by non-buddhists to destroy the Dharma of wisdom and compassion .
In Buddha 's time , there were many who tried to kill or discredit him and his disciples as exemplified by Devadatta 's betrayal .
In the 10th century , as the result of the Muslim invasion of what is modern day Afghanistan , Pakistan and India , the Buddhist religion was viciously wiped out in an act of virtual genocide .
Throughout the ages the Buddhist religion experienced many purges in China , most notably in the 20th century .
In the 19th century , the European empires such as Great Britain and France had by political , military and economic coercion implanted their forms of Christianity on such countries like Sri Lanka , Burma and Vietnam .
In Tibet , the Dharma has been brutally oppressed since the Chinese invasion in the 1950s .
In North Korea the Dharma has been effectively exterminated since the 1950s due to the hard line communist government .
In the 1990s , in South Korea , the Buddhist faith has seen intimidation , vandalism of temples and the murder of monks by Catholics .
In Kampuchea during the 1970s , the Marxist Pol Pot regime exterminated most of Buddhist clergy .
As a result , in the 1990s , a flood of highly financed , Western Christian fundamentalists have poured into the country using fast talking and pushy salesmanship tactics to convert Buddhists with great success .

The six volunteers will live in cramped metal containers
What would you be prepared to do for money ?
For $ 6,500 ( £ 4,500 ) a month , to be precise ?
How about the following : locking yourself inside a small metal container for three months without any communication with the outside world , with electronic monitors attached to various parts of your body and with frozen baby food and cereal bars for breakfast , lunch and dinner ?
To add to the fun you 'll have five companions who will do everything possible to stop you trying to escape before the three months are up .
Meanwhile , from a control room outside , a team of scientists will monitor your every move checking for any signs that you are starting to crack up .
And banish all hope of finding solace through alcohol or tobacco .
Both are strictly forbidden .
Experiment
So it may come as something of a surprise to know that this well - paid , extreme version of Big Brother and The Weakest Link attracted 6,000 applicants from 40 countries .
It definitely will not be fun
Sergei Ryazansky
commander of mock spaceship
And next Tuesday the fun will begin for the six lucky people who were chosen to take part .
After a news conference and with cameras flashing they will walk to a collection of linked cylindrical containers inside a dreary building in Moscow , open the heavy hatch and disappear inside .
All in the name of an unprecedented experiment called Mars 500 which has been talked about for many years and is now finally happening .
The six volunteers from Russia , France and Germany believe they are playing a small part in the making of history by bringing the long - cherished goal of a manned mission to the planet Mars one step closer .
Conditions are cramped with only few home comforts
Using the current generation of rocket engines , a trip to the Red Planet and back could take up to two years ( compared with less than two weeks for a mission to the Moon ) .
So space agencies around the world vying to win the race to Mars have to be certain the next generation of astronauts will be able to withstand the psychological and physical trauma of extremely long periods of space travel .
' No fun ' The Mars 500 experiment here in Moscow will focus on the psychological difficulties of prolonged isolation and claustrophobia .
" It 's a real probability that a flight to Mars would fail if the very serious problem of isolation is not investigated first , " says Oliver Knickel , an army engineer from Germany who is one of the volunteer " astronauts " for the experiment .
" The impact of the isolation would almost certainly kill the crew on board . "
Whether the six volunteers taking part in the current experiment will come to blows is a moot point .
" It definitely will not be fun , " says Sergei Ryazansky , the commander of the mock spaceship .
" Each test subject [ volunteer ] has the right to go out at any moment but of course it will influence the whole experiment .
" So we will try to support him and make life for him better .
" Each crew member understands that it 's our goal to go all the way . "
Few comforts
And that will certainly not be easy judging by what we were allowed to see of the inside of the mock space - craft earlier this month .
You can be psychologically normal but some people may be claustrophobic or think something will happen
Cyrille Fournier , French volunteer
Its cheap , stripped - pine interior was mostly bare , although we were told this was because the scientific equipment had yet to be installed .
There were a few home comforts , including a large flatscreen TV , a plastic kettle and an empty fridge .
But overall it was cramped , airless and without windows .
The sleeping quarters are particularly small and apparently not well sound - proofed .
Each of the volunteers is allowed to bring one suitcase of personal belongings including books , music , DVDs and games such as chess .
They will work shifts of up to 10 hours either during the day or at night , when they will be busy conducting scientific experiments and ensuring all the on - board systems are working properly .
Claustrophobia
They wo n't have much free time .
A room without a view " You have to cope with the environment - that 's the main point , " says volunteer astronaut Cyrille Fournier who is a commercial airline pilot from France .
" You can be psychologically normal but some people may be claustrophobic or think something will happen .
" That 's not the case for me , so I am quite confident . "
It was all laughter and smiles as the " astronauts " left us to complete the final stages of their training before the big day .
And if all goes well with this experiment , then early next year another " crew " will be locked inside for a total of 520 days .
Any volunteers ?

And so what I expect from my team is to constantly be guided by evidence , facts , talking through all the best arguments , drawing from all the best perspectives , and then talking the best course of action possible given the fact that there are some big uncertainties and that sometimes what people may want may actually be contradictory .
So , for example , lately , people have been concerned  understandably  about the decline in the market .
Well , the reason the market ’s declining is because the economy ’s declining and it ’s generating a lot of bad news , not surprisingly .
And so what I ’m focused on is fixing the underlying economy .
That ’s ultimately what ’s going to fix the markets , but in the interim you ’ve got some folks who would love to see us artificially prop up the market by just putting in more taxpayer money which in the short term could make bank balance sheets look better , you know , make creditors and bondholders and shareholders of these financial institutions feel better and you could get a little blip .
But we ’d be in the exact same spot as we were six , eight , 10 months from now .
So what I ’ve got to do is make sure that we ’re focused on the underlying economy and if we do that right , if we do that well , and I ’m confident that we will , then after some very tough times , and after a lot of hardship on the part of some of the people that I hear from every day who ’ve lost their jobs or do n’t have health insurance or what have you , that we ’re going to get this economy moving again .
And I think over the long term we ’re going to be much better off .
Q . Are you sleeping sir or is it hard to sleep ?
A. Ohhhhh , I always sleep because when I ’m not sleeping I ’m working .
Q . You never feel burdened by it , though ?
You ’ve come into  there are so many problems that the country faces .
Do you feel the weight of that now as president ?
A . As I said feel as if I ’ve got a great team and we are making the best decisions under the circumstances .
Do I wish that I had the luxury of maybe dealing with one monumental problem at a time during the course of the year ?
Of course and in fact , you know , you ’ve been hearing sort of our opposition lately saying , ‘ Well , he ’s trying to do this and that and the other , and he should n’t  ‘ Look , I wish I had the luxury of just dealing with a modest recession or just dealing with health care or just dealing with energy or just dealing with Iraq or just dealing with Afghanistan .
I do n’t have that luxury and I do n’t think the American people do either .
We ’ve got to use this moment to solve some big problems once and for all so that the next generation is not saddled with even worse problems than we have right now .
All right ?
Thanks .

At 2:30 p.m. , President Obama called The New York Times , saying he wanted to clarify a point from the interview .
Here is a transcript of that brief call :
President Obama : Just one thing I was thinking about as I was getting on the copter .
It was hard for me to believe that you were entirely serious about that socialist question .
I did think it might be useful to point out that it was n’t under me that we started buying a bunch of shares of banks .
It was n’t on my watch .
And it was n’t on my watch that we passed a massive new entitlement  the prescription drug plan without a source of funding .
And so I think it ’s important just to note when you start hearing folks throw these words around that we ’ve actually been operating in a way that has been entirely consistent with free - market principles and that some of the same folks who are throwing the word socialist around ca n’t say the same .
Q . So who ’s watch are we talking about here ?
A . Well , I just think it ’s clear by the time we got here , there already had been an enormous infusion of taxpayer money into the financial system .
And the thing I constantly try to emphasize to people if that coming in , the market was doing fine , nobody would be happier than me to stay out of it .
I have more than enough to do without having to worry the financial system .
The fact that we ’ve had to take these extraordinary measures and intervene is not an indication of my ideological preference , but an indication of the degree to which lax regulation and extravagant risk taking has precipitated a crisis .
I think that covers it .

I hope you ’ve recently noticed a significant improvement in the speed of the Division by Zer0 .
I ’ve done some further testing and I think I ’ve discovered the perfect combination of tools which , at least for me , has made everything much snappier .
Last time I was playing around with Dreamhost ’s FastCGI option as well as trying out a few newer caching plugins since Super Cache did n’t really play nice .
Specifically I was testing Hyper Cache and DB Cache and trying to decide which one is better to keep .
Well , in the end I figured out that using both is even better , and now I ’m going to tell you why 🙂
Hyper Cache
This one is one serious mutha .
It basically does the same thing as Super Cache but without requiring you to edit your .htaccess or other such hassle .
All you have to do is activate and go .
And the results are really stunning .
With it activated , I routinely get pages loading in sub-second speeds ( whereas before the average was 2 - 6 seconds ) on cached pages with very low overhead , which means I can withstand traffic spikes .
I was so impressed I spent an afternoon just reloading pages to admire how fast they loaded 🙂
Of course this plugin will not help with javascripts speed so if you have a lot of ’em , you will still notice your site taking a bit .
However you should notice that the loading starts immediately and then waits for each javascript to download and run ( so you ’ll see the page appear in stages ) instead of waiting a bit until it even starts loading ( while it ’s gathering prerunning the php and quering the DB ) .
As such , if you have most of your javascripts loading at the footer ( as you should ) , your content will appear immediately for your audience to start reading , and by the time they ’re one the second sentence , the page will have finished .
My main problem was exactly that incidentally , that the content took up to 5 seconds to even appear .
As long as the main text is there , I do n’t mind so much how long it takes for the rest of the “ bling ” to load .
Another good thing about hyper cache is that it will not activate if you ’re logged in to your wordpress installation .
This means that in order to see the speed of your site as it appears to everyone else , you either need to use another browser ( I keep a konqueror lying around just for this ) or to clear your cookies .
On the upside , it means that you almost always see the current version when you make non-content changes , such as editing your theme ( as the cache will be automatically cleared if you make content changes . )
This really helps if you like to tweak your site layout a lot .
One last ( bad ) thing I ’ve noticed is that if I go ahead and clear all hyper cache .
My site will die with an internal server error .
I ’ve tried this twice now .
I do not know if that is because my site would die if hyper cache was not there or because once the cache is cleared , there some heavy duty function running to repopulate it or whatever .
I know it happens though .
I do n’t have to do this anymore however so it ’s not really a problem .
Overall , Hyper Cache is an absolute win for people hosting their own WordPress , especially if you ’re on a shared hosting plan and even more especially if you ’re using Dreamhost PS , as Super Cache is not an option .
DB Cache
This plugin takes a novel approach to caching .
Whereas all the other that exist simply save the html output of your content and then serve it to avoid running PHP code each time a page is requested , DB Cache saves database query output to avoid making SQL calls to it .
This has a few significant benefits .
First of all , it helps with Search Engine crawlers such as the google bot .
Where a normal caching plugin really shines when a lot of people access one specific page , it actually harms you when one agent accesses a lot of pages , since you add the cache - saving to your load , on top of the normal page loading .
DB cache on the other hand , by caching common Database queries , can fill exactly that hole which significantly reduces the juice you need to serve all the bots crawling you .
This is becauseeach page of your site , other than the main content and possible some post - related queries ( ie similar posts ) , has basically the same calls .
Your recent posts , your tag clouds and category lists , recent comments etc , depending on what widgets and theme you use .
These generally do n’t change from page to page but for a normal caching plugin on a new page , they still need to be called so that the full html page can be saved .
So by caching all these common calls , you seriously reduce the time one needs to wait on a blank screen before a page can even start loading the content .
You also reduce the load when a crawler does his daily thing and you even increase the speed of the occasional visitor from a mobile .
While DB cache will not give you the awesome speed hyper cache will on a single page load , it will certainly reduce your overall server ’s CPU & RAM load ( much more important than bandwidth and disk space for shared hosting ) and make visits to uncommon pages quicker .
Another plus which I ’ve discovered is when you are using Gallery2 through the wpg2 plugin .
Gallery is imho a database chewer because people do n’t simply see one image and then leave , but rather switch quickly among a lot of them .
As a result , DB Cache is perfectly prepared to grab those common queries done through wpg2 and save them for later , increasing the overall speed .
The caching combo of ultimate speed
Until now I ’ve never mixed caching plugins as they all generally worked in the same or similar way .
However the distinct way these two worked gave me the impression that they would n’t really conflict and might actually complement each other quite well .
One of them is built for serving one page to lost of visitors in a short time period , while the other is perfect for serving many pages to one visitor .
So I went ahead and activated both of them at the same time
And whatdayaknow , there was no explosion 🙂
What happens at the moment is that generally , a page always has at least a few queries cached by DB Cache .
You can even see the cached queries increasing with each time it ’s reloaded ( when bypassing hyper cache ) .
This in turn allows a non-hypercached page to load quicker which is then saved into hyper cache for further visitors .
So currently you see the results of this experiment .
I ’d like to believe that my speed at the moment is quite good and others who have followed my advice have experienced similar improvements .
I really hope this is the last time I have to play with caches in the future and that the current speeds are not just an illusion .
Let me know of the results if you try the same combo on your own sites .

New Scientist has an excellent article on the neuroscience of deja vu , tackling how our brain can generate the anomalous feeling that we are reliving an event when it has happened for the first time .
The article tackles both experiments that try to trigger and measure deja vu in healthy participants , as well as in people who experience , sometimes permanent , deja vu because of epilepsy of brain injury .
There is one slightly awkward bit in the article however .
One possibility is that d√©j√† vu is based on a memory fragment that comes from something more subtle , such as similarity between the configuration or layout of two scenes .
Say you are in the living room of a friend ’s new house with the eerie feeling that you have been there before , yet knowing you ca n’t possibly .
It could be just that the arrangement of furniture is similar to what you have seen before , suggests Cleary , so the sense of familiarity feels misplaced …
Although the familiarity idea appeals to many , Moulin , for one , is not convinced .
His scepticism stems from a study of a person with epilepsy that he conducted with Akira O’Connor , now at Washington University in St Louis , Missouri .
This 39 - year - old man ’s auras of d√©j√† vu were long - lasting enough to conduct experiments during them .
The researchers reasoned that if familiarity is at the root of d√©j√† vu , they should be able to stop the experience in its tracks by distracting the man ’s attention away from whatever scene he was looking at .
However , when he looked away or focused on something different , his d√©j√† vu did not dissipate , and would follow his line of vision and his hearing , suggesting that real familiarity is not the key .
The fact that an epilepsy aura can cause d√©j√† vu at all suggests that it is erroneous activity in a particular part of the brain that leads to misplaced feelings of familiarity , suggests Moulin .
This dichotomy is interesting because it implies that ‘ brain activity ’ and ‘ misplaced familiarity ’ are somehow separate , when we know each can just be descriptions of the same thing on different levels of interpretation .
However , it also implies that deja vu can only be caused in one particular way , when it could be caused by many different processes .
For example , think about trying to understand why someone got angry .
We could be studying one person who gets angry when his football team loose , another when he is wrongly accused and another when he has a seizure in his limbic system .
You could use each one of these explanations to say that the other explanation is wrong if you believed that anger could only be caused in one way .
However , if we accept that it is an experience described at the level of psychology or behaviour there could be many ways of explaining it , and many paths that lead to the same experience , each cause does not cancel the other out .
Like deja vu and probably many other experiences , there are many causes and ways of explaining causes for the same phenomena .

" Always keep mystery .
Not many interviews . "
There you have it , fledgling bands of the world .
If you start right now and keep in mind those rules , as well as some key others , in about a decade ’s time you can have the number one album in the world .

The ‘r’ Word Campaign
When we began The ‘r’ Word Campaign
Web site in April of 2007 there was no one speaking out nationally in any forum about the ‘r ’ word or the attitude of prejudice and discrimination towards people with disabilities it perpetuates .
We began the site as a result of two unrelated events that made us decide it was time to stand - up , speak out , and empower anyone offended by this word by letting them know that it was okay for them to do the same .
The first event occurred after our family became separated while in a Walmart store with our daughter with disabilities and her 8 year old sister .
Our younger daughter had stopped to look at some clothes while we walked on with her sister who has significant disabilities .
A short time later our younger daughter came running up to us crying .
She would not tell us until after we had left the store that a couple of men had walked past her and while looking at her sister said , “ I do n’t know why they let people like that live . ”
We were out of earshot and did not hear the comment .
The second event in April 2007 was a joking racial slur by national radio disc jockey Don Imus referring to Rutgers basketball players which provoked national civil rights leaders to step forward in outrage .
It was at that point we realized there was no one , no national civil rights leaders , no one at all standing up and providing a voice against the daily slurs that occur to people with disabilities .
It was at that point The ‘r’ Word Campaign was formed .
https://stopsayingretard.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/pressrelease-1.pdf
At the time there were several other small voices out there like pebbles thrown in a pond creating tiny ripples .
Jenna Glatzer had created her ‘ My Words Matter Pledge ’ in 2004 http://www.jennaglatzer.com and Soeren Palumbo had given his first high school speech earlier that year http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoqaNG0Ozqc
Soeren ’s speech grew to receive coverage in several TV stations along the east coast .
This site , The ‘r’ Word Campaign , was the first site in the nation to address and bring attention to the hateful and harmful use of the ‘ r ’ word .
Then in August of 2008 the movie , “ Tropic Thunder ” was released and the national Special Olympics started their R - Word site and picked up national television coverage through the organized protests of their chapters , at that point our Web site had been on - line for well over a year .
We were later told by a Special Olympics publicist , “ ( The Special Olympics ) … “ R - Word ” pledge site was something that we pulled together quite quickly in response to the Tropic Thunder film . ”
Quite frankly we were happy to see the Special Olympics bring their vast resources into this campaign .
Our campaign was and is a grass - roots effort to bring awareness to this hateful word and empower people to stand - up and say something .
Although we receive many requests for stickers , buttons and posters from schools and teachers we have limited funding to provide very much .
Everything we have comes from our own pockets or from what few donations we receive .
But we have been able to provided many materials on our Web site for downloading free of charge .
The Special Olympics , like the National Down Syndrome Society and the National Autism Association , has a specific population that they serve .
They do have a higher ‘ brand ’ recognition in that they have organized chapters in most every state and hold annual events that involve thousands of schools and agencies raising millions in donations through these events .
There are , however , many hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities who for whatever reason , either too young , too old , not able or not interested , have never participated in Special Olympic events .
Although through their vast resources they have been able to bring the ‘ r ’ word to a greater national attention , and we share in that message with them , our message is somewhat different in that we want to focus on all people with disabilities and the prevailing attitudes against them .
You see , it ’s not just about a simple word .
It ’s about the hate and discrimination that is perpetuated by it .
For instance , there was more national outrage over the abuse of Michael Vick ’s dogs than about this story coming out of Corpus Christi Texas in which staff organized a ‘ Fight Club ’ where residents with intellectual disabilities were forced to fight in front of those who were there to take care of them or suffer worse abuses if they refused .
The fights are thought to have gone on for more than a year .
Even now we periodically receive hate comments like this recent one ;
“ i pledge the next time i see a retard i will call him a retard because thats what he ( or she ) is .
This is because they are wasting the worlds money by doing nothing but sitting around and drooling .
All retarts should be shot because they contribute nothing and just waste our money by feeding them ect .
I hope i dont offend or angry any of you … retards . ”
As long as this attitude persists , we welcome all efforts by the Special Olympics and anyone else to see that it does not evolve to the next level on the Cycle of Prejudice and Hate … like it did for the Jewish people under Hitler … like we have seen it happen in our own country in the examples of a black man dragged behind a pick - up truck or a gay man tied to a fence post and beaten to death ( both major news stories in recent years ) .
So our ‘r’ Word Campaign stands to speak for those who can not , empower those who do n’t believe they have a voice and to help them see that others are standing up and speaking out … that things are changing … and that our words do make a difference .
In the end the ‘r’ Word Campaign is not about national protests or media campaigns , it is a much more personal effort than that .
When a person stands up to tell someone else that this word offends them , it becomes a matter of respect .
And that is what we have said from the beginning .
It ’s about telling the people we meet in our day - to - day lives that this word hurts when we hear it and we would appreciate it if you would not use it in that way any longer .
It ’s not about freedom of speech , its simply about respect .
Much has been accomplished but there is so much more to do .
If you have not already we invite you to join in this effort .
And if you already have , we thank you and hope you will continue to do so for many years to come .
Sincerely ,
Rick & Wanda Felty

The “ r ” Word Campaign © 2010 , Rick & Wanda Felty – online since April 2007
NOTE : The purpose of this site is for the promotion of the ‘ r ’ Word Campaign , any comments that do not reflect that effort or do not include a valid e-mail address will not be approved .
As I slowly attempt to teach myself Haskell and the basics of functional programming , I will try and post some of my thoughts and confusions as they come .
If anyone sees me doing something wrong , please speak up .
My ego is not tied to the code I post so much as the fact that someone read it and took the time to respond .
As I was reading chapter 3 of Real World Haskell yesterday , I got myself all turned around .
And , like any good man driving a car , I refused to ask for directions and kept driving around until things started to look familiar again .
The task at hand was to write a function which would convert the List data type the authors defined earlier in the chapter to a native array .
data List a = Cons a ( List a )
| Nil
deriving ( Show )
fromList ( x:xs ) = Cons x ( fromList xs )
fromList [ ] = Nil
The authors also gave an example of a function which would convert arrays to Lists .
My job was to create the reverse .
My first attempt is below :
fromList2 List a b = a : ( fromList2 b )
fromList2 Nil = [ ]
This had some potential , but does n’t compile complaining about a lack of a data constructor ‘ List ‘ .
My confusion was around the difference between the type constructor and the value constructor .
List is the type constructor for the List type .
Cons is the value constructor for an object who type happens to be a List type .
Coming from a Java / C# background , when I first read about pattern matching , I immediately assumed it was matching against the type of objects .
Well , that ’s true and false .
In Java the type and value of something are two different things .
In Haskell , they are linked and can not change .
Therefore , when writing a pattern matching function , we need to look at the value of the parameter ( ie the value constructor and values ) and NOT the “ type ” .
I should have realized this when I wrote the second line .
Nil is not the same kind of construct as List , which should have set of a red flag for me .
To make things even more confusing , when I wrote the above code to try and test my new function , I head already read the author ’s comments about how since type constructors and value constructors are really two different things and can never be used where the other was intended , they are normally named the same ( Cons was used for readability ) .
Normally , and how I typed it out at first without realizing it , it would be written with both constructors named the same – List .
The other confusing thing for me was the difference between type variables and “ normal ” variables .
When defining the new abstract type List , ‘ a ‘ represents a type variable , or a place holder for the type of the actually object passed in .
Since nothing within the definition of a List needs to know the type of the parameter , we can get away with it being unknown until creation time .
When defining a function , the variable no longer represents the objects type , but the object itself .
Haskell is strongly and statically typed , but does n’t require you to specificy exactly what type a variable is .
It inferes it from how you use it .
Thus , the correct anser is :
fromList2 ( Cons x xs ) = x : ( fromList2 xs )
fromList2 Nil = [ ]
Trying to work with the type constructors , value constructors , type variables , etc all at once was a bit much .
The way I really figured this out was to build up to it with another example .
Here is the code I wrote which taught me what I was doing wrong above .
Maybe it will help someone else someday .
myListOrgChart = Cons " ben " ( Cons " boss " ( Cons " ceo " Nil ) )
listOrgChart = fromList2 myListOrgChart
data Person = Employee Int String Person
| Consultant String
| NoOne
deriving ( Show )
name ( Employee _ name _ ) = name
name ( Consultant name ) = name
managerName ( Employee _ _ manager ) = name manager
managerName ( Consultant name ) = name
orgChart ( Employee _ name manager ) = name : orgChart manager
orgChart ( Consultant name ) = name : name : [ ]
orgChart NoOne = [ ]
As if more proof were needed that Febrooairy and Marrtch were months made of strategy , we hear glad tidings of little army men achieving great commercial success .
Across the world ( including the US , UK and Oz ) last week , Dawn of War II hit the top of the PC charts like a , er , Space Marine hitting a pile of Orks with a powerfist .
Or something .
God , it ’s too early for tortorous similes .
However , come this week in the UK , DOWII ’s down to number 3 in the PC charts , below the latest instalment of perennial UK man-magnet Football Manager .
In the all - formats chart , it places a mere 29th .
DOOM !
PC GAMING , DEAD !
DEAD LIKE MY ABILITY TO DEVISE FUNNY SIMILES !
Except … we have a new champion .
One that achieves even greater success .
Sitting pretty at number one in the UK PC chart is Empire : Total War .
And at number one in the all formats chart ?
Woo - hoo !
Empire : Total War , possibly the most PC - gamey game of all - time , is master of all it surveys .
Eat that , Killzone 2 and Halo Wars .
The PC is the ultimate champion once again – coo in envy and mild arousal as it performs the crab most muscular .
No word on its
Yankee chart - placement yet , which is likely to be interesting .
Empire ’s Euro - focus , despite the introductory War of Independence campaign , seemed to rile a few of our more patriotic American readers a little while back – could there be a general sentiment that ETW be disrepectin’ the colonies ?
Amusingly , I note that the game features different box art in the UK and US .
It ’s the same shouting Sean Bean - alike front ’n ’centre , but in the UK he ’s wearing a red coat with a British flag waving behind him .
In the US ?
Why , blue coat and star - spangled banner .
See above for empirical proof .
LOLZOR .
Though it totally makes sense , of course : that evil motherland - celebrating redcoat box sat on US store shelves would have riled tempers enormously .
It ’ll certainly be fascinating to see if ETW can achieve the same success in the US , or if there ’s a genuinely a political / cultural / historical obstacle between it and megabucks .
Update – seems like there ’s a ton of different Empires .
LOLZOR once more :
Thanks to Winfred van Heerebeek for pointing that out .
I was watching AC 360 last night , even though John King was filling in for Anderson Cooper , and the following segment was mind - numbing when you took it in its totality :
DAVID GERGEN , CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST : Well , John , I think there ’s a range of priorities for him now .
Having cleared this hurdle — and it is a major victory for him — with the stimulus package , the White House knows that he has tougher , higher hurdles ahead .
Tomorrow , just as he ’s signing , he does have this automobile bailout problem hitting his desk with a big thud .
My sense is that , unlike where we were a few weeks ago , the possibility of the administration allowing some sort of structured bankruptcy to occur is higher today than it was a while back .
I think there ’s not a big stomach to keep putting money , dollar after dollar after dollar , into this .
The day after that , he ’s going to announce his housing plan .
That ’s going to be expensive .
People are going to be looking for details .
He ’s got the banking bailout still to come back to , the biggest of all of the problems , three times the cost , probably , of the stimulus package .
Nobody knows what — how to deal with these toxic assets , a real question whether we ’re moving toward nationalization .
And , then , at the end of the month , John , as you well know , he has to — he has to face the deficits and produce a budget that ’s going to forecast deficits out 10 years .
And I think they ’re going to be eye - popping .
KING : Well , Gloria , let ’s follow on that point .
Republicans are now saying , Obama is presiding over the era of big bailouts .
I asked Senator John McCain yesterday if he thought the stimulus fight indicated the beginning of a partisan war .
He did n’t go quite that far , but he did say this .
It ’s a bad beginning , ” he says , because what we promised the American people , what President Obama promised the American people , that we would sit down together .
A bad beginning , Gloria ?
Is that just political criticism , or are we going to see this , Republicans drawing this line , as we go on and on and on ?
***
KING : And , Joe , we ’re seeing more and more evidence of the pain at the state level , Kansas saying today it does n’t have the money to give people their income tax refunds , California tonight saying 20,000 people will be laid off .
As the governors deal with this pain , A , how soon might this money get to the states to help them , and , B , are people out there going to blame their governors , or might they start to blame their president ?
JOE JOHNS , CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT :
Well , the truth of it is , if you look at the economic models on this recession , a lot of people are suggesting the main thing the president has to do is avoid another big blow to the economy .
And , certainly , you want to manage and minimize the economic turmoil in the states .
***
People may want to blame Barack Obama , but , at the end of the day , once this money goes out the door , in a lot of ways , it ’s going to be up to the states and how well they ’re prepared to try to get this money out quickly , John .
KING : And , David , we ’re talking about the long list of domestic challenges , but another huge issue facing this president , his press secretary saying he is close to making a decision on sending potentially thousands of more American troops into Afghanistan .
Testing Times Collapse of European Industry Worse than Expected
New statistics released on Thursday show that Europe 's industrial woes are even worse than expected .
Many are concerned that the bad economy could lead to more protectionism .
Socialist Appeal - the Marxist voice of Labour and youth .
The holy trinity of ideological concepts for the modern capitalist age are neoliberalism , globalisation and financialisation .
Of these three concepts financialisation occupies a position akin to that of the holy ghost , as the least understood and least discussed of the three .
Financialisation is a reality under modern capitalism .
Marxists need to examine how much it has changed capitalism , and how far the system remains fundamentally the same .
The holy trinity of ideological concepts for the modern capitalist age are neoliberalism , globalisation and financialisation .
Of these three concepts financialisation occupies a position akin to that of the holy ghost , as the least understood and least discussed of the three .
Financialisation is a reality under modern capitalism .
Marxists need to examine how much it has changed capitalism , and how far the system remains fundamentally the same .
( For the role of neoliberalism in capitalist ideology see http://www.socialist.net/neoliberalism-dead.htm
Marx typically analysed the behaviour of capitalist firms producing a single product and involved in just one line of business , such as textile spinning or weaving .
He did so because , in his day , that is how most firms worked .
We ’ve come a long way from that .
Take the case of General Electric - a typical , modern diversified firm .
General Electric is a conglomerate with a finger in all sorts of pies - though not , these days , electricity .
To quote ‘ Forbes ’
It ’s a “ technology , media & financial services company , with products & services ranging from aircraft engines , power generation , water processing & security technology to medical imaging , business & consumer financing , media content & industrial products . ”
Where ’s the industrial logic in that ?
There is none .
So why diversify ?
As a last resort neoclassical economists have invoked the mysterious notion of synergy as a force for diversification , rather like conjuring a rabbit from a hat .
Synergy is said to mean that ‘ two and two can make five . ’
As we shall see , the results of mergers have just as often demonstrated that ‘ two and two can make three . ’
There is one theory of modern capitalism that can attempt to explain diversification in the form of a pure conglomerate like GE .
That is the theory that treats the firm as a portfolio of assets .
Portfolio theory begins with the homely saying that ‘ you should n’t put all your eggs in one basket . ’
Diversification is said to be about risk reduction .
The notion of reducing risk ( rather than increasing profit ) hardly seems an adequate theorisation of the aggressive and predatory irruption of big capital into new sectors in search of more and more surplus value .
A Marxist has no problem in perceiving the unifying theme in financial services , aircraft engines , power generation , medical imaging and the media within GE .
They are all intended to make money .
GE ’s market capitalisation comes to $ 279 billion .
Its sales are $ 172.6bn , profits $ 21.9bn and it has assets of $ 833.9 bn .
It employs 327,000 workers .
( All these figures were bigger at the turn of the millennium .
GE has had serious difficulties in recent years and the value of its assets has been in decline . )
In many ways General Electric is typical of the biggest businesses of our age .
General Electric is in fact treated by top management as a portfolio of financial assets which generate surplus value .
They do n’t care whether they are making aircraft engines or security technology as long as they make money .
Modern capitalists take a purely financial view of their firm ’s operations .
Not only that , they are increasingly intertwined with and dominated by financial institutions , financial instruments and financial considerations .
This process is called financialisation .
It ’s been going on for the last thirty years or so .
It ’s an ugly word .
The reality behind it is not pretty either .
What is financialisation ?
Others have noted this modern trend .
Some writers , in our view , have tried to put too much explanatory weight on the concept .
For now we will offer the fairly neutral definition offered by Wikipedia .
“ Financialisation may be defined as : " the increasing dominance of the finance industry in the sum total of economic activity , of financial controllers in the management of corporations , of financial assets among total assets , of marketised securities and particularly equities among financial assets , of the stock market as a market for corporate control in determining corporate strategies ... ”
“ More popularly , however , financialisation is understood to mean the vastly expanded role of financial motives , financial markets , financial actors and financial institutions in the operation of domestic and international economies . ”
This is not simply restating the view outlined by Lenin in his book , ‘ Imperialism , the highest stage of capitalism ’ ( Progress Publishers , 1966 ) that capitalism in its monopoly stage is dominated by or merges with finance capital .
The increasing importance of finance capital to modern capitalism remains a valid insight to this day .
But we have moved beyond the period where finance capital simply battens itself upon the productive capitalist sector though it still does so , like the Old Man of the Sea on Sinbad the Sailor ’s back .
George Soros has observed , “ The size of the financial sector is out of proportion to the rest of the economy .
It has been growing excessively ... ending in this super - bubble of the last 25 years . ”
Capitalism has evolved to the stage where all management calculation is basically dominated by financial calculations .
The importance of productive activity has been completely dissolved in the modern management mindset .
In ‘ The moral consequences of economic growth ’ ( Alfred A. Knopf , 2005 ) Benjamin M. Friedman summed up his analysis of the changes that have taken place , “ I have the sense that in many of these firms the activity has become further and further divorced from actual economic activity . ”
This is reflected in the background and training of top management .
Thirty years ago the manager of an engineering firm would typically have come from an engineering background and would have a basic understanding of the problems and possibilities afforded by the technology handled by the firm .
This is no longer considered necessary or desirable .
Harvard Business
School has concentrated over the past thirty years in turning out managers who have the mentality of accountants .
They are completely unaware of the technology the firm uses .
All they see is a balance sheet .
More and more top managers have been trained as accountants or lawyers .
Money from money ?
Marx dealt with two forms of circulation .
In an economy of simple commodity production the commodity is exchanged for money only as a means of acquiring commodity of a different kind .
The commodity producer sells in order to buy .
Marx calls this the C – M – C circuit .
He contrasts this with the intention of a capitalist who starts with money and exchanges it fleetingly for commodities ( for instance means of production ) only in order to end up with a larger sum of money .
He intends to transform money into capital .
This is the M – C – M’ circuit .
Marx notes that the acquisition of commodities ( even if only for an instant ) is regarded by the capitalist as a nuisance .
The capitalist ’s ideal is to move from M – M ’ without bothering with acquiring commodities at all .
This strikes us as absurd but it is this absurdity to which capital aspires .
A new era ?
A new era of capitalism was announced by Martin Wolf in 2007 ( The new capitalism : how unfettered finance is fast reshaping the global economy .
Financial Times 19.06.07
Wolf may be regarded as a guru of finance capital .
The article is exceptionally wide - ranging and well - informed .
However it is inevitably impressionistic and raises more questions than it resolves .
Wolf is no Marxist .
He is a Commander of the British Empire .
His last book was entitled ‘ Why globalization works . ’
As we will see , he may be having second thoughts on that .
We have certainly expressed our reservations in the past at the way in which the phrase ‘ globalisation ’ has been lazily bandied about to suggest the unfettered triumph of capitalist production relations throughout the world .
( See http://www.marxist.com/globalisation-imperialism-economy110406.htm)
We agree with Martin Wolf when he argues that there is a new , or at least vastly more important , trend in modern capitalism .
That trend is financialisation .
“ First , finance has exploded .
According to the McKinsey Global Institute , the ratio of global financial assets to annual world output has soared from 109 per cent in 1980 to 316 per cent in 2005 .
In 2005 , the global stock of core financial assets had reached $ 140,000bn . ”
This is true and important .
But we need to know why finance has exploded in modern capitalism .
Wolf himself does not have a complete explanation , though he associates its rise with neoliberalism and globalisation .
“ Second , finance has become far more transactions - oriented .
In 1980 , bank deposits made up 42 per cent of all financial securities .
By 2005 , this had fallen to 27 per cent .
The capital markets increasingly perform the intermediation functions of the banking system .
The latter , in turn , has shifted from commercial banking , with its long - term lending to clients and durable relations with customers , towards investment banking . ”
Again this is new and true .
The reason for the present credit crunch is that banks no longer hang on to mortgages and other assets , and just count the money as it comes in .
As we now know they bundled these assets on , including the toxic sub - prime mortgages , and passed these exotic securities on all round the world .
The other side of this game of passing the risk parcel is that innumerable financial intermediaries have sprung up taking a cut – agency fees – for every transaction .
This is what Wolf calls financial intermediation - turning loans into securities .
The credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor did not put any difficulties in the way of this securitisation .
The reason is not hard to seek .
Since they are actually employed by the financial institutions that issue the securities , they do not scrutinise the risk as carefully as they might .
They know what side their bread is buttered on .
When considering finance capital , we naturally think of borrowing and lending as the principal activities and of interest as the ‘ reward ’ sought by finance capital .
In fact as transactions are bundled up and sold on , many intermediaries in the financial sector make their main income from commissions on sales .
In the 1987 film ‘ Trading Places ’ Eddie Murphy as a con man exchanges places with a trader in futures as part of a bet between two billionaire brothers as to whether heredity or environment is determinant in human behaviour .
As they explain their business to Murphy , he sums it up , “ I get it .
You guys are bookies , right ? ”
Traders in pork belly futures get their commission whether pork bellies go up or down in price , just as bookies get their cut no matter which horse wins the 3.30 at Lingfield .
Huge sums are made in the City and Canary Wharf in activities that approximate to bookmaking .
Investment banking is basically a matter of mobilising other people ’s money and hurling it at investment opportunities rather than the homely high street job of lending money out on mortgage and taking in deposits most of us associate with banking .
" O brave new world , that hath such people in it , " as Miranda says in Shakespeare 's ‘ The Tempest ’ .
Derivatives and fictitious capital
Wolf goes on , “ Third , a host of complex new financial products have been derived from traditional bonds , equities , commodities and foreign exchange .
Thus were born ‘ derivatives ’ , of which options , futures and swaps are the best known .
According to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association , by the end of 2006 the outstanding value of interest rate swaps , currency swaps and interest rate options had reached $ 286,000bn ( about six times global gross product ) , up from a mere $ 3,450bn in 1990 .
These derivatives have transformed the opportunities for managing risk . ”
Derivatives are so called because they are derived from another transaction .
For instance a future contract may be a contract to buy a share in the wheat harvest of 2010 .
The crop , of course has not been sown , so the buyer is making a bet as to whether there will be a good harvest or not .
Futures are contrasted to spot transactions , where the buyer takes delivery of the commodity at the time of buying .
Derivatives are a form of what Marx called fictitious capital .
In the case of real capital , it is a real productive resource that participates in the equalisation of the profit rate .
So the return is worked out on the capital invested .
For fictitious capital it is the other way round .
“ The formation of a fictitious capital is called capitalisation .
Every periodic income is capitalised by calculating it on the basis of the average rate of interest , as an income which would be realised by a capital loaned at this rate of interest .
For example , if the annual income is £ 100 and the rate of interest 5 % , then the £ 100 would represent the annual interest on £ 2,000 , and the £ 2,000 is regarded as the capital - value of the legal title of ownership on the £ 100 annually .
For the person who buys this title of ownership , the annual income of £ 100 represents indeed the interest on his capital invested at 5 % .
All connection with the actual expansion process of capital is thus completely lost , and the conception of capital as something with automatic self - expansion properties is thereby strengthened . ” ( Capital Vol III Chapter 29 p. 597 Penguin , 1981 )
Fictitious capital generates pieces of paper that entitle the bearer to an income stream .
This revenue can only come from surplus value , from the unpaid labour of the working class .
Yet the capital is fictitious because it ’s just a piece of paper and has n’t contributed a penny to the development of the capitalist world ’s productive power .
Does a capitalist care whether through spending £ 1,000 he owns a share in a factory , a mass of real productive capital ; or whether he owns a piece of paper ?
In either case ownership provides him with a steady income stream , a share of surplus value .
And , in any case , a share in a factory does not really cause its owner to perceive that they have ownership of individual bricks and machine parts .
So of course they do n’t care .
The capitalist ’s indifference between real and fictitious capital is the objective basis in his cranium to calculate everything in money terms – in other words for the evolution of the mentality that produces financialisation , that regards all economic activities as simply profit opportunities to be assessed against each other .
As for managing risk , the supposed justification for this explosion of paper wealth , that has proved a cruel delusion .
What this ‘ globalisation ’ of finance has achieved is a global spread of risk .
It has turned localised risk into generalised systemic risk .
Nice one !
Wolf continues , “ Fourth , new players have emerged , notably the hedge funds and private equity funds .
The number of hedge funds is estimated to have grown from a mere 610 in 1990 to 9,575 in the first quarter of 2007 , with a value of about $ 1,600 bn under management .
Hedge funds perform the classic functions of speculators and arbitrageurs in contrast to traditional ‘ long - only ’ funds , such as mutual funds , which are invested in equities or bonds .
Private equity fundraising reached record levels in 2006 : data from Private Equity Intelligence show that 684 funds raised an aggregate $ 432bn in commitments . ”
( We have discussed hedge funds and private equity funds elsewhere .
http://www.marxist.com/hedge-funds-speculation-and-capitalism.htmhttp://www.marxist.com/private-equity-capitalist-mutation260207-6.htm)
Basically hedge funds are betting syndicates for very rich people .
They are run by investment managers .
They are private and unregulated .
There were estimated to be 8,000 , but there has been a big shake - out since the present financial crisis .
Their claim to be able to outperform the market , which is what makes them so attractive to the rich , has been severely tested and many have disappeared .
Never the less they were described in 2006 as economically “ the eighth biggest country in the world . ”
For the moment all we want to add is that when the mainstream banks slice and dice debts and pass them on as securities , they do not literally disappear from the earth , even if they no longer impinge on the consciousness of the bankers who transferred them .
Someone buys them .
There is therefore a secondary banking sector linked to the official banks .
Hedge funds have been a central institution of secondary banking .
But because they are linked to the regular banks and the rest of the capitalist economy by a thousand threads , they are bound to take a hit when the rest of the capitalist economy cops it .
Hedge funds are famously secretive institutions , only invested in by the super - rich .
It is the secondary , unregulated banking sector that has exploded over past recent years .
It is the secondary banking sector that has collapsed .
Now it is dragging the rest of finance capital , and of the whole capitalist system , into crisis .
But when shares go down , the owners sell and contribute to the catastrophe .
In an article in the Financial Times ( 12.01.09 ) George Soros is reported to have told the US Congress that hedge funds would shrink during the present crisis by 50 - 75 % from their $ 2,000bn ( that ’s $ 2trn ) peak .
The fundamental problem was that they were so heavily leveraged .
Funds were reported as betting thirty times as much as their assets , boosted by cheap loans .
The same paper reported that they have probably wound down their holdings of listed companies from $ 3,500bn in mid-2008 to $ 1,500bn by the end of the year .
Clearly this is not just a disaster for the overpaid employees of hedge funds in Mayfair , for whom the reader may or may not shed a tender tear , but is disastrous for the future of those listed companies and their employees .
Back to Wolf ’s analysis ( The new capitalism : how unfettered finance is fast reshaping the global economy .
Financial Times 19.06.07 )
“ Fifth , the new capitalism is ever more global .
The sum of the international financial assets and liabilities owned ( and owed ) by residents of high - income countries jumped from 50 per cent of aggregate GDP in 1970 to 100 per cent in the mid-1980s and about 330 per cent in 2004 .
“ What explains the growth in financial intermediation and the activity of the financial sector ?
The answers are much the same as for the globalisation of economic activity : liberalisation and technological advance .... ”
Liberalisation
Martin
Wolf is quite right that liberalisation is a major factor in the financial explosion .
Before the 1970s monetary crisis the world ’s financial affairs were governed by the Bretton Woods system of monetary management laid down at the end of the Second World War .
This was basically a fixed exchange rate regime .
We have to say that this tightly regulated system of financial management presided over much more spectacular results in real economic performance than anything that has happened since , when the ‘ animal spirits ’ of the entrepreneurs have been allowed free rein .
Exchange rates were fixed and restrictions on capital movements were universal .
In Britain and other capitalist countries exchange controls strictly limited the movement of capital before 1979 .
This in turn restricted the scope of speculation .
Keynes ’ remarks in ‘ The General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money ’ ( Cambridge University Press 1973 p. 159 ) seem borne out .
“ Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise .
But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation .
When the capital development of a country becomes a by - product of the activities of a casino , the job is likely to be ill - done . ”
Thatcher was the first leader of a major capitalist country to scrap exchange controls .
Now they are a thing of the past in the advanced capitalist countries .
( They were sensibly reintroduced in Malaysia in 1998 to immunise the country from the regional financial crisis that started in 1997 .
India and China still have exchange controls . ) .
Since the collapse of the Bretton Woods settlement , we have seen an orgy of deregulation .
( See http://www.socialist.net/neoliberalism.htm)
In the USA the Glass - Steagall Act left over from Roosevelt ’s New Deal strictly separated commercial and investment banking .
All the other domestic banking systems were rigidly regulated .
In London the ‘ big bang ’ of 1986 heralded the end of cosy regulated City establishment .
Instead we saw capitalism red in tooth and claw in London competing with New York for the position of financial capital of the world .
Fixed and floating exchange rates
In a more recent article , Martin Wolf links the explosion of currency reserves as a destabilising element in the world capitalist system with the floating exchange rate regime .
“ Between January 2000 and April 2007 , the stock of global foreign currency reserves rose by $ 5,200bn .
Thus three - quarters of all the foreign currency reserves accumulated since the beginning of time have been piled up in this decade . ” ( Financial Times 09.10.08 )
Under fixed exchange rates monetary flows , to pay for flows of goods and services in the opposite direction , were in effect self - liquidating in that they disappeared into the receiving country ’s reserves .
Under a floating exchange rate regime , national banks do not in principle have to maintain foreign exchange reserves to back the currency .
So they can multiply without number and be acquired by speculators .
Liberalisation was inevitable as capitalism after 1971 entered an era of floating exchange rates .
Capital movements were no longer just the counterpart of trade in goods between countries .
Capital was set free !
Capital movements soon dominated the movement of goods by a factor of 100:1 .
It was these capital flows that determined exchange rates , not the balance of payments of a country .
Capital outflow could bring any government not prepared to do the bidding of international capital to heel .
( For more on the implications of exchange rate regimes on the accumulation of capital , see http://www.socialist.net/the-world-economic-crisis-and-the-%E2%80%98emerging-economies%E2%80%99.htm)
Computers in trading
As to technology , it has helped to transform the financial environment .
Risk assessment was largely a personal matter till the building up and availability of banks of data on the creditworthiness of millions of citizens .
Typically the borrower had to appear before a bank manager , of the kind typified by Captain Mainwaring in ‘ Dad ’s Army ’ , and explain why they needed the money .
In the City cliques of blue - blooded bankers typically relied on trust between one another as the glue that held their financial transactions together .
Risk is no longer monitored individually .
Transactions are logged and risk assessed mathematically .
Experian is a British firm with sinister banks of information on the ‘ consumer preferences ’ and credit history of virtually every citizen in the land .
Nor is risk held at the bank with the loan .
It is securitised and passed on , and agency fees are pocketed in the process .
The illusion was allowed to develop that , in this manner , risk had disappeared .
Out of sight , out of mind .
As explained earlier , rather than being localised , risk is being packed into the foundations of the global financial system .
It is made systemic .
Secondly banks of computers are routinely used to develop the complex programmes and predictions evolved from advanced mathematics with the noble aim of making money through speculation .
We deal later with the ‘ efficient markets hypothesis . ’
Briefly markets are assumed to be ‘ efficient ’ , in the sense that they process all available information .
One implication of the theory is that , ' you ca n’t beat the markets ' – not consistently at any rate .
This , of course , does not prevent capitalists expending vast amounts of blood and treasure in an attempt precisely to beat the markets .
One such model is called the Black - Scholes options - pricing mechanism .
Perry Mehrling – in ‘ Fischer Black and the Revolutionary Idea of Finance ’ ( John Wiley , 2005 ) – notes that , despite the occult quality of these mathematical endeavours , there is no evidence that this model ‘ added value ’ to their assets .
But the myth lives on .
Here ’s a note from Scientific American ( December 2008 p. 21 ) on why these programmes failed .
“ As Benoit Mandelbrot ... wrote in Scientific American in 1999 , established modeling techniques presume falsely that radically large market shifts are unlikely and that all price changes are statistically independent ; today ’s fluctuations have nothing to do with tomorrow ’s – and one bank ’s portfolio is unrelated to the next ’s .
Here is where rocket science and reality diverge . ”
Wolf concludes , ( The new capitalism : how unfettered finance is fast reshaping the global economy .
Financial Times 19.06.07 )
“ Yet there is also a shorter - term explanation for the explosive recent growth in finance : today 's global savings and liquidity gluts .
Low interest rates and the accumulation of liquid assets , not least by central banks around the world , have fuelled financial engineering and leverage .
How much of the recent growth of the financial system is due to these relatively short - term developments and how much to longer - term structural features will be known only when the easy conditions end , as they will . ”
Since he wrote the article Martin Wolf has come to see how much of the inexorable progress he outlined was a pure , unsustainable financial bubble .
But the article was the conventional wisdom little more than a year ago .
“ What then have been the consequences of this vast expansion in financial activity , much of it across international borders ?
“ Among the results are that households can hold a wider array of assets and also borrow more easily , so smoothing out their consumption over lifetimes .
Between 1994 and 2005 , for example , the liabilities of UK households jumped from 108 per cent of GDP to 159 per cent .
In the US , they soared from 92 per cent to 135 per cent .
Even in conservative Italy , liabilities rose from 32 per cent to 59 per cent of GDP . ”
The notion that this amounts to ‘ smoothing consumption over one ’s lifetime ’ is far - fetched .
What is really going on with these spiraling liabilities is people getting head over heels in debt .
Mergers and acquisitions
“ Similarly , it is ever easier for companies to be taken over by , or merge with , other companies .
The total value of global mergers and acquisitions in 2006 was $ 3,861bn , the highest figure on record , with 33,141 individual transactions .
As recently as 1995 , in contrast , the value of mergers and acquisitions was a mere $ 850bn , with just 9,251 deals . ”
In the first place a merger typically does not raise a penny for new investment .
Vast sums of money are indeed mobilised , but for the sole purpose of changing the ownership of assets , not for increasing their productive power .
Secondly we note that all surveys show that mergers and takeovers are usually unsuccessful in improving real economic performance .
Put bluntly , the merger movement is a huge waste of energy and resources , and the fact that financial mobilisation makes mergers possible on an ever larger scale cannot be regarded as any form of ‘ progress . ’
Can capitalist dinosaurs spending all their energy eating one another be regarded as progress ?
After his breathless exposition , Wolf injects a note of caution .
“ Pessimists would argue that monetary conditions have been so benign for so long that huge risks are being built up , unidentified and uncontrolled , within the system .
They would also argue that the new global financial capitalism remains untested . ”
The pessimists were right .
Working class households
Let us look at the development of financialisation , starting with the household sector .
In the nineteenth century workers did not use banks .
Skilled workers had a strong savings ethos .
But life was precarious .
They were only one wage packet away from destitution .
A host of voluntary savings societies catered to their need .
None of these funds flowed into or out of the banking system .
Banks were certainly missing a trick to make money out of workers ’ savings .
The Bank of England ’s smallest note issued was £ 5 , the equivalent of several weeks ’ wages for any worker .
For a nineteenth century worker , the unskilled in particular , wages were usually spent as soon as they were received .
For workers of that time surviving on a subsistence wage , the only ‘ provision ’ for being looked after in old age was to submit themselves to the Poorhouses , the ‘ poor law Bastilles ’ , unless they could rely on the charity of others in their family who were better off .
The banks made their money elsewhere .
The banks ’ obsession with the finance of world trade , and the consequent ignoring not only of workers ’ saving needs , but also of the requirements of capitalist manufacturing as we shall see , was typically part of the process by which British capitalism lost its pre-eminence .
Economic historians have declared that the banks did not ‘ fail . ’
In the light of the relative decline of British capitalism this seems a metaphysical proposition .
Certainly British capitalism , of which the banks were a central part , failed in the competitive struggle against rival capitalist powers .
In the modern era each individual is perceived by the banking system as “ a two legged cost and profit centre , ” as Robin Blackburn puts it .
( New Left Review The subprime crisis April 2008 p. 84 ) Workers are expected to go into debt if they go to university .
These loans are commodified and sold on .
Workers are expected to go into debt to buy a house .
In Britain there is little other option for most people .
Wages are becoming a form of loanable funds , a site for profit - making by the financial institutions .
Now working class people see their wages as subject to all kinds of exactions and financial flows .
The credit card , let it be remembered is , despite our universal reliance upon it , a relatively recent invention .
More and more ways of borrowing are being opened up to ‘ the consumer . ’
Historically the household sector has always been in net surplus .
No longer .
In recent years both the British and US household sectors have slid into deficit as the burden of debt upon families has soared .
Every aspect of consumption has been financialised .
Apart from the attempt to get consumers in hock through mortgages and credit cards on every aspect of their private spending , this principal percolates into as many aspects of our collective consumption as it will fit .
State old age pensions were introduced in this country in 1908 as an unfunded system .
How could it possibly have been otherwise ?
As a politician , Lloyd George could not have been expected to levy national insurance payments from voters and start handing out pensions decades later when the pot had filled up .
Apart from anything else , this would have been electoral suicide .
The point is made to illustrate the wider principle that , even when people are told that their benefits are matched by their contributions , the reality is that this year ’s pensions are paid from the current national insurance fund .
Workers are told to save for their old age .
In some cases this is a complete illusion .
Pensions , including private pensions , are paid for from current national income , just as this year ’s apples are plucked from this year ’s apple trees .
Payments from pension funds are a claim on current national income , though the assets piled up are presented as saving for a distant future .
Most of this monetary flow out of the funds is not real investment in the sense of increasing the productive capacity of the nation .
It chases yet more paper assets .
But these huge funds mean a huge increase in institutional finance .
Pension funds and insurance companies are major players in financial markets .
These funds need fund managers .
Fund managers require fees .
We shall see later what effect all this has on stock markets .
In relation to the health service , Aneurin Bevan was emphatic that the NHS should be funded from general taxation .
The introduction of the Private Finance Initiative , along with other ‘ reforms ’ aimed at creating a market in the health service where none existed , have transformed the situation .
What is significant about PFI is that the task of providing the infrastructure of the NHS such as hospitals is compulsorily handed over to the financial sector by the simple expedient of forbidding the public sector the right to borrow , as it had done for fifty years before .
Since the private consortium owns the buildings they also provide the health service as a private profit - making business .
Two features of the mentality of capitalism in the age of financialisation pop up .
The first is that no management expertise in providing health care is regarded as necessary .
An accountant will do just as well , or even better .
The second is that a service based on current spending , mainly on wages , is turned into a series of financial flows .
Higher education : when grants were replaced by loans and students had to pay fees , higher education became commodified .
Another stage in the endless life cycle of workers accumulating debt and paying it off was created .
And of course they are using PFI to fund school building .
In doing so they have exposed education , the health and other elements of the essential infrastructure of our society to the vagaries of the banking crisis .
The banks , central to the whole project , have just turned the finance tap off .
Will PFI survive ?
Early signs are that New Labour will guarantee the contracts , thus removing any last fiction that PFI is about switching risk to the private sector .
Just guaranteed profits for them – in boom or in slump .
Anything is better than slaughtering the sacred cows that show the government ’s commitment to ‘ pro- business ’ policies .
Middle class savings
The Victorian middle class did save , but their savings did not serve to grease the wheels of industrial investment .
Famously they would put their money into railway bonds and state and municipal bonds in exotic countries .
( It is argued that British capitalism did benefit indirectly from this early trend to ‘ globalisation . ’
Railways being pushed into the interiors of far - away places opened them up as markets for dominant British manufactures . )
The British middle class also bought government securities ( consols ) , but seldom bought into shares of any kind .
Banks were also geared to financing world trade by dealing in bills of exchange and other trade - related paper and domestic monetary and credit circulation , rather than financing industrial investment .
Government
The government sector was comparatively small in the nineteenth century .
Throughout most of the twentieth century state spending rose as a proportion of national income , and the national debt ballooned on account of two world wars .
The welfare state , beginning with old age pensions and the National Insurance Act of 1911 , was based on spending out of current government income from values generated by current working people , rather than generating the illusion that NI , pensions and other transfer payments were a form of saving for the future .
The corporate sector
Nor did banks lend long term to industry at least in Britain and the USA .
They still do n’t .
More than 90 % of investment funds in those countries are internally generated , that is to say they come from profits ploughed back .
Yet industry is more and more dependent on finance , and finance more and more dependent on industry .
Every major car firm now has its own hire purchase company , such as the General Motors Acceptance Corporation and the Ford Motor Credit Company .
Before these were set up , a car buyer would have had to save up , or try their chance for a bank loan .
These credit institutions are more than just a convenience to these car companies .
They illustrate the way that production has been almost erased as a separate activity in a welter of financial calculation at the top of a big corporation .
The crisis of these HP companies is an important part of the present acute crisis in the world motor industry .
Anglo -American capitalism versus the ‘ bank ’ model
There are undoubted differences between different capitalist nation states .
These differences are products of their different history and evolution .
We are going to refer to these different types as ‘ models . ’
The reader should not get the impression that the ruling class , tiring of the failure of their own model of capitalism , can select another from off the shelf .
They are also victims of historical processes , are trapped in the form of capitalism that has evolved and , like the captain of the ship , will go down with their system .
One of the differences between Anglo - American capitalism and the German type concerns the interaction between production and finance capital .
Historically , the ‘ stock exchange ’ capitalism of Britain and the USA has been contrasted to the ‘ bank ’ model typified by Germany , and later in a modified form by Japan and countries such as Korea .
German capitalism of his time was the model for Hilferding in his classic ‘ Finance Capital . ’
( Routledge and Kegan Paul , 1981 ) It should be noted that Lenin in ‘ Imperialism , the highest stage of capitalism ’ ( Progress Publishers 1966 ) gave a broader sociological definition of finance capital than Hilferding ’s strict reliance on the practices of German banks .
After all Lenin used and adapted the Liberal - radical Hobson ’s analysis in his treatment of British imperialism .
Likewise he tended to speak of the ‘ fusion of financial and productive capital ’ in preference to Hilferding ’s formulation of the ‘ domination of finance capital . ’
The specific phenomena incorporated into Hilferding ’s theory are often seen as of two - fold significance : first they have been seen as part of the launching of German capitalism as a major competitor nation on the world economy .
Whereas British capitalism evolved ‘ organically ’ from petty artisan production , German capitalism could only compete on the world market at the time it emerged as big business .
This required large amounts of fixed capital .
This in turn meant that industrial capital could not be financed by private capitalists , as was generally the case with early British capitalism , but firms had to have recourse to borrowing .
This gave the banks a key role .
Secondly this teutonic form of capitalism persisted till quite recently in that banks lend long term and develop an active interest in monitoring their investments in manufacturing firms .
This in turn meant that capitalism could develop long term perspectives , as opposed to the chronic ‘ short termism ’ characteristic of Anglo - American capitalism .
So the structure of German capitalism was a part of its combined and uneven development .
Conventional economic historians call this the Gerschenkron thesis , but Marxists will recognise it comes from Leon Trotsky .
The stock exchange
The stock exchange is not a major source of investment finance for most capitalist firms in most capitalist countries .
Of course a company can issue new shares as a means of raising funds .
But as Lazonick has pointed out , many executives have been more concerned with stock repurchases , that is withdrawing their shares from the exchanges .
Buying a second hand share of a car company in the bourse is no more advantage to the motor company than buying a second hand car .
So why is the share price important ?
It is important because the share is the modern form by which capitalists own the means of production .
The dividend and hoped for increase in the price are the rewards of being a capitalist .
The shareholders are the people the managers have to butter up .
The share price is therefore a central determinant of the behaviour of those who run the firm .
We can look at the options for different forms of capitalism in terms presented by organisational theorists such as Albert Hirschman ( ‘ Exit , Voice and Loyalty , ’ Harvard University Press , 1970 ) .
He looked at the likely reactions to unsatisfactory prospects in life as a choice between ‘ voice ’ and ‘ exit . ’
In Britain and the USA the stock exchange is actually dominated by these institutional investors .
Personally owned shares are only a tiny minority of those traded .
The fund managers have their own techniques .
If they perceive failure , in terms of the price of a share in their portfolio heading south , they just sell .
Here the instant reaction from the institutional investor is to ‘ exit , ’ showing no ‘ loyalty ’ whatsoever – any more than a gambler would to a horse that had fallen at the firs
A man in his 20s died Wednesday night after being shot with a Taser by a San Jose police officer who was attempting to take him into custody .
It is the sixth instance of someone dying after San Jose police deployed the electric stun gun on them .
Man dies after being Tased by San Jose policeBy Mark GomezMercury NewsPosted : 02/12/2009 06:08:32 AM
PSTA man in his 20s died Wednesday night after being shot with a Taser by a San Jose police officer who was attempting to take him into custody .
It is the sixth instance of someone dying after San Jose police deployed the electric stun gun on them .
The man resisted arrest , tried to grab the officer 's gun from its holster and fought with two police officers for several minutes before one of the officers shot him with a Taser , according to police .
After he was shot with a Taser , the man went into medical distress , police spokesman Enrique Garcia said .
Officers performed CPR , but the man died at the scene .
His name was not immediately released .
The officers , whose names were also not released Thursday , were treated at a hospital for injuries incurred in the struggle ; one suffered facial lacerations and the other had a leg injury , Garcia said .
They had been dispatched to Story Road and Adrian Way at 10:24 p.m. and approached the man , who ran away .
A resident in the 2200 block of Amador Drive reported someone in the backyard .
Garcia said the officers located the man and tried to take him into custody .
He " resisted and got into a violent struggle with our officers , " Garcia said .
The officers used their batons during the struggle , which lasted several minutes .
One of the officers shot the man with a Taser .
In 2004 , the San Jose Police Department armed every officer with stun guns , devices capable of temporarily disabling suspects by sending 50,000 - volt jolts through their body , as an alternative to deadly force .
The move came after San Jose police shot and killed a Vietnamese woman after they mistook her vegetable peeler for a large knife .
In four San Jose incidents where suspects died after being shot with a stun gun , family members filed lawsuits over the deaths .
In December , San Jose officials agreed to pay $ 70,000 to the wife and child of a man who died in 2005 after being shot with a Taser by police , marking the city 's first settlement over a fatality linked to the stun guns .
In mid-December , a San Jose man with psychiatric problems died outside of Valley Medical Center when a Campbell police officer fired his Taser while he was helping Santa Clara County Sheriff 's deputies control the situation .
The San Jose Police Department Homicide Unit is investigating Wednesday night 's death , Garcia said .
The Santa Clara County medical examiner 's office will conduct an autopsy to determine the cause of death .
Investigators from San Jose Police Department 's Internal Affairs Unit and the Santa Clara County District Attorney 's Office are also monitoring the case .

With the flash of cameras and oohs and aahs from the crowd , an Indian company Monday launched what is billed as the world ’s least expensive car , six years after it was conceived and six months behind schedule .
The Nano will start at $ 2,200 after taxes and dealer costs , while the more expensive CX and LX models with heat , air conditioning and power brakes will go for as much as $ 3,800 .
None of the models , made by India ’s giant Tata conglomerate , have air bags or anti-lock brakes .
But they will meet or exceed all Indian safety standards , company officials said .
“ I hope it will provide safe , affordable four - wheel transportation to families who until now have not been able to own a car , ” Ratan Tata , company chairman , told reporters .

Amid the applause and homegrown pride at India ’s accomplishments , however , some here expressed concern about the environmental impact of a “ people ’s car ” so inexpensive that it will be within reach of millions more people , further clogging the roads and polluting the air .
“ At this time , when India is just beginning to motorize , it ’s absolutely essential that we grow differently and not become as car - centric as the rest of the world , ” said Anumita Roychowdhury , associate director of the Center for Science and Environment in New Delhi .
“ It ’s a natural aspiration that people want to own a car , but it ’s important to offer public transportation options . ”
The initial focus will be on the Indian market and its rising middle class , but the company plans to roll out a more expensive European version in 2011 with air bags and better emissions and safety ratings .
It may also consider a model for the U.S. market .
China ’s Cherry QQ car sells for about $ 4,800 and India ’s Suzuki Maruti 800 for about $ 5,000 .
The least expensive U.S. car is the basic Chevrolet Aveo , with a nearly $ 12,000 base price .
Nissan offers its subcompact Versa model in the U.S. at a base price of $ 9,999 .

Tata Motors , which last year bought Jaguar and Land Rover , has seen its debt soar in recent months , as have carmakers around the world .
To help ease its cash squeeze -- the company suffered its first loss in seven years last quarter -- it is taking sizable advance deposits .
Protests by farmers and a politician ’s hunger strike last fall forced the company to shutter its main Nano factory in West Bengal state , delaying the launch by half a year .
Since then , the global economy has deteriorated significantly .
Tata said it would hold a lottery starting April 9 for the 1 million applicants vying for the 60,000 or so vehicles expected to be produced in the first year .
Those who are selected will be asked to put up a deposit of as much as 80 % of the price .
Delivery is to start in July .
The four - door vehicle , similar in look and size to Mercedes ’ Smart Car , has the smallest footprint and turning radius of any car in India , the company said .
At 10 feet long and less than 5 feet wide , it has a single windshield wiper and gets about 47 miles to the gallon from a two - cylinder engine that is hardly bigger than an outboard motor .
With its limited power and top speed of about 65 mph , analysts said , it will be largely limited to city driving .

“ The Nano is good for customers , good for business , good for the industry , ” said Murad Ali Baig , an independent auto analyst based in New Delhi .
“ In the early years , a car in India was considered a rich man ’s toy .
Now it ’s seen as part of life . ”
Some of the demand is expected to come from motorcycle owners switching to four wheels -- it ’s not unusual to see a whole family on one bike here -- and other sedan owners .
Competing automakers are watching closely , ready to jump in with their own low - priced model if the Nano succeeds .
India ’s car industry has ample room to grow by the standards of other nations , with just 14 cars per 1,000 population , according to industry figures .
That compares with 28 per 1,000 for neighboring Sri Lanka , 400 to 600 per 1,000 for Europe and Japan , and more than 700 per 1,000 for the U.S .
Utsav Chibbad , 27 , a retail worker out shopping at a Suzuki - Maruti dealership on New Delhi ’s Africa Avenue , said he dreads the prospect of thousands of new Nanos clogging India ’s already jammed roads .

“ What a nuisance , ” he said .
The environment ?
He ’s not particularly worried .
“ Things are already so haywire , what difference will it make , ” he said .
That sort of attitude concerns Indian environmentalists worried about the planet , quality of life and the cycle of materialism that results with aping Western lifestyles .
“ They say everyone having a car is development , ” said Vinay Jaju , an activist working to spread awareness about solar vehicles .
“ I do n’t see it that way .
We need to save our resources , otherwise it all becomes a vicious cycle . ”
If the real estate sweeteners , tax breaks , interest - free capital and other subsidies Tata got are factored in , Roychowdhury said , the Nano would probably cost 60 % more .
And that does n’t count parking and infrastructure subsidies car owners in India enjoy .

Public buses in India , which carry 50 % of the traveling public while using just 5 % of the road capacity , are hit with much higher taxes .
And when auto giants around the world go bust , Roychowdhury added , they are bailed out by taxpayers to the tune of billions , “ fanning more greed and greater car dependency . ”
Those concerns are n’t putting a damper on the Nano ’s coming - out party .
“ It ’s Nano - mania , ” said Baig , the analyst .
“ With India ’s hot and horrible climate , it ’s about time people have an alternative to those terrible buses . ”

New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson waves while speaking before Democratic presidential nominee U.S. Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) speaks at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver , Colorado August 28 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Mike Segar
PHOENIX ( Reuters ) - New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson signed a bill to repeal the death penalty in the state and replace it with a sentence of life imprisonment without parole , his office said on Wednesday .
Last week , the state ’s Democratic - controlled Senate voted 24 - 18 for a bill to revoke the death penalty .
It had already been passed by New Mexico ’s House of Representatives .
Richardson , a Democrat , previously supported the death penalty .
The decision to repeal it marked the “ end of a long personal journey on the issue , ” he said in a news release .
There are two prisoners currently on death row in the state .
New Mexico is the 15th state to abandon capital punishment , according to the Death Penalty Information Center .
New York and New Jersey repealed capital punishment in 2007 and bills to abolish it are pending in several states , the center said .
New Mexico has carried out only one execution since the death penalty was reinstated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976 .
Neighboring Texas is America ’s most active death penalty state .
There have been more than 1,130 executions in the United States since the 1970s .

( nota bene : a lot of the time Finns come to Tallinn for a day or two to drink because of the lower prices , so they 'll often be quite inebriated .
But then again sometimes that 's the best time to talk to someone in their mother tongue )
German :
Let 's say you want to learn German but the chances of going abroad for the next few years to use the language in person are nil .
If you 're in Pennsylvania though you should be able to learn Pennsylvania German .
It 's a regional variant and thus not the same as Hochdeutsch , but then again most people in Germany itself also speak their own regional variant too , so one could make the argument that it would make you even more German than someone that just learned standard German in class .
One other option if you 're interested in Germanic languages is to learn Norwegian ( the language I consider to be easiest for English speakers to learn ) .
Norway is also admittedly horrendously expensive , but given its ease of learning a lot of it can be done online ahead of time .
Afrikaans is also fairly easy to pick up and if you know a number of people from South Africa ( or Namibia ) you might want to try to learn it from them .
German than someone that just learned standard German in class .

Afrikaans is also fairly easy to pick up and if you know a number of people from South Africa ( or Namibia ) you might want to try to learn it from them .
Romance languages :
There are a few options here .
If you 're one of those people that is not too bad with Spanish vocab but for some reason verb conjugation and grammatical gender does n't stick , you might want to think about learning Papiamentu .
If you do n't have all that much money and just want to spend some time in another country learning any Romance language to fluency ( and do n't care that much about having an exciting time , just an educational one ) , you might want to consider Moldova .
Romania is also much cheaper to live in than countries in the west .
Persian :
If you want to learn Persian but are n't having much luck with / do n't like the script or your country has diplomatic problems with Iran , another option would be Tajikistan .
Tajikistan speaks pretty much the same language except that it's written with the Cyrillic ( Russian ) alphabet , which means that you 're able to read words without knowing them beforehand .
With the Perso - Arabic script short vowels are n't written so when you see a word like بزرگ for the first time ( bozorg ) , you have no idea whether it 's bazarg or bezorg or bozarg or any other combination , because the letters alone just say b- z - r - g. ( see romanization of Persian for more information )
I 've even read a discussion on the somethingawful.com forums on the subject before where one person has done exactly that - first spent some time in Tajikistan , learned the language ( which is actually not that difficult a language ) and then later on went on to standard Persian .
The two are mutually intelligible but people told him that he sounded like a Tajik when he talked .
Turkish : actually , I would n't recommend using any shortcuts to learn Turkish .
Turkey is n't that expensive a country and other Turkic languages are actually harder to learn because they 're either written in a different script and are in a country much harder to visit ( Kazakh , Kyrgyz ) , or in countries where Russian is still pretty dominant and thus people that do n't look like locals are just as likely to be addressed in Russian .
So the only situation where I would recommend it would be if you 're Russian or Ukranian and have the chance to learn Tatar or Crimean Tatar , near or in Moldova and can easily make the trip to Comrat to learn Gagauz , etc .
Otherwise standard Turkish is the only way to go .
Luckily Turkish also has a large diaspora in countries like Germany so if you live there you can pick it up pretty easily if you 're determined to do so .
Mongolian : European , interested in Mongolian and a chess fan ?
Check out Kalmykia .
Much closer ( and warmer ) than Mongolia .
Slavic languages : Bulgarian and Macedonian ( there 's also some dispute as to whether these two are dialects or separate languages , but let 's not get into that ) are easier for English speakers to master given that there are no cases except for pronouns ( yay ! ) , they use the definite article , and the words are generally shorter than in Russian .
The two countries are also way , way cheaper than living in Moscow and they 're much warmer .
Arabic : this only applies if you 're from Italy ( preferably Sicily ) , but Maltese is spoken just a few hundred km away .
Maltese is basically a Semetic language with a lot of foreign influence ( apparently some 50 % of it is Sicilian or Italian ) , and is written in the Latin script .
Maltese and Tunisian Arabic are also very similar to each other .
Finally , as an IAL advocate I would be remiss if I did n't mention the idea of learning a constructed language for the propaedeutic value .
The IAL with the largest community is Esperanto , Ido and Interlingua have a speaker base of perhaps a thousand each , and Occidental and Lingua Franca Nova have some activity too .
I 've spoken in Ido for a number of hours myself and it works just fine , and I can attest that knowing one of these languages makes Romance languages much easier to read ( after learning Ido in 2005 I was suddenly able to muddle through articles in Italian , which I had never studied before ) .
Before beginning , take a quick look at this introduction to our planet Earth : That 's a paragraph written in Scots , a language ( or a dialect , see the article for information on the debate over what Scots actually is ) spoken in Scotland that as you can see is extremely similar to English .
Assuming your English is fluent , thanks to this you were able to understand pretty much everything there .
Next , take a look at this sample sentence in a few Romance languages from Wikipedia 's article on the Romance language family :
Though the amount of similarity varies from language to language you can see that all of these languages bear a fear amount of some similarity to each other , which makes sense considering their common ancestor .
If one of those were your mother tongue you would be able to understand something written in another one to a certain extent without even studying it , and if you decided to actually learn it one day it would take that much less time to learn .
In short , when studying one language ( with the exception of a few isolates ) , this naturally brings about a certain familiarity with other related languages as well .
Now to the main subject : what reasons would lie behind picking a smaller language over a larger one ?
There are basically two benefits that studying a smaller language sometimes has over a larger , more well - known one : 1 ) Economic benefit ( i.e. it 's cheaper to learn than the other language ) 2 )
Ease of learning , if one is easier than the otherSince even languages that are relatively easier to learn still take a long time to learn ( they 're still languages after all and languages take a long time to learn ) , reason # 1 is probably the more important one .
I 'll take myself as an example .
A decade ago I was living in Calgary , had a few thousand dollars to my name and an interest in Finnish .
Finnish , however , takes an English speaker a fairly long time to learn considering that it belongs to a completely different family of languages , and on top of that Finland is one of the most expensive countries out there so a few thousand Canadian dollars just would n't stretch far enough to give one enough time in the country to achieve fluency .
However , right across from Finland is a country called Estonia , and the language there belongs to the same language family ( the Finno - Ugric language family ) .
They 're not close enough to be mutually intelligible , but close enough that learning one is great preparation for learning the other .
On top of that , at the time Estonia was an extremely cheap country to live in ( and it 's still much cheaper than Finland ) , and I was able to spend a month there using only a few hundred dollars .
There was a silly spat at the time with Canada over visas and so I was only able to obtain a month - long visa and my long - term plans came to naught , but with the money I had at the time I probably could have stayed for six months or so .
You can see an interesting forum post here on the similarity between the two languages .
When staying in Tallinn ( the capital ) , the father of the family I stayed with told me about how his son ( whom I knew in Calgary as he had moved there ) had picked up Finnish as a child during the 80s just by watching Finnish TV that came in over the gulf from Helsinki , as the two cities are very close .
Suffice to say if you know Estonian you 're already more than halfway there with Finnish , and a great deal of Finnish people visit Tallinn all the time so moneywise it might even be easier to learn the language by not even going to Finland .
So this is one example of how it might be a good idea to choose to learn one language over another , if the other language you intend to learn just is n't possible to learn at the moment due to financial reasons , or if that language happens to be that much harder to learn .
And often you can pick up two languages for just a tad more than the price of one .
Here are a few other possibilities depending on how good you are at languages or your financial position : ... and so on .
The above only scratches the surface of some of the methods by which one can go about learning one or two languages in the same family .
You can see that all of these ideas are pretty unorthodox so they certainly are n't recommended for the majority , and not even a substantial minority .
But if you only have a bit of money saved up or do n't see yourself being able to make a trip abroad to an expensive or faraway country for a long time but still want to learn a language , then you might want to think about adopting an unorthodox strategy to make it happen .
Also , one last point : speakers of smaller languages are usually much , much more helpful in teaching their language to you if you are earnest about wanting to learn it , and that also makes it easier to get friends right from the start .
Most of the time they can't even believe that anyone would want to learn their tiny language in the first place .
With much larger and more influential languages you 're often just one in the crowd .
If I have any problems with Mathematica , it ’s that once I ’m empowered with the ability to get answers , I ca n’t help but ask more questions .
So it was when a conversation about flags , which are included in Mathematica ‘s CountryData , got out of hand .
“ What are the most popular colors ? ” I was asked .
Looking at them all together , it ’s hard to tell .
What if we look at the textual descriptions and see which words come up most ?
First let ’s pull together a list of color names from another data source .
We can then search for matches in the text .
Here I ’m taking the prosaic descriptions and breaking them into a list of words , then using set intersection to find those words that are also in our list of colors .
Here are the first ten .
A quick bit of counting and sorting of the full list and we see which are the most popular colors .
So now if I ever set up my own country , I know what are fashionable choices for the flag colors .
But surely some of those combinations have already been taken ?
We do n’t want the embarrassment of turning up at the UN with the same flag as someone else .
Let ’s restrict ourselves to a two - color flag from the most popular seven choices .
Next , let ’s eliminate those that already exist .
Finally , let ’s sort those according to our popularity score .
This leaves us with red and gold as the most fashionable unique two - color choice for a flag .
What about three - color flags ?
Just change the value in the Subsets command to 3 and you find that it is red , green , blue .
Does the shade matter ?
Using text analysis is a pretty limited way to look at the colors .
Consider my own UK flag and my southern neighbors ’ flag for France .
They are both red , white , and blue .
But not the SAME red , white , and blue or ,
probably , the same amounts of red , white , and blue .
If we are going to be
properly analytical , the words “ red , white , and blue ” are not a good enough description .
What if we use the actual color data from the raster images of the flags and take into account the number of pixels of each ?
I am , of course , drawn into the new question .
I ’m using a somewhat arbitrary way of deciding whether the colors are of the same Norm of the difference of the color vectors < 0.4 .
There are other ways , and using a smaller tolerance will judge closer colors to be different .
The code works by counting the number of pixels of distinctly different color , dividing the count through by the total number of pixels , and then sorting into descending popularity .
Let ’s test our function on the Spanish flag .
I can determine from the chart that it is 51.6 % red .
We need a function to collect together this data for all the countries and merge values from different flags that are roughly the same color .
Now we simply analyze all the world ’s flags and use this function to aggregate the data .
The result is pretty complicated , so I want words and pictures to understand it .
First , I need a name to describe the resulting colors .
This new function searches ColorData for the best match , e.g. we find that the combined intensity of 50 % red , 20 % green , and 70 % blue is best described by Mathematica as DeepCobaltViolet .
Now I want a custom version of the BarChart function , with bars in the right colors and labels using this new name function .
Here is the result .
There we have an answer — if you put all 237 flags of the world together , the greatest area covered is red , followed by white and green .
There are many significantly different shades of blue in use , with something around midnight blue ( labeled Ultramarine on the chart ) being the most popular .
But a new question comes to mind !
What if we took into account the populations of the countries ?
There are more people represented by the colors of the Chinese and Indian flags than there are by the flags of Pitcairn Islands and Cocos Keeling Islands .
All we need to do is repeat the step of aggregating the data , but this time multiply each color area by the population of the country in question .
So now we know all about the popularity of individual colors , but I feel a new question coming on .
If we average out the colors , do we see a trend across the map ?
Let ’s start by creating an average color out of a flag .
Just take the mean of all the pixels .
Then inspect the result .
The uneven contrasting patchwork is a little surprising .
After a little thought , I have a hypothesis : the historical point of flags was to tell your side from your enemy ’s in battle , and the enemy was most often your neighbor .
The hypothesis would assert that substantial local variance is deliberate .
Can we confirm that ?
Oh no , another question !
How to resolve this one ?
Well , what if we consider the color difference between the averaged flag and the averaged flag of a neighboring country ?
If I am right , the value will be higher than the difference between that flag and a non-neighboring country .
Of course , we need to average this over all the neighbors and all the non-neighbors to see if there is a general bias .
Let ’s test .
This claims that the average difference in color of the averaged Belgian flag and its neighbors France , Germany , Luxembourg , and the Netherlands is 0.45 by my color metric .
Slightly less than the 0.46 difference between Belgium and the rest of the world , making my theory wrong .
Perhaps the Belgians are particularly peaceful !
Let ’s finish by running it for the entire world ( excluding island nations that have no neighbors ) and taking the average .
My theory of warring nations is significantly wrong .
There is 10 % less average color difference between neighbors .
Perhaps my eyes are just too good at seeing color differences ?
To get a smoother image , let ’s apply a topological moving average .
Each color is averaged with its immediate neighbors .
However , I think the trends that we see are more influenced by a few well - connected countries with strong colors exerting undue influence on the moving average .
Probably better would be to use a moving average based on distance rather than shared borders .
But by now there are lots of questions in my mind … is there a pattern to order of colors , number of colors , or orientation of patterns ?
Of course Mathematica can provide the answers , but I ’ve decided to stop here as it would also , no doubt , provoke even more questions .

Of the many aspects of adolescent mental health , it appears watching television and depression go together .
A study in the February issue of Archives of General Psychiatry describes a national , heterogeneous sample of students , grades 7 to 12 , for whom depression increased with each additional hour of television viewing .
Seven years after the study began , by 7.4 percent met criteria for depression .
This is slightly higher than the 5 percent estimate for teen depression given by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry .
Study results are based on 4142 people who were not depressed at the beginning of the study .
Males seem to be more vulnerable than females .
It is not clear whether people watch TV because they are depressed , or what they see ( idealized gender roles , risky behavior , disturbing images ) , or whether a pre-existing vulnerability leads to more viewing time .
Still , the authors conclude , " television and overall media exposure are associated with the development of depressive symptoms in young adulthood . "
Depression is a treatable disorder .

GM 's new restructuring plan seeks another $ 16.6 billion in government aid -- for now .
Chrysler wants an additional $ 5 billion .
The $ 30 billion that GM has either received or requested since December does n't count the $ 8 billion it wants to develop fuel - efficient cars , and another $ 6 billion it 's soliciting from foreign governments .
For these taxpayer subsidies , the government could buy hundreds of thousands of GM cars a month and give them to deserving citizens .
Make mine a Corvette , please .

Renowned British musician Brian Eno will curate a three - week music festival at the Sydney Opera House , while the city is illuminated by light installations as part of the new Vivid Sydney event .
The New South Wales Government says the festival of music , lights and ideas will be the biggest event of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere .
The festival will run from May 26 to June 14 and will feature four major events , including the Luminous music festival at the Opera House curated by Eno - best known for his work with Roxy Music , David Bowie , U2 , Talking Heads and Coldplay .
The Opera House sails will be lit up by a changing display designed by Eno throughout the music festival , which will include performances by New York band Battles , UK electropop outfit Ladytron , Irish singer - songwriter Damien Dempsey and comedian and musician Reggie Watts .
The second event - Smart Light Sydney - will feature light installations created by Australian and international artists and placed from Sydney Observatory , through the Rocks to Circular Quay .
A three - night food and music festival will be held at The Rocks , where the focus will be a recreation of the tragic 1814 sinking of the convict ship The Three Bees under the Sydney Harbour Bridge .
Creative industry seminars , workshops and performances will also be held throughout Vivid Sydney under the banner of the fourth event , Creative Sydney .
Eno will be in residence at the Opera House throughout the festival and will participate in talks and performances with artists and other guests .
Luminous will also feature Eno's audio- visual installation - 77 Million Paintings - created for the Venice Biennale .
In a statement , he says the artists and musicians slated for the festival are only alike in the sense that they cannot be categorised .
" They are people who work in the new territories , the places in between , the places out at the edges , " he said .
" Some of them take old forms and infuse them with new life and make them new again , and others have invented forms of art that did n't previously exist . "
Light extragavanza
Events NSW chief Geoff Parmenter says Vivid Sydney will generate $ 10 million worth of economic activity in its first year .
He says the figure is expected to grow in subsequent years .
Mr Parmenter says Smart Light Sydney will be the biggest light festival in the Southern Hemisphere .
" It 's actually a sustainable light festival using a special technology that uses tiny amounts of power , a bit like Sculptures By The Sea but along the harbour foreshore and featuring a bunch of Sydney 's landmark buildings , " he said .
The three - day Fire Water festival will be held in the Rocks from June 12 to 14 , featuring fire sculptures , light installations , music , food stalls and the recreation of the Three Bees tragedy .
Organisers say a sculpture of the ship will emerge from the water below the Harbour Bridge on each of the three evenings , before it catches fire and sinks .
Visitors will be invited to create floating lanterns and put them in the bay to symbolise the descendants of the 210 Irish convicts who died on the ship when it caught alight with 30 kegs of gunpowder and loaded cannons on board at Sydney Cove .
Mr Parmenter says Vivid Sydney will compliment the already popular and well established Sydney Festival .
" We felt that there 's a recognised gap in the calendar at this time of year and an opportunity to create something that we expect in a short space of time can become a very substantial signature event for Sydney , showcasing Sydney 's fantastic creative credentials , " he said .
Eno became prominent in the early 1970s as a member of Roxy Music .
He has collaborated with and produced albums for U2 , David Bowie , Devo , Coldplay , John Cale , Talking Heads and David Byrne .
As a solo artist , he is considered a pioneer of modern ambient music .
Fishers and scientists announced this week the catch , and release , of what is likely the world 's largest known freshwater giant stingray .
The giant stingray , weighing an estimated 550 to 990 pounds ( 250 to 450 kilograms ) was reeled in on January 28 , 2009 , as part of a National Geographic expedition in Thailand .
The stingray 's body measured 6.6 feet ( 2 meters ) wide by 6.9 feet ( 2.1 ) meters long .
The tail was missing .
If it had been there , the ray 's total length would have been between 14.8 and 16.4 feet ( 4.5 and 5 meters ) , estimated University of Nevada Biologist Zeb Hogan .
Hogan was in Thailand searching for giant fish as part of the Megafishes Project — an effort to document Earth 's 20 or so freshwater giants .
The new find gives Hogan hope that the giant stingray , once overfished , may be more abundant than previously thought .
And it may confirm the giant stingray as the heavyweight champ of the Megafishes Project .
" Honestly , we just do n't know how much it weighed .
But it 's clear that the giant stingray has the potential to be the largest freshwater fish in the world , " said Hogan , also a National Geographic Emerging Explorer .
( National Geographic News is owned by the National Geographic Society . )
" The Thai populations were once considered critically endangered , although with the discovery of new populations the stingray 's abundance appears higher than previously believed , " added Hogan .
The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) currently lists the freshwater giant stingray as vulnerable .
Last March , Hogan found a 14 - foot - long ( 4.3 - meter-long ) ray near the Thai city of Chachoengsao .
Freshwater giant stingrays are among the largest of the approximately 200 species of rays .
They can be found in a handful of rivers in Southeast Asia and northern Australia .
Much is still unknown about the mammoth ray species , including whether or not it can swim out to and survive at sea .
The species was first described scientifically only in 1989 .
For the most part , advocates of free markets contend that competition and innovation go hand - in - hand , as individuals and companies compete to find optimal solutions that will bring them financial success .
There 's a glaring exception to that , however : the patent system , which has a lottery - like , winner - takes - all reward structure .
Anyone who successfully patents an innovation is granted a monopoly for its use , a trade - off that is considered a necessary reward to spur innovation .
The current patent system , however , is beginning to show signs of stress , and there have been a number of questions regarding its basic assumptions .
Although it 's not part of the changes being considered in the current patent reform efforts , the use of temporary monopolies as a reward for innovation has been challenged in academic circles .
That debate has now reached the pages of Science , where a new paper spells out the alternative right in its title : " Promoting Intellectual Discovery : Patents Versus Markets . "
The paper spells out a number of reasons why patent monopolies may not be the spur for innovation that they 're intended to be : partial solutions do n't get any reward , fragmented ownership of innovations can inhibit their use , downstream licensing can inhibit markets well outside of the scope of the innovation , etc .
The problems are tied together by the fact that intellectual property is hard to define , meaning all of these issues will almost certainly require repeated trips to the legal system to sort out .
The authors argue that there have been some cases where a period of patent - free innovation took place in a way that ensured that the innovators were still rewarded .
Their prime example is the case of the mining industry in Cornwall , England , where the expiration of several patents on steam engines spurred a period of openly shared innovations that led to rapid improvements in steam engine design .
( You can read an academic examination of this period if you 're so inclined . )
The lack of intellectual property allowed multiple improvements to be incorporated in a single design , while the innovators benefited from having their mines operate more efficiently ahead of their competition .
This being a Science paper , the authors engaged in an experiment to see how well these open innovation systems worked in a model market .
To do this , they turned to what 's called the knapsack problem .
Students were given a list of 10 items , each with different weights and values .
Given limits to the number of items they could choose and the total weight of the items , the students were asked to maximize the total value .
The authors set up two different types of experiments .
In one , there was a winner - take - all monetary prize for the first optimal solution .
In the other , the students were assigned shares in each of the objects , and given the opportunity to trade the shares on an open exchange ; when the trial was over , rewards would be given based on the number of shares people held in items that were used in the optimal solution .
For all but the most difficult case , where only the market system arrived at a solution , both systems resulted in the discovery of an optimal system .
The key difference seems to be that , in the market system , more of the participants finished with an optimized system .
The authors present evidence that suggests that prices of the items acted to communicate information on the solution among the market 's participants .
Although it would be nice to think that open innovation could lead to efficient solutions , the authors seem to be overselling their ( somewhat weak ) evidence by claiming their experiment shows the " superiority " of the market system .
In any case , even they recognize that the controlled experimental environment may not provide an accurate reflection of a real environment .
Basically , for this system to reward innovators , they must not only have something required for their solution to invest in , but also the capital to do the investing .
One thing the authors neglected to note is that the price of the item being invested in actually has to respond some way to the solution .
Since many process innovations involve switching to cheap and abundant raw materials , it 's hard to see this system working at all in these cases .
In short , this appears to be a case where a proposed solution — market - based innovation rewards , in this case — may work in a subset of cases , but identifying that subset and implementing this solution in it may exact more of a cost than simply continuing with the existing system does .

A paper published in the January 29th issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters confirms what astronomers have been suspecting for the past couple of years , and namely that the atmosphere around Saturn 's moon , Titan , which is approximately 10 times denser than that of the Earth , is capable of producing clouds of methane that consequentially form rain .
These precipitations can fill larger craters on the moon 's surface , and thus give birth to new lakes , filled with hydrocarbons .
The natural satellite has a diameter of about 3,200 miles ( 5,150 kilometers ) , and is larger in size than Mercury .
It 's also about 40 percent the size of the Earth , and harbors a large variety of lakes on its surface , as evidenced by the latest findings sent back by the Cassini space probe .
By comparing data on the same region of Titan from two separate flights , one in 2004 and another in 2005 , researchers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory , in Laurel , Maryland , led by Cassini imaging team associate Elizabeth Turtle , have managed to determine that in less than a year a lake was formed in a place where nothing was visible a twelvemonth before .
The same instrument aboard Cassini , the Imaging Science Subsystem ( ISS ) , was used for both sets of pictures .
This find only comes to strengthen the belief that a system of volcanoes on the moon 's surface fuels the atmosphere with methane , allowing it to condense in the air , and then fall back down as rain .
Liquid hydrocarbons thus fill crater holes and create lakes on the surface of the satellite , a fact that is most obvious in its northern regions , which seem to be more rich in the stuff than the southern ones .
" The clouds , when we look at them over a period of a few hours , behave like convective clouds , the same way you have thunderstorms on Earth .
If you watch them over a few hours , they kind of billow upwards the same way thunderheads do on Earth , " Turtle told Space .

To Bradley Schlozman , they were “ mold spores , ” “ commies ” and “ crazy libs . ”
He was referring to the career lawyers in the Justice Department ’s civil rights and voting rights divisions .
From 2003 to 2006 , Schlozman was a Bush appointee who supervised them .
Along with several others , he came to symbolize the midlevel political appointees who brought a hard - edged ideology to the day - to - day workings of the Justice Department .
“ My tentative plans are to gerrymander all of those crazy libs right out of the section , ” he said in an e-mail in 2003 .
“ I too get to work with mold spores , but here in Civil Rights , we call them Voting Section attorneys , ” he confided to another friend .
He hoped to get rid of the “ Democrats ” and “ liberals ” because they were “ disloyal ” and replace them with “ real Americans ” and “ right - thinking Americans . ”

He appears to have succeeded by his standards , according to an inspector general ’s report released Tuesday .
Among the newly hired lawyers whose political or ideological views could be discerned , 63 of 65 lawyers hired under Schlozman had Republican or conservative credentials , the report said .
Slapping down “ a bunch of . . . attorneys really did get the blood pumping and was even enjoyable once in a while , ” Schlozman wrote three years later when he left to become the U.S. attorney in Kansas City , Mo .
Schlozman surrounded himself with like - minded officials at the Department of Justice .
When he was due to meet in 2004 with John Tanner , then chief of the voting section , he asked how Tanner liked his coffee .
“ Mary Frances Berry style -- black and bitter , ” Tanner replied by e-mail , referring to the African American woman who chaired the U.S. Civil Rights Commission from 1993 to 2004 .
Schlozman circulated the e-mail .
“ Y’all will appreciate Tanner ’s response , ” he wrote .

The inspector general concluded Schlozman violated the civil services laws while at the Justice Department .
While the president ’s appointees are entitled to run the department and set policy , they are prohibited from considering “ political affiliations ” in deciding on who serves in career positions in the federal government .
“ We found that Schlozman inappropriately considered political and ideological affiliations in hiring career attorneys , ” said the report issued jointly by Inspector General Glenn A. Fine and H. Marshall Jarrett , who heads the Office of Professional Responsibility .
The report cited the abusive language as evidence of the harsh political tone .
Peter Carr , a Justice Department spokesman , said it “ describes troubling conduct ” from the recent past , but added , “ We are confident that the institutional problems identified in today ’s report no longer exist and will not occur . ”
Separately , the U.S. attorney ’s office in Washington announced it will not seek to prosecute Schlozman for giving false testimony to Congress .
Patricia Riley , a spokeswoman for that office , said acting U.S. Atty .
Jeffrey A. Taylor stepped aside , and six career prosecutors looked into the case against Schlozman .

Joseph D. Rich , the former chief of the voting rights section , said the report “ confirms the disdain and vitriol they had for career civil rights attorneys .
He called us ‘ mold spores . ’
That kind of epitomizes his view .
He was probably the most miserable person I ever worked for , ” said Rich , who retired in 2007 after a 37 - year career at the Justice Department .

Most BitTorrent sites operate in the shadows , with operators who rarely speak in public and guard their identities closely .
Mininova is not one of those sites and in a new interview , company directors Erik Dubbelboer and Niek van der Maas reveal a little more about running one of the world 's biggest BitTorrent sites .
Most visitors to Mininova will be completely unaware that this is not your regular torrent site .
Unlike many private torrent sites – operating on the fringes of legality and trying to keep a fairly low profile ( whilst gathering donations in order to stay alive ) – Mininova is a very successful and fully - fledged tax - paying business with a revenue of well over a million dollar a year .
Operating out of its new offices in Utrecht , The Netherlands , Mininova and its five company directors go about their daily business with unparalleled openness .
In a new interview with ORF .at , they further peel away the mystique usually associated with running a huge torrent site .

Erik Dubbelboer , President of Mininova told ORF that although some people believe that The Pirate Bay is the largest torrent site , in truth Mininova is quite bigger in terms of page views .
The site is commercially - driven now , however , it has n’t always been that way .
Erik explained that in the beginning there was no plan to have Mininova operate as a company .
“ We wanted to make a cool website and experiment with the exciting Bittorrent technology , ” he told ORF
But of course , the site was a huge success and now receives a staggering number of visitors .
Managing Director
Niek van der Maas explained that this substantial traffic is used to drive the site ’s main source of revenue – advertising , including deals with companies like Yahoo .
The increased popularity of the site has allowed the Mininova team to grow .
“ We have turned Mininova from our hobby into a profession , ” said Erik .
Indeed , the site now has five young employees ( average age of 24 ) who are all studying computer science .
Mininova ’s Erik and Niek ( photo richard .
pyrker )
While other torrent site admins choose to stay in the shadows , Mininova ’s owners operate openly as they believe that under current law in The Netherlands their operations are entirely legal .
Unlike other large ‘ open ’ sites , such as The Pirate Bay , Mininova does not operate a public tracker , and unlike their Swedish counterparts they operate a proper copyright takedown request system .
If a copyright holder wants a torrent removed , they can write to the site and the necessary action is taken promptly .
Unfortunately , even this is n’t enough to keep anti-piracy outfits at arms length and like The Pirate Bay before them , Mininova also faces legal action .
BREIN , the prominent Dutch anti-piracy group ( which has already run many torrent sites out of The Netherlands ) had been in secret talks with Mininova for over a year , ostensibly trying to reach a negotiated settlement .
But it was n’t to be .
BREIN wanted Mininova to proactively filter their search engine , something the site was not prepared to do .
At the time , Erik told TorrentFreak that Mininova will not cave in to pressure from BREIN .
“ We will proceed to court with full confidence .
We operate within the law , as we maintain our ‘ notice and take down ’ policy .
That is , we remove search results if a copyright holder asks us to . ”
The court showdown with BREIN will take place May 20th .
Mininova is being defended by lawyer Christiaan Alberdingk
Thijm , who is known for his legal victory while representing KaZaA in The Netherlands .
Erik told ORF that he believes the first major process in the case will try to determine if the type of service operated by Mininova is legal or not .
He noted that there are key differences between their case and the recent one involving The Pirate Bay – the action in The Netherlands is a civil suit , while the case in Sweden was a criminal trial directed at the individuals , not the site itself .
Erik went on to say that he ’d spoken recently with Peter Sunde about the TPB case , one which Peter firmly believes they will win .
Erik says they speak with Gottfrid too on technical issues but other than that , there is no cooperation between the sites .
When asked how he felt the court would rule in The Pirate Bay case , Erik said it was too difficult to call .
One of the reasons that sites like Mininova exist is due to the changing viewing habits of tech - savvy individuals , something which torrent sites have embraced while mainstream media continue to lag behind .
“ I would like to see content when I have time for it – not only at the time when it ’s broadcasted , ” Erik told ORF .
“ Some companies are starting to think and rethink , asking us how they can benefit from our “ content distribution ” model .
They recognize that the fight against file - sharing is hopeless , ” he said .
In a further indication that BitTorrent is able to move from the PC screen to the living room , regular visitors to Mininova will have noticed the recent addition of a link labeled ‘ New : Devices Overview ‘ .
Listed here are various BitTorrent - compatible ‘ set - top box ’ type devices recommended by Mininova .
Erik Dubbelboer says that at the recent CeBIT trade show , several manufacturers showed an interest in having a ‘ Powered by Mininova ’ logo / license for their devices , including Hauppauge who are perhaps best known for their PC TV tuner cards .
Mininova is very interested in experimenting with new business models for content creators , Dubbelboer said .
He said that most people download copyrighted files because it ’s so easy and convenient , not because they ’re free .
One thing is certain , BitTorrent is a great distribution model which allows many artists just setting out to get their work in front of millions of people .
Silence is Sexy is one band that has teamed up with Mininova to distribute their latest album for free , with great success .
They even put up a ‘ Powered by Mininova ’ banner at one of their latest concerts .
This year will be an exciting one for the Mininova team .
On the one hand they are still experiencing a substantial increase in visitor numbers as well as interest from content producers and device manufacturers .
However , the legal battle with MPAA ’s affiliate BREIN may ruin this party if the worst case scenario becomes truth .
Let ’s hope for the best .
BAGHDAD 
Two sophisticated suicide bombings , including one on Tuesday in which 33 people died just outside Baghdad , and other recent violence are raising fears that jihadi militants and hard - line Baathists may be renewing their deadly partnership to threaten the largely calm Iraqi capital .
Iraqi military leaders emphasized that it was too early to draw any firm conclusions but noted similarities in the attacks in which more than 60 people were killed since Sunday .
While overall violence in Iraq remains the lowest since the American invasion , both recent attacks were against Iraqi soldiers operating with relatively high security , suggesting much planning and coordination .
The worry among some Iraqi military officials is that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia , a largely homegrown Islamist militant group , and Sunni insurgents loyal to Saddam Hussein and his Baath Party have put aside their differences to destabilize Iraq as the United States military proceeds with its plans to withdraw .
“ We have said before that Qaeda was broken , but it was not finished , ” said Hadi al - Ameri , the chairman of the Security Committee in the Iraqi Parliament and the leader of the Badr Organization , the former armed wing of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , a Shiite political party .

Plato predicted that democracies , by splintering the consensus that founds a civilization into atoms formed of individual wills , become so chaotic that at some point , tyranny is desired by the citizens and so comes to pass .
Every civilization has a life cycle , from birth to death , says Plato .
At birth , it has the simplest form of rule , which is aristocracy , or a hereditary group of its morally best and smartest people .
When they run down or are overthrown , in comes military rule .
After that , it ’s oligarchy , which roughly corresponds to a libertarian ideal — those who have money rule , like a Southern Plantation culture .
But that gives way to democracy , he says :
The oligarch changes into the democrat in the following manner : —
The youth who has had a miserly bringing up , gets a taste of the droneâ€™s honey ; he meets with wild companions , who introduce him to every new pleasure .
Plato , The Republic
As soon as democracy comes about , Plato writes , there are numerous changes in the attitudes of the population that end up being a complete fracturing of the consensus that holds that society together .
Instead of one set of values , rules , customs and goals , there are now as many as there are citizens .
We call this process atomization .
And if any offer of alliance or parley of individual elders comes from home , the false spirits shut the gates of the castle and permit no one to enter , â€ ” there is a battle , and they gain the victory ; and straightway making alliance with the desires , they banish modesty , which they call folly , and send temperance over the border .
When the house has been swept and garnished , they dress up the exiled vices , and , crowning them with garlands , bring them back under new names .
Insolence they call good breeding , anarchy freedom , waste magnificence , impudence courage .
Such is the process by which the youth passes from the necessary pleasures to the unnecessary .
Plato is critiquing the psychology of the democratic man at this point .
He describes something not unlike the Norse vision of Ragnarok or the Hindu vision of Kali - Yuga : an end times where trust is impossible , people are corrupt , everything is crass and gross and commercialized , and in this whoring all values have been inverted and replaced with an ethic of convenience that leads to long - term destruction .
Let us now inspect the individual democrat ; and first , as in the case of the State , we will trace his antecedents …
Necessary pleasures are those which are good , and which we cannot do without ; unnecessary pleasures are those which do no good , and of which the desire might be eradicated by early training … the drone , as we called him , is the slave of these unnecessary pleasures and desires , whereas the miserly oligarch is subject only to the necessary .
The distinction he ’s drawing here is between first - world and third - world behavior .
First - world people can put off pleasure until after they ’ve accomplished something ; third world people are slaves to the short term , and to their pleasures , and so never build infrastructure , develop learning , etc .
That sounds more un - PC than it is , because if you read Toynbee and Spengler you will see that third world states are basically failed attempts at first world states , and that the reason they seem exotic ethnically is because they are remnants of cosmopolitan mixed - race populations blurred into a monoculture .
Plato describes a neurosis we can observe in our current society :
After a while he divides his time impartially between them ; and perhaps , when he gets older and the violence of passion has abated , he restores some of the exiles and lives in a sort of equilibrium , indulging first one pleasure and then another ; and if reason comes and tells him that some pleasures are good and honourable , and others bad and vile , he shakes his head and says that he can make no distinction between them .
Thus he lives in the fancy of the hour ; sometimes he takes to drink , and then he turns abstainer ; he practises in the gymnasium or he does nothing at all ; then again he would be a philosopher or a politician ; or again , he would be a warrior or a man of business ; he is â€ ˜Every thing by starts and nothing long.â€ ™
Ever notice how our time is choked by New Age -y pursuits ?
People are looking for that Next Big Thing , whether it ’s Yoga or fire - walking or Acai berries or whatever ; they want to find the one thing to give their lives meaning , because they ’re adrift in the meaningless void of having no direction , no script , and no narrative to move them forward , because they ’re in a time that has inverted all values .
Plato ’s description of democracy is unflinching in its critique :
The manner of life in such a State is that of democrats ; there is freedom and plainness of speech , and every man does what is right in his own eyes , and has his own way of life .
Hence arise the most various developments of character ; the State is like a piece of embroidery of which the colours and figures are the manners of men , and there are many who , like women and children , prefer this variety to real beauty and excellence .
The State is not one but many , like a bazaar at which you can buy anything .
That ’s his description of atomization : every person trying to do something different and special , thus there ’s zero consensus .
The great charm is , that you may do as you like ; you may govern if you like , let it alone if you like ; go to war and make peace if you feel disposed , and all quite irrespective of anybody else .
In dysfunction , there is no accountability .
That feels good until you see the consequences .
When you condemn men to death they remain alive all the same ; a gentleman is desired to go into exile , and he stalks about the streets like a hero ; and nobody sees him or cares for him .
Observe , too , how grandly Democracy sets her foot upon all our fine theories of education , — how little she cares for the training of her statesmen !
The only qualification which she demands is the profession of patriotism .
Such is democracy ; — a pleasing , lawless , various sort of government , distributing equality to equals and unequals alike .
Whether you ’re right or left , you have allegiance to the ideals of your state , and so you are patriotic — which is the only requirement .
You do not have to actually engage in society at large .
Just wave the flag , even if a flag of protest , and you ’re accepted into the group .
How does democracy come about ?
The sturdy pauper finds that in the hour of danger he is not despised ; he sees the rich man puffing and panting , and draws the conclusion which he privately imparts to his companions , â€ ” â€ ˜that our people are not good for much ; â€ ™ and as a sickly frame is made ill by a mere touch from without , or sometimes without external impulse is ready to fall to pieces of itself , so from the least cause , or with none at all , the city falls ill and fights a battle for life or death .
And democracy comes into power when the poor are the victors , killing some and exiling some , and giving equal shares in the government to all the rest .
Sounds like the French and Russian revolutions , or the bloodless revolutions of 1968 .
Plato then sounds a note of warning about how democracy leads to the next stage , tyranny :
Tyranny springs from democracy much as democracy springs from oligarchy .
Both arise from excess ; the one from excess of wealth , the other from excess of freedom .
â€ ˜The great natural good of life , â€™ says the democrat , â€ ˜is freedom.â€ ™
And this exclusive love of freedom and regardlessness of everything else , is the cause of the change from democracy to tyranny .
This is Plato ’s description of what is going to come .
It ’s a subtle “ meta - thesis ” : that by focusing on freedom , and ignoring other vital parts of society , people encourage downfall .
It ’s like the farmer who thinks the vital thing is to get seed in the ground , and then is dismayed to find a conspiracy of details like drainage , pests , drought and other things not related to planting bring down his crop .
Plato then describes the mentality of late stage democracy — a demand for “ freedom ” bordering on anarchy :
The State demands the strong wine of freedom , and unless her rulers give her a plentiful draught , punishes and insults them ; equality and fraternity of governors and governed is the approved principle .
Anarchy is the law , not of the State only , but of private houses , and extends even to the animals .
Father and son , citizen and foreigner , teacher and pupil , old and young , are all on a level ; fathers and teachers fear their sons and pupils , and the wisdom of the young man is a match for the elder , and the old imitate the jaunty manners of the young because they are afraid of being thought morose .
Slaves are on a level with their masters and mistresses , and there is no difference between men and women .
At last the citizens become so sensitive that they cannot endure the yoke of laws , written or unwritten ; they would have no man call himself their master .
This state of duality is completely neurotic : people are in a civilization , which requires collectivism , but they insist on anti-collectivism as their organizing principle .
Even more , since their principle ( freedom ) sounds positive but really is a negative ( freedom from x , y or z ) they are prone to strike against those who do not support freedom as the absolute goal .
Like most universals , or absolute and contextless demands , freedom obscures the need for other parts of a civilization , like a goal , order , learning , culture and so on .
In fact , by the very nature of its negative inclination , “ freedom ” is opposed to ever having a goal .
Such is the glorious beginning of things out of which tyranny springs .
â€ ˜Glorious , indeed ; but what is to follow ?â€ ™
The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy ; for there is a law of contraries ; the excess of freedom passes into the excess of slavery , and the greater the freedom the greater the slavery .
You will remember that in the oligarchy were found two classesâ€ ” rogues and paupers , whom we compared to drones with and without stings .
These two classes are to the State what phlegm and bile are to the human body ; and the State - physician , or legislator , must get rid of them , just as the bee - master keeps the drones out of the hive .
Now in a democracy , too , there are drones , but they are more numerous and more dangerous than in the oligarchy ; there they are inert and unpractised , here they are full of life and animation ; and the keener sort speak and act , while the others buzz about the bema and prevent their opponents from being heard .
And there is another class in democratic States , of respectable , thriving individuals , who can be squeezed when the drones have need of their possessions ; there is moreover a third class , who are the labourers and the artisans , and they make up the mass of the people .
When the people meet , they are omnipotent , but they cannot be brought together unless they are attracted by a little honey ; and the rich are made to supply the honey , of which the demagogues keep the greater part themselves , giving a taste only to the mob .
Plato introduces two psychological archetypes here and two social archetypes :
Psychological archetypes Drones : clueless , perpetually impoverished people who cannot plan for the future and so squander whatever they have and then need a bailout .
Trailer parks and urban ghettoes provide a modern example .
clueless , perpetually impoverished people who cannot plan for the future and so squander whatever they have and then need a bailout .
Trailer parks and urban ghettoes provide a modern example .
Rogues : these are passive aggressive thieves , or wolves in sheep ’s clothing , who act for their own selfish gain in every situation , and so wreck civilization by sewing distrust and socialized costs .
Modern examples might include Bernard Madoff and Rod Blagojevich .
Plato thinks a healthy society will remove both rogues and drones , because drones through stupidity empower rogues with their greater numbers , and rogues through their single - mindedness victimize people with more ambitious , whole views of life .
Too much of these people and a society collapses , as Jonathan Haidt explains .
What has happened is the laying of a foundation for class warfare .
Let ’s look at the two class distinctions :
Social archetypes Bourgeoisie .
Plato says “ respectable , thriving individuals ” and by this he means the middle class , conventionally called bourgeois because at this stage their entire morality is to earn money and buy their way out of social decay .
If you ’re reading this and understanding it , your parents probably belong to this group .
Plato says “ respectable , thriving individuals ” and by this he means the middle class , conventionally called bourgeois because at this stage their entire morality is to earn money and buy their way out of social decay .
If you ’re reading this and understanding it , your parents probably belong to this group .
Working classes .
These are called labourers and artisans , but nowadays we ’d know them as people who work in factories , restaurants and with machines at semi-skilled jobs .
This group is often confused with the drones because there is so much overlap between the two ; one way to view it is that some of the working classes are drones because of their psychology , while all of the working classes end up laborers and artisans because it is the kind of work to which they are drawn .
So about that class war : the drones and rogues conspire to mobilize the working classes to demand free stuff from the government , a process called entitlement .
It is this class war , coming up against the boundaries of a civilization that demands freedom but not order , that shapes the tyrant :
Their victims attempt to resist ; they are driven mad by the stings of the drones , and so become downright oligarchs in self - defence .
Then follow informations and convictions for treason .
The people have some protector whom they nurse into greatness , and from this root the tree of tyranny springs .
The nature of the change is indicated in the old fable of the temple of Zeus Lycaeus , which tells how he who tastes human flesh mixed up with the flesh of other victims will turn into a wolf .
Even so the protector , who tastes human blood , and slays some and exiles others with or without law , who hints at abolition of debts and division of lands , must either perish or become a wolfâ€ ” that is , a tyrant .
Class war drives the upper half of the middle classes — in modern terms , this is households clearing more than $ 140,000 a year — into a defensive position , at which point they start to be winner take all .
A modern example is the bonuses on Wall Street that are most of each employee ’s salary ; they reward themselves handsomely because they know that without a half - million - dollar house , private schools for the kids , private medical plans and organic food , they ’re going to get dragged down into the social morass of the drones .
During this class war , because the crowd comprised of drones and labourers , egged on by rogues ( demagogues ) , will demand everything it can get , the bourgeois start to fight dirty .
They start hiding money and hiding behind private security .
It ’s slowly dawning on them that the crowd of irresponsible people hates them for being responsible , and they ’re going to do their best to take the fruits of that responsibility and throw out the responsible people if not outright kill , rape and maim them .
I call the bourgeois reacting to a class war second - stage oligarchs .
They ’re not like the oligarchy stage that precedes democracy , which I equate to something like the Mafia or Southern Plantation style living : although the big boss takes a lot , and may spread corruption in the “ official ” government , the official government is useless and the big boss gets stuff done and takes care of his people .
In Sicily , the Mafia at least used to be a net positive ; in the South , the planter social hierarchy kept everyone fed , which was not the case after the war ( skipping for a moment other questions and concerns about the South ’s political structure ) .
At that point , The People appoint themselves a guardian and protector who promises to bring equality — or revenge upon the rich , since they have something to lose where no one else does .
Of course , the wealthier people do n’t take this lying down , and so the protector is unable to protect himself , and asks for a private army :
Perhaps he is driven out , but he soon comes back from exile ; and then if his enemies cannot get rid of him by lawful means , they plot his assassination .
Thereupon the friend of the people makes his well - known request to them for a body - guard , which they readily grant , thinking only of his danger and not of their own .
Now let the rich man make to himself wings , for he will never run away again if he does not do so then .
And the Great Protector , having crushed all his rivals , stands proudly erect in the chariot of State , a full - blown tyrant .
Bang .
In that final step , you have reached a Soviet / French Revolution style state .
These in turn collapse because , since all of their goals like freedom are negative , they have no actual plan and end up dividing up the wealth and infighting while the country collapses around them .
However , since the tyrant already has the power … well , there ’s not much chance of him or her being overthrown .
In fact , The People have put him in power and for at least the first few decades find it hard to admit they ’ve screwed up , which gives the tyrant a free ride to strengthen the centralized power of the state .
Modern people , who have the attention span of gnats and cannot think past a two - week period ( paycheck to paycheck ) , imagine that a tyrannical state comes about because the state demands more power to accomplish the goals of the state .
What is important about the knowledge Plato brings us is that it shows that tyranny comes about through the state being divided , so that its two parts can play good - cop / bad - cop much as the Democrats and Republicans , respectively , seem to in our media .
Are there any signs of aggressive protectors on the horizon ?
James Hansen , a climate modeller with Nasa , told the Guardian today that corporate lobbying has undermined democratic attempts to curb carbon pollution .
“ The democratic process does n’t quite seem to be working , ” he said .
Speaking on the eve of joining a protest against the headquarters of power firm E.ON in Coventry , Hansen said : “ The first action that people should take is to use the democratic process .
What is frustrating people , me included , is that democratic action affects elections but what we get then from political leaders is greenwash .
“ The democratic process is supposed to be one person one vote , but it turns out that money is talking louder than the votes .
So , I ’m not surprised that people are getting frustrated .
I think that peaceful demonstration is not out of order , because we ’re running out of time . ” – The Guardian
This is just one such example .
Other recent threats have included : Hitler - like dictators , racism , drugs , and Communism .
Hansen is speaking in code .
Peaceful protests are legal and socially acceptable ; he ’s hinting to his fellow scientists and listeners that democratic process is not working and is not going to work .
Why ?
Well , those second - stage oligarchs are tired of the drones massing together and making grabs for their wealth , so they ’re doing their best to pollute and neutralize public opinion .
In many ways , welfare lines next to fast food joints and liquor stores are the ultimate weapon of the second stage oligarchs ; keep the drones stoned , fat and spaced out on television .
Our country would probably run a lot better if we advertised incorrect voting dates on television .
It ’s possible global warming is a power grab .
It ’s possible it ’s not .
Even more likely is that it ’s both : one group is ready to grab power , and gets an opportunity that , by blowing it out of proportion or demanding unreasonable action , can be used to corner the populace into a state of revolt .
The above statement by Hansen would be setting the stage ; if we get some weird hurricanes or ice storms in summer that kill lots of people and make life inconvenient , the rogues are going to start bloviating about how it ’s global warming and we need to overthrow the bourgeois .
Here ’s another part of that hammer :
Growing world population will cause a “ perfect storm ” of food , energy and water shortages by 2030 , the UK government chief scientist has warned .
Demand for food and energy will jump 50 % by 2030 and for fresh water by 30 % , as the population tops 8.3 billion , he told a conference in London .
Climate change will exacerbate matters in unpredictable ways , he added .
“ My main concern is what will happen internationally , there will be food and water shortages , ” he said . –
BBC
It ’s the resource wars , he ’s saying .
There ’s not going to be enough water and food , and with our growth in the third world ( the industrialized world has negative growth ) there will be a Malthusian conflict between the number of people we have and the resources available to sustain them .
This will bring about struggle , which will in turn bring about population bottleneck .
Example of struggle : 2,000,000,000 starving Asians charge into Eastern Europe looking for resources .
1,000,000,000 starving Africans surge into the Middle East .
All of central and south America explodes up through the Yucatan Peninsula toward Texas .
That kind of thing .
Common sense tells us , of course , that Malthus was right : Earth has a fixed output capacity that we can’t dicker with too much .
Even more , common sense tells us that this same limited capacity causes us a pollution problem : if the Earth can process so much pollution , and we do n’t know that number , at some point as we grow and dump even more in , we ’ll reach that point and then excess pollution will pile up .
This points back to our real environmental problem , which is overpopulation , specifically by those without any strategy toward a lasting , forward - moving civilization .
Common sense also tells us that there ’s a secondary problem , which is that no scrap of earth is untouched by humanity .
This means habitats are disrupted , divided by roads and fences , limiting the flexibility of animal populations and ecosystems .
Even more foreboding is that since we have made an ethnic of convenience for ourselves , we do n’t mind calling utilitarian consumerism “ capitalism ” and ignoring the fact that we ’ve put a price tag on everything .
The only thing that keeps a piece of ground from being developed and its trees cut down is that no human yet has the money to do it .
Frightening , is n’t it ?
There are no brakes on the human growth cancer .
The European Environment Agency … released a report yesterday warning that Europe is “ living beyond its means ” when it comes to water use .
Increasing demand and prolonged periods of low rainfall and drought have helped reduce river flows , dry out wetlands , and lower lake and groundwater levels , the report says , predicting that “ climate change will almost certainly exacerbate these adverse impacts in the future , with more frequent and severe droughts in Europe . ”
Meanwhile , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said yesterday that by 2030 , about half the world ’s population — 3.9 billion people — could be living in water - stressed areas .
– NYT
Here you see the wonderful paradox of democracy and consumerism , which both being utilitarianism have a common ancestor : we will ignore a problem for decades and then , by making it trendy because it empowers the have - nots to hate the haves for producing carbon , suddenly we ca n’t get away from it .
It inundates us .
Even if it does n’t succeed because people cannot react to it , we are saturated in it , dripping guilt and foolish pretense .
Check this out :
“ We are responsible , ” LoÃ¯c Fauchon , president of the World Water Council , said during opening ceremonies Monday .
“ Responsible for the aggressions perpetrated against water , responsible for the current climate changes which come on top of the global changes , responsible for the tensions which reduce the availability of fresh water masses so indispensable to the survival of humanity . ”
Drama !
O rich drama !
Plato ’s words ring true for us today : we are facing a corner .
On one side is the damage we ’ve done to our environment ; on another , a burgeoning population , most of whom are irresponsible ; on another , a political tendency to mobilize the irresponsible against the responsible for a power takeover the likes of which we ’ve never seen before .
The origin of this , of course , is globalism .
Where Plato wrote about Athens , we ’re now writing about the world .
Our drones may live in Africa , Asia and Latin America , but they have planes and rifles now , too .
The pattern will occur in staggered loops : China will have its transition to tyranny , become a drone state , and then enforce tyranny on the bourgeois states , and so on .
We ’re all in one society now .
Our economies , politics and militaries are linked .
When we fall , we fall together .
Luckily , individuals and small groups will — as they did when Rome and Athens fell — sneak out and make their way to safer but less convenient places to live .
More on that later this week .

This piece about an upcoming “ gay Jesus film ” is one of those examples that demonstrates a good petition never goes away , even when the issue it addresses has long since been settled ( or was never really an issue in the first place ) .
The “ gay Jesus film ” petition first hit the fan in 1984 , and by the end of 1985 more than a million Christians had written protest letters in an attempt to have the non-existent movie it referenced banned .
Yes , non-existent .
There never was such a film in production , but petitions likes these were circulated anyway :
Modern People News has revealed plans for the filming of a movie based on the SEX LIFE OF JESUS in which Jesus is portrayed as a swinging HOMOSEXUAL .
This film will be shot in the U.S.A. this year unless the public outcry is great .
Already a French Prostitute has been named to play the part of Mary Magdalene , with who Christ has a blatant affair .
We CANNOT AFFORD to standby and DO NOTHING about this disgrace .
We must not allow this perveted world to drag our Lord through the dirt .
PLEASE HELP us to get this film banned from the U.S.A. as it has been in Europe .
Let us show how we feel .
Detach and mail the form below to the address shown .
Make a few copies and give them to your friends .
Only one name per copy .

Attorney General Scott ,
301 South Second Street ,
Springfield
ILLINOIS 62606 Dear Attorney General Scott , I would like to protest , in the strongest terms possible , the production , filming , and showing of any movie that supposedly depicts the sex life of JESUS CHRIST by MODERN PEOPLE NEWS , 11030 West Addison Street , Franklin Park , Illinois 60181 .
Such a movie would be blasphemous and would be an outrage and contrary to the truth .
We urge you to take proper action against this moral corruption .
NAME :……………………………………………
ADDRESS :………………………………………
CITY :……………………………………………..
STATE :……………………… … CODE :……….
In the early incarnations of this call to arms , people were asked to fill out an attached form letter of protest and mail it to the Attorney General of Alabama .
The message often contained the following postscript :
Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart recently reported that the above mentioned movie HAS BEEN COMPLETED !!!
According to Brother Swaggart , the movie company has released word that the movie is scheduled to be shown in various locations around the country during the Christmas Season .
So , the time is short to put a stop to it .
We sincerely hope that all spiritually and morally minded people will band together and keep this UNGODLY type of filth out of Alabama .
Many readers fell for it , including a radio station that happily passed the story along to their listeners and later had to retract it , according to folklorist Jan Brunvand :
By later the same day the radio station [ in Gadsen , Alabama ] personnel had attempted to contact Modern People News and had been in touch with the Alabama Attorney General ’s office .
Following these efforts at verification , a statement was read on the air saying that although the attorney general had received between two and three thousand letters over a period of several weeks concerning the supposed gay - Jesus movie , no evidence could be found that such a project ever existed .
Modern People News , it was stated , seemed to have either gone out of business or changed their name .
In January 1985 Ann Landers published a letter from the Attorney General ’s office of Illinois which tried to set the record straight .
By then it was Modern Film News ( not Modern People News ) who supposedly had offices in Illinois , which is how that state got dragged into this issue ) .
People were exhorted to write to Attorney General William J. Scott . . . a man who had last held that office four years earlier :
Dear Ann Landers :
The office of the Attorney General of the State of Illnois respectfully requests your assistance in combating an international chain letter that is distressing hundreds and thousands of Christians and those of other faiths as well .
The chain letter is a plea to protest “ in the strongest possible language ” the making of a movie in which Jesus Christ could be depicted as a swinging homosexual .
Both this office and the Associated Press have chased down every possible clue and cannot find a shred of truth in the story that such a film was ever in production .
Modern Film News , which reported the film plans , has been out of business for more than two years .
Moreover , 90 percent of the protest mail that has been overwhelming our staff is addressed to the former attorney general , William J. Scott , who has been out of office longer than four years .
Despite our efforts to get the word to the public that the chain letter is a hoax , we continue to receive approximately 1,000 protests every week and at least a dozen phone inquiries each working day .
The inquiries and protests have come from 41 states , Canada , Puerto Rico , New Zealand , Australia , Cambodia , Spain , Brazil , the Dominican Republic , India , the Philippines , Guatemala , Costa Rica and Portugal .
We have concluded that the “ Jesus movie ” rumor originated in 1977 when a suburban Chicago publication , Modern People News , reported that certain interests in Europe were planning such a film and requested that readers express their opinion of the purported project .
The result was the chain - letter protest , which , for some unknown reason , has been revived and is again sweeping the world .
We are appealing to you , Ann Landers , to help us get the word out .
The scope of your readership and impact on millions of newspaper readers around the world cannot be overestimated .
The postage and phone calls , not to mention the valuable time of employees , run into a great deal of money that could be used for so many worthwhile purposes .
Will you please help us ? — Neil F. Hartigan , Attorney General , State of Illnois
Dear Attorney General Hartigan : Hoaxes die hard and the zanier the hoax , the more difficult it is to convince people that it is not true .
If any of you , my readers , receive a copy of that wacky chain letter , take my word for the fact that there is not an iota of truth in it .
And please tell friends that chain letters are illegal and should be tossed into the handiest wastebasket or fed to the nearest goat .
The only such movie that seems to have been planned or made when this petition originally began circulating decades ago was the 1974 film Him , described briefly in Harry and Michael Medved ’s 1980 book , The Golden Turkey Awards , as an “ everything you ever wanted to know about bad movies , but were afraid to ask ” offering :
This innovative film , designed exclusively for gay audiences , goes into excruciating detail concerning the erotic career of Jesus Christ .
The ads for the film show the face of The Savior ( with a cross glistening in one eye ) while the headline inquires ‘ Are You Curious About HIS Sexual Life ? ’
Filmmaker Ed D. Louie satisfies that curiosity by showing us that the Son of Man was a voracious homosexual .
( After all , why did he spend all that time hanging around with the Apostles ? )
The central character of the film is actually a young gay male in contemporary America whose sexual obsession with Jesus helps him to understand the “ hidden meaning ” of the Gospels .
Contrary to common belief , the entry for Him in the Medveds ’ book was not a hoax concocted by them .
However , the minor , low - budget film was so obscure even after its release that it ’s hard to imagine it could have triggered a massive outpouring of petitions to halt its production .
The non-existence of a “ gay Jesus film ” did not stem the ire of those who heard about it .
Blasphemy — even the mere hint of it — is enough to mobilize good Christian soldiers everywhere .
In 1988 , Martin Scorsese ’s The Last Temptation of Christ reaped massive publicity — and long lines at the box office — after fundamentalist Christians picketed theaters .
The uproar was n’t over a gay Jesus , merely one who both questioned his fate and who had a dream about a sexual relationship with Mary Magdalene .
The film remains controversial to this day .
We take our religious icons seriously , as Denis Lemon , editor of the British publication Gay News , found out in 1978 .
He lost his appeal against conviction for blasphemous libel involving poem he had published about a Roman centurion ’s homosexual love for Jesus .
Though the nine month suspended sentence was set aside , the $ 900 fine against him and $ 1,900 fine against his magazine were upheld .
A non-film version of a work similar to the one described in the petition was produced in 1998 , when Terrance McNally ’s dramatic offering Corpus Christi began previews at the Manhattan Theater Club in New York .
As described by the New York Times , the production “ retells the Biblical story of a Jesus - like figure — from his birth in a Texas flea - bag hotel with people having profane , violent sex in a room next door , to his crucifixion as ‘ king of the queers ’ in a manner with the potential to offend many people . ”
And it did .
The Manhattan Theater Club ’s announcement of the play as part of its fall season was greeted with bomb threats promising to “ burn the place to the ground ” if the production opened .
In May 1998 the theatre announced it was pulling “ Corpus Christi ” from its line - up .
A week later it changed its mind , reinstating the play to its fall roster .
Caught between cries of censorship on one side and outraged sensibilities on the other , the theatre had to make a choice .
Additional security measures were taken during the play ’s run to protect both the actors and the audience .
The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights ( self - described as the nation ’s largest Catholic civil rights group ) planned an opening - night protest at the theatre involving busloads of people from as far away as Baltimore and Philadelphia as well as nuns , priests and lay people from Long Island .
“ Hopefully we ’ll send a message that this is basically unacceptable , ” said William A. Donohue , the league ’s president .
Corpus Christi continues to play various live theatres from time to time .
It completed a four - week engagement at London ’s Pleasance Theatre in late 1999 , and in March 2001 it became the subject of a brouhaha at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton when several state lawmakers threatened to cut funding for FAU because their theatre department staged the play .
In March 2010 , Tarleton State University ’s decision to host to a student performance of Terrence McNally ’s Corpus Christi drew ire from some residents of Stephenville , Texas , home of that institute of higher learning .
Update : The Cook County Sheriff 's Department is asking a federal judge to close the Erotic Services section of Craigslist , as well as reimburse the department $ 100,000 it has cost to pursue Craigslist - related prostitution investigations over the past year , according to the �Chicago Tribune .
Original Story :
The Cook County Sheriff 's Department in Chicago has announced that it plans to sue Craigslist because it facilitates prostitution .
Cook County Sheriff Thomas
Dart said that he and the police have made dozens of arrests of people who have been involved in prostitution over Craigslist over the years , and referred to the site as " the single largest source of prostitution in the nation . "
Details of the lawsuit are not yet available , though Dart held a press conference in Chicago this afternoon to announce the lawsuit .
The sheriff 's police arrested 76 men and women in June of 2008 on prostitution - related charges thanks to a Craigslist sting .
In December of 2007 , four Chicago men were charged with running a prostitution ring over Craigslist that employed girls as young as 15 .
Law enforcement has long criticized the popular classifieds site for facilitating prostitution , due largely to the " Erotic Services " section on the site that does n't try to hide what it 's meant for .
Craigslist makes it easy for prostitutes to make fairly anonymous listings while still generating interest .
Critics point out that prostitution is illegal almost everywhere in the US , adding that it's all too easy for those exploiting children to traffic them on Craigslist , making it not only morally reprehensible , but also dangerous for kids .
Craigslist acknowledged these criticisms this past November when the company decided to impose a number of restrictions on its red - light district .
As part of an agreement with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ( NCMEC ) and the Attorneys General of 40 states , the company implemented a phone verification system for listings in the Erotic Services section , which requires anyone who is listing an ad there to post a real number that will be called before the posting goes live .
This not only thwarts sex - themed spammers , but also allows Craigslist to blacklist phone numbers of those who post " inappropriate " ads .
Craigslist also imposed listing fees on those who post in Erotic Services ( which were previously free ) , forcing those who want to post to provide a credit card number .
Craigslist claimed that the phone system and the fees have reduced ad volume in Erotic Services by 80 percent and increased compliance with the site 's Terms of Service , though some believe that is n't enough .
Sheriff
Dart wants to go after the other 20 percent with his lawsuit , which asks for the closure of the Erotic Services section of the site .
As long as the Erotic Services section exists , there will be people who assume this is the only way prostitutes manage to hawk their wares on the site .
This is n't true in the slightest , of course ; those who use Craigslist for this purpose already have special code words to communicate who they are and how much they want , along with prepaid phone numbers and other measures for conducting business .
And they do n't only post in Erotic Services , either — part of the reason Erotic Services exists in the first place is to get them to stop posting in the dating sections of the site , though many still do .
Needless to say , if Erotic Services were to go away , prostitutes would merely filter back into other sections of the site , making them even less detectable by law enforcement than before .
Craigslist , for its part , claims that it 's doing everything it can to prevent illegal activity from appearing on the site .
" We have not yet seen the complaint issued by the Cook County Sheriff , " a Craigslist spokesperson told Ars , but " misuse of Craigslist to facilitate criminal activity is unacceptable , and we continue to work diligently to prevent it .
Misuse of the site is exceptionally rare compared to how much the site is used for legal purposes .
Regardless , any misuse of the site is not tolerated on Craigslist . "
" If you have a seat on a row with an exit / we 're gonna talk to you so you might as well expect it .
You gotta help us out in case we need you / if you do n't want to then we 're gonna reseat you . "
村上春樹さんの 「 正論原理主義 」
村上春樹さんのインタビューが、文藝春秋四月号に掲載された。そのインタビューの中で語られている「正論原理主義』という言葉が、インターネットのあちこちで波紋を呼んでいるようだ。
引用しておくと、正論原理主義という言葉は以下のような文脈で使われている。
ネット上では、僕が英語で行ったスピーチを、いろんな人が自分なりの日本語に訳してくれたようです。翻訳という作業を通じて、みんな僕の伝えたかったことを引き取って考えてくれたのは、嬉しいことでした。
一方で、ネット空間にはびこる正論原理主義を怖いと思うのは、ひとつには僕が1960年代の学生運動を知っているからです。おおまかに言えば、純粋な理屈を強い言葉で言い立て、大上段に論理を振りかざす人間が技術的に勝ち残り、自分の言葉で誠実に語ろうとする人々が、日和見主義と糾弾されて排除されていった。その結果学生運動はどんどん痩せ細って教条的になり、それが連合赤軍事件に行き着いてしまったのです。そういうのを二度と繰り返してはならない。
ベトナム反戦運動や学生運動は、もともと強い理想主義から発したものでした。それが世界的な規模で広まり、盛り上がった。それはほんの短い間だけど、世界を大きく変えてしまいそうに見えました。でも僕らの世代の大多数は、運動に挫折したとたんわりにあっさり理想を捨て、生き方を転換して企業戦士として働き、日本経済の発展に力強く貢献した。そしてその結果、バブルをつくって弾けさせ、喪われた十年をもたらしました。そういう意味では日本の戦後史に対して、我々はいわば集合的な責任を負っているとも言える。
村上文学 は 「日本の土着のにおい」に乏しく、きわめてグローバルだとされているが、実のところその文学の変遷は日本社会の変容を色濃く反映したものになっているように思う。
逃走から承認 へ
読み方はさまざまにあるけれども、ひとつの切り口から見れば、村上文学はこう読み取れる――初期の作品群は、主人公「卵」がいかに世界のシステム＝「壁」から回避し、孤独でシニカルな生き方を選びとることができるのかというテーマに覆われていた。社会からの撤退であり、その撤退の先にいったい何が待ち受けているのかという問題だ。ところが一九九〇年代以降、そのテーマは大きく変容している。
イスラエル在住の方が書かれているブログ『漂流博士』は、村上さんがイスラエルのイェディオット紙に答えたインタビューを翻訳して掲載している。
「 僕の初期の作品では、主人公はみな孤独でしたが、時間と共に、僕の主人公たちは他人との人間関係を求めるように変わってきたと思います」
「 壁」からひたすら逃げることを求めていた彼は、九〇年代以降、「卵」がどう「壁」を乗り越え、他の「卵」たちと接続し、お互いに承認していくのかという痛切なテーマへと向き合うようになった。
そしてこの村上文学の転換は、日本社会の変質とちょうど重なる。戦前の農村社会から高度経済成長期の企業社会に至るまで、日本社会は一貫して同調圧力の高い内向きのコミュニティ性を基調としていた。だが九〇年代後半、終身雇用制の崩壊とともに家族的な企業文化は消失し、風の通り抜けるような涼しい野原に取り残された人々は、おたがいの接続と承認を求めるようになっていく。中間共同体の喪失である。
卵と卵はつながりあえるのか？
そこで問題になっていくのは、システムと個人との関係だ。中間共同体的なものが不在である世界にあって、人はどうやってシステムとつながり、個人とつながることができるのだろう？
ここで立ち現れてくる「壁と卵」というメタファーは、古い左翼言論人が言いたがるような単純な対立構図ではない。壁がイスラエル軍で、卵がパレスチナの民衆たち……そう裁断してしまえばある意味気は楽だが、思考はそこで停止してしまい、古い世界観からは一歩も抜け出せない。
壁と卵は対立しているだけではない。そこには共犯関係が存在している。壁は卵を作り、卵は壁を支える。われわれはつねに壁に荷担し、壁と共犯して他の卵を壊している。つまりわれわれは否応なくシステムに組み込まれ、システムに荷担して生きている。その荷担からは決して逃れられないように見える。
しかしその共依存のような共犯関係謎を解き明かし、そして新たな卵と卵、そして卵と壁の世界観を作り上げることは可能なのだろうか。私にはそれこそが、現在の村上文学のテーマであると考えている。
ベルリンの壁が崩壊すれば、東側の民衆と西側の民衆が手をつなぐ世界がやってくるかと思っていたのに、そこに待っていたのはそんなユートピアじゃなく、東西の絶望的な格差が生み出す冷酷な社会だった。
ムラ社会は消えたが、空気は残った
日本社会の現状に即して言うと……システムは破壊しても破壊しても、ぬめぬめとした粘着質のスライムが私たちのからだにまつわりつくようにやってくる。農村社会は太平洋戦争の終戦によって崩壊し、企業社会は格差社会の到来とともに崩壊しはじめている。そうやって鬱陶しい中間共同体が消滅すれば、ひょっとしたら私たちの前には「卵」と「卵」が直接つながるようなユートピアがやってくるのかもしれないと、昔はみんなが夢想した。だから一生懸命石を投げたり、ムラから脱走を図ったりしたのだ。少なくとも一九八〇年代まで、自家用車を持ったり旅行に出かけるということは、この暑苦しいムラから逃げ出す貴重な機会だと思われていたのである。
しかし気がついてみると、企業や農村というムラの崩壊の後にやってきたのは、卵と卵がつながる新たな世界ではなく、結局はなんだかよくわからない「空気」が支配する世界だった。
マスコミが家父長的なパターナリズムに陥って、わけのわからない古びた勧善懲悪を振り回す。そういう空気の支配には唖然とさせられるが、その一方でインターネットの世界も空気に支配されている人が少なくない。「反マスコミ」「リベラル 」「反サヨク」という空気に呑み込まれて、その論理の本質そのものは置き去りにされ、まともな議論は置き去りにされたまま空気だけが支配力を強めていくようなところがある。この空気の支配は、自分を正当化する。議論しない。悩まない。
それこそがすなわち、 「正論原理主義」だ。正論原理主義は楽チンである。なぜなら絶対的な正義を背中に背負っていると信じることができれば、思い切り大声で怒鳴ることができるから。怒鳴っているうちに、どんどん気持ちは高揚し、ますます自分は正論を吐いているんだと気持ちよく酔うことさえできる。
もちろんそうじゃない人もたくさんいて、だから私はこのネットの論壇的機能にものすごく期待している。ひょっとしたらいまインターネットで起きているさまざまなことーーブログの論争やニコニコ動画の盛り上がりや２ちゃんねるのスレッドは、この古いシステムから外に出る第一歩なんじゃないかとずっと考えてきた。
卵も党派からは逃れられない
とはいえ、そうやって作られた新たな圏域は、それはまたひとつのシステム＝壁となってしまう。サヨク／リベラルもシステムであり、それに反対するウヨク／保守もシステムである。党派性からは逃れられないようにも思える。
だから村上さんにとっては、エルサレム賞を辞退することは、ある種の左翼的なシステムへと取り込まれてしまう危険性を秘めていた。だから彼はイスラエルへと赴いたのではないか。
さらに加えていえば、いまや言論の空間の中で対立するシステムは、旧態依然とした左右の軸だけではない。格差社会の中で取り残された貧困層とそれを見下ろす市民、正規労働者と非正規労働者、子を持つ女性と持たない女性、リアルの充実した若者たちと、もてない若者たち――ありとあらゆるところに党派は生まれ、その党派はシステムとなり、壁を生産し続けている。気がつけばどこかの壁に取り込まれ、客観的と信じていたその視点でさえもが党派に曇らされている。壁に空いた小さな穴からの視点でしかない。
そうやって世界の視界が曇っていく状況を、どうすれば押しとどめることができるのか。どうすればクリアに地平を望むことができるようになるのか。そういうポストモダン的な五里霧中の状況に追い込まれて、どこまで「主体的に生きる」ということが可能なのかどうか。主体的に生きればシステムを乗り越えて、つまりは壁を排除して卵と卵がつながるようになれるのか。
イスラエルに与するのではなく、しかしイスラエルを厳しく糾弾する人たちに与するのでもない。そうした党派性からは一歩距離を置き、自分の目によって「壁に光をあてて」、システムに対する世界観を独自構築していくということ。
それこそが文学の力だと思うのだけれども、では村上さんの文学の力は、どのように人々に影響を与えているのだろう？
私にはまだよくわからない。

When he met these politicians in the ’90s , Gergiev was the celebrity .
“ No one knew these people , and I was so famous already , ” he told me .
Once in power , Putin and his associates shaped a Russia that diverged darkly from any youthful liberal visions .
Gergiev said that his ongoing relationships with these men are based on shared cultural viewpoints .
“ It is not personal , this in return for that , ” he said .
“ They understand the importance of the Mariinsky . ”
GERGIEV’S ABILITY TO LEAD MUST have inspired his piano teacher in Vladikavkaz , the North Ossetian city where he grew up , to suggest that he study conducting .
She introduced him to Anatoly Briskin , a conductor , who gave him lessons , although Gergiev was more interested in playing soccer .
Then everything turned more serious .
His father , an officer in the Red Army , died of a stroke when Gergiev was 14 .
“ That was so far the single saddest day of my life , when this happened , ” he told me .
“ I suddenly realized my life was completely different . ”
He began playing the piano more .
“ I did n’t feel I wanted to be with a lot of people , maybe , ” he said .
Briskin told him that if he wanted to pursue conducting , the only path was to study in Leningrad with Briskin ’s own teacher , Ilya Musin , who had a long , legendary career of training young conductors .
Gergiev took the advice .
From Musin , he imbibed an attitude as well as a technique .
“ He tried to teach everyone to find a reason for joy in making music , ” he said .
While still a student , Gergiev in 1977 won the Herbert von Karajan conducting prize .
Karajan asked Gergiev to come work with him in West Berlin , but the Soviet authorities would n’t permit it .
Instead , he stayed in Leningrad , where he became an assistant conductor at the Kirov .
As a leader , Gergiev ’s core constituency is his family .
His older sister , Larissa , runs the academy for young singers at the Mariinsky , and the husband of his younger sister works at the theater as well .
He has installed his mother , along with his two sisters and their families , in apartments in the St. Petersburg waterfront building where he lives with his wife , Natalia Dzebisova — an Ossetian who is 27 years his junior and whom he met when she was a student at the same music school that he attended as a boy , an institution that had been renamed for him by the time she enrolled there .
( They have three children . )
His devotion in particular to his elderly mother is unstinting .
In his three - story pink stucco dacha , large and comfortable but hardly opulent , which he built a year and a half ago in a wooded , suburban district near the Baltic Sea , he included , in addition to her bedroom suite , a glass elevator that allows her to get around easily .
But Gergiev ’s concept of family extends beyond blood ties .
When the financier and munificent music patron Alberto Vilar , who had generously supported the Mariinsky , was arrested in 2005 on fraud charges , other opera companies that had benefited from his largess turned their backs on him .
Gergiev personally sent him $ 500,000 to post bail .
Gergiev ’s loyal relationships with wealthy friends and government officials keep the Mariin­sky afloat .
For the past eight years , he has been pushing to build a Mariinsky II opera house , budgeted at about $ 500 million , to complement the jewel - box auditorium within the pale green , 19th - century Mariinsky Theater .
By meeting with Putin and two cabinet ministers , he received approval for the expansion .
Afterward , an informal competition in 2001 and a high - profile juried competition in 2003 each selected a cutting - edge foreign architect : first , an American , Eric Owen Moss , and then a Frenchman , Dominique Perrault .
Both Moss ’s iceberg of glass and blue granite and Perrault ’s glass - and - gold snowflake geometry provoked outraged squawks in conservative St. Petersburg .
Both died on the drawing board .
Gergiev then resolved to select the architect himself and found one : Jack Diamond , designer of the Toronto opera house , a Modernist glass box that Gergiev says is superbly functional .
“ Jack Diamond is a practical man , ” he told me .
He sensed the climate was n’t right for a project like Moss ’s or Perrault ’s .
“ Although it looks very good on paper , at a time when people are worried about their jobs and children , you do n’t go for extravaganza , ” he said .
But he needs top - level authorization to dispense with competitions and start over right away with a new architect .
We were speaking in a hotel cafe in Moscow early last month when an assistant came up and handed him a cellphone .
It was Elvira Nabiullina , the minister of economic development and trade , calling to say that she had talked to President Medvedev on his behalf .
Gergiev thanked her .
“ People are worried , ” he told me afterward .
“ Let ’s be honest , it ’s a little bit smaller people in the picture , but I know the Canadian will do the job , and I take responsibility .
Some people do n’t want to be blamed .
If anything goes wrong , everyone wants to be sure that I will be the one guilty . ”
WHEN GERGIEV LEADS AN ORCHESTRA , his left hand flutters , as if receiving spectral transmissions , and occasionally , it jerks up to push his thinning , lank gray hair out of his eyes .
In his right hand , he sometimes holds a small stick ( once I saw him use a toothpick ) , but more often , nothing .
The right hand indicates entrances and tempo , which , even for professional musicians , can be hard to read .
Julia Broido , a musicologist at the St. Petersburg conservatory that Gergiev attended , told me that adulatory young conducting students comically imitate the fluttering hand , “ but it is a kind of magic , and it only works for Gergiev . ”
The alchemy is not proceeding from the hands .
Andrew Marriner , who is the principal clarinetist for the L.S.O. , said , “ Everything happens here , ” and traced from the eyes to the mouth .
Gergiev ’s large , protruding eyes beneath bushy arched eyebrows are extraordinarily expressive , and his face registers an emotional range that any actor would envy — from nodding , encouraging confidence to wooing , romantic yearning , from heedless rapture to the darkest scowl .
When the pace of the music picks up , his whole body throbs .
During a crescendo , he may pump his arms back and forth , as if he were about to dive into a pool , and he will jump up and down a couple of times .

[ In an in - depth analysis , designer and Divide by Zero Games founder James Portnow surveys almost 300 people to discover the role of genre - specific language in games . ]
Every discipline and specialization establishes its own power words , its own secret language .
These languages serve a multiple of purposes : to establish mastery , to deliver specificity , to foster group identification , to create an artificial barrier to entry .
Nowhere is this more apparent than in our own industry and our culture .
After all , to the outside world something that is " broken " is bad and a " mob " is a crowd of angry people ... and gamer slang can't hold a candle to the mystic composition industry jargon .
It 's a natural human thing to do .
It 's why lawyers and doctors pepper their speech with Latin , it 's the reason that " goths " and " gangstas " can barely communicate -- but should we do it within games ?
The Problem At Hand
Today almost every game establishes a specialized vocabulary to support its story or creative IP .
That vocabulary is , for the most part , exclusive and non-transferable ( that is to say , it does n't apply to other games ) .
Does this make sense ?
Is this what we should be doing ?
Should we be creating common genre - wide vocabulary ?
Should we be using more familiar terms in order to lower the barrier to entry to our games ?
Over the course of this article I will be addressing these questions and discussing an informal survey I took regarding this issue ( do n't use it for any term papers kids : it 's pretty much just me asking questions to gamers ) .
What Does The User Get ?
There is a designer who I very much admire who would always ask the question , " What does the user get ? " as a metric of whether a design decision was good .
This was the best tool I could think of for weighing whether our exclusive vocabularies make sense , so I simply asked groups of gamers how they felt about the terminology in their games .
Case Study 1 - MMOers
Whether you 're walking around Norrath or Azeroth , MMOs present some of the most massive and intimidating blocks of jargon and ' creative language ' presented to gamers .
If you do n't know what a Blood Elf is or where Tanaris is located you might as well go back to your real world home and play with a ball .
So how do gamers feel about acquiring this massive vocabulary that loses all meaning when the servers shut down ?
Overall the response was amazingly positive from the MMO gamer community .
Common themes were that the vocabulary reinforced the world ( the most important element of the creative IP in an MMORPG , in my opinion ) and gave them the flavor they lost by skipping the quest text .
There was almost universal agreement about place names : " You 've got to call them something , so they might as well be unique . "
Equipment names were more split .
There was a sizable minority who wanted equipment names to tell more about what a piece of equipment did .
In general the amount of terminology was generally considered manageable given the amount of time players spent on a single MMO :
" By the time you 've been playing for forty hours you just learn it , you know .
It 's not like I had to go out of my way to figure out what a Moonkin was . "
Perhaps the most interesting part of my study of MMO players was around how MMO terminology related to the social experience .
A fair number of the respondents stated that jargon enhanced the social experience , especially the out of game social experience .
" If I 'm like at a Denny 's and I hear somebody go '... Sunwell , ' I 'm like totally in . "
( I was n't entirely sure what he meant by this at first ; he meant that he would go join their real life conversation . )
On the other hand a slightly smaller number said that the terminology ruined their out of game social interaction , some going so far as to say they would n't talk about the game in public , even to other people who they knew played .
" I hate that I can't talk about my game without sounding completely dorky . "
" I feel silly saying Blood Elf Paladin .
I 'm uncomfortable every time someone tries to talk to me about WoW outside of my home . "
Case Study 2 - FPSers
FPS games often have a more modest amount of jargon to pick up .
It is almost entirely limited to the player 's weapons / gear .
So how do FPS players respond to this more limited jargon pool ?
Well , first I found FPS players fall into two categories : those who play historical / real world games , and those who do n't .
For those who play " real world " games , there is at least a subset to whom the jargon matters a lot .
They will chew your ear off about how the Mosin - Nagant rifle is n't historically accurate or the M4A1 " just does n't shoot like that . "
As for the rest of the community , they pretty much could n't care less if you called a nail gun a nail gun or a machine gun .
Interestingly enough , I found that map names could be a real source of vitriol for some players .
" I think Deck 17 but we 're playing on Deck 16 and it's all sorts of different , and that 's some stupid fuckin ' bullshit if you ask me . "
( I 'll admit , " Deck # " does n't make for a very good naming convention . )
It was interesting to note that FPS players were at least somewhat displeased by how rapidly their knowledge of map names became obsolete .
I do n't think this is actually related to the larger question of exclusive vocabulary and secret languages , but it 's a noteworthy sidelight .
Case Study 3 - Strategy Gamers
This one surprised me the most .
Strategy gamers were all for invented names -- so long as they were good .
Complaints came in when players had to remember the difference between a TU - 34 and a TU - 37 or a series of nondescript tanks .
I think my favorite strategy gamer comment on the subject was :
" If names were n't carefully chosen , how could you make sure everything hotkeyed right ? "
The most common complaint from strategy gamers related to not having enough variety and breadth in their game terminology .
Their principle desire was to have enough differentiation that unit names were clear and distinct , allowing for easy recognition and recall :
" MkV , Sherman , M1 , Gladiator , Centurion ; those names mean anything to you ?
Is a Sherman or a MkV better ?
Is one better against infantry and another better against other tanks ?
Maybe a Centurion 's actually just a roman era foot unit ! "
" I really like Dawn of War 's names .
They sound like what they do and they 're all really different . "
Case Study 4 - Parents
Here 's one group that universally hates exclusive vocabulary .
" It 's like my kid 's speaking a different language . "
" I can't keep up .
He comes to the dinner table and I try to be involved , but one week it 's a ' dwarf enchanter ' and the next it 's ' Solid Snake . ' "
" I do n't know if he 's talking to his friends about doing drugs or playing a game . "
" I 've got a job and three kids .
How am I supposed to learn all the Pokemon ? "
I received several indifferent responses and no positive responses from parents about the exclusive vocabulary in games .
At the least it was viewed as a tragic waste of a child 's brainspace , at the worst it was an active impediment to the parent 's relationship with their children .
Casual and Sports
I left sports games and casual games out of my survey entirely .
Sports games usually translate their vocabulary from the real world sport they simulate , and so do n't have IP - supportive vocabulary .
Casual games have little to no exclusive vocabulary , and when they do it 's rarely integral to the user 's experience ( you do n't need to know what a Tetris is to play Tetris ) .
Conclusions
I conducted this study to aid my own efforts in the work I am currently doing .
Below are the conclusions I 've drawn from the study and my own reasoning as I 've wrestled with the project at hand .
Vocabulary Of The Mundane
I 've come to believe that games would suffer from homogeny if we were to lower the barrier to entry by making game vocabulary more prosaic ; we would lose part of what lets our players cross into the magic circle .
Part of what allows them to escape their mundane , ordinary , everyday lives and slip into this secret other world of " game " is the hidden language they adopt when they begin to play .
As words that had no meaning before reaching for the controller take on significance and gain import the player becomes part of an exclusive society : they know what no one else knows , they are special , unique .
This transformation prepares a player to adopt the role of a great warrior or a brilliant commander or a deadeye mercenary -- it is in becoming more special than the ordinary person that we come to more easily accept the fantastic roles we often adopt in games .
Unnecessary Complexities
While creative terminology is good , creating good creative terms is in and of itself an art .
I 've found that there is , at times , a tendency for some designers to want players to prove their devotion by learning an overly complex set of vocabulary .
I could write an entire article on this topic , but to keep it brief I 've found the following rules of thumb useful :
1 . Whether it's the Black Bow of the Betrayer or a Firebat , names should still hint at what something is in your game .
2 . Use real roots .
Whether it 's English , Latin , German , or Japanese does n't matter , just try to draw your names from something recognizable .
While this might help clue your player in on what your names mean , the real reason is that it's hard to remember whether Qlgeshmahn is the healing potion and Mqklema is your torch or if it 's the other way around ...
3. Numbers are bad .
If they correlate to power they 're boring and if they do n't correlate to power they are confusing .
4 . Use invented vocabulary only for things that are unique to your world .
Do n't replace the names of things the player already has words for without some very good justification .
Genre -Wide Vocabulary ?
We have already established a group of conventions ( HP , EXP , bot , frag ) that carry over between games in a genre .
These terms are usually related to common mechanics found in the genre .
I 've become convinced that you should not try to replace these with cool IP - related words .
This simply confuses players and leads them to refer to things in your world by the better known corollary terms anyway .
Of respondents who played RPGs , I often asked them what the currency in the Final Fantasy series was ; slightly over half inaccurately responded , " Gold . "
On the flip side , anything not related to common game mechanics seems to be fair game .
Familial Understanding
This study brought to light the larger question of how the non-gamer relates to someone immersed in one of our fantasy settings .
This is a moral question and a social question but , I believe this to be a monetary question as well .
Often our customer is not actually the one consuming our products ; they are a relative or a friend of the person who will , in the end , play our games .
If we can improve their tangential experience , that is to say if we can make buying a game a positive and connecting experience , they are more likely to be willing to purchase other of our products in the future .
Unfortunately I do n't have any suggestions on how to do this except on a case by case basis .
Notes on the Study
I began taking this survey in furtherance of my own work .
I refined it over time , adding and subtracting questions as I began to discover what questions elicited useful data .
This survey is a combination of email questionnaires and face to face conversations .
Not all of the respondents knew they were being surveyed at the time .
In short , this study was in no way statistically rigorous .
I am publishing this summary because I felt as though the results benefited my own work and may benefit the community as a whole .
I believe the data acquired here to be good , regardless of its lack of rigor ... just be aware of how it came to be .
For those , the sample size was just under 300 people ( I have 238 gamers and 43 parents marked on my tally sheet with a handful of results discarded for various reasons ) .
I tried to target gamers of all ilk from the hardcore to the more casual , although due to the categories investigated and the nature of the survey I believe the respondent pool leaned more towards the " core . "

The number of Palestinians killed by Israel 's offensive in Gaza climbed above 1,000 yesterday , despite repeated calls from the UN for a halt to the conflict .
With mounting concern about the hundreds of civilians killed , nine Israeli human rights groups wrote to their government warning of their " heavy suspicion ... of grave violations of international humanitarian law by military forces " .
Among the sites hit yesterday was Sheikh Radwan cemetery .
Thirty graves were destroyed , spreading rotting flesh over a wide area .
The army said it was targeting a nearby weapons cache .
So far 1,010 Palestinians have died , including 315 children and 95 women , Dr Moawiya Hassanein , head of Gaza 's medical emergency services , told the Guardian .
The number of injured after 19 days of fighting stood at 4,700 , he said .
On the Israeli side , 13 people have died , among them three civilians , and four soldiers accidentally killed by their own troops .
The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights , which is based in Gaza and has field staff across the territory , believed at least 673 civilians had been killed - about two - thirds of the total .
A more accurate count of civilian deaths is difficult , with journalists and international human rights observers banned from entering Gaza .
Ban Ki-moon , the UN secretary - general , was in Cairo for talks to halt the fighting .
" My call is for an immediate end to violence in Gaza , and then to the Israeli military offensive and a halt to rocket attacks by Hamas , " he said .
" It is intolerable that civilians bear the brunt of this conflict . "
Yesterday John Holmes , the UN 's humanitarian chief , told the security council : " The situation for the civilian population of Gaza is terrifying , and its psychological impact felt particularly by children and their parents , who feel helpless and unable to protect them . "
He added that Hamas 's rocket attacks on Israel violated international laws and must cease .
" Yet any Israeli response must itself comply with international humanitarian law .
Here , too , there is considerable and grave cause for concern . "
The Israeli military pressed on with its offensive yesterday , striking 20 sites across Gaza , including what it said were rocket launching sites , three smuggling tunnels , several armed gunmen and five buildings storing weapons .
Yet despite the intense bombing and artillery , militant rocket fire from Gaza has continued every day since the war began .
Yesterday at least 16 rockets were fired into southern Israel , some reaching as far as Be'er Sheva and Ashdod .
Separately , guerrillas in southern Lebanon fired rockets into northern Israel yesterday .
There were no casualties .
The Israeli military fired mortars back .
The nine Israeli human rights groups , which include B'Tselem , Gisha , Amnesty International 's Israel section and Physicians for Human Rights , said accounts from Gaza showed the Israeli military was " making wanton use of lethal force " and called for a halt to attacks on civilians , access for civilians to escape the fighting , medical care for the injured , access for medical and rescue teams and the proper operation of electricity , water and sewage systems .
Their unusually strong criticisms stand out in a country whose Jewish population at least has been united in extraordinarily strong support for the war in Gaza .
The desperate state of health facilities in Gaza was highlighted yesterday in the Lancet medical journal .
Several mobile clinics and ambulances have been damaged by Israeli attacks , it notes , and at least six medical personnel killed .
Hospitals and clinics have been forced to close .
International law requires that all medical staff and facilities be protected at all times , even during armed conflict , said the Lancet .
" Attacks on staff and facilities are serious violations of these laws , " it said .
Many doctors are working 24 - hour shifts , ambulances cannot be maintained and are breaking down , while hospital equipment , medicines and anaesthetics , beds and medical staff are all in short supply .
Hospitals and clinics have had their electricity supplies cut and are relying on " fragile back - up generators " .
Norwegian doctors Mads Gilbert and Erik Fosse wrote that during their spell working in al - Shifa hospital in Gaza City in the current conflict they had " witnessed the most horrific war injuries in men , women and children of all ages in numbers almost too large to comprehend .
The wounded , dying and dead have streamed into the overcrowded hospital in endless convoys of ambulances and private cars and wrapped in blankets in the caring arms of others .
The endless and intense bombardments from Israeli air , ground and naval forces have missed no targets , not even the hospital . "
Two Palestinian journalists working for an Iranian television station were charged in Israel yesterday with passing classified information to the enemy .
They were accused of reporting the start of the ground invasion two weeks ago while the information was still under military censorship , and could face lengthy jail terms .
Tokyo , with a population of 12.4 million , is one of the largest cities in the world and still growing .
It is known for not only having huge amounts of anime and robot fans , but also for its annual rainy and typhoon seasons that can flood the whole city .
Because of this , there is a need to build a massive underground drainage system to counter the problem .
In 1992 , a plan called G - Cans Project or the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel ( drainage system ) was approved and construction began .
The G - Cans project was completed in 2004 .
Below are some of the pictures of “ Tokyo ’s Drainage System : The Largest in the World ” .
Fototerra Finaldarkworld had a bit more to say :
To download of rain water , the complex is equipped with a turbopump 59 .
Their total capacity of 14 thousand horsepower , they can outrun the top 200 tons of water per second .
It seems that this might certainly be designed for the most intense flooding .
However , in this area in a heavy downpour falling on 200 millimeters of precipitation , and sometimes up to 400 ( monthly rainfall for Moscow , for example , is 35 millimeters ) .
Therefore , margin of safety facilities placed enormous .
Let all the sea would rise in clouds and rain fall .
Designers should consider a set of massive underground storage for many thousands of tons of water to the height of precipitation area upstairs is not to submergence .
Since its opening , the G - Cans has prevented floods from entering the metropolis , but “ unfortunately ” it ca n’t prevent many people , including celebrities and film makers from flooding the place .
It is due to the G - Cans project is also meant to be a tourist attraction , and can be visited for free twice a day , from Tuesday to Friday .
Unfortunately , the tour is conducted only in Japanese .
My suggestion is you should learn the language ; it is very interesting .

Changes in marijuana policies across states legalizing marijuana for medical and / or recreational use suggest that marijuana is gaining greater acceptance in our society .
Thus , it is particularly important for people to understand what is known about both the adverse health effects and the potential therapeutic benefits linked to marijuana .
Because marijuana impairs short - term memory and judgment and distorts perception , it can impair performance in school or at work and make it dangerous to drive .
It also affects brain systems that are still maturing through young adulthood , so regular use by teens may have negative and long - lasting effects on their cognitive development , putting them at a competitive disadvantage and possibly interfering with their well - being in other ways .
Also , contrary to popular belief , marijuana can be addictive , and its use during adolescence may make other forms of problem use or addiction more likely .
Whether smoking or otherwise consuming marijuana has therapeutic benefits that outweigh its health risks is still an open question that science has not resolved .
Although many states now permit dispensing marijuana for medicinal purposes and there is mounting anecdotal evidence for the efficacy of marijuana - derived compounds , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved " medical marijuana . "
However , safe medicines based on cannabinoid chemicals derived from the marijuana plant have been available for decades and more are being developed .
This Research Report is intended as a useful summary of what the most up - to - date science has to say about marijuana and its effects on those who use it at any age .

Ever sit through a Disney movie and think that some parts of it seemed familiar ?
Well it turns out it ’s not all in your head , because Disney recycles cartoon scenes .
No the identical shots naturally , but character movement and interaction .
Here ’s the proof :
March 16,2009  , 2009 -- Utah .
Take it or leave it .
In an unscientific study of scientific studies , Utah always comes out on top -- or all the way on the bottom .
And sometimes it comes out on top and on the bottom in studies about the same thing .
In short , it is a land of extremes and extreme contradictions .
In surveys conducted one year apart , by institutions no less illustrious than Gallup and Mental Health America , Utah was named , respectively , the happiest state in the country and the most depressed state in the union .
It is a place of extreme landscapes -- salt flats , deserts , mountains , the Great Salt Lake -- and , some say , extreme people strident in the protection of their values and fiercely proud of their history .
It is a state so dedicated to protecting the moral interests of its residents that the NBC affiliate in Salt Lake City wo n't air " Saturday Night Live " because it deems it too risque .
Yet , despite its values - based rhetoric , the state is also the country 's No. 1 consumer of online pornography , according to a recent study conducted by Harvard University .
Last week , the state legislature overturned a decades - old law that forced people to complete a membership application when they visited a " private club " -- what the rest of America calls a bar .
The law was repealed after a compromise with conservative lawmakers .
Now , instead of membership , anyone who enters a bar and appears to be less than 35 years old will have their identification card scanned and information stored in a digital database for a week .
Republican Gov. John Huntsman , who opposed the database because he said " that [ it ] would enhance the oddness of our laws , " is now working to change another oddity about the state 's alcohol laws -- a rule that forces bartenders to mix drinks out of the sight of customers .
" The liquor thing is weird , " said Heather Armstrong , a Utah transplant who writes the popular blog dooce.com .
" There is this sense that the church and the government have to take care of us , " said Armstrong , a former Mormon .
" There is a paradox in that Mormonism gives people free will and then the legislature takes all your choices away . "
Utah 's Extreme Contradictions : Mormons , Birthrate , Stereotypes
The state is overwhelmingly white and nearly two - thirds of Utah 's 2.2 million residents -- and all the statewide politicians -- are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints .
USA Today and the Pew Center on the States ranked Utah the " best managed state " in the country for its fiscal conservatism -- a fact that may explain why the Urban Institute ranked it dead last for per-capita spending on programs like Medicaid .
Utah is the fastest growing state in the nation , with the highest birthrate and the youngest population , but it ranks 50th among the 50 states in per pupil spending , according to the U.S. Department of Education .
Outsiders have long tried to decipher the state and its people , but have instead succumbed to outsized stereotypes .
For non-Utahans , the state 's residents are all sexually deviant polygamists or ultra-conservative paragons of wholesome family values .
" There is no such thing as monolithic Utah culture , " said Theresa Martinez , a sociology professor at the University of Utah , of a place that is predominately white and Mormon .
" Americans are always looking for an easy way to sum up a people .
The culture does n't take into account the enormous complexity of Mormons .
No population is uniformly the same .
The way the state is portrayed in the mass media is unfair and does n't capture who we are , " she said .
Utahans Defend Themselves
It is impossible to talk about Utah or its people without mentioning the Mormon Church .
The Mormons have historically described themselves as a " peculiar people , " exceptional in the eyes of God .
As recently as the presidential primaries , they worked to remind people that they were Christians too just like most of the rest of the country .
More than a century ago , Mark Twain described Utah as a " fairyland to us -- a land of enchantment and awful mystery . ''
That fascination -- and continued misunderstanding of Utah -- might explain the popularity of shows like HBO 's " Big Love , " which is about fundamentalist Mormons who practice polygamy .
Given that the fascination by outsiders typically focuses on negative stereotypes and myths , Utah 's religious and political leaders have worked to demystify the place .
In January , two church elders gave ABC News ' Dan Harris a rare interview inside a new Mormon temple .
Once dedicated , the building would be closed to nonmembers of the church .
" We want to be understood , not misunderstood , " said Elder Russell Ballard , " and people are defining us in the wrong way .
They 're defining us without having the facts . "
For years , biologists assumed that the histones in their nucleosome spools provided a passive framework for the DNA .
But , over the last decade , it has become increasingly clear that this is not the case .
The histone tails that jut out from the nucleosomes provide a way of marking up the genetic script .
Although one kind of mark is attached directly to the bases in the DNA , more than a hundred others are fixed onto specific sites on the histones ’ tails .
When the DNA has to replicate , for cell division , the direct marks pass only to the two parent strands and all the nucleosomes are disassembled , yet the cell has ingenious methods for reconstituting the same marks on the two daughter genomes .
The marks are called epigenetic , and the whole system the epigenome , because they are inherited across cell division despite not being encoded in the DNA .
How is the structure of the epigenome determined ?
The basic blueprint for the epigenomes needed by each cell type seems to be inherent in the genome , but the epigenome is then altered by other signals that reach the cell .
The epigenome is thus the site where the genome meets the environment .
The organization of the epigenomes seems to be computed from information inherent in the genome .
“ Most of the epigenetic landscape is determined by the DNA sequence , ” says Bradley Bernstein , a chromatin expert at Massachusetts General Hospital .
The human genome contains many regulatory genes whose protein products , known as transcription factors , control the activity of other genes .
It also has a subset of master regulatory genes that control the lower - level regulators .
The master transcription factors act on each other ’s genes in a way that sets up a circuitry .
The output of this circuitry shapes the initial cascade of epigenomes that are spun off from the fertilized egg .
The other shapers of the epigenome are the chromatin regulators , protein machines that read the marks on the histone tails .
Some extend marks of a given kind throughout a domain .
Some bundle the nucleosomes together so as to silence their genes .
Others loosen the DNA from the nucleosome spools so as to ease the path of the transcription machinery along a gene .
Biologists had long assumed that once the chromatin regulators had shaped an epigenome , their work could not be undone because a cell ’s fate is essentially irreversible .
But a remarkable experiment by the Japanese biologist Shinya Yamanaka in June 2007 underlined the surprising power of the master transcription factors .
By inserting just four of the master regulator genes into skin cells , he showed the transcription factors made by the genes could reprogram the skin cell ’s epigenome back into that of the embryonic cell from which it had been derived .
The skin cell then behaved just like an embryonic cell , not a skin cell .
Until then , biologists had no idea that the epigenome with its millions of marks could be recast so simply or that transcription factors could apparently call the shots so decisively .
But subsequent research has shown the chromatin regulators are not pushovers .
Only one in a million of the skin cells treated with the four transcription factors reverts fully to the embryonic state .
Most get stuck in transitional states , as if the chromatin regulators are resisting a possibly cancerous change in the cell ’s status .
“ The take - home story is that yes , the transcription factors are really critical players in determining cellular state , but epigenetics is important , too , ” Dr. Bernstein said .
Once dismissed by wine snobs as a lightweight plonk for a summer picnic , rosé wine is enjoying a world revival : French wine critics love it , the British market is booming and more French people now buy rosé than white wine .
But the success has been soured by a bitter row in Brussels as the European Commission plans to loosen the strict rules on how the distinctive pink wine can be made .
In Provence - where rosé is as important to the region 's glitzy image as the Cannes film festival and St Tropez - winemakers are up in arms and warning that the whole art - de-vivre and economy of the south of France is under threat from the European Commission 's proposal to allow producers in all member states to make rosé by simply mixing red and white wine .
In Europe methods of making rosé are strictly regulated : it is produced from black grapes only , using a complex method in which the grape skins mingle with the juice for only a few hours until the right pink hue is achieved .
In France , the world 's biggest rosé producer , mixing red and white is seen as heresy that risks flooding the market with cheap wine , wrecking consumers ' palletes and killing the established industry .
" We 're shocked , angry and worried , " said Jean - Jacques Breban , president of the Provence winegrowers ' association .
The region is the biggest rosé - producer in France .
" If the rules change , we wo n't be able to compete with our traditional methods , our industry will die and the Provence economy will be devastated .
If tens of thousands of wine - growers are forced out of business , swaths of landscape could see vines pulled up and destroyed .
It will change our region forever . "
The Provence rosé - producers have lobbied the French government prior to the commission 's final ruling next month .
They said if necessary they would organise demonstrations .
The government wants to avoid more protests by its beleagured wine industry which has seen troubled Languedoc Roussillon wine - growers resort to terrorism .
The champagne industry has taken legal action to protect its unique right to used the word " champagne " .
The commission argues that the technique of mixing red with white to get rosé is authorised across the world from Australia to America , and European producers should be able to compete .
But the technique remains extremely rare .
A matter of quality
For the winemakers of Provence , allowing producers to blend red and white wines will have them choking on their bouillabaisse .
Why should blending matter ?
The answer is rooted in character and quality .
At its dry best , rosé combines cool refreshment with a delicate , tangy hint of a red .
Blending wines rather than allowing brief , gentle contact between pressed juice and the skins of red grapes to extract rosé colour and character , is n't the same thing at all .
Cynics might argue that the Provencals can keep producing rosé in the time - honoured way and allow others to satisfy growing demand with an easing of tiresome restrictions .
But quality would almost invariably suffer as cheap blends flooded the market .
It would be a shame if Brussels played into the hands of purveyors of mass pink plonk rather than sustaining a style of wine that traces its roots back 26 centuries to the Phoenicians who brought their vines to France .

North Korea demands U.S. stop humanitarian aid supplies
RIA Novosti
17/03/2009 22:08 WASHINGTON , March 17 ( RIA Novosti ) - A U.S. State Department spokesman said Tuesday that the United States would stop humanitarian aid supplies to North Korea after the communist state requested Washington discontinue the program .
Robert Wood said the U.S. had received an official request from North Korea several days ago .
The notification contained no reasons for the rejection of the aid .
" Clearly , this is food assistance that the North Korean people need .
That 's why we 're concerned , " he said .
He added that the State Department would continue to cooperate with NGOs working in North Korea to make sure that earlier delivered humanitarian aid had reached those in need of it .
Wood also said that in 2008 and 2009 , the U.S. had supplied 169,000 metric tons of humanitarian aid to North Korea , with the last batch of 5,000 tons dispatched in late January .
The North Korean decision comes amid rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula .
Pyongyang has called U.S. - South Korean military exercises preparation for war , and has also said that any attempt to shoot down what it calls a telecommunications satellite next month will also lead to armed conflict .
Seoul and Washington say the real purpose of the launch is to test a long - range Taepodong - 2 missile , which is thought to have a range of 6,700 kilometers ( 4,100 miles ) and could possibly reach Alaska .

Bristol Palin and Levi Johnston have decided against becoming married teenage parents , which is fine for them , but what does this do for Bristol ’s mom , Governor Sarah Palin ’s hopes of becoming the darling of the social conservatives and the potential presidential nominee of the GOP in 2012 ?
Before the news of the breakup that they tried to keep a secret for the last two and a half month hit the news , Palin ’s PAC sent out a fundraising email that touted her work with faith based initiatives in Alaska , which said in part , “ Recently , Governor Palin was joined by Franklin Graham as she traveled to Western Alaska .
Together , Governor Palin and Mr. Graham toured the region and met with residents of the area .
Many of these Alaskans have recently received additional assistance through a partnership between many state agencies and several faith - based , non-profit groups , such as Mr. Graham ’s Samaritan ’s Purse . ”
So on the same day that Palin begins her campaign to court social conservatives , it is revealed that her daughter is an unwed teenage mother , and that the family has been lying to media about her marriage plans for a couple of months now .
Last month on Fox News , Bristol Palin was talking about a summer wedding , and today we found out that this was all a lie , likely designed to keep up her mother ’s political image .
I know that the social conservatives see something romantic in teenage marriages , but in my opinion the teenagers probably made the correct decision for them .
I ca n’t image the pressure that they must have felt to get married last year , because Gov. Palin was running for vice president .

In political terms , the news definitely is a hit to the image that Palin is trying to cultivate for 2012 .
She sees that her path to the GOP nomination runs through the social conservative wing of the party .
Mitt Romney has long been the choice of the fiscal conservatives , so Palin is left to duke it out with Mike Huckabee for the hearts of the social conservatives .
I ca n’t see how having an unmarried teenage mother for a daughter will help her with the values voters who like to believe that teaching abstinence can prevent teenage pregnancy , but Palin , like George W. Bush before her , knows how to turn on the charm and speak their language .
Huckabee is the more authentic social conservative , but Palin has personality and charisma working for her .
While I , as a non values voter , have no problem with the way Bristol Palin chooses to live her life , I can see where Palin ’s family situation could undermine her credibility with some GOP primary voters .
I find it more offensive that Palin tried to lie to the world in order to keep her political image intact .
The bigger political problem for Palin might be that the only base within the GOP that she might be able to count on is Republican women .
It will be difficult for Palin to make the family values argument in 2012 , but no one should be surprised if she tries .
DETROIT --
The Detroit Tigers have upset some Roman Catholics who are unhappy that the club's home opener is scheduled during holy hours on Good Friday .
Traditional Christian belief says Jesus hung on the cross from noon to 3 p.m. on Good Friday .
All 30 American and National League teams play April 10 , but the Tigers ' 1:05 p.m. game against the Texas Rangers is the only one during those hours .
" It 's sort of an insult for Catholics , " said Michael Ochab , a 47 - year - old Tigers fan .
He said he 'll miss his first opener in 20 years this year to attend services at St. Florian Catholic Church in Hamtramck .
" I 'm still hoping the Tigers will change the time . "
Tigers spokesman Ron Colangelo said Major League Baseball has a " monumental task " putting together a season 's schedule .
Detroit 's climate makes a night game unrealistic this time of year , Colangelo told the Detroit Free Press .
" Fans have come to know that our home opener is always a day game , " he said .
The Rev. Ed Vilkauskas of downtown Detroit's St. Mary 's Catholic Church said the game at nearby Comerica Park will keep people from services .
" Nobody is saying baseball is n't big , but Good Friday is really big , " Vilkauskas told The Detroit News .
" It 's 2,000 years old . "
Now here 's a smart idea !
This one compact charging base docks up to 4 iPods or iPhones at once .
If you 're tired of having your home overrun by charging cables , the Griffin PowerDock will simplify your digital life .
The PowerDock integrates 4 universal iPod docks , and included adaptors support all dockable iPod models , including 2G Touch and iPhone 3G .
PowerDock 's sleek form and brushed metal finish blend beautifully into any décor , and the non-slip base keeps it from sliding off the desk when people are undocking their iPods in a hurry !
The 6 - foot power cable lets you place the charging base wherever it 's most needed .
If you 're a multi-iPod household , do yourself a favor and centralize your charging with the Griffin PowerDock !
STATEN ISLAND , N.Y . ---
We got a call today from an irate reader wanting to know why the film " Milk , " about the late San Francisco city supervisor and gay - rights icon Harvey Milk , had not yet found a screen on Staten Island .
We wish we had thought to check the local movie times before we hung up on the caller -- " Milk " is playing this week at the Atrium in Eltingville .
But , why did it take so long ?
The movie first opened in Manhattan on Nov. 26 .
The suggestion behind such complaints is that homophobia is once again at work here .
Does it exist on Staten Island ?
Sure , just as it does in the population centers of a similar size all across America that also have n't had a chance to go see this movie until now ( Sean Penn winning the Best Actor Oscar for playing Milk is why the film 's release has widened this week ) .
This is about business .
It begins there and ends there .
" Milk " is a small movie released by a small studio , Focus Features -- incidentally , the same studio that was behind " Brokeback Mountain " a few years back , which also took its time getting to Staten Island .
This is n't to suggest that Focus is homophobic , in fact quite the opposite .
And the bottom line ?
This is a studio without deep pockets , and it has a history of going slow on its release dates , waiting to see if theaters fill up before distributing it to still more theaters .
It 's just that simple .
It was refreshing to see the Ocars reward " Milk " for work well done .
Voters did n't appear to shy away from it because of its content , or rush to embrace it for the same reason .
It 's a fact that certain film critics heaped praise on the film last year because they wanted to show their support for gay rights after California voted to prohibit gay marriage in November .
This bothered us a great deal , and we said so at the time -- review a motion on its merits alone , please .
We do n't see a agenda in " Milk 's " slow release pattern .
We do see a agenda on the part of those who are quick to label their community homophobic because the movie is n't ( or was n't ) playing there .
And that 's fine ; some agendas are necessary .
But just because you have an agenda does n't mean another party is harboring one as well .
Rather than embrace the negativity that results in Staten Island once again being dragged through the dirt , it may be more productive if those making such charges just go see " Milk . "
Fill the theater .
Your ticket sales will eventually end up on the desks of those responsible for deciding who gets to see what and when , we guarantee it .
Stephen Colbert may have won NASA 's poll to rename a module on the International Space Station , but NASA does n't really want to go through with it .
Instead , they might just name a toilet after him .

Despite beating out Serenity by more than 40,000 votes , NASA still has the right to choose the name on its own , and Colbert might just not have the , well , gravitas necessary for the job .
But hey , he still gets something !
They 're talking about possibly naming the new toilet being delivered to the station " Colbert , " so at least something up there will get his name , even if it 's just where the astronauts go to drop a deuce .

Seeking Purpose in a Universe of Chance ( 1998 )
Victor J. Stenger
Review of Belief in God in the Age of Science by John Polkinghorne .
New Haven and London : Yale University Press 1998 .
This book is taken from a series of lectures given at Yale by a well - known elementary particle physicist who took up the cloth to become an Anglican priest and theologian .
He is a uniquely equipped and frequent participant in the dialogues between theology and science .
I am inclined to suggest that Chapter 5 , " Critical Realism in Science and Religion , " be read first .
There Polkinghorne motivates much of what he presents earlier .
He shows how the problem of determining " truth " in religion has many similarities with that in science .
Both engage in a rhetorical process he calls " critical realism . "
Polkinghorne claims that much of what we do in science is " the creative interpretation of experience , not rigorous deduction from it . "
Science is not the search for truth but for " verisimilitude , " the quality of having the appearance of truth or reality .
Scientists can never know when they have absolute truth ( 104 ) .
Neither can theologians .
All scientists and theologians can do is mount their best possible arguments and try to convince each other and everyone else .
This does not mean that reality is subjective or relative .
Polkinghorne is very much a realist , expressing no doubts that quarks and electrons are real .
He calls the period 1950 - 80 , when both he and I were active workers in particle physics , " a substantial episode in the history of discovery " ( 103 ) .
How could I disagree with that ?
Polkinghorne is a refreshing contrast to Hugh Ross , another physicist turned - theologian .
Ross writes from the framework that he already knows the truth - what 's in the Bible - and does his best to make the data conform to that truth .
( See my review of Ross 's Creator and the Cosmos at < URL:/library / modern/vic_stenger/ross.html > ) .
Do n't get me wrong .
Polkinghorne is a True Believer .
While he acknowledges the greater power of science to test its beliefs against observation , he thinks that theology also has a legitimate claim on verisimilitude .
He does not accept the account of God as some abstract Platonic concept of perfection and order .
Although he views the religious experiences of the " conflicting variety of the world faith religions " as " authentic , " he stands on his own conviction that the Christian revelation is superior to them and to science .
Science has a " circularity " that is mutually sustaining while theology offers the means to break this circle .
" One must believe in order to understand " ( 113 ) .
Chapter 1 presents reasons from human experience that Polkinghorne says encourage belief in a divine mind and purpose behind the history of the world .
He refrains from talking about " proofs " and is content with looking for insights from theology on " what is going on " ( 10 ) .
But Polkinghorne offers no new insights here , referring in typical fashion to our moral , aesthetic , and religious intuitions .
Here , as throughout the book , he falls back on his personal convictions .
He " cannot believe " that life " simply came into being when hominid brains had acquired sufficient complexity to accommodate such thoughts " ( 20 ) .
He laments : " If cosmic history is no more than the temporary flourishing of remarkable fruitfulness followed by its subsequent decay and disappearance , then I think Macbeth was right and it is indeed a tale told by an idiot " ( 21 ) .
Perhaps it is , whether we like it or not .
Chapter 2 considers the " Christ event " and its aftermath , claiming it provides insights of reason and revelation , with further information provided by tradition .
The point is to take a case from theology , namely the development of attitudes about the nature of Christ and compare it with scientific method .
He likens the Pauline formula to Bohr 's theory of the hydrogen atom , " highly instructive as a heuristic device " ( 37 ) .
He argues that Christology is not the " height of metaphysical speculation " but an " attempt to give a coherent and adequate account of the fact of [ the Church 's ] encounter with Christ " ( 47 ) .
In chapter 3 , Polkinghorne indulges in some interesting speculation about how God acts on the physical world .
Most people would simply say God performs miracles , doing whatever he wants to do whenever he wants to do it .
If God wants to violate energy conservation , he does it .
If he wants to nudge evolution a certain way , he does it .
Polkinghorne , good physicist that he is , wants to find a mechanism that is consistent with the laws of physics and not require blatant miracles .
This makes sense , since science has never found evidence for a miracle of any shape or form , blatant or not .
Although Galileo had been condemned by the Church , Newton restored God to the throne of Heaven even as Charles II was being restored to the throne of England .
Newton believed that his laws of mechanics and gravity were those set down by the great lawgiver in the sky .
Using the modern catchy phrase of Stephen Hawking , Newton had succeeded in reading the " mind of God . "
The only miracle God need to have ever performed was the one of creating the universe and its laws .
The quantum revolution undermines the notion of a Newtonian clockwork universe operating deterministically according to a divine plan .
Random chance appears to play a significant role in events .
And , if quantum mechanics indeed indicates that chance is inherent in nature , chaos theory and the other new sciences of complexity have demonstrated how chance processes in sufficiently complex systems can generate order and beauty with no preexistent design .
Structure and beauty can be simulated on a computer running the simple algorithm of the Mandelbrot set or other nonlinear procedures .
Genetic algorithms can produce artificial life in a computer with completely unpredictable structure and form .
This has left theology in a quandary .
How can we live in a purposeful universe when a good part of that universe seems to be the product of chance ?
Where can God exert his influence in such a universe ?
Polkinghorne thinks that God probably cannot control things on the macroscopic scale by simply acting microscopically on each elementary particle in the universe .
As far as we know from current , conventional physics , these particles and the laws they obey do not fully determine the development of macroscopic complexity .
Complexity seems to evolve by processes of self - organization that include an unpredictable element of chance .
We are very unlikely ever to find an equation that shows DNA developing from the motion of quarks and electrons .
At best , elementary processes place broad limits upon what can develop .
Our present best guess is that the behaviors of macroscopic systems are " emergent phenomena " that result from a combination of chance and constraint , not necessity .
Polkinghorne , and other scientist - believers such as biochemist and fellow Anglican priest Arthur Peacock , have found room for God to act within the framework of chaos theory .
God does not selectively inject energy into various places in the universe needing his intervention .
Rather , as " pure spirit , " he injects information .
Thus , as the complex nonlinear systems of life oscillate back and forth trying to decide which strange attractor to move towards , God intervenes with a gentle nudge in the direction that moves the system where he wishes it to go .
Polkinghorne speculates that the possible mechanism may be related to one proposed by Nobel laureate chemist Ilya Prigogine .
Prigogine has advanced the notion that macroscopic , many - body processes are able to act down to the elementary particle level and provide a " top - down " causality that violates the longstanding reductionist , " bottom - up " causality of conventional physics .
This idea has had a wide and enthusiastic reception among new age holists who , like Christians and other more traditional theists , hate the thought of mindless chance playing such a crucial role in the universe .
Indeed , those who search for religion in science are allied with those who seek evidence for top - down causality in a system where virtually all explanations are bottom - up .
No surprise , then , that both efforts are tinged with mysticism .
Prigogine has shown that it is possible to enlarge the class of solutions of certain equations in statistical mechanics to contain ones that cannot be reduced to sums of localized particle trajectories .
This is presumed to leave the door open for holistic , top - down causality .
However , no evidence has been found to support this notion .
All that evidence continues to be consistent with bottom - up causality tempered by chance .
In Chapter 4 , Polkinghorne considers other modern developments in the dialogue between science and religion .
He dismisses what he calls the polemical scientific writings of authors like Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett as a problem for the secular academy , not the Church .
He asserts that biologists are still intellectually inebriated by their success in unraveling the basis of molecular genetics , a victory comparable to the physicists ' earlier elucidation of the laws of motion and gravity .
Physicists have now gone beyond reductionism and are so more congenial to religious notions ( 79 ) .
Polkinghorne argues that many physical notions , such as conservation laws and fields , have been asked to carry too much metaphysical freight .
He knows from his physics that conservation laws are virtual tautologies .
They are " consequences of the symmetries of creation and can easily be understood as expression of the Creator 's will rather than impositions on it . "
Similarly , he finds the common use of the field as a metaphor for omniscient spirit " quaint " and " distinctly limited " ( 82 ) .
Polkinghorne claims he is not engaged in " an apologetic exercise , trying to make the faith appear acceptable in a scientific age .
He warns against a " scientific takeover bid , offering no more than a religious gloss on a basically naturalistic account . "
He rejects Spinoza 's deus sive natura .
" That was Einstein 's God , but it is certainly not mine " ( 85 - 86 ) .
Polkinghorne finds science writers who " garnish their wares " with references to God and big bang cosmology as tiresome .
He insists that " theology is concerned with . . . ontological questions . . . and gains little from science 's fascinating , but largely theologically irrelevant , talk of temporal origins . "
This places him outside the large group of theistic scientists who are obsessed with cosmology and what they see as evidence that the universe has been fine - tuned for life .
Far more important to Polkinghorne is " the most significant event in cosmic history to date - the dawn of consciousness " ( 88 ) .
Once again Polkinghorne calls on chaos and complexity theory .
He argues that " holistic and relational concepts are coming to play an increasing role in science . "
These are regarded as " congenial to theological thinking , " as exemplified by " much Trinitarian discussion that emphasizes relationship ( communion ) as the ground of being " ( 97,98 ) .
Chapter 6 is a " Mathematical Postscript " which takes the Platonic line promoted by mathematician Roger Penrose and others that " mathematics is the exploration of an existing noetic realm . "
In a book that contains many expressions of his personal beliefs , Polkinghorne winds up by saying " I believe there is a much more persuasive case for believing in the reality of the Mandelbrot set than in the reality of the Idea of a lion . "
The realm of physical and mental experience are " parts of an interlinked complementary created reality " ( 128-130 ) .
In his 1994 book The Faith of a Physicist , Polkinghorne was quite explicit in rejecting even the remotest chance that we live in a purely natural , purposeless universe : " The strategy of the materialist atheists is usually to claim that science is all , and that beauty and the rest are merely human constructs arising from the hard - wiring in our brains .
I cannot accept so grotesquely impoverished a view of reality . "
But there , as here , he insists on interpreting the world from an anthropocentric , theocentric perspective .
Nonbelieving scientists such as Feynman and Sagan looked at the material universe with wonder and found material reality to be anything but grotesquely impoverished .
Theologians and scientists each seek understanding .
But theologians rely on the mythical tales and subjective human experiences that emanate from the insignificant point in spacetime that encloses human history .
Scientists , by contrast , view a range of space from inside atomic nuclei to the farthest quasar , and a range of time from a tiny fraction of a second after the big bang to the present .
They see a universe more vast and with far more potential for development than has ever been imagined in any scripture or mystical trance .
I was greatly aided in this review by comments from Jean Bricmont , Scott Dalton , Keith Douglas , Peter Fimmel , Jim Humphreys , Norm Levitt , Ricardo Alder Mur , Clay Stinson , and Ed Weinmann .
Apple is exploring the possibility of including a wireless " remote wand " with future versions of its Apple TV media system that would provide users with precise control over a cursor on the Apple TV screen in very much the same way a conventional mouse controls a cursor on a PC .
It would also unlock three - dimensional controls similar to those offered by Nintendo 's Wii controller .
The wand , which was revealed in a patent filing published for the first time this week , would control the movement of a cursor displayed on a TV screen by the position and orientation at which it is held by the user .
As the user moves the wand , the on - screen cursor would follow .
Unlike the current 5 - button remote shipping with the current version of Apple TV , the wand would be capable of controlling a plurality of new operations and applications that may be available from the media system , including for example zoom operations , a keyboard application , an image application , an illustration application , and a media application .
According to Apple , the Apple TV media system could identify the movements of the wand using any suitable motion detection component such as an embedded accelerometer or a gyroscope .
Another approach for identifying the movements of the wand would be to determine its absolute position relative to one or more infrared modules positioned adjacent to the screen in the living room .
" The wand may include an optical component for capturing images of the infrared modules , and may calculate its orientation and distance from the modules based on the captured images , " the company said .
" In some embodiments , the electronic device may direct the infrared modules to identify the position of an infrared emitter incorporated on the wand , and may calculate the absolute position of the wand relative to the infrared modules . "
By incorporating the wand controller into future Apple TVs , Apple would unlock a tremendous amount of capability in its set - top - box interface while blurring the lines between a conventional PC and a media system .
In one example , the company shows how pressing the remote 's menu button would trigger a Dock to rise from the bottom of the Apple TV screen , which users could then navigate by moving the wand from left to right .
The wand could also incorporate several new selection techniques that would reduce dependency on physical buttons such as the menu / select button on the current Apple remote .
" In some embodiments , the user may provide a selection input by moving wand in a particular manner , " Apple said .
" For example , the user may flick wand ( e.g. , move wand in circular pattern ) , rotate wand in a particular manner ( e.g. , perform a rotation of wand ) , move wand a particular distance off screen , or any other suitable movement of wand . "
When it comes to navigating album art or other media presented in CoverFlow mode , the user could draw a circular pattern on the screen to cause the CoverFlow carousel to rotate , displaying different selectable options .
Wand movements could also direct the carousel to turn in a particular direction based on the direction in which it 's rotated .
When inside Apple TV 's photo application , similar movements would allow the user to navigate large sets of thumbnails and make selections .
However , a more powerful aspect may the ability of the wand to zoom in and out of images based on its proximity to the screen .
" To zoom out , the user may move wand away from screen such that the distance between wand and screen may be larger than the initial distance between wand and [ the ] screen , " Apple explained .
" The larger distance between wand and screen may be depicted by the position of wand relative [ to its ] origin . [...]
In some embodiments , the user may provide an input in the z - direction ( e.g. , to zoom out ) by providing an appropriate input with an input mechanism without moving wand .
For example , the user may roll a scroll wheel , provide an input on a touchpad , or move a joystick to provide an input in the z - direction and zoom out the image of [ the ] screen . "
Rotating the wand could also serve to rotate and skew images on the screen :
Another advantage of the wand would be its ability to trigger a keyboard application from within any of Apple TV 's core applications and provide swifter input .
Instead of navigating the keyboard with left , right , up , and down arrows , the " user may select a character on the displayed line by pointing wand at a particular character to place cursor over the character , " Apple said .
" To access other characters not displayed on a particular line , the user may select one of [ the ] arrows to scroll [ a ] line to the left or to the right .
In some embodiments , the user may simply place cursor at the left or right edge of the screen to scroll [ a ] line . "
Apple goes on in the massive 64 - page filing to describe methods for using the wand to control media scrubber bars , jump around the Apple TV interface , and serve as a digital pen for an illustration application .
The May 2008 filing is credited to Apple employees Duncan Kerr and Nicholas King .
In January acting chief executive Tim Cook said , " We will continue to invest [ in Apple TV ] , because we believe there is something there for us in the future . "
Cook 's comments were in the context of the news that unit sales were up over three times year - over - year .
He still cautioned Apple is considering the device a hobby , as Steve Jobs has often said since its release .
As the UIQ Platform Opens , UIQ Closes
by Ostatic Staff - Jan. 06 , 2009
Things looked admittedly bleak for UIQ in June , when the mobile software company 's code was slated to be integrated into the Symbian Foundation 's open source platform .
Yesterday it was announced that Motorola and Sony Ericsson , joint owners of UIQ , declared the company insolvent .
On December 30th , UIQ filed for bankruptcy ( as is required of insolvent companies under Swedish law ) .
UIQ 's chief executive , Johan Sandberg , said that UIQ was surviving on the royalty fees from its intellectual property , and Sony Ericsson and Motorola 's decision to work with the Symbian Foundation was the real end for the firm .
Motorola discontinued work with UIQ in November , but both it and Sony Ericsson avoided cutting the company loose , in order to allow UIQ and its employees extra time to look for new opportunities .
It 's interesting to look at this story from both sides of the intellectual property argument .
It illustrates clearly why companies go to great lengths ( and expense ) to hold on to and protect intellectual property -- it is a matter of life and death in some instances .
Could an open license , implemented from the beginning , save a company from this end , if only because it forces the business to approach the market in a very different manner ?
It 's difficult to say , even in hindsight .
It would seem that choosing the best licensing for your product is as important as -- and integral to -- adapting to change and competition .
The other problem with bras is that ladies get angry if you cut them off with a razor or scissors .

Forum - goers will no doubt catch the Unpredictable Strippers in - joke .
The rest of you non -forum people will just have to giggle nervously as we all laugh !
So I took another jab at Conor Oberst in today 's strip .
It really is like trying to hit the side of a barn with a Gatling gun .
Still , it 's so much fun !
I can guarantee that the emo - bashing will continue throughout the lifespan of this strip .
Hell , SOMEBODY'S gotta take up the torch now that Nothing Nice To Say has died .
I am going to feel hell of awkward if I ever meet the girl who draws Life 's So Rad ( supar - emo webcomic ) in person .
I really , really want an Apple G5 .
Even the 1.6 gHz machine would be wonderful .
While the PC I 'm currently working on is plenty nice , Apples are just so much more art and design friendly that it 's just making me sad whenever I go to Apple.com and drool over all the pretty shiny things there .
Two more things :
First of all , I 'd like to take the opportunity to whore out the services of my uber - talented sweetie Heather .
She recently left her job to go back to grad school , and is looking for some work in the interim .
She is extremely skilled at web design , everything from basic HTML and CSS work to complex PHP and dynamic site scripting .
She did all of the backend for Questionable Content , if you 're looking for examples of her work .
Anyway , if you 're interested in giving her money to do web things , drop her a line at donneh ( at ) alum ( dot ) rpi ( dot ) edu .
The last thing is that since she quit her job she 's moving in with me here in Northampton .
Once we get her settled in , we 're thinking of having a BIG CRAZY HOUSEPARTY ( or a small , slightly crazy houseparty ) to celebrate .
If you'd be interested in attending ( we have lots of couches for people to sleep on ) , drop me a line .
That 's all for today .
Keep voting for QC over at Buzzcomix !
We 're doing really well so thank you for the help .
See you Wednesday !
A federal judge ordered the Food and Drug Administration on Monday to make the Plan B morning - after birth control pill available without prescription to women as young as 17 .
The judge ruled that the agency had improperly bowed to political pressure from the Bush administration in 2006 when it set 18 as the age limit .
The agency has 30 days to comply with the order , in which the judge also urged the agency to consider removing all restrictions on over - the - counter sales of Plan B .
The drug consists of two pills that prevent conception if taken within 72 hours of sexual intercourse .
Some women ’s health advocates hailed the decision .
“ It is a complete vindication of the argument that reproductive rights advocates have been making for years , that in the Bush administration it was politics , not science , driving decisions around women ’s health , ” said Nancy Northup , president of the Center for Reproductive Rights , the attorneys for the plaintiff in the suit against the F.D.A .
— A Johnston County jailer was off the job on Sunday after she was arrested on charges of driving while impaired and possession of moonshine .
The North Carolina Highway Patrol said Shirley Woodard Tyndall crashed into a ditch along U.S. Highway 301 in Wilson County , near Lucama , while trying to cross the four - lane road early Saturday morning .
Tyndall , who worked at the jail for about two years , was fired shortly after her arrest , Johnston County Sheriff Steve Bizzell said .
She also faces a charge of careless and reckless driving .
Her husband , Thomas Joseph Tyndall , was also in the vehicle with her , was also charged with aiding and abetting DWI and possession of moonshine .
Cute .
Looks like the SCEE Portable IDs are now live , thanks to everyone that emailed in about them .
Here ’s the one for my main ( public ) PSN ID :
– ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW –
The recent games only seems to show you the games you last got Trophies in though , not the games you actually played last .
I presume then , that this actually wo n’t show games that do n’t have Trophies at all .
Like Singstar Queen .
Ahem .
What do you think of them , then ?
Last weekend I went along to a training weekend for the Scottish Mountain Bike Leader Association ’s Trail Cycle Leader award , or the SMBLA TCL .
I ’ve already talked about the first day of the TCL in my last post , now we ’re onto the second day and the hard stuff : riding skills and leading a group !
On the second day we had the one session I thought I might be lacking a bit in , and that was the ride skills training .
For the assessment you need to be able to do a track stand to a reasonable level , along with a front wheel lift , both manual and powered .
Now , I ’m fine with manuals and I ’m getting better at trackstands but , to be honest , I ’ve never got the hang of wheelies , mainly due to never having really practised it !
Even better , one of the guys on my course had been riding since he was about 10 and was trackstanding for about 10 minutes 1 - handed so I was feeling a little inadequate .
Neil was great though , and explained the moves no problem .
By the end of the session I was getting a good 2 or 3 seconds on my wheelies ( technically a powered front wheel lift for you text - book fans ) and had discovered that you only need to track - stand for 5 seconds on the assessment .
With a bit of practise before the assessment I felt there would be no problem .
The last afternoon of the weekend was spent actually leading out on the trail which was a great learning experience .
We had to plan a route card for a leg of trail in Hamsterley forest , about 5 km long with plenty of turns , and on the route card you have to measure distance and time estimates .
This was where one assessment worry crept in as you have to estimate both correctly to within 10 % .
Distance is n’t too much of a bother as you can use ruler and string to measure it out on the map , but the time is obviously a little more variable .
The SMBLA book has a table for estimating times based on type of terrain , steepness , etc , but still , there ’s some difference between a fat lad on a Toy ’s R Us full - sus special and a lycra-clad , shaven legged whippet on a carbon GT .
You just have to try and find the middle group and take a best guess .
Admittedly , once out on the trail you can be checking the watch and altering speed accordingly but it ’s a tight margin for error nonetheless .
The leading went well anyway , and everyone got to within a pretty good margin on the navigation .
Two of us were a little slow on our times but , considering one of the guys was a triathlete in training and another was an active road racer , we decided the group was probably a little faster than your average so all was forgiven .
After arriving back from our leading escapades all that was left to do was a little review , the filling out of forms and a few farewells .
Looking back at the weekend I ’m still impressed with how much I learned .
I was a little arrogant going in , thinking that there might be an element of simply ticking the boxes before going for assessment , but having done it I ’m planning to take at least a couple of months to practise everything before going forward .
I think the course would be useful to anyone into biking , even if they never intend to earn money as a trail cycle leader .
Everyone takes out a friend new to biking at some point and Neil had plenty of advice on working with new riders and equalising groups .
Also , some of the equipment and trailside maintenance advice will definately come in handy for a multi-day ride I ’m planning for next month , and the skills training itself will certainly improve my riding next time I ’m out at Glentress .
So , next step is the assessment and attempting to get within the magic 10 % with my time estimates .
If you ’re out on the trail in a couple of months and see a pretty stressed looking guy frantically checking his watch and dragging a group along by the helmet straps then say hello .
I probably wont reply , my attention darting between watch and map , but at least I ’ll know I ’m giving someone a laugh .

WIRED : Music industry ’s plan ignores the general direction of all digital technology
THREE STRIKES is a policy , agreed to by Eircom as part of a settlement with the major music labels , that will lead to the ISP cutting off their own users from the internet if they are accused three times of copyright infringement .
The Irish telco is the first in Europe to agree to the recording industry ’s demand for this extreme measure .
Hear that enormous smacking sound ?
That noise is 100,000 Irish geeks slapping their heads in frustration at another music industry own goal .
Just when the record labels looked like they were coming to their collective senses : dropping crippling digital rights management ( DRM ) from its downloads , supporting innovative digital distribution companies like Spotify , and abandoning its policy of suing music lovers who file - share , they go and make a deal like this .
Let ’s not discuss the consumer risk of being thrown off the internet at the slightest evidence from a third party .
Eircom and the labels assure us that the standard is just as high as a court would demand – which surely means , as author Cory Doctorow notes , that if these music companies are so sure of their evidence , they would agree to be thrown off the internet after their third mistaken accusation ?
And let ’s not bother with those obvious dire headlines for Eircom and the labels , neither of whom are currently famous for great customer relations , when their detection system misfires .
What I , like so many other users of technology , would like to know is this : how exactly does the music industry think these strikes will save them ?
I know the theory : that by raising the stakes on those the labels pursue , and streamlining the process of punishing infringement so that it no longer involves a tiresome visit to the court for the rightsholders , online copying will somehow diminish by an appreciable amount ; enough to save their profits and keep the current system in place .
This is the “ speedbump ” theory of intellectual property enforcement : millions of casually infringing file - sharers will cease their behaviour as soon as the risk becomes too high , and finding free music online becomes too cumbersome .
It ’s sounded convincing before – it ’s the same argument that led music companies to embrace DRM , which was supposed to stop the casual copying of music from CDs and legitimate online stores like iTunes .
In the end , DRM did no such thing .
Infringers who wanted to make many copies found other easier routes to obtain their music .
Meanwhile , legitimate consumers grew frustrated and angry at the patronising and restrictive limitations of their purchased digital music .
Indeed , they frequently turned to unauthorised copies of music because they were easier and more flexible to use than the commercially available versions .
Will a speedbump work for three strikes ?
In attempting to punish unauthorised copying , the music industry is not just fighting the habit of music sharing , it ’s fighting the general direction of all digital technology .
Copying data is easier and faster with every generation of computers and storage .
Already the net is too slow for many music sharers .
Instead of downloading individual tracks , these file - sharers simply pool terabytes of music data offline on handheld , high - capacity drives that cost less than € 50 .
They do n’t even touch the internet .
Should we police these drives , or impose some tariff on them ?
We could , and I ’m sure the music industry will make exactly that argument in a year or so .
But do we really want to embed systems to analyse and monitor our hard drives , controlled by a third party ?
If the idea of a record executive being able to cast someone into net exile and add their name to a blacklist seems extreme , what would a system to police all our offline files be called ?
Perhaps we can give up such offline file - sharing as beyond anyone ’s control , just as the music industry has effectively abandoned any attempt to limit people burning mix CDs of their favourite music ( a practice that they still estimate costs them billions a year in “ lost revenue ” ) .
Let ’s stick with net - mediated infringement , then .
Sadly , with five minutes ’ effort , any techy worth his or her salt can devise a system for consistently evading the detection of these ISP - led three strike systems .
Off the top of my head : music fans could upload their collections to a third party hosting site , and then publicise the link .
The music industry has the power to shut down that host , but wo n’t have the easy record of who downloads the files that current peer - to - peer systems provide them with .
Two : file - sharers could take advantage of the revolution in social networking sites to share only with friends , and friends of friends .
That might sound like a limiting speedbump to some – until you see the millions anyone can reach via Facebook or a similar site .
There are surely many others , and we ’ll quickly see which systems work , if only because Eircom and anyone else who follows this approach will quickly promote those that are the most invisible from detection .
But it wo n’t be driving file - sharing underground , because while the technology will became more evasive , the interfaces will remain just the same for the average user .
And the music industry will have placed its hopes in yet another doomed , customer - unfriendly venture into vigilante net policing .
( Reuters ) - A whistleblower contacted U.S. regulators more than five years ago alleging that businesses of Allen Stanford , the Texas billionaire charged last week by U.S. securities regulators with an $ 8 billion fraud , were involved in an “ illegal Ponzi scheme , ” the Financial Times said .
Leyla Basagoitia , a former Stanford employee , raised a series of red flags about the tycoon ’s empire in a 2003 employment dispute with her company at a tribunal run by the finance industry ’s self - regulatory body , the paper said citing her lawyer .
Basagoitia also alerted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission at about the same time , her lawyer said , echoing criticisms the agency ignored early warnings about the alleged $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme run by Bernard Madoff , the paper added .
Basagoitia told an arbitration panel at the National Association of Securities Dealers in October 2003 that she suspected that Stanford Group Company was “ engaged in a Ponzi scheme to defraud its clients , ” the paper said citing case documents .
The SEC did not immediately reply to a Reuters email seeking comment that was sent outside of normal business hours .
The FBI made the first arrest in the Stanford Financial Group fraud investigation on Thursday , detaining chief investment officer Laura Pendergest - Holt on federal obstruction charges .

[ 4.0 ]
What are electronic cigarettes ?
Some electronic cigarettes ( or e-cigarettes ) look exactly like regular cigarettes or cigars ; others look more like pens .
They are battery powered , and create their effect by vaporizing nicotine which is dissolved in a solution of water and propylene glycol ( which , minus the nicotine , is basically the fog that is used in fog machines ) .
The result is something that feels somewhat like smoke in the mouth and lungs but without involving any real smoke , tobacco or combustion .
This e-cigarette fog ( or vapour ) dissipates rapidly , and leaves little scent in the air or on clothing .
E-smoking is almost identical to cigarette smoking .
The major difference is that the e-cigarette is always " lit " .
Most of them even have an LED on the end that lights up like a cigarette ember when you draw on it .
You can put it down or pick it up at any time without worrying about burning anything .
It is only on when you actually draw on it .
How much you smoke is related more to how many puffs you desire rather than on the length of the cigarette .
When switching over to e-cigarettes , a person needs to buy a kit which includes the battery containing smoking tube , cartridges which may or may not be flavored , and which may have high , low or no levels of nicotine , a recharger for the battery , an atomizer ( this vaporizes the nicotine ) , and a set of instructions .
As this is an electronic device , there may be a need in the future to purchase new batteries and atomizers as basic upkeep to keep your unit functioning properly .
Even with refills and replacement pieces , there is still a phenomenal savings in comparison to tobacco .
There is also the option of buying individual disposable " cigars " which might be a good way to start without a big investment as long as there is not a big shipping charge .
Of course , if you are fortunate enough to have a retailer stocking these items , you can bypass that cost .
For a good overview of the basics of the e-cigarette product and its use see How to Vape .
[ 4.1 ]
Are they really safer than regular cigarettes ?
- Yes .
Though we are uncertain as to how safe they are , we are fairly sure that they are safer than smoking cigarettes .
Part of our certainty derives from knowing how harmful regular smoking is .
Almost anything is certain to be safer .
Almost anything else that is not acutely toxic ( and we know the e-cigs are not ) will be safer .
Even if e-cigs are about ten times as harmful as smokeless tobacco , that still makes them about 1/10th as harmful as smoking .
Smoking is just that bad .
First of all , there is no burning of any plant matter so all those combustion related carcinogens are no longer present .
Of course , in most cases , nicotine is still present but , as we 've written elsewhere , nicotine is one of the more benign elements in tobacco ( see our Nicotine FAQ for more on this ) .
All that remains is some uncertainty about the effects of propylene glycol with long term regular use .
However , though there is little danger in smoking e-cigarettes , there are some safety issues involved if people are using refillable versions and handling liquid nicotine .
In the liquid form , nicotine is quite dangerous and any spills onto skin should be immediately washed off and certainly it should never be ingested .
For more details , see Laugesen 's cautions here .
[ 4.2 ]
Are they as safe as using smokeless tobacco ?
- Maybe .
We cannot be as certain of their safety range as we are with smokeless tobacco ( ST ) simply because they are so new .
With smokeless tobacco , we have evidence from decades and decades of use by many different populations .
Evidence that comes only from examining substance effects on cells in laboratories , measuring constituents in blood or urine , or its effects on nonhumans does not provide enough information to know what the effects will be on humans over time .
There are some but not that many studies of the potential harms that might come from using electronic cigarettes .
To date , there is no indication of anything substantial .
So , all we can say at this point is that they could be as safe , or even safer , than using ST or pharmaceutical nicotine products but we can not be certain of that .
There are studies that confirm the chemicals that the body receives from some e-cigarettes , but not all of them .
There is some concern about quality control -- making sure they are only what they say they are -- given that many factories in China are producing various versions with little regulation or oversight .
We recommend using major brands that have been well tested .
The most comprehensive study so far is on Ruyan ( the largest producer ) and indicates a clean product .
( You can find that report online here . )
Or you can find the link and also a few other reports in our Research Bibliography section under Electronic Cigarettes , as well as a risk report on propylene glycol .
Unfortunately , the studies that we have are all about chemistry , and a chemistry study does not tell us everything about human health effects .
Since nicotine seems to be the source of most , if not all , of the risk from using smokeless tobacco , e-cigarettes , like traditional pharmaceutical nicotine products , will likely have those same risks ( which we discuss HERE ) .
To date , there is no reason to believe there is any substantial additional risk from the e-cigarettes , but we can not be certain of that .
[ 4.3 ]
How can I be sure I will like them ?
You can't .
But here is a link to a couple of resources out there .
The first is a forum of former smokers discussing their experiences , and how they feel about the different available products , and the second is a reviewer who is trying to gather and review all the available products ;( E - cigarette forum.com , and E - smoker forever ) .
And here at E - cig review is a summary page for one person 's experience with many brands .
( Or watch this video of one long time smoker 's experience with various methods including e-cigarettes ) .

Is vaping as expensive as smoking ?
The following is a British resource which will give you some idea of how much healthier your pocketbook will be ( as well as your lungs ) .
[ 4.5 ]
Where can I buy them ?
Note :
As of March 2009 , Health Canada has decided to officially advise Canadians not to use electronic cigarettes ( see the Advisory here ) and has also curtailed the marketing ( see here ) .
In the United States , many of health organizations such as the American Lung Association , and the American Cancer Society are also actively campaigning to remove e-cigarettes from the market .
We hope this is temporary and that the situation changes .
We are also not entirely certain what this means in terms of finding and using e-cigs .
Unfortunately , this means that Health Canada and those American groups are actually advocating smoking regular and proven to be harmful cigarettes over their almost certainly safer electronic alternatives .
We will keep you informed of any major developments .
Presently , electronic cigarettes are much more commonly available on the internet than in stores ; some personal orders appear to be successful .
You might check with your local tobacco shop as to whether they carry or plan to carry these products .
At this time , Canadian distributors have been shut down indefinitely ( Health Canada has essentially made it impossible to gain approval ) while American distributors are suffering from haphazard confiscations by the FDA .
A few governments are discouraging these products and threatening eventual confiscation .
Of course , this makes it much less likely for this product to be on the shelves .
We are hoping that the situation improves so that electronic cigarettes become at least as easy to purchase as regular cigarettes .
In the meanwhile , E - cigarette Ban is currently the best site for keeping track of the status of e-cigarettes around the world .
[ 4.6 ]
If these are so good , why are n't governments and anti-smoking groups supporting them ?
We do not know for sure .
There does not seem to be a concerted effort to block these products in most countries , though that remains a possibility .
Regulatory agencies have a legitimate responsibility to help make sure the products are pure and contain what they say .
This creates a challenge in the current environment .
Groups that are truly anti-smoking should embrace any alternative , but those that are more interested in making life difficult for smokers or nicotine users do not like these products because they could make nicotine users more comfortable .
Whenever government regulatory agencies are confronted with a new product , they need to find the proper category to put it into , and then make sure it complies with the standards associated with that category .
In this case , even though nicotine is widely available in many forms , it is still important to make sure the products do not contain any hidden toxins , that they function properly ( e.g. , cannot accidentally deliver an overdose ) , and so forth .
In this case , the waters have been muddied by the claims that it helps people quit smoking .
Whether or not it does is not the concern of the agency , but when such a claim is made , the claim needs to be proven ( and that means more than anecdotes ) .
In some sense , the situation is absurd because someone could much more easily introduce another harmful product that was part of an already established category than introduce a new and obviously safer alternative .
Governments typically worry more about hypothetical new risks than clear old risks .
Some commentators have suggested that governments are so used to tax revenues that if electronic cigarettes became more popular they could threaten this income .
This is not an absurd concern , given the current economic conditions and given that governments have been raising tobacco taxes to make up shortfalls in other areas .
We can only hope that if that is the plan , that they keep the taxes lower than on tobacco products because the last thing you want to do is make people choose traditional cigarettes because they are cheaper .
However you do hear official spokespersons from both government , NGOs and anti-tobacco agencies making statements that either betray ignorance of where the harm in smoking comes from , or statements that are ideological rather than concerned with health .
You might hear that e-cigarettes are dangerous because they deliver nicotine which they say is a poison .
See our nicotine FAQ for why this has little basis .
You also hear people say that these just keep people smoking .
That may sound like a health statement but it is simply expressing an opinion that no one should smoke , not even if it is entirely safe .
This statement ignores the public health harm reduction principle that we should do all we can to protect the health of those who choose to smoke , and part of that protection involves educating people about the comparative risks of these products and in promoting the safer options .
Or you might hear that this will lead people to smoking .
This makes little sense since it is much easier to obtain traditional cigarettes , and what you hear most from people who enjoy these , is that apart from being able to smoke inside again , they feel they are making a healthier choice .
We like to think that those against will realize that e-cigarettes ( and smokeless tobacco ) remove all that second hand smoke they are so worried about , and also remove the health risks associated with nicotine use .
How can you argue with that ?
At the very least , we hope that anyone who has doubts about these products will realize that the elimination of second hand smoke and a likely reduction in health risk will mean that governments will eventually come to approve them .
Anti-nicotine extremists , on the other hand , might stay with their goal of trying to punish smokers rather than offer them good alternatives .
[ 4.7 ]
Can I use these in nonsmoking areas ?
Technically you should be able to use these anywhere .
No smoking sections refer to the smoking of tobacco so legally there is no prohibition against these .
However , you might have to let people know that you are not smoking tobacco .
Even though you are not generating anything remotely like second hand smoke , some might prohibit your e-smoking simply because they disapprove of even the appearance of smoking .
Over time , this should become less necessary to explain to people .
Some of these products come with information cards to give to people who might think you are doing something illegal .
[ 4.8 ]
Could these help me quit all nicotine use ?
- Maybe .
They might .
Switching away from smoking is the most important thing to do so even if you end up not quitting .
At least it wo n't harm you the way smoking will .
Some people have found that electronic cigarettes reduce their need to smoke somewhat .
E- cigarette Direct has posted a collection of e-cig user comments about their experiences with many reporting that they have reduced or quit traditional smoking .
The products are available with varying levels of nicotine , from a lot to none , so they can be used as a weaning product .
It does not strictly qualify as scientific evidence but indications are that e-cigarettes are being used successfully by many to quit smoking , with many of the quitters having a history of trying other methods and failing .
And though anti-tobacco activists see them as an attraction for adolescents and those who never would have smoked , we have seen no reports of previously never smokers starting up with this product .
Every anecdote so far appears to tell the same story ; a cigarette smoker is switching over , sometimes just part time but more often full time , to this safer alternative .
Other quit smoking methods have little success with many smokers , so it is not surprizing that people who are trying to quit will try this too .
And given the reports , it seems to be working for many .
In time we should see some formal studies but in the meanwhile , on a person to person basis , some smokers are rapidly reducing their health risks .

In what could pass for a remarkable and historic interview during his last 10 days as likely the most powerful vice president in national history , conservative Republican Dick Cheney says he sees the inauguration of liberal Democrat Barack Obama as positive and remarkable and historic .
Even exciting .
No , really .
The conservative Cheney , much villified on the left as an effective partisan and hawk , and called the worst or most dangerous vice president in American history something like that by the next vice president in American history , Joe Biden , was interviewed on tape Friday by CNN 's Wolfie .
Portions of the taped interview were obtained from CNN .
In the session set for broadcast on Sunday morning 's " Late Edition , " Cheney was asked his thoughts as he looks at the impending inauguration of Obama on Jan. 20 .
Cheney first states the obvious :
As a Republican , he voted for John McCain .
But then the conservative Wyoming resident and longtime Washington denizen says :
" I have the same feeling that I think many Americans have , that it 's really remarkable that -- what we 're going to do here in a few days is swear in the first African American president of the United States .
When I came to town in 1968 , we'd had the Martin Luther King assassination , Bobby Kennedy assassination , riots in the cities , major , major disturbances , a lot of it racially motivated around the country .
" And in fact , things have changed so dramatically that we 're now about to swear in Barack Obama as president of the United States .
That 's really a remarkable story and I think a record of tremendous success and progress for the United States . "
Apparently , momentarily taken aback by the vice president 's positive tone on his party losing the White House , Blitzer mumbles , " Pretty historic .
Pretty exciting . "
And Cheney agrees !
" It is , " he says .

あまり頻繁に使うわけでもないWikipediaだが、ブログで取り上げるに当たり、基礎情報を調べようと「カラヤン」を検索してみた。インターネットにまつわる日本語と英語との情報ギャップについては梅田望夫さんが繰り返し注意を喚起しているところだが、カラヤンというグローバルなトピックに関して日本のWikipediaが何を掲載しているのかには興味が湧いた。続いて英独の情報にもアプローチしてみた。
見比べてみると、基本的に日本語の情報は英語のWikipediaを下敷きにし、そこに日本ならではの改変を加えるというスタイルで記述が成立している様子である。また、英語の情報はドイツ語のページと情報を共有している感が強い。
日本語の情報には特徴がある。トリビア的な情報付加が行われているわりに、幹となる情報が英独のページに比べるとたいへん弱い。相互に対応する項目である日本語の「生涯」と英語の「Biography」を読み比べると一目瞭然だが、日本語のページはカラヤンの戦前のキャリアをほとんどはしょってしまっており、戦後もすぐに1967年のザルツブルク復活音楽祭開始までひとっ飛びしてしまうなど、生涯を追うというかたちにそもそもなっていない。一方で、ザビーネ・マイヤーをめぐるベルリン・フィルとの確執の話やシュピーゲル誌の批判記事の話、ライム病感染の話など、「生涯」というよりはたんなるゴシップ紹介に終わってしまっている。
これに対して、英語のページは、戦前のキャリア確立時、戦後のカムバック時と、時系列に沿って彼のキャリアを俯瞰する内容で、ソースとしてはより分かりやすいものとなっている。ただし、こちらには、「生涯」としてＣＤ誕生へ協力した話であるとか、ナチス党員問題などがサブ項目として大きく取り上げられ、かつ音楽的な特徴すら、この「生涯」に入れらているなど、全体の構成には難がある。
さすがにご当地ドイツの情報は一等充実しており、英語ページの構成上のぎくしゃくもなければ、日本語ページのゴシップ周知とも異なる。ザルツブルクのモーツァルテウム音楽院でピアノを学び始めた時点から、客観的に彼のキャリアを記述していくスタイルで、情報に粗密がないし、情報量もふんだんにある（ただし、ナチス党員問題についてはまとまった言及がない）。
英独のサイトと比べて日本語のサイトの弱さは、記述の客観性に関して、英独とは異なる規範意識が働いているかのように感じられる点で、英独のそれが辞典の趣があるとすれば、日本のカラヤンサイトは週刊現代かよくて週刊朝日、つまり大衆ジャーナリズムにかなり近い雰囲気がある。
このことはページの冒頭に掲げられているリード文を見るだけで顕著に表れている。まずドイツ語版のリードを訳してみる。
英語版はどうか 。
最後に日本語版は 。
ドイツ語版は辞典のイメージ、英語版はニューヨークタイムズなどのクオリティ紙を意識したような雰囲気があるのに対し、日本語版は週刊誌のノリである。日本語の情報は最後までこの雰囲気が続く。全体の構成も非常にバランスが悪い。
比較した部分で日本語のカラヤン情報全体を象徴しているのは、
「
「楽壇の帝王」と呼ばれた。」の部分である。「帝王カラヤン」は存命中から彼の通り名として日本では常にそう呼ばれていたが、これはあくまで日本での通り名、日本のジャーナリストの誰かが付けた呼称に過ぎない。80年代、さかんに晩年のカラヤンとベルリンフィルを追っていたテレビマンユニオンがつくったある番組で、インタビュアーが「日本では、カラヤンは“帝王”と呼ばれているが、どう思うか」と練習合間のベルリン・フィル団員に尋ねる場面があった。質問をされた数人の団員はいちように困惑の笑顔をうかべ、ある一人が「帝王（ドイツ語でカイザー）と言えば、ベッケンバウアーしか思い浮かばないね」と答えて、周りが釣られて笑い出すという映像だった。言うまでもないが、「ベッケンバウアー」とは、ドイツ・サッカー界のスーパースター、フランツ・ベッケンバウアーを指している。欧州でも、アメリカでも、「帝王カラヤン」などとは誰も呼ばない。ところが、日本のWikipediaでは、「フルトヴェングラーの後任としてベルリン・フィルハーモニー管弦楽団の音楽監督を務め、一時期それと同時にウィーン国立歌劇場の芸術監督の地位にもあったことなどから、「楽壇の帝王」と呼ばれた」になってしまう。これは、“日本では”としないかぎり、大きな間違いだ。おまけに言えば、「巨匠（マエストロ）である。」という表現もどうかと思う。
もう時間がないので、紹介しないが、音楽的特徴に関する記述の部分も同様。日本語のページには、週刊誌的言辞が並んでいる。大衆がそう信じていた、メディアがそんな風に書いていたというコンテクストが、Wikipediaにもかなり影響を及ぼしている。日本語だけ見ていると、カラヤンは同じ顔かたちをし、同じ音楽を響かせながら、英独版で読むのとは微妙に異なる人格の人物に見えてしまう。
St. Patrick 's Day in the United States means clover - colored clothing , paper shamrocks , bagpipes , Irish folk music and dancing , corned beef and cabbage , green beer .
Often , the man of honor gets lost .
At its core , the holiday is a holy recognition of St. Patrick 's commitment to spreading Christianity throughout Ireland .
It falls on March 17 , the day he is believed to have died more than 1,500 years ago .
Over the centuries , Ireland 's patron saint has become a mythical figure , widely pictured with a long beard , standing tall on the lush Irish coast in ceremonial robes , wearing a bishop 's miter ( or hat ) , holding a shepherd 's staff .
Snakes scatter from his feet .
It 's an image that feeds into widely held misconceptions .
To set the record straight :
St Patrick was n't Irish .
There is disagreement over his precise birthplace , but it was somewhere in Roman Britain .
He did n't introduce Christianity to Ireland .
St. Palladius was the first bishop to travel to Ireland to convert the pagans , who believed in many gods .
He did n't drive the snakes from Ireland .
Geological studies have determined there were no snakes .
The story symbolizes St. Patrick casting off paganism .
He likely never used the three - leafed clover to teach about the Holy Trinity , the belief that God exists as the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit .
That story surfaced centuries after St. Patrick 's death .
" There is a huge contrast between the historical St. Patrick and the legendary St. Patrick , " said Dermot Quinn , author of " The Irish in New Jersey : Four Centuries of American Life " and history professor at Seton Hall University in South Orange , N.J .
" All sorts of things get folded into the memory of the saints . "
Historians reason that St. Patrick was the son of an aristocratic landowner , captured by marauders when he was about 16 , taken to Ireland and made a slave .
During six years sheepherding in relative solitude , he found God .
Patrick escaped and returned to Britain , but he longed to one day minister to the Irish .
He studied for the priesthood and eventually was ordained a bishop .
Sources vary on Patrick 's timeline , but in the early 430s , Pope Celestine sent Patrick back to Ireland .
Patrick spent decades baptizing , founding churches and otherwise spreading Christianity .
He may have died in his 70s , though some sources say he lived past 100 .
In Ireland , March 17 became a day of religious celebration .
But centuries later in the United States , it turned into more .
Irish immigrants who poured into this country during the 18th and 19th centuries found a hard life , struggling in exhausting jobs and suffering discrimination .
" People started looking back romantically at the motherland , " said Philip Freeman , author of " St. Patrick of Ireland : A Biography " and associate professor of classics at Luther College in Decorah , Iowa .
Parades , enlivened with Irish music and dancing , emerged , beginning treasured traditions in cities built with Irish hands .
This year , Cleveland will celebrate its 139th St. Patrick 's Day Parade .
Marilyn Madigan , 52 , of Cleveland , said the " true Irish " will observe that day by first attending Mass in the morning .
" It 's become such a secular holiday , " said Madigan , a deputy director of the Cleveland parade .
" We 're glad that everybody wants to partake with us , but we do not want to forget the meaning of the day of St. Patrick . "
The Rev. Rock Badgerow , pastor of St. Patrick Parish in Parnell , Mich. , said he has to remind the children in the parish school , " It 's a day , not a season . "
He said that 's hard to remember when St. Patrick 's Day decorations appear in stores and restaurants for days or weeks , making the holy day a commercial venture .
Pam Chamberlain , 34 , of Pittsburgh and of Irish descent , sees nothing to celebrate .
She 's a pagan , and St. Patrick 's Day reminds her of Patrick 's dissolution of pagan culture .
" Everybody says , ` You can celebrate your Irishness , " ' Chamberlain said .
" I say , if you 're an Irish Catholic , go right ahead .
" But many embrace the holiday 's more cultural trimmings .
Everybody 's Irish on St. Patrick 's Day , " as everyone may join the festivities , said Thomas P. Giblin , 58 , of Montclair , N.J. Giblin has helped organize the Newark , N.J. , St. Patrick 's Day Parade over the years , as his father did before him .
He said the holiday fosters Irish - American pride and brings attention to descendants of poor , Irish immigrants who have become leaders in business , labor and politics .
" That 's also cause for celebration , " he said .

Tasters said the wine had notes of truffles , caramel , figs - even the sea
The world 's oldest champagne , bottled before Victoria became Queen , is still drinkable , with notes of " truffles and caramel " , according to the experts .
An " addictive " bottle of 1825 Perrier - Jouet was opened at a ceremony attended by 12 of the world 's top wine tasters .
Their verdict : the 184 - year - old champagne tasted better than some of its younger counterparts .
There are now just two 1825 vintage bottles left - and Perrier - Jouet has no plans to open them soon .
The wine and champagne experts convened at the winemaker 's cellars in Epernay in France , for a " once in a lifetime " tasting of the 1825 champagne - officially recognised by Guinness World Records as the world 's oldest .
British wine writer John Stimpfig described the " reverential silence " as Perrier - Jouet cellar master Herve Deschamps eased out the cork , followed by a round of applause as the champagne was poured .
" It was a memorable evening , and tasting the wine was like tasting history in a bottle , " he said .
As for the flavour of a wine bottled just 10 years after the battle of Waterloo , Mr Stimpfig said he drank it more out of curiosity than for pleasure .
He said : " The wine was heavily oxidised , with a sherry - like character .
The 184 - year - old cork was in good condition , helping to preserve the wine " However I did taste notes of truffles , caramel and mushrooms .
" Most of the bubbles had disappeared , although there was a slight spritz left . "
But Serena Sutcliffe , the head of Sotheby 's international wine department , who helped organise the tasting event , described the wine as " addictive " with a complex flavour of figs and even a " slight nose of the sea " .
She said : " What was interesting was that I preferred the 1825 champagne to later vintages we tasted , dating from 1846 , 1848 and 1874 . "
She said each sip would have been worth " hundreds of pounds " if it had been sold at auction , but added : " It is virtually impossible to assign a value to the 1825 vintage - we 've never seen anything like it on the market . "
Wine tastes have changed over the past 184 years - the 1825 vintage was sweet , and even had a little brandy added at the " topping - up " stage .
But it was this very sweetness that experts believe helped the wine to survive for so long , together with the five to six atmospheres of pressure within the bottle .
No guarantees " It 's the bubbles that kept it younger , " said Ms Sutcliffe .
She added there was no guarantee that the remaining two bottles of 1825 would be as drinkable as the one she and fellow experts sampled , to mark the release of a new Perrier - Jouet vintage .
" They could last for years , and they might be better or worse , " she said .

I agree with this bit of superficiality :
Ed Liddy sized up this situation when he got to AIG and came to the conclusion that the best course for taxpayers and for the financial system was to pay the bonuses .
This gets back to something I wrote earlier : If Obama disagrees with Liddy 's decision , he should either A ) fire Liddy , or B ) fire the guy who hired Liddy ( Tim Geithner ) .
What he should not do is go along with this Kabuki outrage , in which official Washington pretends it had no idea that big financial institutions — especially failing ones — might need to keep paying their top employees competitive salaries .
That would seem so obvious it need not be said , but apparently the entire press corps has decided to do the Kabuki dance along with the clown show on Capitol Hill .
Look , I have no clue in the world whether it makes sense to pay these bonuses .
This is what I do wonder :
Why is Ed Liddy taking all this grief ?
The government brought him in to clean up this mess .
As nearly as I can tell , he took the job for a dollar a year -- adjusted for inflation , that 's less than FDR 's dollar - a- year men got ! -- and there is no disclosure in AIG 's SEC filings to suggest that he is getting anything more than that ( although to be sure we have to wait for the proxy statement ) .
Why has Liddy become every federal politician 's punching bag ?
One is forced to wonder why he does not just tell the Obama administration that they can find some other chump to wind down AIG .

Tall , pointy objects standing alone in an open space are more likely to get struck by lightning but it ’s by no means a certainty .
Sometimes the flat ground next to a tall tree can be hit .
A car or other enclosed metal structure is the safest place to be in a thunderstorm .
Failing that , a ditch , trench or group of shrubs of uniform height is better than nothing .
Keep away from boundary areas between dissimilar terrain ( water and land ; rock and earth ; trees and fields ) .
Also keep at least five metres away from metal objects or other people as lightning will often jump from one object to another .
Interesting post by Scott Berkun :
How to deal with jerk programmers which is n't exactly consistent with my experiences from both sides of the fence .
Scott states
The best place to start is empathy .
Why is someone acting like a jerk ?
There are basic psychological reasons for this :
Either they are insecure , they are unhappy , or they are angry about something .
Ok , there is a fourth reason , that they are psychopathic hell spawn put on the earth to torture all living things in a 10 foot radius , especially you , but lets assume that ’s not the case for a moment .
That fourth one sounds eerily like me , but I shall pretend thats not the case .
Scott further goes on to make a set of suggestions ( read his post for details , I am just listing them below )
Charm to Connect
Demonstrate your ability to help
Agree on the roles you both play
Get help from allies
While definitely in the right direction , these are very tactical steps .
And I really am not sure that the jerk programmers can be " unjerked " with these .
There are two types of jerk programmers .
Those who simply enter the office with a combined sense of arrogance and disdain that the situation is likely to be beyond any reasonable likelihood of any decently workable relationship .
Thankfully this is likely to be a very rare set ( I suspect they exist , but have n't ever worked with one ) .
At least half of the remainder are likely to have some issue with the " big picture " work atmosphere .
Something that reeeallly bothers them .
Something they are finding difficult to reconcile to .
Something thats gnawing at them .
I think there are two options in this case .
If you can largely agree with the issues , ensure that you not only empathise and help ( as Scott mentions ) but also make sure you 're clearly seen to be believing and acting towards solving the issues .
I think that belief is a very important element which sets up a shared goal and is complemented by the actions and results .
The programmer needs to believe you are on the same side ( in his opinions the right side ) of the issues as him many times even if not completely so .
This could be related to number of aspects - technology choices , code or design quality , deadline tradeoffs , deadlines , territorial control issues etc. etc .
A programmer is very unlikely to actually promote himself to jerkdom because of the coffee vending machine being located on the wrong side of the aisle or even due to more serious matters such as role ambiguity or disagreement .
It usually runs much deeper .
In case you cannot agree with the issues , I think a clear talk needs to be had about the differences , the criteria that are going to be laid down , and the programmer should be encouraged to either adjust to these or attempts should be made to find a role / position where such differences can be minimised .
In extreme cases it may be helpful to encourage the programmer to relocate to other teams for a win-win resolution .
To summarise , if a programmer is acting like a jerk , there 's likely to be a much deeper issue .
Work with him , be seen to be friendly to and believing in his case and be seen to be on his side many times on the issue and demonstrate at least some tangible progress on the issue at regular intervals .
Alternatively in extreme cases find avenues to work independently .
There is a risk of lesser tactical resolutions simply prolonging the difficulties for all concerned .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) -
The Israeli army unlawfully fired white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas of the Gaza Strip during its recent offensive , needlessly killing and injuring civilians , Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday .
Sabbah Abu Halima , who is suffering from very deep burns on her arm and leg , lies on a bed at Shifa hospital in Gaza January 22 , 2009 .
The doctors treating Abu Halima at Gaza 's Shifa hospital said the burns were caused by white phosphorus incendiary shells used by the Israeli army .

Citing Israel ’s use of white phosphorus as evidence of war crimes , the group said the army knew the munitions threatened the civilian population but “ deliberately or recklessly ” continued to use them until the final days of the December 27 - January 18 operation “ in violation of the laws of war . ”
The Human Rights Watch report , one of several issued by international organizations to sharply criticize Israel ’s conduct , called on senior military commanders to be held to account , and urged the United States , which supplied the shells , to launch its own investigation .
The Israeli army announced after the war that it would conduct an internal probe .
“ We ’re checking the claims we received from different NGOs ... of using white phosphorus shells in illegal ways , according to those claims , and this is what we ’re investigating , ” an Israeli military spokeswoman , Major Avital Leibovich , said .
White phosphorus ignites on contact with oxygen and continues burning at up to 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit ( 816 degrees Celsius ) until none is left or the oxygen supply is cut .
It is often used to produce smoke screens , but can also be used as a weapon , producing extreme burns if it makes contact with skin .
When used in open areas , white phosphorus munitions are permissible under international law .
But Human Rights Watch said Israel “ unlawfully ” fired them over populated neighborhoods , killing and wounding civilians and damaging civilian structures , including a school , a market , a humanitarian aid warehouse and a hospital .
“ In Gaza , the Israeli military did n’t just use white phosphorus in open areas as a screen for its troops , ” said senior Human Rights Watch researcher Fred Abrahams .
“ It fired white phosphorus repeatedly over densely populated areas , even when its troops were n’t in the area and safer smoke shells were available .
As a result , civilians needlessly suffered and died . ”
The group gave no precise casualty figures , citing the difficulty of determining in every case which burn injuries were caused by white phosphorous .
SHELLS LANDED IN CIVILIAN AREAS
Human Rights
Watch researchers found spent shells , canister liners , and remnants white phosphorus on city streets , apartment roofs , residential courtyards and at a United Nations school .
The report documented several attacks involving white phosphorus , including one on January 4 that killed five members of Ahmad Abu Halima ’s family in northern Gaza , saying it found remnants of the substance at their home .
“ I was talking with my father when the shell landed .
It hit directly on my father and cut his head off , ” the 22 - year - old said .
The rights ’ group said the army knew that white phosphorus threatened civilians , citing an internal medical report about the risk of “ serious injury and death when it comes into contact with the skin , is inhaled or is swallowed . ”
Israel launched the offensive with the declared aim of halting cross - border rocket fire by militants in the Hamas - ruled territory , home to 1.5 million Palestinians .
Over the 22 days of fighting , 1,417 Palestinians were killed , including 926 civilians , according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights .
Israel disputes those figures , and has accused Hamas of putting civilians at risk by using them as “ human shields . ”
At a briefing on white phosphorus arranged by the Israeli army , retired Lt. Col .
Shane Cohen , an artillery expert , said the munitions are used to create a smoke screen for troops and “ would n’t be an effective weapon . ”
“ When we fire , we ’re not firing on civilians , ” he said .
Retired Lt. Col. David Benjamin , an international law expert , said : “ Even if there is room for debate here about the legality of the use of these munitions and the circumstances of the use of these munitions , we ’re still far away from any talk about war crimes .
And that is because war crimes deal with grave breaches of international law . ”

WASHINGTON --
As the nation celebrated a day of uplift , Wall Street delivered a brutal downdraft .
Even as Barack Obama was taking the oath of office , the markets plunged -- the Dow dropped more than 300 points and broader indexes slumped on jitters about shaky banks .
It was the worst Inauguration Day performance in more than a century of trading .
Wild swings on Wall Street are but one sign that no one really knows where we are economically , let alone where we are going .
When Obama , known for his elegant optimism , spoke of " gathering clouds and raging storms " in his inaugural address , it seemed to be implied that not even he knows how to navigate them .
If he meant to say we have nothing to fear but fear itself , it did not come across .
We have , frankly , an awful lot to fear and Obama seemed to tell us that .
Few analysts believe the perilous economic situation will improve anytime soon .
The consensus is that we are n't to expect anything resembling a return to economic normalcy -- whatever that looks like without a housing bubble or a tech boom or loose credit -- until about 2010 .
But beyond a mammoth economic stimulus package that is to be the first order of business for the new president and Congress , it is difficult to tell exactly what Obama plans .
His campaign was a gauzy celebration of new - generation hope , and a recognition of historic racial progress .
Yet above all , his election was a primal scream against the policies and legacies of George W. Bush .
Obama 's own ideology remains obscure , wrapped in a youthful , congenial and confident persona .
We do not yet know what , exactly , lies underneath .
With so little time in federal office , Obama has scant history of taking tough stands or making difficult choices .
He has not revealed an overarching worldview and bristles at the notion that he should .
His transition to power was soothing , yet his insistence that he will engage with anyone who wishes to offer ideas is , in its own way , troubling .
The root of our financial crisis is that for much of the past three decades , we have implemented very bad economic ideas .
Obama seems to get this -- and not get it -- at the very same time .
The question , he said in his inaugural address , is not whether the market is a force for good or ill .
He noted that " without a watchful eye , the market can spin out of control " and that " the nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous . "
Nonetheless he keeps telling congressional Republicans that he will work with them -- even though they are among the chief architects of this disaster .
Since the Reagan era , Republicans have put tax cuts ahead of all other economic policies , and deregulation a close second .
They have stuffed wallets that already were plump , left the broad middle class staggering and allowed the working class to become the working poor .
If these politicians that Obama so fervently wishes to engage have such good ideas to offer , why have they not done so ?
In fact , there are few Washington traditions as annoying as the cultish worship of bipartisanship , for it ignores the simple fact that sometimes one party gets things disastrously wrong .
Another is the mantra that " entitlements " -- that is Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid -- are costly , bloated and threaten the nation 's economic future .
Obama already has pledged to undertake " entitlement reform , " a phrase that sends a shudder down my spine .
With banks and other financial institutions now " entitled " to hundreds of billions in public money to bail them out of disastrous decisions , it is impossible to see why taxpayers who have paid for their future benefits through their payroll taxes should not be " entitled " to receive them .
Besides , since there is no immediate crisis in Medicare -- and certainly not in the healthier Social Security program -- there is n't even a reason to mention this right now .
The ease with which Obama glides through political rituals is amazing .
So is his ability to soothe while talking about disturbing truths .
Yet symbolism soon will fade as Obama becomes the decider .
To decide is to disappoint , even anger , those who have n't gotten their way , and frankly should n't .
My hope for the new president is that he understands this , and is willing to take the hits .
" He 's out of touch with the real world , " the Italian insider said .
" On the condom issue , for example , there are priests and bishops in Africa who accept that condoms are a key part of the fight against Aids , and yet the pope adheres to this very conservative line that they encourage promiscuity .
The Vatican is far removed from the reality on the ground . "
Meets Witness Of His B - 17s Downing Over Bavaria
Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Stanton Rickey , 88 was presented with pieces of his downed B - 17 last week by two German men who not only located the crash site on their farm in Bavaria ... but also traveled to the US to meet the plane 's former pilot .
Kurt Hauber was only an 11 - year - old boy when Rickey , then 23 , was shot down by Luftwaffe fighter planes over his family 's Bavarian farm on July 18 , 1944 .
But his vivid memories of that day inspired his nephew Ludwig to acquire a metal detector and search for the plane 's wreckage .
" They not only found my aircraft , they expanded the search of the entire area and located other crash sites of American and German aircraft , " Rickey told The Arizona Republic .
" It 's been super cultivating friendships with them .
We 've become very close because of our shared experience . "
On the fateful day of the B - 17s downing , Rickey had received orders to bomb a manufacturing plant in Bavaria that was building the Messerschmitt Me-262 .
High above Memmigen , Germany , Rickey was flying one of 26 B - 17 bombers from the 483rd Bomber Group that braved bad weather and anti-aircraft fire before being confronted by 200 German fighter planes .
" I was the last one out of the airplane .
We were hit at 25,000 feet and I got out about 5,000 feet as the plane was spinning , " Rickey said .
" We lost 14 of our 26 aircraft " on the bombing raid .
" That 's 140 people , and 40 percent of them were killed . "
He was subsequently captured and taken to a prisoner - of - war camp .
Last Friday , Rickey and the Haubers were at Falcon Field Airport , preparing to board a North American B - 25H Mitchell bomber operated by Warbirds Unlimited Foundation , a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving aviation history and honoring veterans .
Rickey and his two German guests were treated to a complimentary ride to commemorate the occasion .
Retired commercial pilot and executive director of Warbirds Unlimited Foundation Jack Fedor told the East Valley Tribune , " We exist to honor WWII veterans .
This is exactly what we 're all about . "
Rickey said the Haubers have helped bring closure for him and to the mission in which so many of his fellow aviators paid the ultimate sacrifice .
" What they have done is wonderful , " Rickey said .
The Pope said distributing condoms was not the answer to HIV / Aids
One of the world 's most prestigious medical journals , the Lancet , has accused Pope Benedict XVI of distorting science in his remarks on condom use .
It said the Pope 's recent comments that condoms exacerbated the problem of HIV / Aids were wildly inaccurate and could have devastating consequences .
The Pope had said the " cruel epidemic " should be tackled through abstinence and fidelity rather than condom use .
A BBC correspondent says the Lancet 's attack was unprecedentedly virulent .
Speaking during his first visit to Africa , the Pope said HIV / Aids was " a tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone , that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which can even increase the problem " .

More from BBC World Service
The Pope said " the traditional teaching of the Church has proven to be the only failsafe way to prevent the spread of HIV / Aids " .
The BBC's David Willey in Rome says the Church 's view is that encouraging people to use condoms only minimises the effects of behaviour that in itself damages lives .
' Devastating '
But the London - based Lancet said the Pope had " publicly distorted scientific evidence to promote Catholic doctrine on this issue " .
It said the male latex condom was the single most efficient way to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV / Aids .
Why the Pope opposes condoms " Whether the Pope 's error was due to ignorance or a deliberate attempt to manipulate science to support Catholic ideology is unclear , " said the journal .
But it said the comment still stood and urged the Vatican to issue a retraction .
" When any influential person , be it a religious or political figure , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record , " it said .
" Anything less from Pope Benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of Catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of HIV / Aids worldwide . "
Our correspondent says the article shows how far the Pope 's attempts to justify the Vatican 's position on condoms have misfired .

No Static at All : Frequency modulation and music synthesis
Posted March 2009 .
In this article , we 'll consider how our ears are able to detect sound and how mathematics gives a powerful way to understand sound and then create and manipulate it ....
David Austin
Grand Valley State University
david at merganser.math.gvsu.edu
Introduction
Music and mathematics are both deeply expressive languages whose mysteries are revealed through pattern and serendipity .
The composer John Chowning , whose work is the focus of this article , says :
Music is a symbolic art .
A painter gets the sensory feedback immediately , but musicians are used to writing things on paper and hearing them later .
So they have to deal with symbols , things that are some distance away from where they are at the sensory level .
It might be why music was the first of the arts to make so much artistic use of the computer .
There is more to the connection , however :
The nature of sound and human hearing lend themselves to mathematical investigation .
In this article , we 'll consider how our ears are able to detect sound and how mathematics gives a powerful way to understand sound and then create and manipulate it .
In particular , we 'll look at Chowning 's discovery of frequency modulation synthesis , an elegant technique for creating complex sounds that was used in the first commercially successful music synthesizers produced in the 1980s .
The perception of sound
Sound is caused by variations in air pressure and is perceived by the human ear 's ability to detect those variations .
This is a fairly complicated , but interesting , story worthy of greater study ; however , we have other aims in this article and will content ourselves with the following relatively simplistic view .
Suppose that a tree falls in the forest .
The resulting vibrations of earth and tree cause the pressure of the nearby air to vibrate as well .
These vibrations in the air 's pressure propagate through the air as a longitudinal wave moving at the speed of sound ( roughly 768 miles per hour ) .
Standing in one place , we may notice the air pressure changing periodically as shown below .
Of course , this is a particular type of vibration modelled by a sine function .
As we 'll see soon , this type of vibration is a building block for many kinds of sounds -- namely , any periodic vibration can be expressed as an appropriate sum of sinusoidal vibrations -- and we call it a pure tone .
For now , let us note that there are two important features of the sinusoidal vibration : frequency and amplitude .
The length of time required for one cycle to move past is called the period T .
The frequency f is simply the number of cycles that move past in a given amount of time .
We therefore have the relationship f = 1/T .
We will measure frequencies in cycles per second , a unit often called Hertz and abbreviated Hz .
Our brains interpret the frequency of a pure tone as the pitch of the tone .
We are capable of hearing frequencies between roughly 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz .
The amplitude A is the height of the sinusoidal function and is detected by our ears as the volume of the tone .
The air pressure , as shown above , may be described as
A sin( 2 π ft + p )
where p is a constant known as a phase shift .
In some sense , the phase shift is not really a property of the vibration but rather a quantity that reconciles our system of time - keeping -- that is , what time we call t = 0 -- with the particular vibration we are studying .
In a pure tone , such as the one above , our ears will therefore not detect the phase shift .
Phase shifts become relevant when two or more pure tones are sounded together ; we will not , however , concentrate on this here .
Here 's how a sinusoidal wave sounds at 440 Hz .
This is the A above middle C that the oboe uses to tune the orchestra .
Sounds like this are used in hearing tests for reasons we will understand shortly .
When the air pressure 's vibration reaches our ear , it is ultimately transmitted to the basilar membrane , a membrane within the cochlea that separates two fluid - filled tubes .
The stiffness of the membrane varies along its length .
For our purposes , it is instructive to model each point of the basilar membrane as a damped harmonic oscillator .
As the stiffness of the basilar membrance causes the amount of dampening to vary along the membrane 's length , the resonant frequency of the oscillator at each point varies as well .
Therefore , when a sinusoidal wave of a particular frequency is transmitted to the basilar membrane , it causes a particular point to vibrate in resonance with that frequency .
The location of this point is sent to the brain , which interprets this information as the pitch of the vibration .
The important point for us is that the physiology of the humar ear naturally causes the ear to break sound into constituent sinusoidal vibrations , whose vibrations are localized on the basilar membrane .
Remarkably , this physiological situation beautifully mirrors our mathematical theory of sound .
A quick tour of Fourier analysis
Since a sinusoidal wave triggers a response on a localized portion of the basilar membrane , how are we able to process more complicated sounds ?
To answer this question , let 's look at an example .
Here is the sound created when the G string of a Collings OM - 1 guitar was picked .
A pure tone G corresponds to the frequency 392 Hz .
Shown below is a portion of the waveform from that sound file taken about one second after the string was picked .
This figure shows six cycles of a 392 Hz wave , or a time interval of 6/392 seconds .
Notice that the waveform appears periodic though it is not a pure tone .
How do our ears make sense of this waveform ?
The answer is given by the surprising theory of Fourier series , introduced by Joseph Fourier in the early nineteenth century .
Simply said , any well - behaved peroidic function of frequency f can be realized as a sum , most likely infinite , of sines and cosines whose frequencies are multiples of f .
That is , if g(t ) is periodic with frequency f , then there are constants a n and b n , indexed by n , such that
This is a remarkable expression .
We know that the sine and cosine functions are periodic .
Fourier 's expression says that any periodic function may be written in terms of sine and cosine functions .
In other words , any sound caused by a periodic vibration may be decomposed into pure tones .
Using the relationship ,
we may write
This is particularly useful if we remember that our ears are configured to detect sinusoidal vibrations .
If the wave g(t ) reaches our ear , the locations on the basilar membrane corresponding to multiples of f detect the constants c n , the amplitude of the pure tone of frequency f , and send them to the brain , which reassembles the information so as to recognize , say , the G string of a Collings OM - 1 guitar .
We should also note that the constants a n and b n , known as Fourier coefficients , are computed by integrating over one period T = 1/f :
This explains why a 0 is divided by 2 in the expression for g(t ) .
As we 'll see , the terms for large values of n usually do not contribute too much to the infinite sum , and we will approximate the function g(t ) by a finite number of terms .
If we are looking at periodic waveforms coming from sound , it seems safe to do this since our ears will not detect the higher frequency components anyway .
( To some , this may be a controversial statement .
Some audiophiles claim that the higher frequency components of a sound still shape the sound even though they may not be directly detected by the basilar membrane .
This is a rather common complaint about the reproduction of music from CDs , which filter out frequencies above 20,000
Hz , compared with , say , vinyl records , which do n't . )
I computed the coefficients assuming a fundamental frequency of f = 196 = 392/2 and found the following expression to describe the waveform .
I found these coefficients using the expressions above by averaging the coefficients obtained over several cycles .
Shown below is the original waveform in blue and the Fourier approximation , using the first 50 terms that correspond to frequencies in the audible range , in red .
I then constructed a sound file using the Fourier series shown above .
For the sake of comparison , here is a sound file taken from the original recording of the guitar , beginning at the time from where the Fourier coefficients are computed .
This is an interesting comparison :
The Fourier series does a fairly good job of capturing the tone of the instrument .
However , the sound of the guitar string -- more specifically , the loudness and the timbre -- changes in time .
If we want to recreate the sound of the string using a computer , we will somehow have to recreate the evolution of these features of the sound .
But it seems that we have taken an important first step .
Since this technique is based on the addition of various waveforms , this form of music synthesis is called additive synthesis .
Shown below is a plot of the coefficients c n for each of the frequencies that contribute to the string 's sound at the time I sampled it .
This plot displays the spectrum of the sound , the frequencies that are present and how much they contribute .
A sound 's spectrum influences our interpretation of it and enables us to distinguish between , say , different musical instruments .
We perceive the spectrum as an instrument 's timbre .
In addition , we call this a harmonic spectrum since every frequency present is a multiple of one particular frequency , f = 196 Hz , in this case .
The sample above was taken about one second after the string was picked .
I also sampled the sound about 3.5 seconds after the string was picked and found this :
The wave seems to have smoothed out quite a bit , which we might imagine is caused by a diminishing contribution from higher frequencies .
The spectrum , shown below , shows only a small contribution from higher frequencies as well as an overall decrease in the energy present .
Here is another waveform from a 0.02 second time interval of one channel from a live performance of the band Wilco performing " Muzzle of Bees . "
In this section of the song , there is an electric guitar , two acoustic guitars , an electric bass , keyboards , and drums .
Clearly , this is a more complicated waveform reflecting the fact that there are many more instruments playing .
While there seem to be repeating features , the entire waveform does not appear to be periodic .
In this case , the waveform is simply the sum of all the waveforms from the individual instruments .
It is therefore enough to understand the individual instruments , perhaps like we 've done above , and combine them using additive synthesis .
Here are two other periodic functions and their spectra :
Square Wave Sound file
Sawtooth Wave Sound file
Frequency Modulation
Our discussion above shows us that we could use a computer to create the sounds of various instruments , through additive synthesis , if we simply knew the Fourier coefficients for the instrument and how they evolve in time .
However , additive synthesis is relatively inefficient .
Adding together 50 terms in the Fourier series to create a two - second sound file , with the usual 44,100 samples per second , required my reasonably fast laptop to run for 13 seconds .
I used a rather simplistic technique ; there are faster ones available .
The point , however , is that efficiency is an issue that needs consideration , especially if we want to make music in " real time . "
We will now describe a technique , called Frequency Modulation ( FM ) synthesis , that allows us to more efficiently create sounds with complex spectra and to specify how those spectra evolve over time .
As a first experiment , let 's take a pure tone of frequency f c and add vibrato .
To do this , we will slowly vary the pitch , which is how we interpret the frequency of the pure tone .
We begin with I sin( 2π f m t ) , a wave of amplitude I and frequency f m , that modulates the pure tone by :
Shown below in blue is a frequency modulated wave with f c = 100 Hz modulated by a f m = 20 Hz wave , shown in gray , using an index of modulation I = 2 .
Notice that the parameter I , which we call the index of modulation , allows us to control how much influence the modulating wave has .
For instance , if I = 0 , there is no modulation .
Here 's the result of a 440 Hz pure tone modulated by a 5
Hz wave with index of modulation I = 2 .
In what sense are we varying the frequency ?
Modulation varies the instantaneous frequency of the wave .
For instance , if we write our wave as sin ( 2 π φ ( t ) ) , we define the instantaneous frequency as the derivative dφ / dt .
For a pure tone , we have φ ( t ) = ft so that the instantaneous frequency is f as we expect .
In the case of a frequency modulated wave , we have
so that the instantaneous frequency is f c +
If m cos( 2π f m t ) .
Notice that the instantaneous frequency varies between f c ±
If m .
Frequency modulation is , of course , commonly used in radio transmissions , and for this reason the frequency f c is known as the carrier frequency , and f m is known as the modulating frequency .
That FM synthesis is a useful technique for creating musically rich sounds was discovered by John Chowning in the early 1970s .
Beginning with something like the vibrato we just created , he increased the modulating frequency into the audio range to create what he later called " extreme vibrato . "
To hear this effect , listen to this sound file in which a 440 Hz carrier wave is modulated by a wave whose frequency increases from 20 Hz to 440 .
Notice how the sound is initially very similar to the vibrato we constructed earlier .
It then becomes more complex in ways we will understand in a moment .
To hear the effect of varying the index of modulation I , here is a sound file in which a 440 Hz carrier wave is modulated by a wave of the same frequency while the index of modulation I increases from 0 to 5 .
Notice how the sound begins as a pure tone and becomes more complex .
A frequency modulated wave is relatively easy to generate compared to , say , adding together 50 terms of a Fourier series .
FM synthesis therefore allows us to create complex spectra with relative ease .
The role of Bessel functions
The spectra of frequency modulated waves may be elegantly described using Bessel functions .
In our discussion of Fourier series , we began with a periodic function and wrote it as a linear combination of sine and cosine functions .
For reasons we 'll understand momentarily , we will consider the periodic function sin(z sin t ) of period T = 2 π and frequency f = 1/2π .
The constant z is a parameter that will soon play the role of the index of modulation .
The Fourier series has the form :
Notice that our function is odd - - sin( z sin( - t ) ) = sin( - z sin t ) = - sin( z sin t ) -- which implies that
This function has another symmetry - - sin( z sin( t + π ) ) = - sin(z sin t ) -- from which it follows that the coefficients b 2n = 0 .
This leaves :
Since the Fourier coefficients depend on z , we will denote them as J 2n+1 ( z ) giving us
Similar reasoning leads to
The coefficients J n ( z ) turn out to be Bessel functions , functions that are well known to mathematicians .
Bessel functions are ubiquitous as they arise , for example , when describing solutions to certain physically interesting partial differential equations .
The vibrations of a round drum are described by Bessel functions .
Here are the graphs of the first six Bessel functions .
Understanding the shape of these graphs will help explain some features we will encounter soon .
In what follows , it is convenient to define Bessel functions for negative indices using the relation J -n ( z ) = ( - 1 ) nJ n ( z ) .
This enables us to write
Let 's go back to our expression for a frequency modulated wave and apply the angle addition relation :
This is an important relation because it shows that the frequencies , sometimes called sidebands , f c + nf m form the spectrum of the frequency modulated wave .
Moreover , the value of the Bessel functions J n ( I ) determine how much the sideband f c + nf m contributes to the overall sound .
Notice that the spectrum will be harmonic precisely when the ratio f m /f c is rational since , in this case , the sidebands are all integer multiples of a common frequency .
Here are the spectra and corresponding sounds for various values of the index of modulation when f c = 440 Hz and f m = 88 Hz .
Crucial to Chowning 's observation that FM synthesis was a useful technique for creating complex spectra is the contribution from sidebands f c + nf m that give negative frequencies .
How can we interpret these frequencies ?
Since the sine function is odd , we may consider them as producing an inverted wave with positive frequency using :
J n ( I ) sin( 2 π( f c + nf m ) t ) = - J n ( I ) sin( 2π|f c + nf m |t ) .
As Chowning writes in his original paper on FM synthesis :
The special richness of this FM technique lies in the fact that there are ratios of the carrier and modulating frequencies and values of the index [ of modulation ] which will produce sideband components that fall in the negative frequency domain of the spectrum .
These negative components reflect around 0 Hz and " mix " with the components in the positive domain .
The variety of frequency relations which result from this mix is vast and includes both harmonic and inharmonic spectra .
Chowning first considers the case when f c = f m .
Here are the Fourier coefficients for all frequencies .
Now let 's reflect and invert the coefficients corresponding to negative frequencies so that two coefficients add for each frequency .
The darker bars represent the Fourier coefficients from the positive frequency while the light bars represent the inverted contribution from negative frequencies .
Finally , we show the absolute value of the total coefficients :
This example illustrates Chowning 's point : in this relatively simple way , we have produced an interesting and fairly complex spectrum .
As we noted earlier , when the ratio of the modulating and carrier frequencies is rational , we will obtain a harmonic frequency .
An inharmonic spectrum results when the ratio f m /f c is the square root of 2 , which is the irrational number approximately equal to 1.414 ...
Notice how the reflection of negative frequencies causes varying distances between the frequencies .
Finally , let 's consider a different modulating frequency now : f c = 220 Hz and f m = 440 Hz .
The sidebands will all be odd multiples of 220 Hz .
The envelope , please
So far , we have seen how to make sounds with a particular pitch ( frequency ) and to create interesting timbres ( spectra ) .
When we studied the sound of the guitar string being picked earlier , however , we noticed two things .
First , the timbre changed over time : the spectra started out relatively rich but eventually settled down to closer to a pure tone .
Second , the volume of the sound changed as well .
If we are using the frequency modulated wave ,
Asin( 2π f c t + Isin ( 2π f m t ) ) ,
then the timbre will be controlled by I and the loudness by A .
We make both of these time - dependent by assigning them an envelope , which specifies how they change in time .
A common model used is the ADSR envelope , which has four distinct phases : Attack , Decay , Sustain , and Release .
A typical graph is shown below .
The sounds of many instruments follow this model .
For instance , in a wind instrument , the sound is initiated as air begins to move through it .
This is the attack phase .
The wind eventually levels off during the sustain phase and dies off during the release .
We may customize the sound by adjusting the transition points between intervals .
The exponential envelope is another commonly - used envelope as it provides a good model for the amplitude of a percussion instrument or a plucked string .
Some examples
In his original paper , Chowning showed how FM synthesis could be used to simulate some instruments .
Brass :
We may mimic a brass instrument by choosing f m = f c and using the same ADSR envelope for the amplitude and index of modulation .
( Earlier we saw the spectrum that results from choosing equal carrier and modulating frequencies . )
Here is the sound file .
Bell :
When a bell is struck , its spectrum is initially very rich .
However , after some time , one frequency begins to dominate .
For this reason , we will use an exponential envelope as the index of modulation I .
How should we choose the modulating frequency ?
Remember that we earlier saw that we obtain a harmonic spectrum -- that is , all frequencies in the spectrum are multiples of a common frequency -- when f m is a rational multiple of f c .
A bell , however , has an inharmonic spectrum .
For this reason , we will choose a ratio f m /f c that is not well approximated by a rational number .
Namely , we will choose f m = φf c where φ is the golden ratio , approximately 1.618 ....
( An explanation of this choice is provided in an earlier Feature Column . )
Here is the result when f c = 440 Hz and an exponential envelope is used for the index of modulation .
We initially hear many frequencies present but most of these die out , and we are left with a pure tone of 440 Hz .
Of course , the volume of a real bell decays in time as well so we will use an exponential envelope for the amplitude A .
Dave Benson suggests this demonstration in his book .
A wood drum : Chowning suggests that a wood drum can be made by using f m /f c = 1 / φ and using these envelopes :
Amplitude Index of modulation
Here is the sound file .
Guitar : I used FM synthesis to simulate the guitar 's sound that we heard earlier .
The spectrum that we saw looked like this :
I wanted to design a similar spectrum so I choose f c = 392 Hz , f m = 196 Hz = 392/2 Hz and I = 0.8 .
Using Bessel functions to predict the spectrum , we obtain this :
We also heard that the spectrum evolves over time to what sounds more like a pure tone .
I therefore took an exponential envelope for the index of modulation beginning with I = 1 and decaying to I = 0.6 after five seconds .
Finally , I wanted to mimic the effect of striking a string with a pick and used this piecewise exponential function as the envelope for the amplitude , based mostly on educated guesses .
Here is the result .
Coda
In this article , we 've only waded into the ocean of music synthesis .
There are many other techniques for synthesis besides frequency modulation ; I concentrated on FM synthesis here since it demonstrates , in a relatively simple way , how we can produce sounds by designing their spectra .
Even if we restrict ourselves to additive and FM synthesis , these techniques may be strung together in countless ways to create novel sounds .
Indeed , Chowning , working with Yamaha in the early 1980s , used these techniques to create the DX7 , one of the first affordable and commercially successfully music synthesizers .
What is the current state of music synthesis ?
An interview with Chowning , published in Mix magazine in 2005 writes :
Chowning is very happy that the state of electronic music technology has reached the point that it has , just at the moment when he is able to retire from teaching and concentrate on composing .
" The present is the dream for me , " he says .
" It 's all software and real time and portable .
I sit here with a laptop that has more power than I could ever use .
....
Software synthesis is the take - off point for ultimate freedom . "
Chowning says that a good synthesizer allows for a " high degree of expressive control .... So it reveals virtuosity , or lack of it , and separates out the really good performers from others . "
As a final note , it is interesting to consider how some music is recorded .
Rather than recording a sound picked up by a microphone , a synthesizer 's digital signal may be sent directly to the recording process .
The first time that a " sound " is actually made is when a listener pushes the " Play " button .
So who is making the music ?
For anyone who has experienced a concert where the performers and audience seem involved in a collaboration , the answer may not be so clear .
Liner notes
Technical Note :
With the exception of the guitar recording , I created the sound files in this article using a Python program to write WAVE files .
Interested readers are encouraged to try their own experiments .
Csound is a free program that offers a huge range of possibilities ( see the references ) .
Dave Benson 's book gives a very readable introduction to using Csound .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. bankruptcy filings surged 31 percent in 2008 as both businesses and consumers struggled to make ends meet in a worsening economy , according to court data released on Thursday .
Total bankruptcy filings rose to 1,117,771 last year , the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts said , up from 850,912 in 2007 .
The total is nearly twice the 617,660 filings recorded in 2006 , when an overhaul in bankruptcy laws led to a drop in filings .
Businesses accounted for 43,546 filings last year , a small percentage of the total , but up 54 percent from 2007 .
The number of filings rose steadily throughout 2008 as the economy worsened , according to figures released by the agency , which oversees federal courts .
Filings rose under Chapters 7 , 11 , and 13 of the bankruptcy code , but filings under Chapter 12 , a category for farmers , fell 8 percent .
Escalating job losses , weakening consumer confidence and declining home values have pushed companies and individuals alike into bankruptcy , and experts say the total is likely to continue to rise this year .
The total could surge further if Congress changes laws that would permit residential home mortgages to be modified under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code , which allows people to budget future earnings under a plan in which creditors are paid in whole or in part .
The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to approve a bill that would let judges erase mortgage debt for homeowners who enter bankruptcy as a last resort .
Imagine a child falls down a well .
Now imagine I offer to lend the parents my ladder to save her , but only if they promise to paint my house .
Would you applaud me for not letting a crisis go to waste ?
Or would you think I ’m a jerk ?
I ask because I ’m trying to come to terms with Rule No. 1 of the Obama administration .
“ Rule 1 : Never allow a crisis to go to waste , ” White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel told the New York Times right after the election .
“ They are opportunities to do big things . ”
Over the weekend , Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told members of the European Parliament , “ Never waste a good crisis . ”
Then President Obama explained in his Saturday radio and Internet address that there is “ great opportunity in the midst of ” the “ great crisis ” befalling America .
Numerous commentators , including me , have pointed to this never - waste - a - crisis mantra as ideological evidence that Obama ’s budget priorities are a great bait - and - switch .
He says he wants to fix the financial crisis , but he ’s focusing on selling his long - standing liberal agenda on healthcare , energy and education as the way to do it , even though his proposals have absolutely nothing to do with addressing the housing and toxic - debt problems that are the direct causes of our predicament .
Indeed , some -- particularly on Wall Street -- would argue that his policies are making the crisis worse .
Advertisement
But the real scandal is n’t those policies , even though they ’re bad enough .
The real scandal is that this administration thinks crises are opportunities for governmental power - grabs ( It seems writer Randolph Bourne was wrong .
It is not war , but crisis , that is the health of the state ) .
Michael Kinsley famously said that a gaffe in Washington is when a politician accidentally tells the truth .
As they say , it ’s funny because it ’s true .
But the White House tactic is n’t funny at all .
It ’s scary .
Its amorality is outweighed only by the grotesque and astoundingly naked cynicism of it all .
Recall that not long ago , the first item on the bill of indictment against the Bush administration was that it was “ exploiting ” 9/11 to enact its agenda .
Al Gore shrieked that President Bush “ played on our fears ” to get his way .
In response to nearly every Bush policy proposal , from the Patriot Act to the toppling of Saddam Hussein , critics would caterwaul that Bush was taking advantage of the country ’s fear of terrorism .
Advertisement
The Bush administration always denied this , and rightly so .
If the president admitted that he was using a national calamity for narrow partisan or ideological advantage , it would be outrageous .
Indeed , every time Karl Rove or some other administration official said anything that could be even remotely interpreted as using the war or 9/11 for partisan or ideological gain , the editorial pages and Democratic news - release factories churned into overdrive with righteous indignation .
Well , now we have the president , along with his chief aides , admitting -- boasting ! -- that they want to exploit a national emergency for their preexisting agenda , and there ’s no scandal .
No one even calls it a gaffe .
No , they call it leadership .
It ’s not leadership .
It ’s fear - mongering .
Franklin Roosevelt said that all we have to fear is fear itself .
Now Barack Obama all but admits that all he has to fear is the loss of fear itself .
Advertisement
In other realms of life , exploiting a crisis for your own purposes is an outrage .
If a business uses a hurricane warning , for example , to price - gouge on vital supplies , it is a crime .
When a liberal administration does it , it ’s taking advantage of a historic opportunity .
Obama ’s defenders respond to this argument that Obama ’s motives are decent , noble and pure .
He wants to help the uninsured and the poorly educated .
He wants to make good on his vow to halt those rising oceans .
But this is just a rationalization .
Every president thinks his agenda is what ’s best for the country ; every politician believes his motives are noble .
The point is that scaring people about X in order to achieve Y is fundamentally undemocratic .
This was transparently obvious to Bush ’s harshest critics , who alleged that 9/11 was merely a convenient crisis for devious neocons who wanted to topple Hussein all along .
But it ’s now clear that many of these critics simply objected to the agenda , not the alleged tactics .
Now that it ’s their turn , they see nothing wrong with doing what they so recently condemned .

They even admit it , over and over again .

Goce 's gravity mapping is just one of many space observations that are possible
The launch of Europe 's Gravity Field and Steady - State Ocean Circulation Explorer ( Goce ) satellite set for Monday will be the first large - scale effort involving the UK's new National Centre for Earth Observation ( NCEO ) since its official inauguration earlier this month .
The exquisite precision of Goce 's measurements is just one facet of the data crucial to fulfil the NCEO 's mission of harnessing space technology and expertise to better inform studies into the environment and , in particular , climate change .
The £ 33 m , five - year collaboration was set up by the Natural Environmental Research Council ( Nerc ) and draws together 100 scientists from 26 UK universities .
Nerc makes the UK's contribution to the European Space Agency 's ( Esa ) Earth Explorer missions , of which Goce is the first to fly .
The NCEO hopes to unite satellite , remote sensing , and ground - based data , integrating it with environmental models to provide an overarching view of the systems of our planet .
UK Science Minister Lord Drayson , speaking at the launch , said that satellite technology provided a particularly valuable role in the centre 's mission .
Science competition
The NCEO effort , he said , " reflects the UK 's determination to ensure that we use the fantastic science that we have around satellite technology - and space technology in general - to make the most contribution that we can to environmental research around climate change " .
The effort was first announced in August 2006 , with the appointment of its science director Alan O'Neill , a professor at the University of Reading .
Earth observation is providing us a key to unlock the door and at least push it significantly ajar , if not fully open
Alan O'Neill , NCEO director
At the official launch , Professor O'Neill announced that the NCEO would provide an " essential national resource " for Esa 's Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programme .
The centre will also oversee the development of two of the three finalists for Esa 's seventh Earth Explorer mission : Premier , to measure atmospheric composition in a critical altitude range between five and 25 km ; and Biomass , to make precise measurements of the carbon locked up in the world 's forests .
The pair are in competition with the CoReH2O concept - a mission that would study the fresh water bound up in ice on Earth .
The parallel feasibility work will eventually lead to the launch of one of the three spacecraft in 2016 .
Modelling errors " I think it 's fair to say that Earth - orbiting satellites are revolutionising our understanding of Planet Earth - how it works and what the forces are that are working against it , " Professor O'Neill said .
" I 'm quite convinced that those societies that capitalise on the rapidly developing technology are going to be very well - placed to respond to those challenges and to provide world leadership in a very scientifically informed way . "
ESA'S EARTH EXPLORERS European Space Agency ( Esa ) programme of Earth observation Intended to address issues of key environmental concern Six spacecraft already ordered ; a seventh in discussion Cryosat - 2 ( above ) will map the Earth 's ice cover
The mission is led scientifically from the UK
The NCEO , he added , would leverage the UK 's space expertise " to do world - class science and ensure that the benefits of that science translate into public good " .
The major scientific goals for the NCEO 's future include revision and refinement of existing simulations of climate change .
" We want to use the wide variety of satellites to make improvements in our climate prediction models .
This is not to say that the fundamental science is weak - on the contrary , the fundamental science is strong - but in order to derive more benefit from the predictions ... we 've got to iron out some significant problems that we have with the models .
" If you like , it 's a war on errors in the models . "
In addition , the NCEO will aim to understand whether changes in the global carbon cycle and the associated water cycle could in the future exacerbate climate change .
It will also study the way atmospheric pollution is transported around the globe and the public health issues that such transport creates , as well as continuing to refine knowledge of the changes taking place in polar ice cover .
Professor O'Neill remarked that very little is understood about how life interacts with the planet , a field of study he called " really the cutting edge of science " .
" Earth observation is providing us a key to unlock the door and at least push it significantly ajar , if not fully open , " he added .
' Breathing planet '
A significant broader issue , according to Lord Drayson , is the power of the visual imagery that satellite data can provide .
Speaking of a visit to the US space agency ( Nasa ) early in his tenure as science minister , he recalled being shown satellite images .
" Actually seeing the data of the planet - for example , the outbreak of forest fires , the way in which the polar ice caps are receding - to see that data visually , for me it looked almost as if the Earth was breathing , " he said .
" It really brings home to you the challenge that we have . "
While arresting visual presentation of the state of the planet could inform public awareness as well as policymakers , the fact that the NCEO 's mission combines space technology with environmental concerns could also inspire the next generation of researchers .
" I think we have in this project the coming together of two areas of science which have huge impact on young people , " Lord Drayson said .
" Young people are very seized by the challenge that we face and want to be a part of the solution .
This has a very potent effect in terms of being a lever by which we can really show the relevance and importance of science in the modern world and how it is actually addressing these issues . "

As the Muslim world settled into ever - deeper decline over the past decade , mired in political extremism , religious sickness , economic irrelevance , WMD , anarchy , dictatorship , and civil wars , Dubai stood out as a happy anomaly .
Burj Al Arab claims to be the world 's only 7 - star hotel .
Under the leadership of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , Dubai ( one of seven polities within the United Arab Emirates ) invited peoples from around the world to come make money and they did ; about 83 percent of its population of 1.4 million is foreign .
The emirate intelligently exploited the energy boom surrounding it and had the ambition not just to globalize but to become a leader at globalization .
Dubai became renowned for the world 's only tropical desert ski slope , the world 's only 7 - star hotel , and the world 's very highest building , all done with a new - agey twist .
( Publicity for the skyscraper , for example , presents it as " an unprecedented example of international cooperation " and " a beacon of progress for the entire world . " )
But if Dubai seemed to be an exception to the general Muslim trajectory , it was only temporary .
In three distinct arenas – economics , culture , and sports – very recent developments show how much the statelet has in common with the impoverishing and separating Muslim world .
Economics
Burj Dubai is the world 's highest building ; but will it be inhabited ?
The huge oil revenues that have been pouring in for two years have nowhere else to go but into more and more real estate speculation .
It makes for great business for the developers and their Western and Asian contractors , as well as for the owners - the sheiks , kings , emirs , and their big businessmen friends who own the deserts on which these mirage - like projects are being erected .
The formula from their perspective is straightforward :
Sell desert land to investors at a premium .
Then double the profits by financing the construction of artificial islands , lakes , and massive air - conditioned shopping malls , alongside pie - in - the - sky projects like the largest ski slope in the desert , a Jurassic Park complete with mechanical dinosaurs right out of the movie , and millions of housing units .
Then get the hell out and let them eat cake .
Dubai was the froth of the early 2000s , the purest example of a bubble economy based on rising prices and boosterism , a Ponzi scheme among the nations .
Already in 2006 , financial writer Youssef Ibrahim dissected its trompe l'oeil economy :
Dubai's leadership , Ibrahim notes , invested its profits " from selling Disneyland desert fantasies in enduring assets outside the Gulf , " such as port facilities and hotel properties .
Some of the over 3,000 abandoned cars at Dubai 's airport .
With Dubai's economy in free fall , newspapers have reported that more than 3,000 cars sit abandoned in the parking lot at the Dubai Airport , left by fleeing , debt - ridden foreigners ( who could in fact be imprisoned if they failed to pay their bills ) .
Some are said to have maxed - out credit cards inside and notes of apology taped to the windshield .
When the music stopped last fall , with a world - wide recession and the price of oil tumbling over two - thirds , no one got harder hit than the Dubai dream machine .
Just as it ascended with panache , so it now sinks .
One example , as reported by Robert F. Worth in the
This unique abandoned - car syndrome results in part from the emirate 's stringent work rules .
As Worth explains , " jobless people here lose their work visas and then must leave the country within a month .
That in turn reduces spending , creates housing vacancies and lowers real estate prices , in a downward spiral that has left parts of Dubai — once hailed as the economic superpower of the Middle East — looking like a ghost town . "
Signs of the new penury abound :
real estate prices , which rose dramatically during Dubai 's six - year boom , have dropped 30 percent or more over the past two or three months in some parts of the city .
...
So many used luxury cars are for sale , they are sometimes sold for 40 percent less than the asking price two months ago , car dealers say .
Dubai 's roads , usually thick with traffic at this time of year , are now mostly clear .
Expatriates in Dubai are now so down on the country , Worth explains , some see it " as though it were a con game all along . "
There is every reason to think that the economic descent has just begun and has a long way to go .
As this happens , foreigners are fleeing .
Christopher Davidson , a specialist on the UAE at Durham University , notes that " When Dubai was rich and successful , everyone wanted to be its friend .
Now that it has no money in the pocket , nobody wants to be pals anymore . "
Culture
When it comes to cultural extravagance , Dubai cedes first place to its neighbor , Abu Dhabi , which in early 2007 , announced the " Cultural District of Saadiyat Island " to include satellites of the Guggenheim ( costing US $ 400 million ) and Louvre ( $ 1.3 billion ) museums , plus about two dozen other museums , performing arts centers , and pavilions .
Still , Dubai has ambitions , if more modest ones and the first Emirates Airline International Festival of Literature , opening on Feb. 26 , is to serve as its literary coming - out party .
A welcoming message from the director of the festival , Isobel Abulhoul , explains :
EAIFL is the first true literary Festival in the Middle East celebrating the world of books in all its infinite variety , with over 50 events featuring authors whose books range from some of the finest contemporary literary fiction to inspirational lifestyle titles , via the magical worlds of children's , fantasy and science fiction writing .
We invite you to share and enjoy their company in a relaxed Festival atmosphere , made even richer by our vibrant fringe which showcases the wonderful and diverse talents from our very special city , Dubai .
British author Geraldine Bedell was disinvited from Dubai because her novel The Gulf Between Us tells about a gay sheikh .
The festival boasts authors from twenty countries , including such big names as Frank McCourt and Louis de Bernières .
All good , but the EAIFL hit a bump before it even opened , one that threatens to overshadow the event itself .
Never mind " the world of books in all its infinite variety " ; the festival banned British author Geraldine Bedell because Sheik Rashid , one of the minor characters in her novel The Gulf Between Us ( Penguin ) , is a homosexual Arab with an English boyfriend ; to make matters worse , the plot is set against the background of the Kuwait War .
As Abulhoul wrote to Bedell , disinviting her .
" I do not want our festival remembered for the launch of a controversial book .
If we launched the book and a journalist happened to read it , then you could imagine the political fallout that would follow . "
As for the Kuwait War , that " could be a minefield for us . "
Bedell responded that her novel " is incredibly affectionate towards the Gulf .
I feel very warmly towards it , except when things like this happen .
It calls into question the whole notion of whether the Emirates and other Gulf states really want to be part of the contemporary cultural world ...
You can't ban books and expect your literary festival to be taken seriously . "
Indeed , the biggest name of the Dubai event , Canadian author Margaret Atwood , stayed away in protest at Bedell 's exclusion ( " I can not be part of the festival this year . " ) , eventually agreeing to appear via video link - up in a debate on censorship to be staged by International PEN at the festival .
Sports
Shahar Pe'er is the Israeli tennis star excluded from a tournament in Dubai because of her nationality .
Nor can you ban one of the game 's finest players and expect your tennis tournament to be taken seriously .
But Dubai did that earlier this month when it banned Shahar Pe'er , 21 , ranked 45 among female players globally , from its $ 2 million women 's Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships .
Why ?
Well , she is Israeli .
Organizers of the event cited security fears as their reason to bar Pe'er .
In consultation with Pe'er , the Women 's Tennis Association decided to continue with the Dubai tournament .
" She did n't want to see her fellow players harmed the same way she was being harmed , " said Larry Scott , CEO of the WTA .
Still , Pe 'er 's exclusion had immediate repercussions for Dubai .
The Tennis Channel canceled coverage of the event ; The Wall Street Journal Europe revoked its sponsorship ; event organizers were fined US $ 300,000 ( $ 44,250 of which will go to Pe'er ) ; and American star Andy Roddick said he would boycott the male championship in Dubai .
During the trophy ceremony , tournament winner Venus Williams discomfited the hosts by mentioning Pe 'er 's exclusion .
Not only was Scott bombarded with messages from upset fans ( " It 's an issue that obviously touches a nerve " ) but he reported " a real snowballing effect " : " I 've been contacted by representatives of other businesses , academic institutions , cultural institutions that equally would only have invested in being in the UAE if they had the same assurances we had that Israelis could participate in the activities . "
As a result of the Pe'er fiasco , Andy Ram , an Israeli ranked 11th among male doubles tennis players was granted a " special permit " to enter Dubai and will play this week in the male Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships .
To stay on the tour schedule in 2010 , the Dubai organizers must guarantee Pe 'er a wild - card entry , so she gets to play there even if she fails to qualify , and must grant qualifying Israeli players visas eight weeks in advance .
In other words , Dubai must accept international rules or it excludes itself from championship play .
That is no small matter in a statelet that has gone into top - tier sports in a big way as a way to attract tourism ; the Associated Press notes that it " hosts the world 's richest golf tournament and horse race , is home to the world governing body for cricket and is building a $ 4 billion Dubai Sports City to house stadiums , sports academies and one of several lush golf courses . "
Conclusion
Through a heady mix of speed and affluence , Dubai tried to vault over tough economic , religious , and political decisions .
The establishment hoped that building big would substitute for a sound base .
It hoped to finesse troublesome issues , that glitz would overwhelm substance .
For example , it expected that patronizing prestigious events would permit it to change the rules ; Dubai says no minor homosexual literary characters or no Israeli tennis players ?
So be it !
Dubai rules , the globe follows .
But that will not happen .
The sharp drop in oil prices exposed the country 's inescapable weakness , while Dubai 's literary and tennis debacles confirmed the point .
Instead , an entirely different model now tempts it – what I call the separation of civilizations .
Unable to impose their way , Persian Gulf Arabs are retreating into a Muslim ghetto with its own economics ( including Shar'i compliant tools ) , consumer goods , media , transportation , fast foods , sports competitions , search engines , and even systems of keeping time .
This course is doomed to failure .
At a certain point , the issues at the center of Muslim life for the past two centuries – the tension between tradition and modernity , the opposition of Muslim identity to universal values , the strains of economic development – will have to be faced .
Hucksterism and fast talk will not solve these problems .
As Dubai 's vacation from history abruptly ends , its hard work begins .
Feb. 25 , 2009 update :
In a comment on this article , " Not Quite That Bad , " Ken Wise , a journalist based in Dubai , takes issue with some of Robert F. Worth 's observations about abandoned cars , population , and traffic jams .
Mar. 8 , 2009 update : Just days later and the Dubai authorities are at it again , this time excluding Sarah Younger of the Israel branch of the International Chamber of Commerce .
And like the women 's tennis federation , the ICC responded unequivocally , deciding in the future not to hold its conferences in countries that do not allow representatives of all its 140 member states to enter .
Mark one more step toward the separation of civilizations .
Apr , 7 , 2009 update :
For a scorching on - site analysis of " a city built from nothing in just a few wild decades on credit and ecocide , suppression and slavery , " see Johann Hari 's long article , " The dark side of Dubai , " in today 's Independent .
One quote , from a bankrupted Canadian woman : " The thing you have to understand about Dubai is – nothing is what it seems .
Nothing .
This is n't a city , it 's a con-job .
They lure you in telling you it 's one thing – a modern kind of place – but beneath the surface it's a medieval dictatorship . "
