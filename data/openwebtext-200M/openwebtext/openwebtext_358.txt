A recent Vista update is causing headaches for users with USB devices .
Microsoft last week re-released a software update intended to provide performance and reliability enhancements for Windows Vista - based and Windows Vista Service Pack 1 - based systems .
It was one of eight security bulletins and updates the company made available on April 8 .
Users who installed the update , however , soon found their USB devices unresponsive , particularly mice and flash drives .
Removing and re-installing the programs reportedly did not immediately solve the problem .
Microsoft confirmed the bug , but declined to provide further details .
" We are aware of concerns that a recent Microsoft update may be causing problems with USB devices , " according to a Microsoft spokeswoman .
" We are investigating the matter and at this time do not have any additional information to share . "
" I have a new system that has been working flawlessly til this patch , " a user known as SkyKnites wrote on a Google forum last week .
His mouse was later restored , but now " I just get this annoying new hardware found and driver install has failed [ notice ] every time I reboot , " he wrote .
A user known as JB also encountered problems .
" I have exactly the same problem as described here , i.e. no cordless mouse and keyboard ( via USB ) , " he wrote .
" I run Vista x64 Ultimate which is in a dual boot with XP x64 , this means ( discovered it today ) that my restore points gets whipped .
Basically , I do n't know how to uninstall the update causing the problem . "
Microsoft shipped its first Vista security patch in January 2006 for beta testers running the Windows Vista December CTP ( Community Technology Preview ) and Windows Vista Beta 1 , and warned that the operating system was vulnerable to a remote code execution flaw in the Graphics Rendering Engine .

If present trends continue , within two decades the proportion of immigrants in the United States will surpass the peak reached more than a century ago , a new analysis concludes .
The Pew Research Center , a nonpartisan research group , estimates that sometime between 2020 and 2025 , the foreign - born will account for 15 percent of the American population , or more than 1 in 7 residents .
They represented about 12 percent of the population in 2005 , 14.7 percent in 1910 and about 15 percent in the late 19th century .
Trends farther ahead are typically harder to predict .
Still , the Pew Center projects that in 2050 , 19 percent of Americans will be foreign - born ; that the share of Hispanic residents will more than double to 29 percent from 14 percent in 2005 ; and that the proportion of Asians will almost double , from 5 percent to 9 percent .
The center estimates that the total population will grow to 438 million in 2050 , with immigrants accounting for 82 percent , or 117 million , of the increase .
But because births in the United States to Hispanic and Asian immigrant parents will play a progressively greater role in population growth , according to the analysis , by 2050 a smaller proportion of both groups will be foreign born in than is the case today .
Ever since Intel compared the criticality of its ( still ) forthcoming Silverthorne ( which now goes by Atom , if you could n't guess ) processor to the original Pentium last June , we 've all wondered just how fantasmical our worlds would become when this thing finally dropped .
Now , however , Tom's Hardware has discovered that the release may actually do more for Intel than we geeks .
After consulting a source it believes to be quite credible , it found that the CPU -- which will likely sell for upwards of $ 30 at the low - end -- will cost Intel just " $ 6 to $ 8 , including production , packaging and shipping . "
Without busting out the abacus , it 's still fairly easy to see how profitable said chips could be if Intel can move these at even a snail 's pace , but of course , we'd take the dollars and cents estimates with a grain of salt until they actually hit the market .

Shades of 1929 : the global implications of the US banking collapse
Part 1
By Nick Beams
16 April 2008
The following is the first part of a report delivered by Nick Beams , national secretary of the Socialist Equality Party ( SEP ) in Australia and a member of the World Socialist Web Site international editorial board , to public meetings in Sydney and Melbourne on April 9 and 15 .
Part 2 and Part 3 of the report will be published on April 17 and 18 respectively .
Beams , an international authority on Marxist political economy , is the author of regular WSWS articles and analyses on globalisation and political economy .
The SEP and the International Students for Social Equality called the public meetings to discuss the global significance of the deepening crisis wracking the US financial and banking system .
Both meetings were well - attended , with the audiences including workers and university students , a number of whom were international students .
Following Beams ’s report , there were animated discussions covering a wide range of issues about the causes and implications of the financial meltdown .
Audience members asked why mainstream economists had been unable to predict or explain the crisis , why the banks and finance houses had resorted to increasingly risky marginal lending , and what the financial failure meant for the world position of the US .
Others raised the catastrophic impact of the economic breakdown on the jobs , homes , living standards and retirement funds of ordinary people .
Questions also centred on the viability of a socialist perspective and how working people would take up the struggle for a socialist program .
March 14 , 2008 — the day it became public knowledge that Bear Stearns , the fifth largest investment bank in the US and one of the largest financial institutions in the world , had gone bankrupt — has already taken its place as one of the defining dates in the history of global capitalism .
On that day , the world changed in a fundamental way .
The nostrums delivered day in day out by the various financial commentators , political leaders , academic economists and media pundits about the wonders and virtues of the “ free market ” — that it represented the highest , indeed the only possible form of social and economic organisation — were proven to be completely worthless .
Suddenly , not only was a crash on the scale of the Great Depression increasingly possible , it was on the verge of taking place .
Comments at the time and subsequent testimony by some of the major players involved in the Bear Stearns rescue operation make this clear .
For three days the US Federal Reserve Board , along with the US Treasury Department , worked round - the - clock to put together a rescue package .
Time was of the essence , the fear being that if a package were not put in place by the time Asian markets opened for trading on Monday March 17 , the world financial system would have gone into a meltdown that would have taken Wall Street with it when trading resumed there .
The key component of the rescue plan , which eventually saw Bear Stearns taken over by JP Morgan , was a guarantee that the Fed would assume responsibility for $ 30 billion worth of debts held by the failed bank — a decision without precedent in the annals of the US central bank .
As Wall Street economist Ed Yardeni commented in a note to his clients : “ The Government of Last Resort is working with the Lender of Last Resort to shore up housing and credit markets to avoid Great Depression II . ”
In his testimony to the US Congress , Fed chairman Ben Bernanke used more restrained language , but the message was essentially the same .
“ On March 13 , ” he told the Congress , “ Bear Stearns advised the Federal Reserve and other government agencies that its liquidity position had significantly deteriorated and that it would have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy the next day unless alternative sources of funds became available .
“ This news raised difficult questions of public policy .
Normally , the market sorts out which companies survive and which fail , and that is as it should be .
However , the issues raised here extended well beyond the fate of one company .
Our financial system is extremely complex and interconnected , and Bear Stearns participated extensively in a range of critical markets .
The sudden failure of Bear Stearns likely would have led to a chaotic unwinding of positions in those markets and could have severely shaken confidence .
The company ’s failure could also have cast doubt on the financial positions of some of Bear Stearns ’ thousands of counterparties and perhaps of companies with similar businesses .
Given the exceptional pressures on the global economy and financial system , the damage caused by a default by Bear Stearns could have been severe and extremely difficult to contain .
Moreover , the adverse impact of a default would not have been confined to the financial system but would have been felt broadly in the real economy through its effects on asset values and credit availability . ”
In other words , there was the real possibility of a global collapse .
The extent of the interconnections between Bear Stearns and the global financial system , and the impact its collapse could have had , is indicated by reports that the bank held trading contracts with an outstanding value of $ 2.5 trillion with firms around the world .
That is , contracts whose value was equivalent to around one sixth of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the United States and one twentieth of total global GDP were at risk .
As one participant in the rescue discussions put it : “ It was much worse than anyone realized ; the markets were on the precipice of a real crisis ” ( “ Leveraged Planet ” , Andrew Ross Sorkin , New York Times April 2 , 2008 ) .
In the month since the crisis erupted , some stabilisation has taken place in financial markets as a result of the Fed ’s bailout and continuing interest rate cuts .
But no one believes that the crisis is over .
Rather , the question hanging over the financial markets is : when will the other shoes drop ?
And the consequences of the credit crisis are yet to be fully felt .
In its Global Financial Stability Report issued on April 9 , the International Monetary Fund estimated that total losses in the US would be almost $ 1 trillion , a sum equivalent to about 7 percent of GDP .
The report warned that “ macro economic feedback effects ” were of growing concern as financial uncertainty was likely to “ weigh heavily on household borrowing , business investment , and asset prices , in turn feeding back onto employment , output growth and balance sheets . ”
These recessionary trends are already apparent .
A report on April 4 revealed that the US economy shed 80,000 jobs in March , the third straight month that job numbers have been down , something that has not happened for five years .
The unemployment rate went from 4.8 percent to 5.1 percent as job cuts were reported across a range of industries .
In the crucial construction sector , some 51,000 building workers lost their jobs , bringing the total for the past 12 months to 350,000 .
Manufacturing industries have been losing jobs for the past 21 months .
The Economic Policy Institute pointed out that for “ the fifth month in a row , fewer than half of industries have added jobs , demonstrating the pervasive nature of job loss . ”
It also noted that this was the first time on record that median family income had not recovered the ground lost in the last recession .
Growing perplexity
Among the more perceptive writers in the financial press there is recognition of some of the longer - term historical implications of this crisis .
The chief economics writer for the Financial Times , Martin Wolf , began his remarks to a recent meeting as follows :
“ For three decades now we have been promoting the joys of a liberalised financial system and what has it brought us ?
‘ One massive financial crisis after the other ’ is the answer .
This is not to say that liberalised finance brings no benefits .
It has certainly made a substantial number of people extraordinarily rich . ”
He noted that since the late 1970s there had been no fewer than 117 systemic banking crises in 93 countries , half the world , and in 27 of these the fiscal cost of the bailout was 10 per cent of GDP and sometimes more .
But the crisis of 2007 - 2008 , he continued , was “ far and away the most significant of all the crises of the last three decades . ”
“ What makes this crisis so significant ?
It tests the most evolved financial system we have .
It emanates from the core of the world ’s most advanced financial system and from transactions entered into by the most sophisticated financial institutions , which use the cleverest tools of securitisation and rely on the most sophisticated risk management .
Even so , the financial system blew up : both the commercial paper and inter - bank markets froze for months ; the securitised paper turned out to be radioactive and the ratings proffered by ratings agencies to be fantasy ; central banks had to pump in vast quantities of liquidity ; and the panic - stricken Federal Reserve was forced to make unprecedented cuts in interest rates . ”
What will be the eventual consequences ?
According to Nouriel Roubini of New York University ’s Stern School of Business the hit to the financial system may be as much as $ 3 trillion , equivalent to around 20 percent of GDP .
Wolf summed up the perplexity gripping those supposedly in charge of the financial system .
“ I no longer know what I used to think I knew .
But I also do not know what I think now . ”
Emphasising the need to learn from history , he continued : “ A fundamental lesson concerns the way the financial system works .
Outsiders were aware it had become a gigantic black box .
But they were prepared to assume that those inside it at least knew what was going on .
This can hardly be true now ” ( Martin Wolf , Financial Globalisation , Growth and Asset Prices , paper prepared for Colloque International de la Banque de France on Globalisation , Inflation and Monetary Policy , Paris , March 7 , 2008 ) .
This is a rather startling admission , not from an opponent of the capitalist order and the free market , but from one of its foremost international public defenders .
The same picture emerges from a report issued in early March , just before the Bear Stearns crisis broke , by The President ’s Working Group on Financial Markets , a body comprising representatives from the Department of the Treasury , Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission .
According to this report the reasons for the turmoil in financial markets were :
“ A breakdown in underwriting standards for subprime mortgages ;
“ A significant erosion of market discipline by those involved in the securitization process , including originators , underwriters , credit rating agencies , and global investors , related in part to failures to provide or obtain adequate risk disclosures ;
“ Flaws in credit rating agencies ’ assessments of subprime residential mortgage - backed securities ( RMBS ) and other complex structured credit products , especially collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) that held RMBS and other asset - backed securities ( CDOs of ABS ) ;
“ Risk management weaknesses at some large US and European financial institutions ; and
“ Regulatory policies , including capital and disclosure requirements , that failed to mitigate risk management weaknesses . ”
In short everyone was involved ... from those who issued the mortgages in the first place , to those institutions that then sliced and diced them , to the credit rating agencies who gave top ratings to the resulting packages , to US and European financial institutions that did not adequately assess risk , right through to those who were in charge of regulatory polices .
There was a considerable element of what can only be described as criminality — deriving not from the particular characteristics of the individuals involved , but from the nature of the capitalist system itself .
When the market was on the rise , when there was money to be made from subprime mortgages , based on so - called liar loans with teaser rates to pull in the unwary ; if money could be made by packaging these loans and then selling them off ; if it could be made by giving these dubious packages a top credit rating , then who wants to know about issues concerning the long - term unviability of the whole process .
There were no profits to be made there and , as one financial executive recently put it , so long as the music ’s still playing you have to keep on dancing .
The British economist John Maynard Keynes , who knew a thing or two about speculation , once wrote : “ A sound banker , alas , is not one who foresees danger and avoids it , but one who , when he is ruined , is ruined in a conventional and orthodox way along with his fellows , so that no one can really blame him . ”
And when a crisis does erupt , he can always call for a government rescue package .
I draw attention to these issues because of their political significance .
One of the most powerful ideological forces generated by capitalist society is the conception that working people could not possibly undertake the organization and control of society , and , above all , of its economy , because they do not have the necessary knowledge .
Socialism is therefore out of the question and society ’s economic organization must be left to the market and to those who supervise its operations .
In the first half of the twentieth century , millions of people all over the world entered the struggle for socialism based on their understanding , born of the experiences of war , fascism , depression and mass unemployment , that the operations of the free market and the capitalist system led to barbarism .
Over the past 60 years one of the most essential ideological props of the capitalist order has been the conception , assiduously promoted in the schools , universities , mass media and from the political platform , that such conditions could not possibly return .
Those in charge — wherever they are located — have learned the lessons of past disasters and know how to prevent their recurrence .
After all , we are told repeatedly , Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board , made his name in the academic world through a study of the causes of the 1930s Depression and is determined not to let it happen again .
So , despite some problems , all is really for the best in the best of all possible worlds .
If the events of the past weeks have done nothing else they have surely shattered that myth .
As official reports openly acknowledge , all the control mechanisms that were supposed to prevent a financial crisis failed .
And what is more , those in charge cannot even say why .
Bear Stearns operated under the regulation of the US Securities and Exchange Commission .
But as its chairman , Christopher Cox , wrote in the wake of the bank ’s collapse : “ At all times the firm had a capital cushion well above what is required to meet supervisory standards . ”
Bear Stearns , according to Cox , was , under the SEC ’s rules “ well capitalized . ”
In other words , as the surgeon put it , the operation was a success , but unfortunately the patient died on the table .
While the representatives of the capitalist economy voice their bewilderment over what has taken place , the events of the past weeks serve as the most powerful confirmation of Marx ’s analysis of the capitalist mode of production , revealing that its motion is governed by objective laws that assert themselves in the same way that the law of gravity does when a house falls about our ears .
And as the collapse of the house is the outcome of processes stretching back over a long period , so the breakdown of the financial system , and the political issues arising from it , can only be understood through an historical analysis of the global capitalist economy .

Did you know the following ?
" pot belly pigs are the only type of swine allowed within city limits and there are restrictions imposed .
The ordinance requires that the pigs are registered with animal control within 10 days of moving into
the city limits with annual renewals .
The pig is also not to exceed 85 pounds in weight or 18 inches in height at the withers .
Among the other
regulations , the ordinance specifies that they are n't allowed to run more than one hour per day three
times a day in a fenced enclosure .
There is also a two - pig maximum per household . "

Here 's a tiny little tip for handling those boiler - plate pages that are n't part of your app 's functionality but you usually need anyway .
It 's good for setting up about , contact , copyright , etc .
You can always throw those pages into / public as static html files , but if you want them to get styled with layouts , they need to be rendered as actions .
This is a way to do that simply .
It 's not rocket science , but I have n't done a noob post in ages and I 'm getting over a cold and I have n't posted in too long so gimme a break .
Say you want to have a simple landing page and a few typical boiler - plate pages .
Let 's start with the routes .
In config/ routes.rb
map.root : controller => ' home ' map.home ': page ' , : controller => ' home ' , :action => ' show ' , : page => / about|contact /
In app / controllers/home_controller.rb
def index # render the landing page end def show render : action => params [ : page ]
end
Throw your about .
html or about .html.erb and other pages into app / views / home and you 're good to go .
If you 've set up page caching , this wo n't even slow your app down .
The : page => /.../ bit in the route constrains it to match only those specific urls .
If you want , you can change that to a constant , like HomeController : : PAGES , so it 's easier to manage .
If you want to link to those pages , you can use the route helper methods , home_path and home_url
link_to ' About ' , home_path ( ' about ' )
You could always unroll the routes and have a separate route for each page , but I find this way a bit drier .
But if you 'd rather have a specific named route helper for each page , that 's an okay way to go .
Either way , you get to use layouts in your pages , and have a nice simple way to get them rendered .
Housing woes in the U.S. have been a hot topic of late , but two of the world ’s most populous countries may be in for a housing crisis worse than what the U.S. is experiencing .
Both China and India are watching real estate prices soar , leading many to question how long the market will last .
China for example , is boasting prices that would be considered absurd in the U.S.
Three - bedroom apartments in cities such as Guangzhou or Shanghai are running for upwards of $ 300,000 .
These prices are especially high considering that the average salary in China is $ 160 per month , according to BusinessWeek .
![ filekey = | 1846 | align=|left| caption =|One million residences were under construction in Shanghai in 2006 | alt =|
The harbor and skyline of megacity Shanghai| ]
In Shanghai , some one million residences were under construction in 2006 , which was just half the amount of new construction in the entire U.S. in 2004 , according to the Houston Chronicle .
With Shanghai representing almost 20 percent of China ’s property value , the bubble is seriously on edge , with many homes remaining empty .
Shanghai ’s property vacancy rate is roughly 25 percent , well above the international average of 10 percent , according to The New York Times .
Is the bubble already bursting ?
It would seem that the early signs are already there , as supply seems to be far outweighing demand at current prices .
Morgan Stanley Asia -Pacific Chief Economist Andy Xie said he believes that the bursting of China ’s housing bubble is inevitable , according to the Epoch Times ( China ) .
The Chinese government ’s delay in controlling their housing market , coupled with the rise in U.S. interest rates and a decline in personal savings in China , have all but forced the issue .
Another indicator of a serious issue is the difference between investments and purchase .
China had a difference of 16.6 percent in 2003 , surpassing the alarm level by almost 60 percent , according to the Epoch Times .
The warnings that this bubble is serious seem to be in place .
China ’s move to both urbanize and modernize , while helpful to the country ’s development , is quickly forcing real estate prices out of the realm of the average citizen .
As of 2005 , prices had already increased some 70 percent in just two years , according to the International Herald Tribune .
If property vacancy rates continue to rise in response to high prices , a burst of the bubble will soon follow .
In India the story seems to be the same as it is in China : rising prices , massive construction and a bubble set to burst .
Much like China , India ’s housing prices have soared , rising 16 percent a year for the last four years .
In Bangalore and Mumbai , prices doubled in both 2005 and 2006 , according to the Economist .
Apartments in Mumbai now cost an average of three times more than in Shanghai , even with incomes in India much lower than those in China .
According to the Economist , the question is not whether the prices will fall–but by how much .
![ filekey = | 1847 | align=|right| caption=|Parts of India have seen real estate prices drop 20 percent in the last year| alt=|Construction and sprawl in Mumbai| ] Recent reports have the fall already taking place , as New Delhi and other parts of Northern India have seen real estate prices drop some 20 percent over the last year , according to the International Herald Tribune .
Described as an erosion of confidence , stock markets have also been down as people have simply lacked the funds to put extra cash into the property market .
The Hindustan Times ( India ) reported a 50 percent drop in actual transactions in mid-2007 , as property developers were forced to drop prices some 5 to 10 percent in order to bolster demand in some of India ’s biggest cities .
The demand for both modest and upscale residences has seen a sharp decline , especially for downtown luxury residences , where transactions seem to have hit a standstill .
There has been a decline in home loan dispersals and the State Bank of India reports a slow in expected growth because of the market ’s movement , according to The Hindustan Times .
The business of flipping properties for a quick profit is most likely over in India for the time being .
Mortgage rates are increasing steadily in both Bangalore and Mumbai as prices have already begun to falter ; however , as the Economist reports , other areas of Asia are seeing a continued rise in home prices .
Developers of all sizes are using price cuts to attract demand for properties , and as it stands , the housing bubbles in both China and India may have already peaked .
Expect prices to continue to fall in order to avoid vacancies , and new construction to slow as the markets slow down .
In his opening remarks at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on network neutrality this morning , Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) got his first turn at the microphone and immediately stepped away from his prepared remarks .
" You 're not looking very cheerful right now , and you usually do , " he told FCC Chairman Kevin Martin .
Martin had reason to look dour .
Seated alone at the witness table , he was only minutes away from a dogpiling by Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) and John Kerry ( D - MA ) over both network neutrality and the relative slow growth of US broadband .
He was lucky enough to be excused before the Christian Coalition suggested that all bandwidth problems could be fixed by simply offering fewer porn video - on - demand channels and using them for Internet traffic instead .
The Democratic senators on the committee did most of the talking at the hearing , and the ones who spoke were surprisingly informed about the topic .
Even law professor Lawrence Lessig , who appeared at a second panel after Martin , opened his remarks by saying how rewarding it was to see how well people understand the network neutrality issue after several years of debate .
The criticisms of network neutrality came from the Republican side of the committee and generally followed the argument laid out by John Sununu ( R - NH ) .
He worried that Congress needed to tread cautiously when it came to thinking about " what we think competitors will do in the future . "
The law of unintended consequences suggests that regulation could hamper Internet growth , in his view , and any enforcement of neutrality should be after the fact .
If there 's a problem , then deal with it ; otherwise , leave the market alone .
Kevin Martin agreed .
He told the committee that no new regulations were needed at this time , but did make clear that the FCC would " enforce the principles it has already adopted " in its Internet Policy Statement .
In discussing the issue of network neutrality , Martin made clear what his own preferred approach would be when it comes to situations like Comcast 's blocking of certain peer - to - peer traffic .
In his view , it matters whether network management practices distinguish between legal and illegal activity ( the FCC will only protect legal activity ) , whether the service providers have adequately disclosed their management practices , and whether management techniques arbitrarily block or degrade a particular application rather than problematic content .
He also had little good to say about Comcast 's Sandvine network management system , saying that the two public hearings that the FCC has held on the matter have shown him that Comcast was not even capable of knowing when a segment of its network was congested .
Instead , it used reset packets to interfere with uploads even when congestion was not a problem .
Dorgan , Kerry , and Rockefeller all used their question time to take issue with the idea that network neutrality represented new , burdensome government regulation of the Internet .
Rockefeller pointed out that the Internet is currently regulated to address issues like spam , VoIP 911 services , and Internet access for schools through the Universal Service Fund ; simply arguing that something is " regulation " has little to do with whether the idea itself is a good one or a bad one .
Kerry took a stronger line , saying that everyone who questions the government 's basic investment in science and research has their answer " every time they check their e-mail . "
Recognizing the unintentional problems that regulation can create , Kerry called for " principles , not nitpicky regulatory structure . "
Dorgan , one of the co-sponsors of a network neutrality bill still pending in the Senate , likewise was incredulous that anyone could consider this some kind of intrusive government interference .
" Who on earth is standing up for discrimination ? " he thundered .
Well , Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) is , for one .
Though he said little at the hearing , the octogenarian did offer his brief take on network neutrality : " extensive regulation of the Internet , that 's what net neutrality means to me . "
Pithy .
Stevens and other suggested that " public indignation " and market forces would solve any problems that would arise , and the debate veered into familiar territory about broadband penetration , duopolies , open access to local loops , OECD numbers , and the like .
But Lawrence Lessig was n't satisfied with the arguments that we should simply wait for evidence of harm or that we should allow ISPs to have " pricing flexibility " when it comes to charging content owners for better service ( something advocated by an AEI researcher at the hearing ) .
Such an approach " fundamentally misunderstands how investment decisions are made in Silicon Valley , " said Lessig .
Venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are making bets today about what networks will look like in five years ; network neutrality , far from exerting a chilling effect on innovation , could instead provide the certainty that innovators need to make bets on the next big thing .
Finally .
Michelle Combs of the Christian Coalition testified during a second panel and offered her own novel solution to solving the sorts of capacity issues that Comcast used to justify its current network management practices .
The cable operator could simply pull two of its VOD porn channels and use them to offer more Internet bandwidth ; capacity problem solved !
Though one wonders , if this solution were even practical , how much of the additional bandwidth would still be used for porn .
Civilized China vs. Barbaric America

With little fanfare , Beijing airport opened an additional new terminal last week .
The terminal ’s 2 - mile long concourse is divided into three sections and connected by a shuttle train .
The addition will boost capacity at the airport to 82 million compared with the 52 million who used the airport last year .
The press reports that the existing terminal was overtaxed , and from my experience late last year , I would agree .
But , even that terminal was much better than many U.S. airports .
But Beijing Capital International Airport Co Ltd that operates the facility is n’t comparing itself to LaGuardia or LAX .
" [ A ] irport officials have admitted they have a way to go before being able to match Hong Kong , Singapore or Kuala Lumpur , " reports Reuters .
Indeed , Hong Kong International was the cream of the crop in my travels that also included Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in Taipei and both Shanghai airports — Hong Qiao International Airport and Shanghai Pudong International Airport .
All of the airports were clean and spacious .
And despite virtually all of the travel being international , there were few hassles and hold ups until we returned to the good old U.S. of A .
Air travel is exploding in China .
The Wall Street Journal reports that the Chinese between now and 2020 will build 97 new airports .
The only new airport on the drawing board in the U.S. that I can find is the Ivanpah airport to be located 30 miles south of Las Vegas .
But it will be 2017 , if or when that airport is complete .
There is plenty of environmental opposition to disturbing the cacti and lizards in the area .
With 200 million passengers expected to take to the skies this year , up from 185 million last year , and even more in the future as incomes rise , China will need another 3,310 jetliners by 2026 according to Boeing , three times more than the 1,150 commercial aircraft that Chinese airlines operated last year , according to the WSJ .
We flew a variety of Chinese airlines while on our trip and the service was excellent .
But , according to Reuters , " China ’s civil aviation regulator continues to berate airlines and airports for their poor treatment of passengers and is desperately trying to get them to raise standards ahead of the flood of visitors who will come for the Olympics . "
Granted these folks are n’t used to being roughed up by the likes of the TSA in the terminal , trying to maneuver luggage in and out of cramped hallways and dirty restrooms , and then settling in for some peanuts and a soft drink served by some union - protected 60 year - old stewardess or chubby , sweaty steward as is typical when flying in the U.S .
Chinese airlines have kept the quaint custom of only hiring young , attractive stewardesses , none larger than a size two , to wait on passengers .
All are smartly dressed , very neat , and define politeness .
There was a full meal offered on every flight we took , no matter how short .
We had to fill out declaration forms going in and out of China , and of course had to wait in line to go through immigration .
But the process was relatively painless , until we returned to LAX .
At least you can keep your shoes on and retain most personal items in Chinese and Hong Kong airports instead of running them through the scanner .
And none of that 3 - 1 - 1 nonsense was being applied .
The new Beijing terminal three features 64 western and Chinese restaurants and 90 retail stores .
There are a similar number of restaurants in all seven terminals at LAX , but more than half are places that primarily just sell coffee .
LAX offers but half the number of retail stores and most are newsstands and gift shops .
But it is when you land at the international terminal , proceed to the cramped baggage claim area , and settle into a line with a couple hundred other jetlagged passengers , all with mountains of luggage , to go through customs that the dreariness of LAX engulfs you .
The line hairpins in and around the luggage carousels , and when getting close to the customs agents , a glance to the right into their office , reveals pictures of a smiling George Bush and Michael Chertoff .
If that sight does n’t make you queasy , watching customs agents slice open packages while the owners of those possessions look on in horror , will do the trick .
Last August , 20,000 international passengers were stranded at LAX when a malfunction on the fiber optic cables that support the system used to process international passengers malfunctioned .
The system went down on a Saturday night and was restored at 11:45 p.m. , however it took Customs officials until nearly 4 a.m. to clear the last of the backlogged travelers .
Many passengers who had already spent 10 or more hours on airplanes during their flights were kept on their planes for several hours after the international terminals used for processing arriving passengers reached capacity , according to News.com .
” That system allows our officers to make decisions on who we can allow to enter the United States , ” Mike Fleming , a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman , told the Associated Press .
” You just do n’t know by looking at them . ”
Welcome home to the land of the free and home of the brave .
Even without computer malfunctions , making the mistake of declaring too much in foreign bought goodies , or telling the guard you ’re packing food , fruits or vegetables will lead to ; the loss of your property , bureaucratic delays , or payment of duties to Uncle Sam .
We flew in and out of Hong Kong three separate times on our trip and never experienced or witnessed these kinds of delays or thuggery .
Architect Norman
Foster ’s website describes the new five - story Beijing terminal as , " The world ’s largest and most advanced airport building — not only technologically , but also in terms of passenger experience , operational efficiency and sustainability — Beijing Airport is welcoming and uplifting . "
LAX is just the opposite .
The Best of Douglas French
Michigan may not have political party registration , but come the morning after the Nov. 4 presidential election , it wo n't be hard to tell the Democrats from Republicans if Hillary Rodham Clinton is elected president .
Democrats will be dancing in the streets , while Republicans will be feeling lousy , the Detroit Free Press - Local 4 Michigan Poll shows .
Nearly four out of five ( 79 percent ) of people who plan to vote in Tuesday 's Republican primary said they would feel " not so good " or " terrible " ( 55 percent ) if Clinton were elected .
The New York senator evoked a similarly strong response from Democratic voters , with 36 % saying they would feel " pretty good " and 32 % " ecstatic " if she were elected .
None of the other six candidates tested — Republicans Rudy Giuliani , Mike Huckabee , John McCain and Mitt Romney and Democrats Barack Obama and John Edwards — prompted such strong reactions from either Democratic or Republican voters .
Guiliani , the former New York mayor , comes closest to reaching Clinton levels of disdain , with 36 % of Democrats saying they would feel " not so good " the day after the former New York mayor is elected president , and 37 % describing the idea as " terrible . "
Quite a few Republicans were n't crazy about the idea of a Giuliani presidency either ; 35 % of Republican primary voters called it " not so good " or " terrible . "
The results of the poll , conducted by Selzer & Co. Inc. of Des Moines , come from telephone interviews Wednesday through Friday with 600 Michiganders who said they will vote in the Republican primary , and 600 who plan to vote in the Democratic primary .
The margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points .
Overall , Republicans were less likely than Democrats to express strong emotion in either direction about any of the candidates .
Romney was the candidate Republicans were most " ecstatic " about at 14 % .
McCain was second at 12 % , and Huckabee third with 10 % .
Republicans were less apprehensive about the other Democratic candidates .
Only 18 % said an Obama presidency would be " terrible . "
Edwards drew that rating from 27 % of Republicans .
Poll director Ann Selzer said Clinton is an " outlier " on the agony / ecstasy spectrum for Michigan voters .
Some of that may be attributable to the fact she is the only one of the top three Democrats whose name will appear on the state 's primary ballot , Selzer said , but strong feelings about her go back a long way .
Giuliani , however , may be suffering a bit among Michigan voters for his decision to focus his campaign on other states , she said .
Not surprisingly , Clinton 's most enthusiastic support came from women , with more than one in three saying they would be " ecstatic " if she wins the oval office .
Irene Will , 67 , of Grosse Ile , Mich. , was one of them .
" If Hillary does n't get the White House I am going to feel a really great tragic loss , " said Will , an activist and retired social worker .
" I 'm a liberal Democrat .
I love Obama and ( Dennis ) Kucinich and Edwards , " Will said .
" But it 's time for a woman .
I have such a passion about it . "
Patty Phillips , a 37 - year - old office manager from Newport , said she 's among those who would feel " terrible " when it comes to the former first lady .
" I have n't heard one truthful fact come out of her mouth .
I lost respect for her " when Bill Clinton was president , Phillips said .
To be fair , Phillips does n't have much good to say about any of the candidates , Democrat or Republican , except Giuliani and Fred Thompson ( who was n't included in the survey ) .
A self - described " real conservative , " Phillips said Giuliani is her top choice for his leadership after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 . Jennifer Reamer , 48 , of Lapeer , might be a more typical Republican .
She plans to vote for Romney , but said " no one would be terrible . "
Reamer said she has more confidence in Romney because of his record in business and government , and she likes his Michigan roots .
But " if it was Obama , I 'd be fine , " she said , adding , " do n't tell my husband . "

In a previous article , I conducted a basic analysis of the economy and monetary scheme of Second Life , a three - dimensional virtual world where users can create virtual goods and services and exchange them with one another .
I showed that thus far , Linden Lab , Inc. , the creator of Second Life , has taken a mostly hands - off approach to its economy , with the notable exception of its fiat currency scheme .
Unfortunately , Linden 's aversion to paternalism changed in January with its announcement that it would be banning most interest - paying banks from Second Life .
The announcement reads :
" As of January 22 , 2008 , it will be prohibited to offer interest or any direct return on an investment ( whether in [ Linden dollars ( L$ ) ] or other currency ) from any object , such as an ATM , located in Second Life , without proof of an applicable government registration statement or financial institution charter .
We 're implementing this policy after reviewing Resident complaints , banking activities , and the law , and we 're doing it to protect our Residents and the integrity of our economy . "
This policy has strong parallels to the adoption of 19th - century banking regulations in the real world .
These regulations were supposed to stop wildcat banking , where ambitious bankers expanded credit through risky loans until defaults led to insolvency and left their depositors empty - handed .
Similarly , in Second Life , unregulated banks have offered demand deposits bearing interest rates of 40 % or more , at least one of which never actually had any loans underlying its interest - bearing deposits .
[ 1 ]
Cases such as that are almost certainly fraud and should be adjudicated as such , but Linden 's adoption of a draconian ban on all interest - paying banks , which had been preceded by a ban on gambling , has established a clear pattern of economic interventionism .
This does not bode well for Second Life users , for as Ludwig Von Mises has taught us , middle - of - the - road policy leads to socialism .
Who Needs Virtual Banks Anyway ?
Strangely enough , there is no need in a virtual world for " banks , " in the strict sense of the term .
In Second Life and many other virtual worlds , the software interfaces have robust and secure forms of money with integrated payment systems .
Unlike the real world , where a bank provides a secure alternative to storing large amounts of money under one 's mattress , there is no risk in Second Life of being burglarized or robbed at gunpoint by another avatar .
Although there may be some risk of having one 's account hacked , a virtual bank is presumably no more secure and is probably a higher - profile target than any one individual .
It is not my intent to quibble over semantics , but it is necessary to identify the actual function of " banks . "
In the real world , it is to warehouse one 's money , but in Second life , the nonfraudulent banks could be better described as either investment funds , where depositors are promised some portion of the yield generated by the fund 's investments , or as brokerage accounts that allow depositors to invest among the different stocks offered on the bank 's associated exchanges .
While some banking institutions offered these services in addition to their interest - bearing accounts , those institutions that do not pay interest appear to be unaffected by the ban .
Wildcat Banking
Banks with no underlying loans and no ability to redeem all deposits , such as the one mentioned before , are essentially Ponzi schemes , and therefore fraudulent .
But what about a bank that actually does extend loans , though to the point that it does not have enough reserves to cover all of its demand deposits , i.e. , what about fractional - reserve banks ?
Are they committing fraud ?
Murray Rothbard explains , in the context of gold being used as money :
" It is true that the note or deposit does not actually say on its face that the warehouse [ bank ] guarantees to keep a full backing of gold on hand at all times .
But the bank does promise to redeem on demand , and so when it issues any fake receipts , it is already committing fraud , since it immediately becomes impossible for the bank to keep its pledge and redeem all of its notes and deposits .
Fraud , therefore , is immediately being committed when the act of issuing pseudo - receipts takes place .
Which particular receipts are fraudulent can only be discovered after a run on the bank has occurred ( since all the receipts look alike ) , and the late - coming claimants are left high and dry . " [ original emphasis ] [ 2 ]
The charge against unregulated fractional - reserve banks in the real world was that they would issue more bills of credit than they could possibly redeem and that these bills of credit would circulate as money , leading to inflation , boom , and bust when the banks defaulted on their deposits .
That much was true .
However , the regulations that were adopted simply sought to limit the fraud to a manageable level , in contrast to a free market , which would have had the tendency to eliminate it altogether .
In the case of Second Life , the prospect of inflation caused by wildcat banks is not a practical concern .
I am not aware of any notes issued by a bank in Second Life ever circulating as money .
This is because it would be highly impractical for that to occur .
As mentioned before , the L$ enjoys a strong competitive advantage over any other would - be moneys because it is part of the payment system integrated into the default Second Life software client .
Furthermore , one can be sure that Linden would move swiftly to protect its highly - profitable fiat currency scheme from any competition , just as the federal government raided NORFED for promoting an alternative real - world monetary scheme based on precious metals .
In actuality , the only entity involved in this discussion that is inflating the money supply is Linden itself .
Linden has created about US $ 14.6 million worth of L$ with no backing whatsoever . [ 3 ]
Although the L$ apparently falls outside the federal government 's definition of money ( this can be inferred because Linden has n't been shut down ) , it clearly functions as a medium of exchange and is very much indeed money .
This evasion of the legal definition of money has parallels to the dubious accounting practices that often accompany corporate scandals , where financial statements technically comply with the rules that govern them , but paint a picture that does not reflect reality .
A natural question to ask , then , is whether or not Linden is committing fraud by creating money out of thin air and selling it to people for US $ .
The answer is no — from a natural - law perspective at least .
Linden explicitly describes the nature of the L$ in its terms of service and states that they are not redeemable for US $ .
Reading closely , it even appears that , for all practical purposes , they are actually Linden 's property . [ 4 ]
Rather than being fraudulent , the L$ is simply a terrible solution for its supposed ends , to provide a stable medium of exchange that will allow for a robust and growing economy .
Using the L$ is like implementing a monetary scheme during wintertime that uses scoops of ice cream as money .
It could work pretty well for a little while , but come springtime , it would result in a huge mess .
As shown above , the fractional - reserve banking occurring in Second Life is not inherently inflationary and would not have led to boom and bust in and of itself .
Accordingly , Linden 's justification of banning all interest - paying banks in order to " protect the integrity of its economy " is either ignorant or disingenuous ( probably the former ) .
The other justification Linden provided was to " protect its Residents , " presumably from the threat of fraud , which really means to favor one group ( naïve depositors ) at the expense of another ( lenders , the entrepreneurs whose businesses they capitalize , and all of the consumers who would purchase goods from those entrepreneurs ) .
This favoritism raises some very obvious questions regarding the ethics of the ban .
The Ethics of Virtual Interventionism
For classical liberals in favor of property rights and opposed to any form of interventionism , the question of whether or not Linden 's ban should be considered unjust is not as straightforward as it might seem .
To make this determination , we must first establish what rights Second Life users have .
The basis of my argument will be natural rights , particularly as elaborated by Murray Rothbard in The Ethics of Liberty .
Proponents of natural rights generally hold that one can make an unclaimed , scarce natural resource his property by mixing his labor with it .
In Second Life , one can mix his labor with atomistic objects to produce a desirable good .
Having created said good , one retains the sole ability ( aside from Linden ) to reproduce , sell , or otherwise dispose of it .
If the story were to end here , it would appear that Second Life users have natural rights over their creations ; but alas , it is not so simple .
This is because the natural right of property is not derived from the artificial nature created by Linden , but from the nature of human existence in the real world .
Although some Second Life users may wish to deny it , Second Life is very much a part of the real world .
Stubbornly rejecting this notion will not lead to any benefit , just as one who rejects the idea that the Earth is a sphere will probably never achieve space travel , and one who rejects the idea that water is necessary for human life will surely die of thirst .
Given that goods in Second Life are in fact real , just like a kitchen table or an automobile , it quickly becomes apparent that they are very much like , if not the same as , intellectual property ( IP ) .
This observation complicates the discussion because it turns out that there is not a unanimous consensus among classical liberals on whether or not IP constitutes property from a natural rights perspective .
Ayn Rand and others have argued that it does .
Taking the opposite stance , Roderick Long and Stephan Kinsella have presented lucid and concise arguments against the legitimacy of intellectual property .
Adopting the view that IP is not property , one still runs into problems because goods in Second Life are not pure information ; they are specific instances of information .
Just as the line of reasoning presented by Long and Kinsella would allow a particular hardback book to be considered property as a scarce instance of information , so too might be the configuration of electrons on Linden 's computer servers .
Having stirred the pot of whether or not virtual goods in Second Life should be considered the property of their creators , I leave the reader with perhaps an unsatisfying conclusion : it is unclear .
The uncertainty arises from the complexity of Second Life 's terms of service , the fact that parts of the terms of service rely on the unnatural concept of IP as property , and the ultimate ambiguity of whether or not Linden , who owns the servers on which the goods are being created , ever grants title to its users for instances of information on its servers .
It might be like a manufacturing plant , where the owner of the plant retains title to the goods being labored on by employees , or it might be more like a pottery workshop where the workshop provides tools , raw materials , and storage , yet the makers of the pots are granted title to their creations .
My personal inclination is to say that it is more like the former and that Second Life users do not possess any natural rights over their creations .
Consequently , I do not believe any economic intervention by Linden to be fundamentally unjust .
One Lesson for Linden
Linden 's ban on interest - paying banks may not be unjust , but that does not mean that it should be condoned .
To draw such a conclusion would be to confuse morality with ethics .
Just as one might believe , for instance , that it should not be considered a crime to smoke cigarettes , drink alcohol , or do hard drugs , one might at the same time believe that all three practices are morally objectionable and that they would all lead to suffering .
So too , I believe that Linden 's ban of interest - bearing banks is a poor policy , though I ardently respect their right to adopt it .
I also have some sympathy for Linden in adopting this ban , as it might have been due to pressure from federal regulators .
Because Linden falls under the jurisdiction of the United States , it is therefore subject to the threat of coercive force if it does not follow regulators ' biddings .
But sympathy aside , policies such as the ban on interest - paying banks incentivize further reckless behavior by users who have made foolish decisions , and they frustrate and hinder the entrepreneurs who are producing the goods that attract people to Second Life .
Linden policymakers would do well to learn and memorize Henry Hazlitt 's One Lesson , to look not merely at the immediate , but at the longer effects of any act or policy , and to trace the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups .
Notes
[ 1 ]
In a panel hosted by the Metanomics series , one virtual banker remarks around time 19:50 that his bank , which has paid annualized interest rates of 44 % and higher , had no loans underlying deposits .
Whether or not there were any other assets underlying the deposits that could provide sufficient yield to pay the promised rates of return is uncertain .

According to official Linden statistics as of the end of November , 2007 , the total L$ supply was about 3.9 billion Linden dollars .
Using a rough calculation with the typical exchange rate of L$ 270 =US$ 1 , Linden has earned about US $ 14.6 million in revenues by selling these L$ .
[ 4 ]
As of January 17 , 2008 , the terms of service read , in part , " You agree that Linden Lab has the absolute right to manage , regulate , control , modify and / or eliminate [ L$ ] as it sees fit in its sole discretion , in any general or specific case , and that Linden Lab will have no liability to you based on its exercise of such right . "
AMD lowered its forecast for first - quarter performance today and announced that it intends to cut approximately 10 percent of its workforce ( 1,600 to 1,700 workers ) by the end of the third quarter .
The company said that it expects first - quarter revenue to come in at $ 1.5 billion .
That 's a healthy 22 percent increase compared to Q1 2007 , but is still 15 percent lower than the fourth quarter of 2007 .
Previously , AMD had been expected to report first quarter revenue of approximately $ 1.6 billion dollars .
Wider Phenom availability , new ATI HD 3000 - series cards , and price cuts for the Radeon HD 3850 and HD 3870 were evidently unable to stem the company 's losses , and AMD says that the revenue shortfall is due to lower - than - expected sales across all market segments .
The company will release additional financial data and information on market segment performance when it reports its quarterly results on April 17 .
There 's at least some reason to think AMD 's second quarter may be better than its first , thanks to a stronger product mix .
B3 - based Phenoms and triple - core processors should both be widely available in - channel through most of the quarter , and the 780G chipset , which launched in the middle of the first quarter to strong reviews , is the obvious platform of choice for either processor .
AMD has already stated , however , that it intends to take an undetermined restructuring charge in the second quarter , which could potentially put quite a dent in the company 's earnings for that period .
AMD gave no guidance on how its revenue shortfall and job cuts will affect either its next - generation 45nm Shanghai processor or Hector Ruiz 's much - publicized plan to return AMD to profitability by the second quarter of this year .
Today 's announcement is n't particularly surprising — bad news from AMD in general is no longer surprising — but the company 's eggs are increasingly lying in a single code - named basket .
All current information suggests that Shanghai 's development is going well , but returning to competitive status may require a performance leap of Athlon XP - to - Athlon 64 proportions by the time the processor actually ships .
Such jumps are not impossible , but reports like this only serve to increase the pressure on AMD 's next - generation production team .

Until now , I have given equal credence to two possible scenarios :
We could have several years of inflation as we do now , and the powers - that - be would have a sudden rush of brains to the head , like Paul Volcker and Ronald Reagan did in 1980 , and stop the “ printing press , ” ending inflation and the gold and silver bull market , for at least a few years ;
or
It is too late to stop it .
The political forces and the Unfunded Liabilities would prevent the powers - that - be from ending the money - printing process , and in fact , would grossly accelerate it .
This would result in a hyper inflation ( 400 percent inflation or more ) , and the eventual total destruction of the dollar .
Suddenly America would find its money totally useless .
Store shelves would be empty , gas would go through the stratosphere , and Americans would suffer through the greatest threat since the Great Depression of the ’30s .
So what caused me to settle on number two ?
I received John Williams ' recent newsletter “ Shadow Government Statistics , ” www.shadowstats.com in which he describes his case for a hyper - inflationary depression .
It was most persuasive .
It certainly persuaded me , and is consistent with what I ’ve said for years .
I spent the ‘ 70s fending off the media label of “ Prophet of Doom , ” arguing that I expected much less than doom .
It turned out to be so .
With my new book in circulation , I ’ll face the same accusations , and this time they are right .
The financial world we know and love is facing genuine doom .
You could lose the value of all your assets in the stock market .
You could find yourself unable to buy essential commodities , when you want them , and gold and silver will be valued , not in the tens or hundreds of dollars per ounce , but in the thousands !
John Williams ’ Shadow Government Statistics newsletter is most unusual .
John is a consulting economist with all of the academic credentials .
Most of his clients are bank officers and high - ranking corporate officers .
He has rearranged the government data according to historical analysis .
For example , the government says inflation is under four percent by the simple expedient of eliminating energy and food from their calculations .
John says inflation is over 11 percent , including energy and food .
His academic credentials are way ahead of mine , but at least I know enough to understand his work .
It ’s my job to try to reduce such things to terms my subscribers can grasp .
Here are some brief paragraphs from this 25 - page report .
“ With the creation of massive amounts of new fiat ( not backed by gold ) dollars will come the eventual complete collapse of the value of the U.S. dollar and related dollar - denominated paper assets . ”
“ … a law professor at Harvard and The University of California , Berkeley , who experienced the Weimar Republic hyperinflation , said , ‘ It was horrible .
Horrible !
Like lightning it struck .
No one was prepared .
You cannot imagine the rapidity with which the whole thing happened .
The shelves in the grocery stores were empty .
You could buy nothing with your paper money . ’ ”
“ … the still - unfolding banking solvency crisis has confirmed the Fed ’s and the U.S. government ’s willingness to spend whatever money they have to create in order to keep the financial system from imploding . ”
“ The circumstance envisioned ahead is not one of double - or triple - digit annual inflation , but more along the lines of seven- to 10 - digit inflation seen in other circumstances during the last century . ”
“ The historical culprit generally has been the use of fiat currencies — currencies with no asset backing such as gold — and the resulting massive printing of currency that the issuing authority needed to support its system , when it did not have the ability , otherwise , to raise enough money for its perceived needs , through taxes or other means . ”
“ The United States is no exception , already having obligated itself to liabilities well beyond its ability ever to pay off . ”
“ Hyperinflation : Extreme inflation , minimally in excess of four - digit annual percent change , where the involved currency becomes worthless .
A fairly crude definition of hyperinflation is a circumstance , where , due to extremely rapid price increases , the largest pre-hyperinflation bank note ( $ 100 ) becomes worth more as functional toilet paper than as currency . ”
“ The current economic contraction is about halfway towards being classified as a ‘ depression . ’ ”
“ Official CPI could be running in double - digits by year - end 2008 . ”
“ The U.S. economy has been in a recession since late - 2006 , entering the second down - leg of a multiple - dip economic contraction , where the first down - leg was the recession of 2001 that really began back in late - 1999 .
Annual CPI inflation currently is running around 11.6 % , again , facing further upside pressures . ”
“ The evolving depression quickly will move to great - depression status , when the hyperinflation hits .
It will be extremely disruptive to the conduct of normal commerce . ”
“ Ongoing M3 currently shows a record annual growth rate of 17.3 % . ”
“ In the near future , dollar selling should build towards an extreme , with heavy foreign investment in the dollar fleeing the U.S. currency for safety elsewhere .
With the domestic financial markets and U.S. Treasuries so heavily dependent on foreign capital for liquidity , the Federal Reserve — now touted as the formal financial market stabilizer — will be forced increasingly to monetize federal debt .
That process will build over time , given the federal government ’s effective bankruptcy . ”
“ Again , the current circumstance will evolve into a hyperinflationary depression , then a great depression .
Although such is not likely much before 2010 , or after 2018 , the financial end game for the current markets will tend to come sooner rather than later and will break with surprising speed when it hits . ”
“ 2008 will favor an incumbent party loss , i.e. a victory for the Democrats . ”
“ What promises hyperinflation this time is the lack of monetary discipline formerly imposed on the system by the gold standard , and a Fed dedicated to preventing a collapse in the money supply and the implosion of the still , extremely over - leveraged domestic financial system . ”
“ The limits to the unlimited abuse of the debt standard are particularly evident in the GAAP - based financial statements of the U.S. government , which show the actual federal deficit at $ 4.0 - plus trillion for 2007 alone , with total federal obligations standing at $ 62.6 trillion .
With no ability to honor these obligations , the government effectively is bankrupt . ”
“ Although the U.S , government faces ultimate insolvency , it has the same way out taken by most countries faced with bankruptcy .
It can print whatever money it needs to create , in order to meet its obligations .
The effect of such action is a runaway inflation — a hyperinflation — with a resulting , full debasement of the U.S. dollar , the world ’s reserve currency . ”
“ Oil prices are near historic highs , the dollar is near historic lows , and money growth is at an all - time high .
The near - term outlook for all three is for new record levels and for extremely strong upside pressure on U.S. inflation . … gold prices should continue setting new historic highs . ”
“ The difference is in accounting … for unfunded Social Security and Medicare liabilities . ”
“ Put into perspective , if the government were to raise taxes so as to seize 100 % of all wages , salaries and corporate profits , it still would be showing an annual deficit using GAAP accounting on a consistent basis .
In like manner , given current revenues , if it stopped spending every penny ( including defense and homeland security ) other than Social Security and Medicare obligations , the government still would show an annual deficit . ”
“ U.S. federal obligations are so huge versus the national GDP that the country ’s finances look more like those of a banana republic than the world ’s premiere financial power and home to the world ’s primary reserve currency , the U.S. dollar . ”
“ The effect of this structural change has been that most consumers have been unable to sustain adequate income growth beyond the rate of inflation , unable to maintain their standard of living .
The only way personal consumption can grow in such a circumstance is for the consumer to take on new debt or liquidate savings .
Both those factors are short - lived and have reached untenable extremes . ”
“ From the Fed ’s standpoint , it can neither stimulate the economy nor contain inflation .
Lowering rates has done little to stimulate the structurally - impaired economy , and raising rates may become necessary in defense of the dollar . ”
“ By the time hyperinflation kicks in , the economy already should be in depression , and the hyperinflation quickly should pull the economy into a great depression .
Uncontained inflation is likely to bring normal commercial activity to a halt . ”
Hyperinflationary Great Depression
“ In the United States , the printing presses have not been revved up heavily yet , but the commitments are in place , as seen in the annual GAAP - based deficit running on average more than $ 4.0 trillion per year .
That amount is far beyond the ability of the government to tax or the political willingness of the government to cut entitlement spending .
While the inevitable inflationary collapse , based solely on these funding needs , could be pushed well into the next decade , actions already taken likely have set the stage for a much earlier crisis . ”
“ It is this environment that leaves the U.S. dollar open to potentially such a rapid and massive decline , and dumping of U.S. Treasuries , that the Federal Reserve would be forced to monetize significant sums of Treasury debt , triggering the early phases of a monetary inflation .
In this environment annual multi-trillion - dollar deficits rapidly would feed into a vicious , self - feeding cycle of currency debasement and hyperinflation . ”
“ Given the extremely rapid debasement of the larger denomination notes , with limited physical cash in the system , existing currency would disappear quickly as a hyperinflation broke .
From a practical standpoint , however , currency would disappear , at least for a period of time in the early period of a hyperinflation . ”
“ Barter System .
With standard currency and electronic payment systems non-functional , commerce quickly would devolve into black markets for goods and services and a barter system . ”
“ Gold and silver both are likely to retain real value and would be exchangeable for goods and services .
Silver would help provide smaller change for less costly transactions . ”
“ In such a circumstance , gold and silver would be primary hedging tools that would retain real value and also be portable in the event of possible civil turmoil .
Also , at some point , the failure of the world ’s primary reserve currency will lead to the structuring of a new global currency system .
I would not be surprised to find gold as part of the new system , in an effort to sell the system to the public . ”
“ I still look for U.S. stocks to take an ultimate 90 % hit , peak - to - trough , net of inflation , during this period . ”
Ruff Times subscribers who accept John ’s scenario have no downside !
At the worst , if Scenario number one occurs , they will make tons of money in gold and silver , then we will eventually put out a sell order and the world will return to relatively normal .
If I and John Williams are right , it will literally save your current lifestyle , and perhaps even your lives .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Cell phone users will get text message alerts of emergencies under a new nationwide alert system approved late Wednesday by the Federal Communications Commission , according to FCC spokesman Robert Kenny .
An emergency text message would be sent in the event of a widespread disaster , severe weather or child abduction .
Under the plan , the FCC will appoint a federal agency to create the messages and pass them on to cell phone companies that choose to participate , an FCC representative said earlier .
Once that agency is named , the participating cell phone providers would have 10 months to comply with the new system 's requirements .
" It is essential that we support and advance new ways to share critical , time - sensitive information with them in times of crisis , " FCC chairman Kevin J. Martin said in a written statement .
Earlier , the FCC representative explained how the plan would work .
Cell phone companies that voluntarily opt into the system would send text - based alert messages to subscribers in response to three types of events :
A disaster that could jeopardize the health and safety of Americans , such as a terrorist attack ; these would trigger a national alert from the president of the United States
Imminent or ongoing threats such as hurricanes , tornadoes or earthquakes
Child abductions or Amber alerts .
Watch how the cell phone alerts would work »
T- Mobile , Verizon , Sprint Nextel and AT&T all stated that they would be likely to opt into the alert system if it is passed by the FCC .
" While we obviously need to review the details of the FCC 's decision , we look forward to offering mobile emergency alerts to our customers , " AT&T said in a written statement .
A Sprint representative said the company would participate if the FCC adopts the plan exactly as it was recommended by an advisory group .
A federal agency , yet to be appointed , would create the messages and information that would go to the participating cell phone companies , an FCC spokesman said .
Once that agency is named , all carriers that opt into the system will have to meet the requirements of the system within 10 months .
Subscribers would be able to opt out of receiving the messages , according to the current plan , and carriers would be required to provide vibration or audio attention signals with a distinct sound for people with disabilities .
The alert system plan was generated from an act Congress passed in 2006 that looked at emergency communications .
The act directed the National Telecommunications and Information Administration , the Department of Homeland Security , the FCC and other agencies to work together to enhance and expand the capabilities of emergency communications in the United States .

All About U.S. Federal Communications Commission
Maybe when we were their age , we walked five miles to school , rain or shine .
So why do n't most children today walk or bike to school ?
It 's not necessarily because they 're spoiled , lazy or over scheduled .
According to a University of Michigan researcher , concerns about safety are the main reason that less than 13 percent of U.S. children walked or biked to school in 2004 , compared to more than 50 percent who did so in 1969 .
" These concerns are strongly linked to the kind of physical environment children navigate between home and school , " said Byoung - Suk Kweon , an environmental and landscape architecture researcher at the U - M Institute for Social Research ( ISR ) .
" The greener the route , the more likely it is that children will walk and bike . "
Using Geographic Information System ( GIS ) data combined with a survey of 186 parents of 5th through 8th grade students , Kweon found that parents were most concerned about the speed and volume of traffic students would encounter en route to school ; the possibility of crime ; and the weather .
" In Texas , where we lived when I conducted this study , our sons did not walk to school because we lived too far away , " said Kweon , who is also affiliated with the U - M School of Natural Resources and Environment .
In general , she found , children who walk to school usually live less than three - quarters of a mile away .

" In Ann Arbor , they do walk to school .
We have a 27 degree rule .
If it 's colder than that , we drive them ; if it 's warmer than that , they walk . "
In her study , Kweon found that children use sidewalks , not bike lanes , when they ride to school .
" Parents may be concerned about the safety of bike lanes , and they may be telling their children to ride on the sidewalk because it 's safer , " she said .
" We may need to re-think how to place bike lanes in school walk zones . "
To learn more about how the physical environment influences parents ' perceptions of safety and their willingness to allow their children walk or bike to school , Kweon and colleagues conducted a series of laboratory - based simulation studies , testing six different pedestrian environments .
" It 's very important for parents that there be a separation or buffer between traffic and the sidewalk , " she said .
" They are much more willing to let their children walk when this buffer is at least eight feet wide , and when there are also trees in this area . "
Trees not only provide shade , but also serve as a sort of vertical barrier between sidewalk and street .
Although improving the physical environment reduces parents ' concerns for their children 's safety , Kweon found that the social environment — especially the likelihood of crime — strongly affects parental perceptions of safety as well .
Kweon hopes to conduct a related study in Detroit to examine how the intersection of social and physical factors influences the likelihood that children will walk to school .
By identifying environmental elements conducive to walking and biking to school , Kweon hopes her research may help improve children 's physical health and reduce the incidence of childhood obesity , especially prevalent among minority children .
" Walking or biking to school helps children develop an early habit of engaging in physical activity , and that can lead to a healthier and more active and healthier population , " she said .
Kweon 's study was supported by a grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation and from the Southwest Region University Transportation Center in College Station , Texas .
Breast cancer patients with low levels of vitamin D were much more likely to die of the disease or have it spread than patients getting enough of the nutrient , a study found — adding to evidence the " sunshine vitamin " has anti-cancer benefits .
The results are sure to renew arguments about whether a little more sunshine is a good thing .
The skin makes vitamin D from ultraviolet light .
Too much sunlight can raise the risk of skin cancer , but small amounts — 15 minutes or so a few times a week without sunscreen — may be beneficial , many doctors believe .
NEW TREND : Women increasingly opt for mastectomy
BETTER LIFE : Summing up the latest cancer research
While the vitamin is found in certain foods and supplements , most do n't contain the best form , D - 3 , and have only a modest on blood levels of the nutrient .
That 's what matters , the Canadian study found .
Only 24 % of women in the study had sufficient blood levels of D at the time they were first diagnosed with breast cancer .
Those who were deficient were nearly twice as likely to have their cancer recur or spread over the next 10 years , and 73 % more likely to die of the disease .
" These are pretty big differences , " said study leader Dr. Pamela Goodwin of Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto .
" It 's the first time that vitamin D has been linked to breast cancer progression . "
But people should n't start downing supplements , she warned .
Experts do n't agree on how much vitamin D people need or the best way to get it , and too much can be harmful .
They also do n't know whether getting more vitamin D can help when someone already has cancer .
" We have no idea whether correcting a vitamin D deficiency will in any way alter these outcomes , " said Dr. Julie Gralow , a cancer specialist at the University of Washington in Seattle .
The study was released Thursday by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and will be presented at the group 's annual meeting later this month .
Lots of earlier research suggests vitamin D may help prevent prostate , breast and especially colon cancer .
In lab and animal tests , vitamin D stifles abnormal cell growth , curbs formation of blood vessels that feed tumors and has many other anti-cancer effects .
Other evidence : People who live in northern regions of the world have higher cancer rates than those living closer to the equator , possibly because of less sunshine and vitamin D .
The Canadian researchers wanted to see whether it made a difference in survival .
They took blood from 512 women at three University of Toronto hospitals between 1989 and 1995 , when the women were first diagnosed with early - stage breast cancer .
A decade later , 83 % of those who had had adequate vitamin D blood levels were alive without extensive spread of their cancer , versus 79 % of those whose vitamin D levels were insufficient and 69 % of those who were deficient , as defined by widely used medical standards for measuring intake .
One red flag :
The few women with the very highest levels of vitamin D seemed to have worse survival .
Though the study was too small and those results were not conclusive , " there may be an optimal level of vitamin D in women with breast cancer and it may be possible to take too much , " Goodwin said .
The federal government says up to 2,000 international units of vitamin D a day seems OK .
Taking 800 units per day will , on average , raise blood levels to the middle of the range that seems best for bone and general health , Goodwin said .
Vitamin D is in salmon and other oily fish , and milk is routinely fortified with it , but dietary sources account for little of the amount of D circulating in the blood , experts say .
" It 's very hard to make a recommendation " because how much difference a supplement makes depends on someone 's baseline level , which also can be affected by sunlight , skin type and time of year , she explained .
Doctors do suggest breast cancer patients get their vitamin D levels checked to see whether they are deficient .
The simple blood test is available in many hospitals and labs for about $ 25 , Goodwin said .
Dr. Nancy Davidson , a Johns Hopkins University cancer specialist who is president of the oncology society , said those tests are growing in popularity , even in ordinary medical care .
" Rightly or wrongly , I 'm increasingly seeing physicians who are measuring this , " she said .
The Canadian study was paid for by the Breast Cancer Research Foundation in New York , established by cosmetics magnate Evelyn Lauder .
" It 's a very provocative paper .
It 's confirmatory of a tremendous amount of evidence that vitamin D is an important component of health , " said Dr. Larry Norton , chief of breast cancer programs at Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York and a medical adviser to the foundation .
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women .
About 184,450 cases and 40,930 deaths from the disease are expected in the United States this year .

As I ’ve gotten to know Scala better , I ’ve begun to appreciate its simple power in ways which have caught me by surprise .
When I picked up the language , I was expecting to be wowed by things like type inference and a more concise syntax .
I was n’t expecting to fall in love with Option .
The Option Monad
In case you do n’t know , Option is a class in the Scala core libraries .
It is what object - oriented developers would call “ a simple container ” .
It simply wraps around an instance of some type as specified in its type parameter .
A simple application would be in a naive integer division function :
def div ( a : Int ) ( b : Int ) : Option [ Int ] = if ( b <= 0 ) None else if ( a < b )
Some ( 0 ) else Some ( 1 + div ( a - b ) ( b ) . get )
Pretty straightforward stuff .
This method repeatedly subtracts the dividend by the divisor until it is strictly less than the divisor .
Of course , the fact that I wrote this as a pure function using currying , recursion and complex expressions obfuscates the meaning somewhat , but you get the drift .
What ’s really interesting here is the use of Option to encapsulate the result .
Here ’s how we could use this method to perform some useful ( ? ) calculations :
div ( 25 ) ( 5 ) // => Some ( 5 ) div ( 150 ) ( 2 ) // => Some ( 75 ) div ( 13 ) ( 4 ) // => Some(3 )
Nothing earth - shattering in the mathematical realm , but it provides a useful illustration .
Each return value is wrapped in an instance of class Some , which is a subclass of Option .
This does n’t seem very useful until we consider what happens when we try to divide values which break the algorithm :
div ( 13 ) ( 0 ) // =>
None div ( 25 ) ( - 5 ) // =>
None
Instead of getting an integer result wrapped in an enclosing class , we get an instance of a totally different class which does n’t appear to encapsulate any value at all .
None is still a subclass of Option , but unlike Some it does not represent any specific value .
In fact , it would be more accurate to say that it represents the absence of a value .
This makes a lot of sense seeing as there really is no sane value for the first computation , and the second is simply incomputable with the given algorithm .
Retrieving a value from an instance of Option can be done in one of two ways .
The first technique is demonstrated in the div method itself ( calling the no-args get method ) .
This is nice because it ’s terse , but it ’s not really the preferred way of doing things .
After all , what happens if the value in question is actually an instance of None ?
( the answer is : Scala throws an exception )
This really does n’t seem all that compelling as a means of encapsulating return values .
That is why pattern matching is more frequently employed :
div ( 13 ) ( 0 ) match { case Some ( x ) => println ( x ) case None => println ( " Problems " ) } // => prints " Problems " div ( 25 ) ( 5 ) match { case Some ( x ) => println ( x ) case None => println ( " Problems " ) } // => prints " 5 "
Pattern matching allows us to deconstruct Option values in a type - safe manner without the risk of trying to access a value which really is n’t there .
Granted , the pattern matching syntax is a bit more verbose than just calling a get polymorphically , but it ’s more about the principle of the thing .
It ’s easy to see how this could be quite elegant in a non-trivial example .
Compared to null
This is very similar to a common pattern in C++ and Java .
Often times a method needs to return either a value or nothing , depending on various conditions .
More importantly , some internal state may be uninitialized , so a common “ default ” value for this state would be null .
Consider the following lazy initialization :
public class Example { private String value ; public String getValue ( ) { if ( value == null ) { value = query Database ( ) ; } return value ; } } // ... Example ex = new Example ( ) ; System . out .
println ( ex. getValue ( ) ) ;
Well , that ’s all well and good , but there ’s two problems with this code .
Number one , there ’s always the potential for stray null pointer exceptions .
This is certainly less of a concern in Java than it was back in the days of C and C++ , but they still can be annoying .
However , let ’s just assume that we ’re all good programmers and we always check potentially - null values prior to use , there ’s still the problem of primitive types .
Let ’s change our example just a bit to see where this causes issues :
public class Example { private int value ; public int getValue ( ) { if ( value == ??? ) { // er...? value = queryDatabase ( ) ; } return value ; } } // ... Example ex = new Example ( ) ; System . out .
println ( ex. getValue ( ) ) ;
If you ’re following along at home , your compiler will probably complain at this point saying that what you just wrote was not valid Java .
If your compiler did n’t complain , then you have some more serious issues that need to be addressed .
Primitive values cannot be valued as null because they are true primitives ( an int is actually a bona - fide integer value sitting in a register somewhere at the hardware level ) .
This too is a holdover from the days of C and C++ , but it ’s something we have to deal with .
One of the consequences of this is that there is no reasonable “ non-value ” for primitive types .
Many people have tried clever little tricks to get around this , but most of them lead to horrible and strange results :
public class Example { private Integer value = null ; public int getValue ( ) { // forgot to init ... return value ; } }
This code will fail at runtime with a NullPointerException oddly originating from the return statement in getValue ( ) .
I ca n’t tell you how many times I ’ve spent hours sifting through code I thought was perfectly safe before finally isolating a stray null value which the compiler happily attempted to autobox .
It ’s worth briefly mentioning that a common “ non-value ” for integers is something negative , but this breaks down when you can have legitimate values which fall into that range .
In short , there ’s really no silver bullet within the Java language , so we have to turn elsewhere for inspiration .
Option in Java
I was actually working on an algorithm recently which required just such a solution .
In this case , the primitive value was a boolean , so there was n’t even a conventional non-value to jump to .
I hemmed and hawed for a while before eventually deciding to implement a simple Option monad within Java .
The rest of the API is remarkably functional for something written in Java ( immutable state everywhere ) , so I figured that a few monadic types would feel right at home .
Here ’s what I came up with :
public interface Option < T> { public T get ( ) ; } public final class Some < T> implements Option < T> { private final T value ; public Some ( T value ) { this .
value = value ; } public T get ( ) { return value ; } } public final class None < T > implements Option < T> { public None ( ) { } public T get ( ) { throw new UnsupportedOperationException ( " Cannot resolve value on None " ) ; } }
The usage for this code looks like this :
public class Example { private Option < Boolean > value = new None < Boolean > ( ) ; public boolean getValue ( ) { if ( value instanceof None ) { value = query Database ( ) ; } return value .
get ( ) ; } }
Once again , Java has demonstrated how needlessly verbose and annoying its syntax can be .
In case you were wondering , the generics are necessary on None primarily because Java has such a poor type system .
Effectively , null is an untyped value which may be assigned to any class type .
Java has no concept of a Nothing type which is a subtype of anything .
Thus , there ’s no way to provide a default parameterization for None and the developer must specify .
Now this is certainly not the cleanest API we could have written and it ’s definitely not a very good demonstration of how monads can be applied to Java , but it gets the job done .
If you ’re interested , there ’s a lot of good information out there on how do do something like this better .
The point was not to create a pure monad though , the point was to create something that solved the problem at hand .
Conclusion
Once you start thinking about structuring your code to use Option in languages which have built - in support for it , you ’ll find yourself dreaming about such patterns in other , less fortunate languages .
It ’s really sort of bizarre how much this little device can open your mind to new possibilities .
Take my code , and give it a try in your project .
Better yet , implement something on your own which solves the problem more elegantly !
The stodgy old Java “ best practices ” could use a little fresh air .

One of the challenges in understanding privacy is how to square what people say about privacy with what they actually do .
People say they care deeply about privacy and resent unexpected commercial use of information about them ; but they happily give that same information to companies likely to use and sell it .
If people value their privacy so highly , why do they sell it for next to nothing ?
To put it another way , people say they want more privacy than the market is producing .
Why is this ?
One explanation is that actions speak louder than words , people do n’t really want privacy very much ( despite what they say ) , and the market is producing an efficient level of privacy .
But there ’s another possibility : perhaps a market failure is causing underproduction of privacy .
Why might this be ?
A recent Slate essay by Reihan Salam gives a clue .
Salam talks about the quandry faced by companies like the financial - management site Wesabe .
A new company building up its business wants to reassure customers that their information will be treated with the utmost case .
But later , when the company is big , it will want to monetize the same customer information .
Salam argues that these forces are in tension and few if any companies will be able to stick with their early promises to not be evil .
What customers want , of course , is not good intentions but a solid commitment from a company that it will stay privacy - friendly as it grows .
The problem is that there ’s no good way for a company to make such a commitment .
In principle , a company could make an ironclad legal commitment , written into a contract with customers .
But in practice customers will have a hard time deciphering such a contract and figuring out how much it actually protects them .
Is the contract enforceable ?
Are there loopholes ?
The average customer wo n’t have a clue .
He ’ll do what he usually does with a long website contract : glance briefly at it , then shrug and click “ Accept ” .
An alternative to contracts is signaling .
A company will say , repeatedly , that its intentions are pure .
It will appoint the right people to its advisory board and send its executives to say the right things at the right conferences .
It will take conspicuous , almost extravagant steps to be privacy - friendly .
This is all fine as far as it goes , but these signals are a poor substitute for a real commitment .
They are n’t too difficult to fake .
And even if the signals are backed by the best of intentions , everything could change in an instant if the company is acquired – a new management team might not share the original team ’s commitment to privacy .
Indeed , if management ’s passion for privacy is holding down revenue , such an acquisition will be especially likely .
There ’s an obvious market failure here .
If we postulate that at least some customers want to use web services that come with strong privacy commitments ( and are willing to pay the appropriate premium for them ) , it ’s hard to see how the market can provide what they want .
Companies can signal a commitment to privacy , but those signals will be unreliable so customers wo n’t be willing to pay much for them – which will leave the companies with little incentive to actually protect privacy .
The market will underproduce privacy .
How big a problem is this ?
It depends on how many customers would be willing to pay a premium for privacy – a premium big enough to replace the revenue from monetizing customer information .
How many customers would be willing to pay this much ?
I do n’t know .
But I do know that people might care a lot about privacy , even if they ’re not paying for privacy today .
... but if entity B only pays taxes on what they consume rather than what others consume , thats cool .

A judge has criticised the treatment of a man who was held in custody for nearly three weeks on minor charges , saying it seemed “ totally improper ” .
Judge Tony Couch convicted and discharged Dale Wetere , 35 , unemployed , in Timaru District Court today , telling him he intended to follow up his case .
Wetere had admitted threatening and abusing Rotorua airport staff after missing his flight to the South Island on March 27 .
He pleaded guilty in Rotorua District Court the following day and had been in custody ever since .
Judge Couch told
Wetere he deserved no further penalty , convicting and discharging him on charges of disorderly behaviour and resisting police .
Told he was too late to board his flight to Timaru , Wetere warned a woman staff member at the airport he would “ do them over ” if he missed the plane .
He said he “ knew their names ” .
Wetere became agitated when he learned he had missed the flight , the gate was closed , and his aircraft was leaving .
After a tirade of abuse , the woman staff member felt threatened and retreated to a secure area behind the counter .
Another staff member tried to help Wetere , but was also threatened and abused .
She called police .
Wetere also verbally abused a pilot and police , who had to handcuff him on the ground in front a large group of air passengers and airport visitors .
Rotorua Justices of the Peace remanded Wetere in custody for sentencing in Timaru , after they learned he had no accommodation in Rotorua and no money .
In court today , Judge Couch said he was “ totally at a loss to understand ” why Wetere had been held in custody .
He was not facing any other charges and the charges he had pleaded to were only finable offences .
Judge Couch asked Wetere why he had been remanded in custody and was told that Wetere had “ no fix abode ” in the North Island , but a brother in Timaru .
Judge Couch asked police prosecutor Sergeant Geoff McCrostie why Wetere was held in custody .
Mr McCrostie said he had no file on Wetere .
Judge Couch said he saw nothing in the summary of facts to justify imprisonment and noted Wetere had been in custody since March 28 .
“ It seems to me something totally improper has happened here , ” Judge Couch said .
“ This should have been dealt with on the spot . ”
He told Wetere he would be convicted and discharged on both counts and he was free to go .
“ You have my assurance Mr Wetere , I ’m going to follow this up it seems on the face of it this has been totally improper . ”
Wetere showed no emotion as he hastily left the court .

Turns out that the surface of Mars is stiffer and colder than previously thought .
New observations from NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter indicate that any liquid water that might exist below the planet 's surface and any possible organisms living in that water would be located deeper than scientists had suspected .
NASA made the discovery was using the Shallow Radar ( SHARAD ) instrument on the Orbiter , which revealed long , continuous layers stretching up to 600 miles or about one - fifth the length of the United States .
The radar pictures show a smooth , flat border between the ice cap and the rocky Martian crust , NASA said .
On Earth , the weight of a similar stack of ice would cause the planet 's surface to sag .
The fact that the Martian surface is not bending means that its strong outer shell , or lithosphere , a combination of its crust and upper mantle , must be very thick and cold .
" The lithosphere of a planet is the rigid part .
On Earth , the lithosphere is the part that breaks during an earthquake , " said Suzanne Smrekar , deputy project scientist for Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter at JPL in a release .
Temperatures in the outer portion of a rocky planet like Mars increase with depth toward the interior .
The thicker the lithosphere , the more gradually the temperatures increase .
The discovery of a thicker Martian lithosphere therefore implies that any liquid water lurking in aquifers below the surface would have to be deeper than previously calculated , where temperatures are warmer .
Scientists speculate that any life on Mars associated with deep aquifers also would have to be buried deeper in the interior .
The radar pictures also reveal four zones of finely spaced layers of ice and dust separated by thick layers of nearly pure ice .
Scientists think this pattern of thick ice - free layers represents cycles of climate change on Mars on a time scale of roughly one million years , NASA said .
The observations support the idea that the north polar ice cap is geologically active and relatively young , at about 4 million years .
More news from Mars is expected this month as NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander is scheduled to touch down on May 25 not far from the north polar ice cap .
It will further investigate the history of water on Mars , and is expected to get the first up close look at ice on the Red Planet .
NASA said Phoenix will enter the top of the Martian atmosphere at almost 13,000 mph .
In seven minutes , the spacecraft must complete a challenging sequence of events to slow to about 5 mph before its three legs reach the ground .
Confirmation of the landing could come as early as 7:53 p.m. EDT .
" This is not a trip to grandma 's house .
Putting a spacecraft safely on Mars is hard and risky , " said Ed Weiler , associate administrator for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
" Internationally , fewer than half the attempts have succeeded . "
Thin pipelines and a loss of patent protection is hurting big drugs firms
US drugs giant Pfizer posted an 18 % drop in profits for the first three months of 2008 after competition from cheaper patent free products .
The New York - based firm 's net income fell to $ 2.78 bn ( £ 1.4bn ) , from $ 3.39bn in the January to March period .
It blamed the loss of US patent protection to sell blockbuster blood - pressure drug Norvasc and allergy relief medicine Zyrtec .
The loss of exclusivity for key drugs is a concern across the sector .
Pfizer also nursed a worse - than - expected sales decline of flagship cholesterol fighter Lipitor , which generated $ 300 m less revenue than some analysts were expecting .
It insisted that it would meet its previously stated profit targets for the year , helped by a massive cost - cutting programme that has already seen 10,000 jobs go .
The firm 's poor performance came despite a boost from the weak dollar which makes sales abroad more valuable .
Shares in the company dropped 3.3 % to $ 20.4 , topping the losers on the benchmark Dow Jones index , which closed virtually unchanged in New York , up 1.2 points .

An ex-coworker of mine who was always an asshole to me ended up doing almost the exact same thing , except he was on mushrooms .
He was laying face - down , naked , in the middle of a busy intersection .
When the cops tried to get him off the street , he dead - weighted , so one of the cops who showed up dragged him face - down on the asphalt by his legs !
... and after it was all over , my ex-coworker STILL HAD his job !
The mounting U.S. drug price crisis can be contained and eventually reversed by separating drug discovery from drug marketing and by establishing a non-profit company to oversee funding for new medicines , according to two MIT experts on the pharmaceutical industry .
Stan Finkelstein , M.D. , senior research scientist in MIT 's Engineering Systems Division , and Peter Temin , Elisha Gray II Professor of Economics , present their research and detail their proposal in their new book , " Reasonable Rx : Solving the Drug Price Crisis , " published by Financial Times Press .
Finkelstein and Temin address immediate national problems -- the rising cost of available medicines , the high cost of innovation and the ' blockbuster ' method of selecting drugs for development -- and predict worsening new ones , unless bold steps are taken .
" Drug prices in the United States are higher than anywhere else in the world .
Right now , the revenues from those drugs finance research and development of new drugs .
We propose to reduce prices , not at the expense of innovation , but by changing the way innovation is financed , " said Temin , also the author of " Taking Your Medicine : Drug Regulation in the US . "
" Nationally , if we keep the current structure , in 50 years only hedge fund managers will be able to afford prescription drugs .
Drug development will focus on therapies for those small groups of people who can pay a thousand dollars a pill .
With income distribution widening and insurance carriers already refusing some coverage , this would be a disaster , " said Temin .
" Prescription drugs have been left out of previous efforts to reform the delivery of health care .
New initiatives to expand coverage must include a plan to reduce the high cost of drugs , " Finkelstein added .
The book , which draws on the researchers ' expertise in the realms of medicine and economics , proposes eliminating the linkage between drug prices and the cost of drug discovery while financing innovation and addressing the needs of society .
Their first bold step is conceptual , recognizing that we all have a critical stake in the products of pharmaceutical research .
Next , drawing on recent history , they propose dividing drug companies into drug discovery / development firms and drug marketing / distribution firms , just as electric utility firms were separated into generation and distribution companies in the 1990s .
Following the utility model , Finkelstein and Temin propose establishing an independent , public , non-profit Drug Development Corporation ( DDC ) , which would act as an intermediary between the two new industry segments -- just as the electric grid acts as an intermediary between energy generators and distributors .
The DDC also would serve as a mechanism for prioritizing drugs for development , noted Finkelstein .
" It is a two - level program in which scientists and other experts would recommend to decision - makers which kinds of drugs to fund the most .
This would insulate development decisions from the political winds , " he said .
Finkelstein and Temin's plan would also insulate drug development from the blockbuster mentality , which drives companies to invest in discovering a billion - dollar drug to offset their costs .
An example of the blockbuster mentality is developing a new drug for hypertension , one that varies only slightly from those already on the market , but that can bring in huge profits if aggressively marketed .
For Finkelstein , a physician , and Temin , an economist , societal needs for medicines are swiftly extending beyond national boundaries : Diseases affecting the developing world -- afflicting people too poor to make drug development attractive for businesses -- will soon affect health inside the United States .
" Global travel and climate change both require that U.S. drug development and innovation policy rethink the way drugs are developed , and for whom .
Air travel , migrations , a global workforce -- all these mean unusual diseases could become usual here , " Temin noted .
Climate change also may affect drugs their proposed DDC would select for funding .
" Especially in the southern states , tropical diseases are likely to increase with global warming , and people will need treatments for them .
In our plan , the DDC would encourage research in advance of the market - and , we hope , in advance of disaster , " he said .

REM Take Away
Alt rock icons R.E.M. have had their share of clumsy release lately , more exactly in the last 10 years since former drummer Bill left the band .
Now with their new album Accelerate , the Georgian trio intendeds to get back on the saddle and taste again some of that late ’ 80s success .
After all Accelerate is a return to the roots records , so all odds are in their favor , that is if things did n’t change a bit in the last 20 years and well they have .
Anyway , the band did a very good job at the latest edition of La Blogotheque ‘s Take Away Show , where they played six new songs from the new album , in acoustic mode .
The band , consisting of Michael Stipe , Peter Buck , and Mike Mills , where filmed in their hometown of Athens , Ga. , by the new notorious Vincent Moon , in his characteristic cinematic and lighting vision .
I was particularly impressed by the trio ’s live rendition of “ Until the Day Is Done , ” a acoustic song from Accelerate that matched perfectly the Take Away Show ’s format .
Then there ’s “ Living Well is the Best Revenge , ” an acoustic song performed in a station wagon , very fun , although it does n’t beat this or this .
Bellow you can watch two of the six videos , the rest at The Take Away Show .
MILAN ( Reuters ) - Double amputee Oscar Pistorius can try to qualify for the Beijing Olympics after winning his appeal against a ban at the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) , the South African said on Friday .
Oscar Pistorius of South Africa runs in the men's 400 meters during the British Grand Prix athletics meet at the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield , England July 15 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Eddie Keogh
The International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) ruled in January that runner Pistorius could not compete with able - bodied athletes because the carbon - fiber blades attached to both legs gave him an advantage .
The 21 year - old appealed to CAS , which ruled in his favor on Friday following a hearing with various scientists at the end of last month .
“ I do n’t think ‘ really happy ’ describes it .
I ’m ecstatic .
The battle has been going on for far too long .
It is a victory for sports in general .
I think this day will go down in history , ” Pistorius told a news conference in Milan , where his lawyers are based .
“ Now I can definitely say the truth has come out .
I have the opportunity once again to chase my dream of the Olympics , if not 2008 , in 2012 . ”
He confirmed he would run in able - bodied races in Milan on July 2 and at the Rome Golden Gala on July 11 , where he competed last year and endeared himself to Italian fans .
The 400 meters will be his main target but he is realistic about his chances of making the Aug 8 - 24 Games with the qualifying deadline in late July .
“ I ’ve missed the whole South African season .
The time period is very short .
It ’s going to be very difficult for me to qualify ( for the able - bodied Games ) , ” he said .
J-SHAPED BLADES
He could run in the relay in Beijing without a sufficient individual time but is not holding out much hope with South Africa ’s 4x400 m team struggling to qualify .
Pistorius , who won gold in the 200 meters and bronze in the 100 meters at the 2004 Athens Paralympics , was emphatic that he would compete in this year ’s Paralympics in September whether he qualified for the able - bodied Games or not .
His coach Ampie Louw was delighted by the ruling .
“ You want to cry and still even now you feel a bit emotional about it and it must sink in to say this is real and the ban is lifted , ” he said .
Swiss - based CAS , the world ’s top sports court , said in a statement that the IAAF had not proved competition rules had been contravened by his J - shaped blades .
“ On the basis of the evidence brought by the experts called by both parties , the panel was not persuaded that there was sufficient evidence of any metabolic advantage in favor of the double amputee using the Cheetah Flex - Foot , ” the statement said .
The IAAF welcomed the decision and said more research needed to be conducted into the effects of prostheses .
“ The IAAF accepts the decision of CAS , and Oscar will be welcomed wherever he competes this summer , ” a statement said .
“ He is an inspirational man and we look forward to admiring his achievements in the future . ”
Canadian world indoor 400 meters champion Tyler Christopher said he would have no problem competing with Pistorius .
“ I do n’t see it a bad thing , ” Christopher told Reuters via telephone from Edmonton .
“ If he is capable of running with us , then great .
That ’s awesome .
I would not have a problem at all ( running with him ) .
“ If there was something that showed he was at an advantage and capable of running ( a world record ) 41 seconds , then maybe we might have a problem , ” Christopher added .
“ But if there ’s not a clear advantage to him , let ’s run , let ’s race . ”

But white centers are statistical ties .
News from the Votemaster
Is Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) a liberal ?
Is Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) a moderate ?
What about the other 98 senators ?
Where do they fit on the ideological spectrum ?
Let 's look at some numbers .
Hundreds of interest groups rate all members of Congress on how they vote on bills of special importance to them .
If you vote with them all the time , you get a 100 % rating .
If you vote against them all the time , you get a 0 % rating .
These numbers are then distributed to their membership in an attempt to get members to vote for good members of Congress and against bad ones .
These ratings give us a tool to rate all the senators ( there are too many House members to do this unless I can find a volunteer ) .
Below seven representative liberal groups have been chosen and their ratings of all the senators given .
The last column is the mean value .
If you are a liberal , a high score is good ( always votes correctly ) .
If you are a conservative , a low score is good ( never sucked in by that liberal stuff ) .
There are many noteworthy items to be found here .
To start with , it is all blue on top and all red on the bottom ( with senators Sanders and Lieberman counting as honorary Democrats since they caucus with the Democrats ) .
With three exceptions , all Republicans are less liberal than the most conservative Democrat , Sen. Tim Johnson ( D - SD ) .
The three exceptions are the two ladies from Maine , Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) and Sen. Susan Collins ( R - ME ) , who are strongly pro-choice .
If NARAL and abortion were not in the list , they would drop dramatically .
The other Republican who floated to the top is Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , who , unlike John McCain , really is a maverick .
To start with , the Senate is incredibly polarized .
Younger readers may not believe this , but it was not always so .
In the 1950s and 1960s , the Senate was far less ideological .
Northern Republicans like Jacob Javits ( R - NY ) were actually quite liberal and southern Democrats like Sen.
James Eastland ( D - MS ) were still angry with the Republicans for freeing the slaves .
In those days , the great divide was north - south , not Democrats - Republicans .
Only when Richard Nixon began implementing his Southern strategy ( i.e. , using racism to win the votes of poor Southern whites ) did we get to the current polarization .
So , what about Obama , Clinton , and McCain ?
Obama at 80 % and Clinton at 82 % are ( 1 ) not far apart and ( 2 ) among the least liberal Democrats .
In contrast , John McCain at 9 % is one of the most conservative Republicans .
When McCain campaigned this year as a true conservative , he was telling the truth .
He is more conservative than Sen. Mitch McConnell ( R - KY ) , the minority leader , and more conservative than all the senators from Alabama , Mississippi , and Georgia , not known as hotbeds of liberalism .
Conclusion : when people say Obama and Clinton are liberals , that 's not true ; when people say McCain is a conservative , that is true .
That aside , there are some real anomalies here .
For example , Sen. Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) is quite liberal , more so than the Barbaras ( Boxer and Mikulski , both of whom are known as real firebrands ) .
But Sen. Tim Johnson ( D - SD ) is the most conservative Democrat , despite the demographics of the two states being pretty similar .
Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) , who is often referred to in the blogosphere as a crypto-Republican actually has a more liberal rating than the other senator from Connecticut , Chris Dodd , who ran for President as a liberal .
Among Republicans , Sen. Richard Lugar ( R - IN ) is one of the most liberal , despite coming from a rock - ribbed Republican state .
And Lugar 's record of being one of the Senate 's few grown - ups on foreign policy issues does not even play a role here .
And what about Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R ) of Utah ?
He ranks in the top quarter of Republicans .
Surprise .
One caveat : a different selection of interest groups would no doubt give a different ordering .
Still , this gives an indication .
If you want to play with the data yourself , it is available in .csv format .
A similar study of conservative groups is in the works and will be posted here in due course of time .
The table below is sorted on mean rating .
Additional ratings from other interest groups can be found at www.vote-smart.org.
The seven groups used in this study are :
For Sen. Roger Wicker ( R - MS ) , some of his votes were made as a House member before he was appointed to the Senate .

Here are the delegate totals from various news sources rounded to integers ( Democrats Abroad has 22 delegates , each with 1/2 vote ) .
The sources differ because in most caucus states , no delegates to the national conventions have been chosen yet , just delegates to the district , county , or state convention so there is some guesswork involved .
Furthermore , some of the unpledged delegates are elected at state conventions in May or June .
Finally , the PLEOs ( Party Leaders and Elected Officials ) sometimes waver and may tell different reporters slightly different stories that they interpret differently .

Baking soda nearly killed an elderly man .
He was using it to relieve the stomach pain caused by an ulcer , but went way overboard with the home remedy .
After slipping on a children 's toy , the retired gentleman could not get back up .
Paramedics transported him to Cooper Hospital in New Jersey .
En route , they noticed that he was short of breath and picking at his side for no apparent reason .
In the emergency room , the patient was completely incoherent .
He looked disheveled , underweight , and could not tell them what year it was .
Had he hit his head during the fall ?
They ran a battery of tests , including a CT scan , but there was no sign of a head injury .
However , the pH of his blood and urine were high – a condition called alkalosis .
In other words , his body fluids were way too basic .
Soon after the examination , he became very agitated and tore the heart - monitor electrodes off his chest and the I.V. from his arm .
To calm him down , the doctors gave him two doses of the tranquilizer Lorazepam .
It worked too well .
His breathing failed .
The medical staff intubated him .
Once the patient was stable , the doctors questioned his niece .
She had found several empty boxes of baking soda at his home and explained that her uncle , who lacked health insurance , had been using it to cope with severe indigestion .
With an understanding of what went wrong , the doctors gave the patient fluids and potassium , which invigorated his kidneys .
Slowly , the problem fixed itself .
In a note to The Journal of Emergency Medicine , Keyur Ajbani , Michael Chansky and Brigitte Baumann said that six days after his arrival , the elderly man could breathe without assistance .
The hospital released him with a prescription for proper ulcer medication .
In their report , which is available online , Ajbani , Chansky , and Baumann explained that they could have quickly brought the pH of their patient 's body fluids back down with injections of arginine hydrochloride or hydrochloric acid , but those procedures would have been risky .
Their advice :
When questioning patients about their medical history , be sure to ask if they are using any home remedies .
“ In my 38 years this has been the worst capital destruction and the worst rating decline in history , ” Robert L. Rodriguez , the chief executive of First Pacific Advisors , a mutual fund company based in Los Angeles , said to a panel of four executives from ratings firms .
“ All of you should be ashamed of yourself . ”
The lashing elicited scattered applause .
The panelists listened , their lips pursed .
Some then admitted making some mistakes but said most investors in top - rated triple - A securities would get their money back .
“ We all have heard a lot of criticism over the last several months , and some of that criticism is certainly justified , ” said Glenn Costello , co-head of the residential mortgage - backed securities group at Fitch Ratings .
But he added that a frequent criticism of ratings firms  that they are beholden to the investment banks and mortgage companies whose securities they rate  reflected “ a real lack of understanding of how we as ratings agencies go about doing what we do . ”
During another discussion , managers of much - maligned collateralized debt obligations  packages of bonds that are packages of other debt  criticized the media for what they said was negative coverage of the securities .
Most of the speakers on that panel asked that reporters be allowed in the session only if they did not directly quote their remarks or did so with their permission .
But other managers and bankers said investors and journalists were right to question why so much wealth was destroyed so quickly .
As for the view that some securities are trading at far lower prices than they deserved to be , Len Blum , a managing director at Westwood Capital , a boutique investment bank based in New York , said investors always overreacted to bad news , just as they overreacted to good news .
“ The market always paints with a broad brush , ” he said .
Another banker , Joseph M. Donovan , said the hand - wringing was overdone .
He said what ailed the market was clear , but added that solutions would take time .
In his estimation , defaults are highest in cases where lenders take too many risks because neither they nor borrowers have much to lose .
Mortgage companies sold the loans to Wall Street banks , and homeowners did not put any money down .
Mr. Donovan , a retired Credit Suisse executive , said the packagers of the securities and investors took false comfort from the diversity of loans backing their securities .
G.W. Bush Is a Criminal , Like His Dad Watching Attorney General Michael Mukasey evade the obvious fact that waterboarding is torture – and the reluctance of Democrats to press him – I was reminded of how the first President Bush got away with an earlier batch of national security crimes .

Printer friendly Indeed , one of the common questions I ’ve been asked over the years is – if the evidence really does show that the Reagan - Bush crowd was guilty of illegal dealings with Iran , Iraq and the Nicaraguan contras – why did n’t the Democrats hold those Republicans to account ?
For people who have posed that question , I would suggest that they watch the Senate Judiciary Committee ’s Jan. 30 hearing with Mukasey .
Everybody in the room knew what the unspoken reality was , but nobody dared say it : George W. Bush authorized torture , which is a crime under U.S. and international law .
However , if the Attorney General – the highest - ranking law - enforcement officer in the United States – recognized the obvious , he would have to either commence legal action against President Bush or send a referral to Congress for the initiation of impeachment proceedings .
If such a referral were sent to Congress , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would have little choice but to permit the start of impeachment hearings in the House Judiciary Committee .
A wide range of Bush ’s illegal actions would then begin spilling out , provoking a political crisis in the United States .
Not only do Bush ’s allies want to avoid that possibility but so do Democratic congressional leaders .
They fear an impeachment battle would boomerang , putting them on the spot with both angry Republicans and a hostile Washington news media .
On Dec. 20 , 2007 , Rep. John Conyers , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , told Amy Goodman on “ Democracy Now ” that impeachment hearings could end up like Watergate in reverse , with today ’s careerist press corps treating the notion of accountability for Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney like some kind of nutty idea .
“ There is a very stark reality that with the corporatization of the media , we could end up with turning people , who should be documented in history as making many profound errors and violating the Constitution , from villains into victims , ” the Michigan Democrat said .
So , Democratic senators were n’t all that upset when Mukasey mumbled through a variety of obfuscations .
Orwell Reference
At one point , Sen. Sheldon
Whitehouse , D - Rhode Island , even made a George Orwell reference in noting that Mukasey ’s discussion about the criminality of waterboarding had “ melted into the abstract . ”
Mukasey responded : “ We could engage in a discussion .
It would not be a concrete and factual discussion because we would be talking about if this , if that , if the other . ”
When Whitehouse called Mukasey ’s answer “ totally not credible ” because Bush administration officials already have acknowledged that CIA interrogators did use waterboarding against several terror suspects , Mukasey continued : “ All of that depends on whether certification was given and whether it was permissibly relied on and it should not turn on one person ’s current view of what the ( anti- torture ) statute requires or does n’t require . ”
Whitehouse , a former federal prosecutor , rejected that explanation too , noting that “ there is no Nuremberg defense built into the criminal statute , ” meaning that authorization from President Bush or some other senior official would not make torture legal .
However , Whitehouse , like other Democrats , finished his questioning with praise of Mukasey for taking a variety of steps to shield the Justice Department from the Bush administration ’s political pressure .
Still , on the most sensitive issue to Bush – his assertion that he possesses unlimited presidential powers that let him violate criminal laws and ignore constitutional protections – Mukasey was as much in lock step with the administration as his predecessor , Alberto Gonzales .
The only significant difference was that the more mature Mukasey , a former federal judge , was less smug in his treatment of the senators than Gonzales had been .
For their part , the committee Democrats seemed eager to look to the future .
“ So today we continue the restoration of the [ Justice ] Department , ” said Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont .
But that “ restoration ” apparently will not include holding the President and Vice President accountable for authorizing the commission of felonies – in permitting the torture of terror suspects , in ordering warrantless wiretaps of Americans , in exposing the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame , etc .
Not Good at Confrontation
The Democrats adopted a similar see - no - evil posture from late 1992 through the Clinton years when evidence surfaced about serious crimes committed by Ronald Reagan , George H.W. Bush and some of their subordinates .
Like Marty McFly ’s father in “ Back to the Future , ” the Democrats were n’t very good at “ confrontation . ”
So , when evidence implicated George H.W. Bush on issues ranging from the Iran - Contra cover - up and secret military support for Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein to Nicaraguan contra drug trafficking and a politically motivated search of Bill Clinton ’s passport files , the Democrats averted their eyes and slinked away from a fight .
In December 1992 and January 1993 , for instance , evidence poured in to a House task force that was investigating the so - called October Surprise controversy , whether the 1980 Reagan - Bush campaign had gone behind President Jimmy Carter ’s back and contacted Iranian mullahs while Iran was holding 52 Americans hostage .
Carter ’s failure to resolve that hostage crisis doomed his re-election and touched off Ronald Reagan ’s landslide victory .
Plus , Iran ’s release of the hostages as Reagan was taking the oath of office gave Reagan an aura of heroism that has continued to this day .
In a December 2007 campaign ad , Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani cited Reagan ’s supposed toughness with terrorists as the reason the Iranians suddenly freed the hostages after a 444 - day standoff .
“ They released the American hostages in one hour , and that should tell us a lot about these Islamic terrorists that we ’re facing ” today , Giuliani said .
“ The one hour in which they released them was the one hour in which Ronald Reagan was taking the oath of office as President of the United States .
“ The best way you deal with tyrants and terrorists , you stand up to them .
You do n’t back down . ”
[ NYT , Dec. 6 , 2007 ]
But the House task force was learning a different reality in December 1992 , as witnesses came forth and documents surfaced indicating that Reagan campaign operatives , including then vice presidential candidate George H.W. Bush , had engaged in their own secret diplomacy in 1980 , promising a swap of arms for the hostages .
Among this new evidence : -- Former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr sent the task force a detailed letter describing the Iranian infighting that had occurred around this Republican overture and how Iran ’s most radical elements favored a deal with the Reagan - Bush team .
-- The biographer for French intelligence chief Alexandre deMarenches recounted how deMarenches had confessed his role in arranging secret meetings in Paris , a statement that was corroborated by several other French intelligence operatives .
-- Former CIA officer Charles Cogan described a meeting in early 1981 at which Joseph Reed , an aide to banker David Rockefeller , boasted to then CIA Director William Casey about their success in thwarting President Carter ’s hoped - for October Surprise of a pre-election hostage release .
So Startling
The new evidence was so startling that the task force ’s chief counsel Lawrence Barcella approached chairman , Rep. Lee Hamilton , D - Indiana , with a request that the investigation be extended a few months so the new information could be evaluated .
Barcella told me during an interview in 2004 that Hamilton rejected the request for an extension .
The task force then finished up work on a report that reached the opposite conclusion from what the new evidence indicated .
The task force report claimed there was no credible evidence to support the long - standing allegations that the Reagan - Bush campaign had interfered with the 1980 hostage crisis .
The task force maintained this conclusion by hiding away much of the new evidence .
( I discovered some of this evidence in 1994 - 95 when I gained access to boxes containing the raw files of the task force . )
In January 1993 , however , there was one more surprise for the October Surprise task force .
After its report was already at the printers , the Russian government responded to an earlier request for information about what its intelligence files showed about secret U.S. contacts with Iran .
On Jan. 11 , 1993 , the U.S. Embassy in Moscow forwarded to Hamilton a translated version of the Russian report , which stated that Soviet intelligence was aware of secret meetings between Republicans and Iranian officials that had occurred in Madrid and Paris during the 1980 presidential campaign .
Among the Republican operatives menioned by the Russians were George H.W. Bush , William Casey and Robert Gates , who was then a senior CIA official and who is now U.S. Defense Secretary .
The Russian report flatly contradicted the findings of the House task force , which were to be released two days later , on Jan. 13 , 1993 .
Despite this extraordinary example of Russian - U.S. cooperation – and the stunning assertions of Republican guilt – Hamilton ’s task force simply stuffed the Russian report into one of the file boxes .
There was no mention of the Russian report or other contradictory evidence when the task force report was issued , or when Hamilton wrote a New York Times op - ed entitled “ Case Closed , ” which relegated the October Surprise suspicions to the loony bin of conspiracy theories .
In 2004 , I asked Barcella about the Russian report and why it had n’t been released .
He explained that it was a classified document and that the task force decided not to undertake the necessary steps to arrange for its declassification .
A more likely explanation was that the Democrats wanted to avoid a nasty fight with Republicans over the Reagan - Bush legacy .
In early 1993 , the Democrats , especially President Bill Clinton , saw a battle over history as a distraction from his domestic priorities .
[ For details , see Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
Clinton adopted a tolerant attitude , too , toward George H.W. Bush ’s unprecedented decision on Christmas Eve 1992 to pardon six Iran - Contra defendants ( another scandal which implicated Bush and could be viewed as a sequel to the October Surprise case ) .
Clinton was equally disinterested when new evidence emerged in 1996 about Bush ’s role in the Iraq - gate arming of Saddam Hussein , and in 1998 when the CIA ’s inspector general compiled damning evidence on how the Reagan - Bush administration had protected drug traffickers linked to the Nicaraguan contras .
Instead of demanding the truth about these crimes and holding people accountable , the Clinton administration found it easier to sweep these unpleasant matters under the rug .
One of Clinton ’s rewards was a cozy relationship with the senior George Bush .
Now , the congressional Democrats seem to taking a similarly permissive approach toward the crimes of the junior George Bush .

The Twilight of Irredeemable Debt Antal E. Fekete Gold Standard University Wagner�s opera Gotterd�mmerung is about the twighlight of pagan gods .
The most powerful of the latter - day pagan gods that has been guiding the destinies of humanity for the past two - score of years is Irredeemable Debt .
Before August 14 , 1971 , debts were obligations , and the word �bond� was to mean literally what it said : the opposite of freedom .
The privilege of issuing debt had a countervailing responsibility : that of repayment .
On that fateful day all that was changed by a stroke of the pen .
President Nixon embraced the woolly theory of Milton Friedman and declared the irredeemable dollar a Monad , that is , a thing that exists in and of itself .
According to this theory the government has the power to create irredeemable debt ― debt that never needs to be repaid yet will not lose its value ― subject only to a �quantity rule� , e.g. , it must not be increased by more than 3 percent annually .
This idea is so preposterously silly that �only very learned men could have thought of it� .
If the thief is thieving modestly , then he will not be detected .
It never occurred to the professors of economics and financial journalists that a modest thief is an oxymoron , a contradiction in terms .
How did they get to believing in irredeemable debt ?
The explanation is most likely found in Schiller�s dictum : � Anyone taken as an individual is tolerably sensible and reasonable .
But taken as a member of a crowd ― he at once becomes a blockhead� .
Economics professors and financial journalists are no exception .
For a time it appeared that Milton Friedman was right .
The world has become dedicated to the proposition that it is possible , even desirable , to expand irredeemable debt in order to make the economy prosper .
Never mind the default of the U.S. government on its bonded debt held by foreigners .
Never mind people victimized by theft .
Thanks to the quantity rule , they will never notice the difference .
For all its seductive attractiveness Friedmanite economics is ignoring the effect of irredeemable debt on productivity .
It watches debt per GDP and is happy as long as this ratio stays below 100 percent by a fair amount .
However , what should be watched is the ratio of additional debt to additional GDP .
By that indicator the patient�s condition could be diagnosed as that of pernicious anemia .
It set in immediately after the dollar debt in the world was converted into irredeemable debt .
The increase in GDP brought about by the addition of $ 1 of new debt to the economy is called the marginal productivity of debt .
That ratio is the only one that matters in judging the quality of debt .
After all , the purpose of contracting debt is to increase productivity .
If debt volume rises faster than national income , there is big trouble is brewing , but only the marginal productivity of debt is capable of revealing it .
Before 1971 the introduction of $ 1 new debt used to increase the GDP by as much as $ 3 or more .
Since 1971 this ratio started its precipitous decline that has continued to this day without interruption .
It went negative in 2006 , forecasting the financial crisis that broke a year later .
The reason for the decline is that irredeemable debt causes capital destruction .
It adds nothing to the per capita quota of capital invested in aid of production .
Indeed , it may take away from it .
As it displaces real capital which represents the deployment of more and better tools , productivity declines .
The laws of physics , unlike human beings , cannot be conned .
Irredeemable debt may only create make - belief capital .
By confusing capital and credit , Friedmanite economics obliterates truth .
It makes the cost of running the merry - go - round of debt - breeding disappear .
It makes capital destruction invisible .
The stock of accumulated capital supporting world production , large as it may be , is not inexhaustible .
When it is exhausted , the music stops and the merry - go - round comes to a screechy halt .
It does not happen everywhere all at the same time , but it will happen everywhere sooner or later .
When it does , Swissair falls out of the sky , Enron goes belly - up , and Bear - Sterns caves in .
The marginal productivity of debt is an unimaginative taskmaster .
It insists that new debt be justified by a minimum increase in the GDP .
Otherwise capital destruction follows ― a most vicious process .
At first , there are no signs of trouble .
If anything the picture looks rosier than ever .
But the seeds of destruction inevitably , if invisibly , have sprouted and will at one point paralyze further growth and production .
To deny this is tantamount to denying the most fundamental law of the universe : the Law of Conservation of Energy and Matter .
The captains of the banking system in effect deny and defy that basic law .
They are leading a blind crowd of mesmerized people to the brink where momentum may sweep most of them into the abyss to their financial destruction .
Yet not one university in the world has issued a warning , and not one court of justice allowed indictments to be heard from individuals and institutions charging that the issuance of irredeemable debt is a crude form of fraud , calling for the punishment of the swindlers issuing it , whether they are in the Treasury or in the central bank .
The behavior of universities and courts in this regard could not be more reprehensible .
Rather than acting to protect the weak , they act to cover up plundering by the mighty .
The inconspicuous beginnings of irredeemable debt have blossomed into a colossal edifice , a fantastic debt tower that is bound to topple upon the prevailing complacency and apathy .
Actually �tower� is a misnomer .
Rather , what we have is an inverted pyramid , a vast and expanding superstructure precariously balanced on a tiny and ever - shrinking gold foundation ― the only asset in existence with power to reduce gross debt .
The construction has no precedent in history , and no place in theory , whether Ricardian , Walrasian , Marxian , Keynesian or Austrian .
As a matter of fact , no one is analyzing the process .
Research has been placed under taboo by the powers that be , lest diagnosis reveal the presence of cancer caused by irredeemability .
There is no known pattern or model that would apply to its mechanism in terms of equilibrium analysis .
Two negative conclusions emerge .
One is that the edifice of irredeemable debt must grow at an accelerating pace as markets for derivatives providing �insurance� to holders of debt proliferate .
The insurer of debt must also be insured , as must the insurer of the insurers , and so on , ad infinitum .
This is due to the fact that the risk of collapsing bond values has been created by man .
In contrast , the risk of price changes of agricultural commodities are created by nature , and the futures market provide insurance , with no need to re-insure .
The other conclusion is that the unwieldy size of the debt structure excludes the possibility of a normal correction : a major liquidation would dwarf the calamities of the Great Depression .
It is a delusion to think that the government can splatter debt all over the economic landscape to cover up its warts , and reap everlasting prosperity as a result .
The stimulation and leverage of debt has always caused stock markets to boom , so that the impact of debt was aided and magnified by the added paper wealth which , in turn , increased the propensity to spend and borrow still more .
Businessmen are supposed to be more realistic in contracting debt .
Yet the pattern of increase in corporate debt has also changed tremendously .
Whereas traditionally corporations used to finance their capital needs in a ratio of $ 3 in debt for every $ 1 in stock , in the years leading up to 1971 they issued $ 20 in debt for every $ 1 in stock , with the ratio sky - rocketing thereafter .
We hear arguments that economists have by now learned how to control the economy with the so - called built - in stabilizers .
Debt has largely lost its sting as a consequence , we are told .
For example , bank deposits can now be insured .
They couldn�t in the 1930�s .
But when the government itself is loaded with debt , and runs boom - time deficits , the built - in stabilizers may backfire and destabilize the economy further .
The government has commitments so great that its endeavor to offset a depression in our vast economy can only result in a loss of confidence .
Anxious withholding of purchasing power in the private sector could far outweigh anything the government can add .
To make matters worse , government income is highly dependent on a prosperous economy .
The magnitude of the problem of offsetting a depression is grossly disproportionate to resources available .
One of the marks of great delusions is that nearly everyone tends to share them .
It is a sorry tale ― any delusion gives rise to a rude awakening in due course .
Public attitudes to debt have changed so radically since 1971 that today indebtedness is practically a status symbol , instead of a shameful condition it used to be in a by - gone era .
The most striking reversal in traditional American attitudes towards debt is the widespread acceptance of perpetual national indebtedness , copied by perpetual personal indebtedness ― a never - ending lien on future income .
Perhaps the worst aspect of the regime of irredeemable debt is the lowest level of morals followed by governments in modern history .
It is epitomized by an elaborate check - kiting conspiracy between the U.S : Treasury and the Federal Reserve .
Treasury bonds , contrary to appearances , are no more redeemable than Federal Reserve notes .
It �s all very neat : the notes are backed by the bonds , and the bonds are redeemable by the notes .
Therefore each is valued in terms of itself , rather than by an independent outside asset .
Each is an irredeemable liability of the U.S : government .
The whole scheme boils down to a farce .
It is check - kiting at the highest level .
At maturity the bonds are replaced by another with a more distant maturity date , or they are ostensibly paid in the form of irredeemable currency .
The issuer of either type of debt is usurping a privilege without accepting the countervailing duty .
They issue obligations without taking any further responsibility for their fate or for the effect they have on the economy .
Moreover , a double standard of justice is involved .
Check - kiting is a crime under the Criminal Code .
That is , provided that it is perpetrated by private individuals .
Practiced at the highest level , check - kiting is the corner - stone of the monetary system .
But our world is still one of crime and punishment , tolerating no double standard .
The twilight of irredeemable debt is upon us .
The sign is that banks are reluctant to take the promissory notes of one another .
Significantly , this also includes overnight drafts .
The banks know there is bad debt at large , and they don�t want to be victimized by taking in some inadvertently .
What the banks don�t yet know , but will soon learn , is that all irredeemable debt is bad debt , and there is no way to rid the system of poison through administering more .
Redeemability of debt is not a superfluous embellishment .
It has a function of fundamental importance : the proper allocation of resources to the different channels of their utilization .
The obligation to redeem debt hangs as the sword of Damocles over the government , just as it does over the head of every economic participant .
It compels economy and foresight .
It forces balancing of income and expenditures .
It adjusts claims and commitments .
It limits expansion by shifting resources away from the incompetent , and away from unhealthy projects .
The regime of irredeemable debt creates an escape route from commitments by the promise of eliminating the pressure of solvency .
Whether it promises eternal prosperity , or it promises eternal subsidies , it does not matter .
The results are the same .
They consist in misleading people , enticing them to skate on thin ice , and luring them into financial adventures , private or public , which are not warranted by the ability to pay .
The logical consequence is wholesale bankruptcy of individuals as well as that of the political setup .
Losses breed more losses , until they become an avalanche .
The present crisis is just the first sign of that denouement .
More is on the way .
It is still possible to escape the catastrophe which this process would entail .
The way out is to open the U.S.
Mint to gold and silver , as advocated by presidential candidate Dr. Ron Paul .
The logic of this remedy is that it would mobilize potentially unlimited resources , presently tied up in idled gold , and re-introduce the indispensable means of debt - retirement into the economy .
Failing to bring gold back , where are we heading ?
The short answer is : we are marching into the death - valley of collectivism .
The alternative to re-introducing redeemable currency is that the debt - behemoth will force the imposition of a capital - levy type of taxation ― � la Solon , 594 B.C. April 27 , 2008 .

Woman calls 911 because Burger King wo n’t make her a cheeseburger

“ Send a deputy over here !
I thought you were supposed to protect me ! ”
But now medical technology has caught up with exercise lore .
Researchers in Germany , using advances in neuroscience , report in the current issue of the journal Cerebral Cortex that the folk belief is true : Running does elicit a flood of endorphins in the brain .
The endorphins are associated with mood changes , and the more endorphins a runner ’s body pumps out , the greater the effect .
Leading endorphin researchers not associated with the study said they accepted its findings .
“ Impressive , ” said Dr. Solomon Snyder , a neuroscience professor at Johns Hopkins and a discoverer of endorphins in the 1970’s .
“ I like it , ” said Huda Akil , a professor of neurosciences at the University of Michigan .
“ This is the first time someone took this head on .
It was n’t that the idea was not the right idea .
It was that the evidence was not there . ”
For athletes , the study offers a sort of vindication that runner ’s high is not just a New Agey excuse for their claims of feeling good after a hard workout .
For athletes and nonathletes alike , the results are opening a new chapter in exercise science .
They show that it is possible to define and measure the runner ’s high and that it should be possible to figure out what brings it on .
They even offer hope for those who do not enjoy exercise but do it anyway .
These exercisers might learn techniques to elicit a feeling that makes working out positively addictive .
The lead researcher for the new study , Dr. Henning Boecker of the University of Bonn , said he got the idea of testing the endorphin hypothesis when he realized that methods he and others were using to study pain were directly applicable .
The idea was to use PET scans combined with recently available chemicals that reveal endorphins in the brain , to compare runners ’ brains before and after a long run .
If the scans showed that endorphins were being produced and were attaching themselves to areas of the brain involved with mood , that would be direct evidence for the endorphin hypothesis .
And if the runners , who were not told what the study was looking for , also reported mood changes whose intensity correlated with the amount of endorphins produced , that would be another clincher for the argument .
NOTCOT Note : Here ’s another article from Anna Corpron of Sub -Studio !
I came across a flickr set today with some amazing pictures of an abandoned housing complex called San Zhi outside of Taipei , Taiwan .
A google search did n’t bring up much information , but from what I can gather , it was apparently built in the early 1980s as a series of vacation homes marketed towards affluent Taipei residents seeking to get out of the city .
The speculation about why the site was abandoned varies , with the most interesting being that a series of fatal accidents occurred during construction , causing locals to believe the site was haunted , and therefore instigating the developer ’s decision to stop construction ( and also putting a stop to any future redevelopment ) .
A more mundane reason listed for the abandonment was the developer running out of money , but I ’ll go with the first reason , thank you !
Architecturally speaking the houses are super cool , being very futuristic for the 80’s ( even by today ’s standards ) with the cantilevered , modular pods houses ( think Archigram ) .

Ron Paul campaign dominates convention Meeting reveals a party , in this state at least , far from united
Sun Archives Today on the presidential campaign trail ( 4-24-2008 )
Call 2008 the year of the great tumult , the year of the outsiders , the young , the tech - savvy who are changing American politics .
Although most of the attention , money and passion lie with the long saga of the Democratic presidential contest , Nevada ’s state Republican convention here offered evidence of the ground shifting across the spectrum , with an actual earthquake Friday night serving as an apt symbol .
Rep. Ron Paul , a Republican with a libertarian ’s heart , followed his second - place finish in Nevada ’s January presidential caucus by out - organizing the state ’s Republican establishment .
In the process , the Paulites embarrassed the campaign of Arizona Sen . John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee for president .
They seemed to make up more than half of the 1,300 or so state delegates to the convention .
They won a key procedural vote on the rules , and their boisterous presence created significant delays , causing the convention chairman , Bob Beers , a state senator from Las Vegas , to recess the convention without selecting delegates to the national convention .
The state convention is to resume at a later date .
Paul supporters occasionally shouted down the chairman , then rocked the convention with noise when Paul , their diminutive doctor icon , appeared to rally them .
The passion of the libertarians showed the sense of unrest of some grass roots Republicans following the party ’s 2006 defeat and worrisome signs of another this year .
A surge in Democratic registrations has dealt Nevada Republicans a 50,000 voter deficit , while nationally , the GOP faces the biggest party identification gap to Democrats ever recorded by the Gallup polling organization .
Although it is largely papered over by the GOP establishment ’s unifying behind McCain , party regulars are debating the future of the party , and especially whether to return to the small - government principles of the late Barry Goldwater , the 1964 Republican presidential candidate .
Republican conventions are usually well - organized , rather staid affairs for bashing Democrats and rallying around the presidential nominee , in this case , McCain .
Not so this time , as many of the more than 1,300 delegates were Paul supporters who viewed themselves as insurgents taking on the establishment .
As Kelly Edinger , a delegate from Washoe County , put it : “ On one side you ’ve got a candidate with principles , on the other , Tammany Hall , ” referring to the corrupt New York City political machine of the 19th and 20th centuries .
It was a wildly exaggerated accusation , but a reflection of insurgent attitudes .
The convention was filled with first - timers , including Shawn Moshos , a member of the carpenters union and a 34 - year - old lifelong Republican energized for the first time this year .
The southwest Las Vegas resident is head of marches , activism and special projects for a Ron Paul Meetup group , which is an online tool for organizing offline .
“ It ’s a little like going to church , ” he said of Paul ’s Las Vegas supporters .
They meet socially and enjoy talking about shared libertarian principles .
Jon Martin is a young management consultant who lives in Las Vegas also at his first political convention .
“ Paul has ignited a fire , ” he said .
Although McCain is the presumed nominee , Paul continues to rack up big vote totals in primaries , including 126,000 votes , or nearly 16 percent , in Pennsylvania .
In his speech , Paul called for an end to the IRS and the protection of constitutional liberties .
He never mentioned McCain .
Martin is the type of libertarian voter who should concern Republicans .
He said McCain is a “ warmonger . ”
Martin , who is hoarding precious metals for a predicted economic calamity , also showed the sometimes confusing ideological space these people occupy .
He said he would vote for the radical leftist Ralph Nader if Paul is n’t a general election candidate .
Jeff Greenspan , Paul ’s southwest director , said the Paul convention plan had been in the works for months .
They dominated county conventions .
And , in Reno on Saturday , they communicated strategy on the convention floor by mass cell phone text messaging , which no doubt kept them a step ahead of party leadership .
Robert Uithoven , a party strategist and adviser to McCain , acknowledged “ there are divisions in the Republican Party .
It ’s April .
I hope they ’ll come over , and I believe they will . ”
Uithoven said Paul supporters were able to gain a strong foothold at the convention because McCain ’s lean campaign team had racked up victories by relying on free media rather than paid staff or volunteers .
The campaign is adding staff and getting organized , Uithoven said .
As he noted , the division among Republicans is nothing compared to the battle going on between the Democrats , Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama .
Indeed , the minor skirmish among Republicans was n’t the most telling incident of the day .
That came from former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Rep. Dean Heller , who both sketched out the attacks Republicans will launch on Democrats from now until November .
Romney said Clinton and Obama are “ more concerned with what the ACLU lawyers think than protecting the American people . ”
“ I know Americans are going to chose a great patriot , a man who ’s been tested and proven , ” he concluded , which was a thinly veiled way of saying Obama is untested , unproven and has suspect associations .
Heller , a one - time moderate who has become a rock - ribbed conservative since joining Congress in 2007 , threw the crowd some red meat .
“ If you can not score above a 40 when you ’re bowling , you probably are not physically fit to be president , ” he quipped , referring to Obama ’s failed attempt in rural Pennsylvania .
Playing off Clinton ’s ad about being ready to answer the call at 3 a.m. in the White House and her fibbing about landing amidst sniper fire in Bosnia during the ’90s , Heller said , “ If you can not remember if you ’ve been under sniper fire , you should n’t be answering the phone at 3 o’clock in the morning . ”
Then he returned to Obama : “ If you think our closets are full of guns , and if you think we go to church every Sunday because we ’re bitter , well , I ’ll let you answer that . ”
Paul notwithstanding , that ’s the campaign to come .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .
A Ford spokesman , Mike Moran , said he was aware that Ford would benefit from the tax credit in the bill passed by the Senate .
But Mr. Moran said that the credit applied to a range of industries , not just automakers .
A spokesman for General Motors , Greg Martin , said today that the auto companies would only be able to use the tax credits to re-invest in their American operations , not their plants overseas .
The credits " will surely have a beneficial impact , which is part of the overall effort to stimulate the economy , " Mr. Martin said .
Domestic airlines and manufacturers other than automakers would be eligible to claim the A.M.T. break as well .
One lobbyist said that the companies that had sought the tax breaks in meetings with lawmakers included Ford , General Motors , American Airlines , Northwest Airlines and Goodyear Tire and Rubber .
Companies could claim only one of the new tax breaks , which in all , are expected to cost $ 6 billion through 2018 .
The jockeying among industry groups , including Realtors , home builders and bankers , is certain to intensify in coming weeks as lawmakers move to reconcile the Senate bill with a more ambitious package of housing legislation now under way in the House .
Lawmakers on the tax - writing House Ways and Means Committee have omitted the corporate tax cuts from their version of the bill in favor of tax breaks for first - time home buyers and developers of low - income rental housing , and more aid for owners facing foreclosure .
Congressional Democrats are also hearing from consumer advocates and other groups who say that the Senate bill does little to help Americans in danger of losing their homes to foreclosure .
“ The Senate legislation gave corporations and Wall Street billions in tax breaks , ” Terence M. O’Sullivan , the president of the Laborers International Union of North America , said at a news conference on Tuesday to denounce the bill .

BANKERS have a bad habit of making economic cycles worse .
They are notorious for lending people umbrellas when the sun is shining and asking for them back when rain starts to fall .
When the economy is strong and asset prices are rising , banks are only too eager to lend to those wanting to buy assets , helping to push prices higher .
In bad times , when prices are falling , banks ask for their loans back , forcing the borrowers to sell assets and driving prices down further .
Right now , banks are desperately plastering over the cracks in their balance sheets created by the credit crunch .
This week Royal Bank of Scotland launched a £ 12 billion ( $ 24 billion ) rights issue ( see article ) .
Other banks have tapped the bulging wallets of sovereign wealth funds .
But there may be a limit to investors ' largesse : those who have bailed out banks so far have lost money .
If the well of investors ' patience does run dry and banks are forced to shrink their lending , the economic situation may get a lot worse .
Already the riskiest borrowers in America and Britain are being shut out of mortgage markets , with predictable consequences for house prices .
Regulators are partly to blame .
When the credit boom was roaring in 2005 and 2006 , central banks did make pointed comments about the “ underpricing of risk ” — in plain English , that banks were not charging borrowers enough .
But they did nothing about it ; indeed , by keeping nominal interest rates low , they encouraged the credit excesses .
International regulations on the capital adequacy of banks do exist , but they tend to be procyclical too , requiring lenders to raise more capital only when the problems have already occurred .
And the regulators tend to be one step behind the practitioners .
Banks were able to exploit the first lot of so - called Basel rules , because they could hide risky loans off their balance sheets .
The new rules , Basel 2 , may be more sophisticated in their treatment of risk but they rely heavily on models developed by banks themselves .
As the past year 's events have demonstrated , those models can be seriously flawed .
Cycling backwards
Could there be a better way to regulate the industry ?
The regulations could be countercyclical , requiring banks to be like the biblical Joseph and raise more money in the fat years to see them through the lean ones .
Defining the cycle may sound prohibitively difficult but Charles Goodhart , a professor at the London School of Economics ( and a former monetary policymaker at the Bank of England ) , suggests a way around it : monitoring whether the pace of loan growth or the rate of increase of asset prices was moving sharply above trend , and requiring banks to find more capital if the alarm sounds .
Had such a rule been in place , the subprime - mortgage boom might not have been so explosive .
Of course , the devil would be in the detail .
Regulators would need a breakdown of how bank lending was being directed to different geographical areas and asset classes .
In good times , greedy bankers would have the incentive to cheat ; for example , by making loans to offshore holding companies that would then pass on the money to Florida condo - buyers .
Such rules would need to be international , to stop foreign banks from stealing market share from banks in countries that observed the regulations .
The regulators would also need to be careful about being too lax during the downturns .
After all , it is at such times that banks are most likely to need capital to keep them afloat .
Bank customers might be resentful if they felt regulators had been complicit in letting a bank go under ( although deposit insurance should soothe them ) .
But if banks are forced to raise more capital during the booms , their finances should be stronger during the busts .
Despite this , countercyclical regulations would not be popular with the bankers .
Over a full cycle , such rules would probably require banks to have more capital than under the existing system ( and given the rescue of Bear Stearns , the rules would need to apply to investment as well as commercial banks ) .
Because money tied up in capital earns lower returns , that would mean lower profits .
But it is hard to feel much sympathy for bankers who rake in fortunes during the boom and require taxpayers to help them out in the bust ( or make central banks jump through hoops for them , as the Bank of England has done this week — see article ) .
An efficient financial sector is vital for a modern economy but trading securities has arguably achieved too much importance in the Anglo - Saxon world .
Winston Churchill once said that he would rather see finance less proud and industry more content .
That is not a bad motto for those devising a new set of banking regulations .
( LifeWire ) -- Rob Skinner did not expect to find a chaplain in the office when he started his sales job at Piedmont Air Conditioning in Raleigh , North Carolina .
" I was a little worried because I did n't want God shoved down my throat , " says Skinner , 38 , a self - described liberal Christian .
Expert suggests companies outline acceptable religious conduct in employee handbook .
Turns out Dwayne Reece , from the nonprofit , nondenominational Corporate Chaplains of America -- which provides Christian chaplains for companies that request them -- offered encouraging words instead .
Piedmont had hired him after the death of an employee , and it worked out so well , he 's been visiting for nine years .
" Having him there really makes you feel that the company cares , " Skinner says .
Religion , like sex and politics , once was considered inappropriate watercooler talk .
Not anymore .
Prayer sessions , religious diversity groups and chaplains like Reece , along with rabbis and imams , have become more common across corporate America in the past decade .
Fifty percent of those questioned in a 2002 Gallup poll said religious expression should be tolerated in the work place while another 28 percent thought it should be encouraged .
That 's compared to 21 percent who did n't see a place for religious expression on the job .
Reactions span the spectrum
" Faith is coming out of the closet at work , " says David W. Miller , author of " God at Work : The History and Promise of the Faith at Work Movement . "
" It could be as simple as using a Buddha screen saver or having a cross at your desk . "
David Silverman , 41 , of Cranbury , New Jersey , does n't mind a cross .
But spare him the sermon .
" In my last job , people held prayer sessions during office hours , " he says .
" I had secretaries tell me to accept Jesus . "
Frustrated that managers looked the other way , he started an atheist and agnostic group at work .
Eventually , he quit .
It is not just the anti-religious , agnostics or atheists who want to keep religion out of the office .
Greg Willits , 37 , of Conyers , Georgia , works for a Catholic nonprofit .
How does he feel about religion at work ?
" Ironically , I think it is better to leave it out of the workplace , if it is a non -faith - based job , " says Willits .
" I think religion is a very personal and emotional thing for many people .
Bringing religion into the workplace can cause trouble . "
The increase in religious expression at work may be tied to politics .
" When President Bush took office , he was very vocal about his faith , " says Os Hillman , founder and director of the International Coalition of Workplace Ministries .
" I think that gave those of faith the license to share their beliefs . "
Many employees appreciate those options .
Texas Instruments in Dallas , for example , provides serenity rooms for prayer and mediation .
" Our company gives us a place to go say our prayers easily and then we can get back to work , " says Siraj Akhtar , 33 , an RFID design manager whose Muslim faith requires him to pray five times a day .
" In the past we would go to a stairwell , which was not the best thing to do . "
Downside : Lawsuits more common
But it 's easy for problems to arise , ranging from bad feelings to legal action .
The number of lawsuits claiming workplace religious discrimination , while relatively low , jumped by nearly 50 percent between 1997 and 2007 to 2,541 , according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .
" While people lobby for integration of faith in the workplace , management must realize that many things that may seem legitimate are actually unlawful under our employment laws , " says A. Martin Wickliff , a managing partner of Epstein Becker Green Wickliff & Hall in Houston who specializes in labor and employment practice and has handled several such lawsuits .
He suggests that companies outline acceptable religious conduct in their employee handbooks .
And he tells workers to learn their legal rights :
They can't be forced into religious activities , and their beliefs must be accommodated unless it creates undue hardship for the employer .
However , employers are not required by law to provide places to worship .
Good for employers ?
A common issue is employees needing recurring time off for religious reasons , such as leaving before sundown on Fridays , not working on Saturdays ( for Seventh - day Adventists or Jews ) or praying throughout the day ( for Muslims ) .
Companies vary on how they handle it .
Some employees use vacation or personal days .
Others are able to negotiate flextime , or even meet with their religious advisers at work -- the Jewish group Aish New York , for example , sends rabbis to executives for one - on - one religious study .
Human resources consultant David Tulin thinks that 's good for business .
Respectful employers often will retain the " best and the brightest " workers , says Tulin , principal of Cincinnati - based Global Lead Management Consulting .
Experts like Tulin recommend that companies create faith - friendly policies through a " religious - diversity lens . "
They say employees should be up front about their religious needs .
And they encourage creating safe spaces for dialogue between groups .
" It is easy to fixate on the negative aspects of religion , " says Akhtar , " but the more employees share their experiences , the more you find commonalities . "
Not everyone thinks the office is the place for that .
Silverman , now a volunteer speaker for the nonprofit American Atheists , is one :
" There are more places to pray in America than ( there are ) pizza parlors .
Go to them . "

A friend died who had a great sense of humor and always used to say that when she died she wanted aparking meter on her grave that says “ Expired . ”
So her nephew got her one on ebay !
She said that hergrave is right by the road so everyone can see it and many people have stopped to get a chuckle .
Origins : The
above - displayed pictures do show the Okemah , Oklahoma , gravesite of one Barbara Sue Manire , who passed away on her 64th birthday in 2005 and is now interred at Highland Cemetery beneath a whimsical symbol of time expired : a parking meter with a “ 64 year time limit . ”
( Her headstone also bears the legend “ OUR MOM … HER HUMOR LIVES ON . ” )
As Barbara Sue ’s daughter , Sherri Ann Weeks , explained , the unusual decorative feature at the gravesite was indeed her mother ’s idea :
Mom always said she wanted a parking meter with ‘ time expired . ’
And she wanted to be on the front row of the cemetery so she could see what was going on .
We gave her what she wanted .
The parking meter was n’t placed at the time Barbara Sue Manire was interred , however .
Sherri and her brother , Terry Heiskill , mulled the matter over for about a year before the latter purchased a meter through eBay .
A hole was drilled in the marble base at the burial site to accommodate the parking meter , which was given a coat of paint to match it with the gravestone .
Sherri told us that the family “ are happy about the attention this [ picture ] has received because we know that our Mom is up above … looking down and still laughing . ”

The Study : a Role of Low Energy Expenditure and Sitting in Obesity , Metabolic Syndrome , Type 2 Diabetes , and Cardiovascular Disease , a Diabetes , November 2007
The Findings : Marc Hamilton and his team at the University of Missouri - Columbia found that the recommended 30 minutes of exercise per day may not be enough to counteract health problems caused by sitting and sleeping the other 23.5 hours .
Their research on the metabolism of rats , pigs and humans suggests that after several hours on our butts , our bodies shut down fat - and cholesterol - burning mechanisms , but standing switches those metabolic functions back on , and calorie - burning is effectively doubled .
Why Bother ?
Hamilton argues that since only 5 percent of Americans exercise regularly , simply staying upright by working at a standing desk or pacing while taking the occasional phone call may be a more practical first step toward good health for most Americans than asking them to go jogging on their lunch break .
a We need to focus on the fact that if sitting is a cause of disease in most people , a Hamilton says , athen avoiding sitting is the most direct and simple recommendation to start with .a 

A recent blog conversation mentioned on The Simple Dollar started me thinking about wealth and quality of life .
One of the participants wrote
I think passive income , like most financial information on the internet , is aimed at keeping middle class people more comfortably middle class .
( comment on this post )
My first reaction was “ Is there something wrong with being middle class ? ”
Ideally , yes , I ’d like to never have to work another day in my life .
It ’d be nice not to have to worry about money ( though I ’d still be careful how I spent it ) .
But I know that I would still work because there are certain types of work I find challenging and meaningful .
It ’s quite likely that I ’d have a part - time job shelving books ( I love it ) and spend the rest of the time quilting , writing , and blogging .
That said , I do n’t really understand slamming the middle class .
I do n’t see anything wrong with not being super - rich or even rich .
It makes me think of how Kiyosaki talks about his father , the “ poor dad . ”
From what I remember , his father had a job he liked and lived comfortably if not richly .
I did n’t see what was so “ poor ” about that .
It ’s been a while , but I do n’t recall them going hungry .
Correct me if I ’ve forgotten that .
Most millionaires and such have poured excessive overtime into their businesses and work .
If that ’s what makes them happy , I ’m glad .
I enjoy blogging , which takes up a lot of my free time .
And along with those success stories , I ’ve heard plenty of stories of people well on their way to wealth who suddenly drop out because it ’s just too much work and stress .
They ’d rather be comfortable and happy .
Maybe they want to see their family more often and actually use the money they earn .
A middle - class family who knows how to use their money wisely can do quite well at creating a pleasant and comfortable life for themselves .
I enjoy reading books from my library , I enjoy writing a blog ( and other things ) , I enjoy quilting ( but quilt by hand which is more fun and engaging and also takes longer … and thus costs less ) .
I do n’t need to be rich to do any of that .
If passive income or personal finance and frugality skills I ’ve learned can make me “ more comfortably middle class , ” great !
I ’m willing to settle for comfortable middle class and enjoy myself in it .
That ’s a heck of a lot better than uncomfortable — whether it ’s uncomfortable poor or uncomfortable rich .
Do you think there ’s anything wrong with being middle class ?

SAN DIEGO , California ( CNN ) --
Their mission is to protect airline passengers from acts of terror on U.S. flights .
But in a special investigation , former and current air marshals told CNN that the number of marshals assigned to police flights is so low that the federal agency overseeing them has drastically lowered its firearms and psychological testing standards just so it can qualify new hires .
An air marshal , far left , trains during a simulated hijacking days after the 9/11 attacks .
More than a dozen current and former marshals said that so many federal air marshals have resigned and are not being replaced , airport screeners are being employed to fill the dwindling ranks .
But the Transportation Security Administration says that 's not true and that the rate of those leaving has remained at 6.5 percent a year since 2001 .
A former federal air marshal and weapons trainer who left the agency in 2006 after four years of service said the situation was so bad that managers at his office fudged the numbers by assigning marshals to short , no -risk flights .
The former marshal said that was done to make it appear that the percentage of manned flights was higher than it really was .
" I think it 's a national disgrace , '' said the former marshal , who asked not to be identified because he still works in law enforcement .
Watch Drew Griffin 's investigative report »
The Federal Air Marshal Service was greatly expanded in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11 , when flights to " high - risk cities " such as New York were given special air marshal manpower priority .
Assignments are " intelligence - driven " and " risk - based , " the Federal Air Marshal Service said in an e-mail .
But many of the marshals interviewed said it had little to do with intelligence or risk and was more about a numbers game .
" We were questioning how these flights could be intelligence - driven when we were flying from San Diego to Phoenix on another leg to Las Vegas back to Phoenix back to San Diego , " the former marshal said .
" It 's not a threat flying on Southwest Airlines to Las Vegas . "
Faced with fewer qualified applicants , current air marshals said that recruiting standards have been lowered .
Air marshals still patrolling flights also said the loss of so many experienced agents has led the TSA to hire airport screeners as air marshals .
Agency spokesman Greg Alter said in an e-mail that only " a very small number of air marshals started their careers as Transportation Security Officers [ airport screeners ] . "
Alter added that all " candidates receive the best training available and enter the workforce with the skill and expertise needed to protect the traveling public . "
In July 2006 , the Federal Air Marshal Service sent out a memo saying that new hires would no longer face mandatory psychological testing , unless the recruit admits that he or she has been treated for a mental condition .
Read a copy of the memo »
TSA said it revised but did not " degrade " the psychological testing of applicants using the application and interaction with others in the service to determine mental competency .
On firearms training , a former weapons instructor with air marshals said that when recruits could not pass the tough federal tactical pistol course , known as the TPC , it was replaced with a less rigorous shooting test the potential recruits could pass .
" The TPC went away very quickly because they could n't get enough people through it to pass , " the former air marshal trainer said .
" So they dropped the tactical pistol course and went to the practical pistol course , which is a standard federal law enforcement course .
It 's not nearly as quick or as dynamic as TPC . "
But the TSA disputes the claim , saying it altered the weapons training six years ago because marshals needed more of a police - type training program rather than military - style weapons instruction .
The TSA said in an e-mail that " the course of fire and minimum qualification score air marshal candidates must acquire is the same today as it has been for over six years . "
To replace departing air marshals , the TSA hired internally , including some administrative staff who had no college , law enforcement or military backgrounds , one current marshal said .
" To me , it 's more of an embarrassment to be a member of that agency that would allow that particular individual in the training program , " one marshal said .
" I would n't want them on my flight .
... I do n't want them as my partner . "
The revelations come in the wake of a CNN investigation , in which air marshals and pilots said that only about 1 percent of the nation 's 28,000 daily domestic flights were protected by onboard , armed federal marshals .
The Federal Air Marshal Service disputes that figure .
CNN 's report about the declining number of marshals on planes also got the attention of Congress .
In a congressional hearing this week , the head of the Transportation Security Administration , Kip Hawley , told members of Congress that what CNN heard from the air marshals is wrong .
" I have to just correct on the factual basis on the CNN report about air marshals covering 1 percent .
That number is absolutely wrong by an order of magnitude , and it was a guess by the folks there , and I just have to say that number is completely false . "
Hawley would not say what percentage of flights has air marshals .
That 's a national security secret .
The service hides behind national security to keep the public from knowing how thin coverage really is , air marshals said .
The Federal Air Marshal Service continues to refuse CNN 's request for an interview .
This month , Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas , who serves on the Homeland Security Committee , began holding closed - door meetings with the air marshal 's service to determine whether congressional oversight committees are getting the truth .
" We will keep working and continuing to make sure that the airlines are served with the appropriate law enforcement that ensures the safety of the traveling public .
We , too , are not interested in having funny numbers , " Jackson Lee said .
Jackson
Lee said that the committee has not finished its work and that she is convinced American air travel is safe for passengers .
" It is important to restate and to re-emphasize : This is not an open opportunity for those who would attempt to do Americans harm .
We are light years from where we were in 2000 .
We have trained personnel .
They 're being utilized , and we feel that we are steps ahead of where we were , but we want to get better .
And that 's what we intend to do . "
After seeing CNN 's initial report , Democratic Sen .
John Kerry of Massachusetts sent a letter to Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff asking for clarity on the number of air marshals protecting domestic flights and sought a response by April 11 .
The senator is still waiting , Kerry 's staff said .

First , the good news : Goofy global warming deniers like Senator James Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) have been thoroughly outed as cranks , and largely relegated to the ash bin of history .
Today ’s most potent climate bad guys are more subtle creatures — those who , usually to court favor with a home - state constituency , are holding back the growth of a clean - energy economy .
Few do so outright .
But when we survey the current U.S. Congress and the political landscape more generally , it ’s clear that many individuals and organizations have helped preserve our moribund fossil - fuel - based energy system :
sen . pete domenici ( R - N.M . )
To transition into a postcarbon energy economy , Congress must pass a so - called “ renewable portfolio standard ” requiring power companies to derive some fraction of the electricity they sell from sources like solar or wind .
During the debate over the 2007 energy bill ( see “ Pork Power ” ) , Democrats sought to require companies to get 15 percent of their power from renewables by 2020 .
The rps survived the House intact but died a filibustery death in the Senate thanks to Republican opposition led by retiring Energy and Natural Resources Committee ranking member and nuclear power fan Domenici , who claimed such a measure would “ burden consumers . ”
Domenici is n’t all bad on renewables — he supported a push to extend tax credits for them as part of the economic - stimulus drive — but his opposition to the rps outweighs any other good deeds .
the southern company Many Southern Republican senators marched to Domenici ’s tune on the rps , and this Atlanta - based power company — which includes utilities in Georgia , Alabama , Mississippi , and Florida and whose profits totaled $ 1.73 billion in 2007 — might know why .
Southern spent a whopping $ 14.5 million on energy and environment lobbying in 2007 , much of it to oppose an rps .
All six senators representing Georgia , Alabama , and Mississippi voted with Domenici — and Southern — on renewable energy .
Since 1990 , five of those six have each received more than $ 50,000 in campaign donations from Southern , with Alabama ’s Jeff Sessions heading the list with $ 154,765 .
sen . mary landrieu ( D - La . )
Landrieu is known for putting the interests of the climate second to those of Louisiana energy companies .
In the 2007 energy bill , the Senate had to decide whether to repeal recently enacted tax breaks to Big Oil and extend incentives for renewables .
A filibuster to prevent this priority realignment held by a one - vote margin .
Landrieu , who ’s thus far received $ 139,500 from oil and gas interests in the 2008 reelection cycle , was the only Demo­crat who voted with Republicans on the matter .
rep. joe barton ( R - Texas ) Perhaps most notorious for sending harassing letters to federally funded climate researchers when he was chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , Barton led the unsuccessful House opposition to the “ kamikaze energy bill , ” especially its renewables mandate .
In the process , Barton engaged in some creative redefinition of terms , arguing that companies should have the option of using power derived from “ clean coal ” and nuclear to meet any renewables standard , which …well , misses the point entirely .
In the current election cycle Barton has received more than $ 100,000 from oil , gas , and electric utilities .
He did n’t get the nickname “ Smoky Joe ” for nothing .
Greening the Pentagon Say what you will about Guantanamo Bay , but America ’s gulag gets 30 percent of its power from on - site wind turbines .
Surprising ?
Maybe not , considering the Pentagon , which uses 78 percent of the federal government ’s power , is also vying to be the country ’s largest consumer of earth - friendly energy , along with Intel and Pepsi .
Nearly 12 percent of dod facilities ’ electric consumption now comes from renewables .
And the Air Force alone accounts for 40 percent of the entire federal government ’s renewable energy usage , perhaps because it is trying to offset its profligate use of jet fuel .

sen . jim bunning ( R - Ky . ) / coal - state dems Clean coal is , in essence , an oxymoron , but that has n’t stopped Kentucky senator and Hall of Fame baseball pitcher Bunning from various maneuvers to promote it — including trying to add a liquid coal amendment to the 2007 energy bill .
One of Bunning ’s top collaborators on the coal - to - liquid front was Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) — although he jumped ship in 2007 , right after it became a political liability .
No worries , though ; Sen. Robert Byrd ( D - W.Va . ) and the other coal - state Dems are still on board .
( See “ Scrubbing King Coal . ” )
rep. john dingell ( D - Mich . )
Serving in the House since 1955 , the “ Dingellsaurus ” is increasingly out of step with “ damned environmentalists ” and House leadership .
Wielding his clout as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee , he ’s fought for massive subsidies for fossil fuels , and against the RPS , increased fuel - efficiency standards — and especially the separate “ light truck ” standard — and ( winning him no love from Speaker Nancy Pelosi ) California ’s 38 - year - old right to set its own emissions standards .
Ostensibly he takes these positions to defend Detroit from pesky regulation , but history will likely judge him as crippling American automakers ’ ability to compete with Toyota and Honda in the 21st century .
sen . lamar alexander ( R - Tenn . )
One of the most important renewable - energy industries that we must encourage is wind power .
But Tennessee ’s senior senator has taken precisely the opposite tack , tilting at wind and even claiming it produces “ puny amounts of high - cost unreliable power . ”
Alexander has also introduced legislation that would remove tax credits for wind power , and in opposing the Senate rps , commented , “ Forcing Tennesseans either to build 40 - story wind turbines on our pristine mountaintops or to pay billions in penalty taxes to the federal government amounts to a judge giving a defendant the choice to be hanged or shot . ”
sen .
ted kennedy ( D - Mass . )
Not to be out - nimby ed by those across the aisle , Kennedy opposes the offshore Cape Wind project , whose proposed site is near his Hyannis Port home .
Hypocrisy ?
Here are Kennedy ’s own words : “ I strongly support renewable energy , including wind energy , as a means of reducing our dependence on foreign oil and protecting the environment . ”
Just , um , not where he lives .
sen . john thune ( R - S.D. )
The conservative prairie senator likes wind power well enough — there ’s plenty of it in his state .
But as there ’s also lots of corn around , Thune has been a leading promoter of corn - based ethanol and spearheaded recent mandates to dramatically ramp up its production .
Alas , scientific research has increasingly exposed this allegedly “ green fuel ” as disastrous for the climate and responsible for higher food prices .
Thune , though , says that ’s “ propaganda ” that has been “ engineered by the oil companies that hate ethanol . ”
He recently introduced legislation that would undermine the environmental safeguards for biofuels included in the 2007 energy bill .

THIS week Israelis celebrate and Palestinians mourn the war of 1948 that created a state for the Jews but resulted in the flight of a large portion of Palestine 's then Arab majority .
After 60 anniversaries the fate of the two sides is as lopsided as ever .
Israel is not just an established state but a dynamic and prosperous one .
By contrast , the lot of the Palestinians is wretched ( see article ) .
The state they were promised under the UN partition plan of 1947 remains tantalisingly beyond reach , even though almost every government in the world , including those of America and Israel , claims to support the creation of such a state in the West Bank and Gaza .
How to explain the perpetuation of this conflict as the generations pass by ?
The contending answers fill a thousand libraries .
Both sides have a stubborn narrative of righteous victimhood , each promoted eloquently by its respective posse of indignant partisans .
To many outsiders in the West the interminable squabble is so familiar that it is becoming merely tiresome : a sad , stuck , tribal quarrel from the 1940s that seems impossible to resolve and so might as well be ignored .
This feeling of baffled impotence is a danger .
The world has a moral obligation to help the Palestinians .
But self - interest is at stake as well .
However tired people in the West may be of Palestine and its woes , this cause electrifies millions of Muslims and helps to stir the global jihad .
If it is soluble at all , it can certainly never be solved without the full attention of America , the only country which Israel really trusts and that has the power to coax or coerce it into territorial compromise .
That is why most of this decade has been wasted : a distracted or uninterested George Bush claimed to believe in Palestinian statehood but did nothing serious to bring it about , failing even to slow Israel 's colonisation of the West Bank .
America 's next president must not repeat this mistake .
But if America is a necessary part of the solution in Palestine , it is not sufficient .
The Palestinians must play their part too .
They desperately need an effective and pragmatic leadership capable of negotiating and implementing a peace based on partitioning Palestine into two states .
Yet their leaders are more divided than ever .
The pragmatists led in the West Bank by Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah are not effective .
The rival Hamas leadership in the Gaza Strip is extremely effective but says it does not believe in a permanent peace based on partition .
Top marks for consistency , zero for sense
Sixty years ago , too , the Palestinians refused partition and ended up stateless .
If rejecting partition was a mistake then , it is a bigger one now that Israel 's population has increased eightfold .
To say that Israel should never have been created and must be dissolved is not only utterly unrealistic ; it is also to propose correcting one injustice by perpetrating another .
And yet this remains Hamas 's formal position .
True , its leaders hint that if Israel gave up all the territory conquered in 1967 it would earn a long - term truce , which just might one day become permanent .
But that hinted future possibility is not a wager Israelis are likely to take .
Meanwhile , the longer Hamas claims to reject the very idea of Israel 's permanence , the easier it is for Israel to dig into the West Bank and the harder it is for America to believe in , let alone press for , a breakthrough to peace .
The Hamas retort is that Yasser Arafat 's Oslo talks achieved little for the Palestinians .
Wars got them less .
After generations as history 's losers , the Palestinians deserve a better future .
But they can help themselves by putting history behind them and coming to terms , as the Israelis say they already have , with the obvious .
A peaceful future is possible only with two states , not just the one .
Ama Sumani was treated at the University Hospital of Wales , Cardiff
Ama Sumani's story
Ama Sumani was taken by immigration officers from a Cardiff hospital where she has been receiving dialysis for a year after cancer damaged her kidneys .
Ms Sumani , 39 , whose visa has expired , said she cannot afford care in Ghana .
Her solicitor said they had pleaded compassionate grounds .
The Home Office said it examined each case " with care " .
Before leaving , she had been comforted by a nurse in a day - room at the University Hospital of Wales .
The immigration service arrived at 0800 GMT .
Ms Sumani was tearful but calm when she left hospital in a wheelchair with five immigration officials , one carrying her suitcase , and she was driven away .
She left on a flight from Heathrow to Ghana at 1435 GMT .
The cancer she is suffering from - malignant myeloma - would ordinarily be treated with a bone marrow transplant , but she was not entitled to the treatment .
The dialysis treatment she has been receiving is helping to prolong her life and her last treatment was on Tuesday evening .
Legal status
But it needs to be repeated regularly and there are concerns she would not be able to access dialysis treatment centres in Ghana .
Health care there is also private but Ms Sumani said she could not afford it .
A spokesman for Ghana 's high commission in London said the country had two fully - equipped hospitals in Accra and further north in Kumasi .
He did concede that access to treatment was costly but said that if Ms Sumani was a member of the Ghana national health insurance scheme she would still receive treatment .
Immigration officials arrived at the hospital on Wednesday morning
A friend Janet Symmons said Ms Sumani was a widow and a mother of two children , who were currently being looked after by members of her church in Ghana .
She first came to the UK as a visitor in 2003 , but then changed her status to student and attempted to enrol on a banking course at a city college , her solicitor explained .
Ms Sumani's lack of English prevented her from pursuing the course and she went to find work which contravened her student visa .
In 2005 she returned to Ghana to attend a memorial service for her dead husband .
But when she came back to the UK her student visa was revoked and she was only given temporary admission which effectively meant she was given notice she would be removed , her solicitor said .
She did not keep in touch with immigration officials and was first taken ill in January 2006 .
Without the dialysis doctors fear she only has weeks to live .
Her solicitor said she accepted her removal was fair but said they had made representations on her behalf on compassionate grounds .
Ms Sumani is being removed from the country rather than deported because of her expired visa which means she has no legal status in the UK .
A removal means that in theory she could apply to return to the UK in the future .
A spokesman for the Border and Immigration agency said said it would not remove from the UK anyone who they believe is at risk on their return .
" Part of our consideration when a person is removed is their fitness to travel and whether the necessary medical treatment is available in the country to which we are returning , " he added .
" Removals are always carried out in the most sensitive way possible , treating those being removed with courtesy and dignity . "
' Fort Knox at the Brandenburg Gate ' German Critics Slam New US Embassy
The new US Embassy in Berlin opens for business this week .
But the building 's design , with its focus on security , has been panned by German architectural critics , who call it a " triumph of banality " that would be more at home in Baghdad than Berlin .

Nothing riles Southern Californians like a new tax on their God - given right to drive .
Yet motorists in Los Angeles County might be paying an extra 9 cents per gallon at the gas pump – or an additional $ 90 on their vehicle registration fees .
The purpose ?
It would help fight global warming .
Voters will decide whether to approve a " climate change mitigation and adaptation fee " under a proposed law being debated by the state legislature .
It has already been endorsed by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority .
The money would be used to fund public transportation and other projects that ease traffic congestion at a time when the state budget is strapped and money from Washington has all but dried up .
Critics are hopping mad .
They say that it exploits public sympathy for global warming in order to fund projects that are already sucking down taxpayers ' dollars .
Who gets tapped ?
Read after the jump .
Supporters point out that many ambitious public transportation projects , including the Subway to the Sea , the Wilshire bus-only lane and the extension of the Gold Line subway are n't fully funded – and risk being sidelined .
The tax would pull in an estimated $ 400 million a year , which makes it a model that other cash - strapped states will no doubt find enticing .
California voters will have to decide whether or not it 's fair .

Table of Contents Back Introduction
Two e-mails from two Clinton supporters pass along this CNN brief about the company that employed a state dept .
functionary who snuck a peak at Barack Obama 's passport application .
Turns out that the owner of one of the companies is John Brennan , one of Barack Obama 's chief advisers on intelligence policy .
( The others are Lee Hamilton and Tony Lake . )
Conspiracy ?
Actually , no .
It 's more interesting that that .
Let 's broaden this out .
Brennan is one of many former intelligence community heavyweights to have started his own consulting firm after leaving the government .
These firms employ hundreds of thousands of Americans in jobs requiring access to sensitive , Secret , Top Secret , or even Top Secret Codeword information .
There 's a big debate in the community right now about contracting : how much oversight is enough ?
Should the contractors be subject to the same rules as federal employees ?
Are their jobs that contractors should n't do ?
Should the IC admit that it has outsourced many of our nation 's most critical jobs to non-government employees ?
Also : what 's the quickest , safest and most efficient way to vet these employees .
In this case , the employee was subjected to a " national agency check , " which is essentially what the Secret Service performs on folks whose friends get them those extra-special White House tours .
That is , their names are run through federal databases to see if anything untoward pops out .
Most " Secret " clearances are processed with a national agency check and only a little bit more investigation .
Most folks in the intelligence community want contractors to have easier access to raw intelligence products and have urged reform of the security clearance process .
That 's where another Brenann connection comes in .
He 's the chairman of INSA , the Intelligence and Security Alliance , a very well - regarded think tank consortium funded in part by companies who have IC business .
One wonders whether a President Obama would be more likely , or less likely , to support a more rational security clearance system after these indiscretions .
NB : Brennan was most recently in the news for breaking with Obama over telecom immunity .
Brennan supports it ; Obama does not .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

For years , Johnson & Johnson obscured evidence that its popular Ortho Evra birth control patch delivered much more estrogen than standard birth control pills , potentially increasing the risk of blood clots and strokes , according to internal company documents .
But because the Food and Drug Administration approved the patch , the company is arguing in court that it cannot be sued by women who claim that they were injured by the product  even though its old label inaccurately described the amount of estrogen it released .
This legal argument is called pre-emption .
After decades of being dismissed by courts , the tactic now appears to be on the verge of success , lawyers for plaintiffs and drug companies say .
The Bush administration has argued strongly in favor of the doctrine , which holds that the F.D.A. is the only agency with enough expertise to regulate drug makers and that its decisions should not be second - guessed by courts .
The Supreme Court is to rule on a case next term that could make pre-emption a legal standard for drug cases .
The court already ruled in February that many suits against the makers of medical devices like pacemakers are pre-empted .
Alaska Wolves to be Shot from Helicopters
The wolves have been killing newborn calves , said biologist Cathie Harms with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game .
The herd had an estimated 10,000 animals in 1983 , but now numbers about 600 .
Harms said Fish and Game staffers will use a helicopter to locate and kill the wolves from the air starting this spring .
She sais it is the first time since the mid-1980s that such an operation has been authorized .
A survey of the herd in 2006 discovered one calf per 100 cows , according to Fish and Game .
That number decreased to 0.5 calves per 100 during a survey conducted last year , Harms said .
The department intends to give calves a chance to survive and restock the herd , which it says is important to subsistence hunters .
Far to the south in Darien , Connecticut , Friends of Animals president Priscilla Feral today denounced the Alaska agency 's approval of aerial wolf control .
" Alaskans have allowed their bureaucracy to be taken over by extremists - people who want to keep an air force to annihilate wolves and other natural predators , " said Feral .
" Alaska 's bloody spectacles are a blight on the continent . "
Priscilla Feral , whose advocacy group has sponsored wolf research in Alaska for 15 years , has successfully intervened in past killing plans .
The group 's latest challenge to Alaska 's wolf control , in November 2006 , awaits a judge 's ruling .
Dr. Gordon Haber , a wildlife biologist based in Alaska , whose work is paid for by the Friends of Animals , is critical of the aerial gunning of wolves to increase caribour numbers .
" The vital underlying patterns of variation that define natural wolf - prey systems are being ignored and replaced , " Haber writes on his website .
" This is being done with parochial , anti-adaptive farming approaches to management that seldom if ever produce and sustain the high , stable numbers and yields of moose and caribou touted by proponents . "

WASHINGTON : The Democratic candidates took the heat out of what had become an increasingly bitter presidential campaign , with front - runner Barack Obama saying in their nationally televised debate that Hillary Rodham Clinton should not be judged for exaggerated remarks about her trip to Bosnia .
And Clinton , struggling to keep her campaign afloat , acknowledged that Obama could beat Republican John McCain in the November election .
But she refused to let up Wednesday night on the Illinois senator 's comments that small - town Americans had grown bitter over economic difficulties and were clinging to religion and guns .
Obama holds a sizable _ perhaps insurmountable _ lead in delegates with just 10 primary and caucus contests remaining after Tuesday 's critical Pennsylvania vote .
She needs to win by a large margin there to keep her candidacy alive .
The senators _ Clinton of New York and Obama of Illinois _ are running rough - and - tumble campaigns for the Democratic nomination and have attacked one another with increasingly personal criticism .
Clinton , apparently trying to put the Bosnia issue behind her , said she was sorry she ``said some things I knew not to be the case . ''
On at least three occasions Clinton told campaign audiences that she landed in Tuzla 12 years ago under sniper fire and had to run to waiting vehicles for safety .
Television pictures of the event showed Clinton walking calmly to a waiting group of people and no evidence of gun fire .
Obama said she ``deserves the right to make some errors .
I 've made some too . ''
And he decried the tendency of modern - day politics to judge candidates according to the gaffes they make on the campaign trail .
He , too , has struggled in recent days to overcome the controversy caused by his comments about small town despondency .
Obama said he was attempting to say that because voters feel ignored by government , ``they end up being much more concerned about votes around things like guns where traditions have been passed on from generation to generation .
And those are incredibly important to them . ''
Clinton shot back : ``People do n't cling to their traditions on hunting and guns ' ' out of frustration with their government .
She charged that Obama had a fundamental misunderstanding on the role of religion and faith .
While both candidates said they believed either of them could defeat McCain , they declined to offer their rival the vice presidential slot .
Clinton at first sidestepped the question about Obama 's ability to win , but when asked a second time , she replied , ``Yes , yes , yes . ''
Obama said , ``Absolutely and I 've said so before '' _ a not - so - subtle response to frequent claims by Clinton 's aides that he could lead the Democrats to defeat in the fall .
On offering one another the vice presidency , Obama said he thought ``very highly of Senator Clinton 's record '' but that it was ``premature at this point to talk about who the vice presidential candidates will be . ''
Clinton said : ``I 'm going to do everything I possibly can to make sure that one of us takes the oath of office next January .
I think that has to be the overriding goal . ''
Both candidates vowed again to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq .
If elected , Clinton said she would immediately call together her military leadership and develop a plan to begin withdrawing forces within 60 days .
Obama said he would live up to his pledge to pull troops out within a year of taking office , realizing he would have to rely on the tactical advice of the military leadership .
On Iran , the agreed the United States should respond forcefully if it obtains nuclear weapons and uses them against Israel .
`` An attack on Israel would incur massive retaliation by the United States , '' said Clinton .
Obama said , `` The U.S. would take appropriate action . ''
The debate was the 21st of the campaign for the nomination , an epic struggle that could last weeks or even months longer .
Clinton 's lead in Pennsylvania has narrowed , according to a new Franklin & Marshall College poll .
The survey , released on Wednesday , showed Clinton with a 46 - 40 percentage point advantage over Obama .
Her 6 - point lead is just outside the poll 's margin of sampling error , which is plus or minus 5.1 percent .
In March the same poll showed her ahead by 16 points , 51 - 35 percent .
The latest poll was conducted April 8 - 13 among 367 likely Democratic voters .
A new Gallup Poll shows Obama with an 8 percentage - point lead nationally over Clinton , 50 - 42 , among Democrats nationwide .
More importantly , he has a solid lead in delegates who will choose the nominee at the party 's convention in August .
The poll was conducted April 13 - 15 and surveyed 1,282 Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters .
Going into the Pennsylvania primary , Clinton trails Obama 1,643 - 1,504 .
Pennsylvania is the largest state still to vote and 158 delegates are at stake .
Because Democratic state contests are not winner - take - all , it is statistically extremely unlikely for Clinton to overcome Obama 's lead in the so - called pledged delegate count .
Neither candidate will be able to clinch the 2,025 delegates needed to win the nomination without the approval of the party 's nearly 800 superdelegates .
Of that group , 254 have said they back Clinton , and 229 are supporting Obama .
His overall delegate lead includes the committed superdelegates .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Home foreclosure filings surged 57 percent in the 12 month - period ended in March and bank repossessions soared 129 percent from a year ago , as homeowners struggled to make mortgage payments , real estate data firm RealtyTrac said on Tuesday .

Home foreclosure filings surged 57 percent in the 12 month - period ended in March and bank repossessions soared 129 percent from a year ago , as homeowners struggled to make mortgage payments , real estate data firm RealtyTrac said on Tuesday .

White
For the month of March , foreclosure filings , default notices , auction sale notices and bank repossessions rose 5 percent , led by Nevada , California and Florida , Realty Trac said .
The rise in March to filings on a total of 234,685 properties followed a 4 percent decline in February , Realty Trac reported .
RealtyTrac said the peak has yet to be reached .
“ What we ’re really looking at is ongoing fallout from people overextending themselves to buy homes they could n’t afford and using highly toxic loan products to get into the houses in the first place , ” Rick Sharga , vice president of marketing at RealtyTrac , based in Irvine , California , said in an interview .
“ We ’re going to see quite possibly a record amount of foreclosure activity in the third or fourth quarter , ” reflecting sharp payment increases on adjustable - rate subprime mortgages in May and June , Sharga said .
One in every 538 U.S. households living in single - family dwellings received a foreclosure filing in March .
The single - family dwellings can include condominiums .
There are three phases of the foreclosure process in most states -- an initial default notice , notice of a scheduled auction , and an “ REO ” filing if the property is not sold at auction but instead repossessed by the bank , Sharga said .
REO refers to real estate - owned property .
All of the households in the report received at least one of these filings last month .
AUCTION NOTICES UP 32 PERCENT
While default notices and repossessions soared in March , auction notices rose a relatively small 32 percent , James J. Saccacio , chief executive officer of RealtyTrac , said in a statement .
That suggests “ more defaulting homeowners are simply walking away and deeding their properties back to the foreclosing lender , ” he said .
“ This deed - in - lieu - of - foreclosure process allows the lender to take possession of a property without putting it up for public foreclosure auction . ”
The states with the highest foreclosure filing rates -- Nevada , California and Florida -- also are among those that had the biggest price appreciation in the five - year boom before the housing meltdown that began in 2006 .
These states tend to also be plagued by defaults on unoccupied homes bought by speculative investors .
In many cases , home prices have now fallen below the size of the mortgages and some owners are walking away .
In Nevada , one in every 139 households received a foreclosure filing in March , keeping the state at the top of the ranks for the 15th straight month .
The 7,659 Nevada properties receiving foreclosure filings last month represented a 24 percent jump from February and a nearly 62 percent spike from March 2007 .
California had the second highest rate of foreclosure filings , one for every 204 households , followed by Florida with one of every 282 households .
Arizona ’s filings fell about 5 percent , but it retained its standing as with the fourth highest pace of foreclosure activity for the third month straight .
Foreclosure activity in Colorado dropped 8 percent in March from February and 1 percent from a year ago , but it ranked No. 5 , with one filing for each 339 households .
Georgia , Ohio , Michigan , Massachusetts and Maryland were the other states with the highest foreclosure rates in March .
The states with highest total number of foreclosure filings were California , Florida and Ohio .
Foreclosure filings were reported on 64,711 California properties in March , the most of any state for the 15th consecutive month , up nearly 21 percent from February and up almost 106 percent from March 2007 .
Florida posted the second highest total , with foreclosure filings reported on 30,254 properties in March .
While down about 7 percent from February , filings were about 112 percent higher than last March .
Georgia , Texas , Michigan , Arizona , Illinois , Nevada and Colorado were the other states with the highest foreclosure totals in March .

Rapid Growth for Top Brands in 2007
The combined value of the world 's top 100 brands - headed by Google - rose by 21 % last year , according to the third annual BrandZ � Ranking from ROI specialist Millward Brown Optimor .
The report , which identifies the world 's most powerful brands as measured by their dollar value , says companies that own brands in the BrandZ Top 100 have ' significantly outperformed the stock market when compared to the S&P 500 ' .
Total value climbed from $ 1.6 trillion in 2007 to $ 1.94 trillion in 2008 , more than twice the increase of the previous year .
Google leads comfortably and for the second year running with a brand value of $ 86.1bn , while GE and Microsoft battle for second place with $ 71.4bn and $ 70.8 bn respectively .
The top British Brand is Vodafone , at no.11 , value $ 36.9 bn .
China Mobile and Nokia are the only non-US - based brands in the top ten .
Among the notable trends spotted by the authors :
Chinese brands continue to get stronger .
The seven brands in the Top 100 from mature Asian economies Japan , Korea , and Hong Kong grew by a moderate 7 % on average ( total $ 111bn ) , while the value of the four Chinese brands in the list - China Mobile , Bank of China , China Construction Bank and ICBC - leapfrogged them with a 51 % increase to $ 124bn .
The other BRIC economies - Brazil , Russia and India - are also rising rapidly , with Russian - based mobile operator MTS the first from its country to enter the ranking at number 89 , and the authors singling out Russia 's Lukoil , Beeline , and Baltika , India 's ICICI and Brazil 's Brahma , Petrobras , and Bradesco as brands to watch .
The technology sector , including mobile operators , comtinues to boom , accounting for 28 of the top 100 and outperforming all other categories with value growth of $ 187.5 bn , more than half the total

More evidence of telomere length as a biomarker of aging emerges from a study of “ exceptionally old persons ” ( subjects > 90 years old ) : Peripheral blood leukocytes from very old individuals show telomere lengths that are about what you ’d expect based on extrapolation from the steady decline in length between youth and regular ( as opposed to “ exceptional ” ) old age .
The very aged also show an enrichment in what the authors call “ ultra - short telomeres ” ; I suspect this peak in the histogram can be rationalized by the fact that telomere lengths are bounded below by zero , such that steady linear decline in length over time would result in a pileup in the “ undetectable ” category .
Is telomere length important to the mechanism of aging , in addition to being a marker of advanced chronological age ?
The jury is still out on that , likely frustrated by the circumstantial nature of the evidence .
We know that telomere length appears to be inversely proportional to life expectancy , but of course correlation ≠ causation , and lifespan and telomere length could be unrelated signifiers of the same underlying phenomenon .
To complicate the issue , we are reminded in a recent review that all telomere ends are not equal :
In addition , recent studies in both normal and pathological contexts point to the existence of chromosome - specific mechanisms of telomere length regulation determining a telomere length profile , which is inherited and maintained throughout life .
… i.e. , bulk telomere length might be less important than the lengths of particular telomeres , a forest hiding the most significant trees .
More to the point , the telomere lengths of the various chromosomes might be regulated independently , making bulk telomere length something of a red herring .
In the cellular senescence field , the idea of “ sentinel telomeres ” is still alive and kicking , but hardly ascendant .
The emerging consensus is that a specific group of chromosomes with the shortest telomeres in a given clonal lineage , rather than a single sentinel telomere , herald the onset of senescent cell cycle arrest .
Furthermore , where senescence is concerned , it is likely that end - to - end joining between “ signal - free ends ” ( probably the same as the “ ultra - short telomeres ” discussed above ) are more relevant than bulk telomere shortening .
I mention this not to argue one way or the other about the relative importance of individual vs. population lengths as related to telomeres as a biomarker of aging , but rather to give a cautionary example of a situation in which the easiest measurement to make ( the distribution of lengths in a population ) does n’t appear to be the most relevant .
Sir Hugh Orde , the Police Service of Northern Ireland 's chief constable , warned yesterday that groups such as the Real IRA would target England if they could .
His warning came within hours of a PSNI statement confirming that its officers had set up a number of vehicle checkpoints on routes from the republic into Northern Ireland .
Vehicles were stopped and searched yesterday along a number of main routes , including the main Dublin to Belfast road at Loughbrickland .
Speaking at Stormont yesterday , Orde said groups such as the Real IRA intended to cause " much damage " to the peace process .
Although the chief constable said that at present he believed the Real IRA and other dissident factions did not have the capability to strike in England , they intended to do so .
" They want to destroy what has been achieved in Northern Ireland , " he said .
The Real IRA , which was blamed for the 1998 Omagh bomb massacre , has been re-organising over the last 12 months .
Late last year it shot and wounded two PSNI officers in Dungannon and Derry .
The re-emergence is also causing concern in the republic , where Irish security officials say they have advised Bertie Ahern 's government that a visit by the Queen this year could provide a rallying point for violent dissident republican protests .
Sources said they were particularly concerned about a rerun of the " Love Ulster " riots two years ago , when demonstrations against a loyalist march through Dublin ended with rioting and looting in the city centre .
Three years ago the Irish president , Mary McAleese , issued the Queen with an open invitation to the republic .
However , it is understood the cabinet , including Ahern , have now decided that there will be no British royal visit in 2008 .
The Queen will be in Northern Ireland just 24 hours before the 10th anniversary of the Good Friday peace agreement .
Buckingham Palace has confirmed that she will attend a Maundy Thursday service at St Patrick 's Church of Ireland Cathedral in Armagh city .
A plan to provide free wireless broadband throughout Dublin has been abandoned .
Dublin City Council has decided the plan would be contrary to EU law on state aid , as well as not financially possible .
The project is estimated to cost € 27m .
But the Labour Party , which says it originally proposed the idea of a free wi-fi city , has accused the Council of backing down as a result of pressure from the telecommunications industry .
Dublin City Council says it still intends to provide free broadband access on a test basis to areas like Ballymun and Ballyfermot , where there is a lack of coverage .
Free wireless access will also be available in public libraries and public buildings .
With baby boomers preparing to retire as the best educated and most skilled workforce in U.S. history , a growing chorus of demographers and labor experts is raising concerns that workers in California and the nation lack the critical skills needed to replace them .
In particular , experts say , the immigrant workers needed to fill many of the boomer jobs lack the English - language skills and basic educational levels to do so .
Many immigrants are ill - equipped to fill California ’s fastest - growing positions , including computer software engineers , registered nurses and customer service representatives , a new study by the Washington - based Migration Policy Institute found .
Immigrants -- legal and illegal -- already constitute almost half of the workers in Los Angeles County and are expected to account for nearly all of the growth in the nation ’s working - age population by 2025 because native - born Americans are having fewer children .
But the study , based largely on U.S. Census data , noted that 60 % of the county ’s immigrant workers struggle with English and one - third lack high school diplomas .
The looming mismatch in the skills employers need and those workers offer could jeopardize the future economic vitality of California and the nation , experts say .
Los Angeles County , the largest immigrant metropolis with about 3.5 million foreign - born residents , is at the forefront of this demographic trend .

“ The question is , are we going to be a 21st century city with shared prosperity , or a Third World city with an elite group on top and the majority at poverty or near poverty wages ? ” asked Ernesto Cortes Jr. , Southwest regional director of the Industrial Areas Foundation , a leadership development organization .
“ Right now we ’re headed toward becoming a Third World city .
But we can change that . ”
How to respond to the inexorable demographic trends is a question sparking a flurry of studies , conferences and new programs .
This week , a USC conference featuring Cortes , former federal housing secretary Henry Cisneros and other community leaders will explore ways to help immigrants better integrate into career - oriented jobs and civic life .
The Los Angeles Community College District has launched a workforce development committee of city officials and community leaders to figure out how to better prepare students for skills needed in the region .
Last week , more than 500 people gathered at Crenshaw High School at a conference sponsored by One LA - IAF , a network of more than 100 churches , unions and community groups .
The network has launched a collaboration with community colleges and employers to recruit low - wage workers , many of them immigrants , and train them for jobs as nursing assistants and solar - panel installers .

“ Our vision is to create a seamless program that takes undereducated , underemployed and underskilled workers and puts them into education and job training that will connect them to career ladders that pay well and offer benefits , ” said Yvonne Mariajimenez , a One LA leader .
“ It ’s really rebuilding the middle class . ”
One of the current trainees is Wendy Estrada , a 30 - year - old Honduras native and naturalized U.S. citizen who aspires to move from her current work as a house cleaner to a certified nursing assistant and ultimately to work as a licensed vocational nurse .
Estrada first learned about the program at her parish , St. Thomas the Apostle Catholic Church in Los Angeles .
One LA organizers came to recruit members for the pilot program , funded by the state community college system , offering free classes to upgrade English and math skills to levels required for a certified nursing assistant course .
Estrada used to dream of becoming a doctor in Honduras before marriage , motherhood and work struggles in Los Angeles waylaid those plans .
She learned English soon after legally arriving in Los Angeles to join her mother in 1998 , so determined to master the language that she went to classes morning and night , five hours a day , for a year .

When the recruiters came to her parish , Estrada immediately applied .
“ I loved the slogan , ‘ Building a bridge to a new and brighter future , ’ ” she said .
“ I knew that education can improve your life , but it was like I fell asleep having to work , pay the rent and just survive .
This program has reawakened my dreams . ”
For four months , she received training at Los Angeles Valley College in basic math and English skills geared toward healthcare work -- calculating a baby ’s head measurement , for instance -- along with skills in time management , meeting goals , interviewing and job hunting .
In February , Estrada began her certified nursing assistant course , where she has gained both practical skills and academic knowledge .
On a recent afternoon , she huddled over another student posing as a patient while trying to figure out which way to turn him to remove a protective bed pad .
Instructor Dory Higgins strode over , took a quick glance and showed Estrada the right technique .

“ You change the soiled pad immediately , before you do anything else , because of skin damage , ” Higgins said as students took notes .
The growing import of immigrant workers is reflected in Higgins ’ class .
Among 21 students in class that day , 17 were immigrants from a range of countries : Mexico , India , Guatemala , Egypt , Honduras , Indonesia , Cuba , Congo , Ukraine and the tiny West African nation of Burkina Faso .
One of them was Maria Reyes , 30 , a Guatemala native who signed up for the program through her church .
Reyes , who came to Los Angeles at age 5 , graduated from high school and got pregnant at 18 ; she began working as a waitress to bring in money for her new family .
Her minimum - wage job , however , was leading nowhere .
“ I wanted to keep doing something better , ” Reyes said .
“ This way I ’m helping my family and other people with needs too . ”

The class practices with mentors at the Center at Park West nursing home in Reseda .
On a recent Sunday , Estrada showed up at 7 a.m. to make the rounds with Beatrice Bustamante , a veteran nursing assistant from Colombia .
The pair chatted and joked with the elderly residents as they helped them with massages and shaves , bathing and denture care .
The job is n’t easy .
On her first day , Estrada cried at the shock of seeing residents coughing up their food , suffering loneliness and isolation .
But she said she loved helping the residents -- and they seemed to enjoy her as well .
“ They ’re the best , ” said Edna Berry , an octogenarian who is bedridden with a gangrenous leg .
“ These people are as much family to me as my own family . ”
Park West administrator Carrie Marks estimated that 90 % of her 110 staff positions are filled by immigrants , who she said make up the “ vast majority ” of job applicants .

“ It ’s in the self - interest of the older generation to have immigrants here , ” said Dowell Myers , a USC urban planning and demography professor and author of the 2007 book “ Immigrants and Boomers : Forging a New Social Contract for the Future of America . ”
“ Even if you do n’t like it , you have to ask the question :
Who ’s going to fill your jobs , buy your homes and pay the taxes for old - age support programs ? ”
Myers said .
Nearly one - third of all Americans -- 76 million people -- were born between 1946 and 1964 .
Boomer retirements are projected to open up nearly 1 million jobs in Los Angeles County and 3 million in California in the next decade .
The ratio of seniors to workers is expected to double in the next 20 years in Los Angeles -- a more rapid pace than is expected for the state or nation , Myers said .

The new Migration Policy Institute report , however , noted promising opportunities in Los Angeles for better integrating immigrants into mainstream economic and civic life .
The region has a more settled immigrant population ; new immigration to Los Angeles is at its lowest level in more than 30 years .
An expanding and more culturally integrated population of immigrants ’ children and increasing naturalization rates among immigrants could also help ease the transition , said Michael Fix , vice president of the institute and co-author of the study .
“ L.A. is probably better equipped than in the past to deal with this , but still faces pretty big obstacles , ” Fix said .
The challenge of filling boomer jobs has prompted several firms and public agencies to start their own training programs .
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power projects that one - third of its 8,300 workers will be eligible for retirement in the next five years .
It is teaming up with unions to recruit new apprentices for such jobs as electrical distribution mechanics and help them learn the trade .
Entry - level meter readers earn about $ 12 an hour , but electrical distribution mechanics can earn $ 48,000 a year with health benefits .

Susana Reyes , who works with the joint training institute run by the utility and electrical workers union , said she did not know how many new recruits were immigrants , but that a recent class included 40 % Latinos and 40 % African Americans .
“ We are anxious to make sure a pipeline of workers is out there and of the quality we need , ” she said .
Ultimately , experts say , greater investments in public education , a renewed focus on vocational education and better job training are critical to California ’s continued prosperity .
Stephen Levy of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy said the foundation for the state ’s robust economy was laid by farsighted politicians and voters from both parties .
They supported the GI Bill , Pell grants and the vast expansion of the state university system , Levy said , producing the best educated workforce in U.S. and California history .
The investments more than paid off : Every dollar invested in public education produces $ 8 in added tax revenues , according to Myers .
He and others worry that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s proposed cuts in the education budget could cripple efforts to produce the well - educated and skilled workers California urgently needs .

Even some groups that advocate a reduction in legal immigration as a way to preserve U.S. jobs agree with the idea of better training for the existing workforce .
“ Absolutely we would favor educating and training the labor force of legal immigrants over bringing in more foreign workers , ” said Roy Beck , president of the Virginia - based NumbersUSA .
“ Let ’s invest in people we have here . ”

The Federal Reserve Bank's $ 29 - billion effort to salvage Wall Street firm Bear Stearns raises the perennial bailout question :
To intervene or not to intervene ?
The answer usually turns on the notion that some companies are simply " too big to fail " – the broader economy would suffer if the firm went under .
It 's an understandable concept , but for too long the exclusive focus has been on preventing failure .
Maybe it 's time to start preventing bigness , too .
The recent bailout , which Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke defended last week , has unleashed the usual torrent of scolding from the laissez - faire devotees who have criticized previous government bailouts of giant failing firms such as Lockheed , Chrysler , Long Term Capital Management , and big banks that gorged themselves on bad Latin American debt .
Such government intervention , these critics charge , is an abomination in a free - market economy :
It nurtures " moral hazard " by rewarding failure , and encourages irresponsible decisionmaking by firms that assume the government will bail them out .
It puts taxpayers on the hook for the private mistakes of others .
And it is " lemon socialism " when firms keep the profits while taxpayers bear the losses .
Pragmatists , however , point to the size of Bear Stearns – its stature as the nation 's fifth largest investment bank , and its entanglement in some $ 10 trillion of financial contracts – to justify the Fed 's intervention as necessary to avoid the catastrophic damage that Bear 's collapse could have inflicted on the economy .
Failure to save Bear Stearns , the president of a federal reserve bank testified , could have led to " widespread insolvencies , severe and protracted damage to the financial system and , ultimately , to the economy as a whole . "
What both groups fail to recognize , however , is that the heart of the bailout dilemma in a democratic , free - enterprise society is " corporate bigness . "
Corporate giantism pits the core principle of private enterprise against the central principle of democratic government , and puts society in the no-win position of adhering to one principle or the other , but not both .
Government can uphold the free - market principle by refusing to bail out collapsing giants and make them responsible for the consequences of their own private decisionmaking – but only by risking broader economic turmoil and violating the democratic principle of government that 's accountable to , and mindful of , citizens .
On the other hand , a democratic government can respond to the plight of the citizenry by bailing out a collapsing giant like Bear Stearns ( or Chrysler ) – but at the expense of violating the cardinal principle of personal responsibility integral to the functioning of private enterprise .
Mistakes happen .
When they 're made by smaller firms , no transcending social dilemma occurs .
Their collapse , while tragic for those involved , poses no threat to the economy at large .
In the case of a colossus such as Bear Stearns , however , private tragedy is a public catastrophe because the firm is so big and its far - flung operations affect so many .
As a result , disproportionately large firms come to be perceived as being too big and too important to be allowed to fail .
This reality , of course , turns on its head the gospel of economic Darwinism preached by laissez - faire devotees .
It results in survival of the fattest , not the fittest – survival of the biggest , not the best .
One way out of this bailout dilemma is to make government less accountable and more despotic by rendering it less responsive to the pleas of the affected millions – a highly unattractive option .
A better way – and a more conservative one – would be to prevent such giantism in the first place .
How ?
By seeing antitrust laws as important instruments for limiting a free society 's vulnerability to big - firm bailouts .
The consolidation process has raged through most major American industries , from telecommunications and oil to pharmaceuticals and defense weapons .
In the banking and finance sectors , the urge to merge has spawned the very behemoths that the Fed is now compelled to prop up .
Instead of celebrating mega-mergers that combine corporate giants , perhaps we should see these combinations as bailout time bombs waiting to explode – and challenge them under US antitrust laws .
We should consider antitrust as more than a policy to promote competition and the economic benefits that flow from it .
We should also value it as a vital instrument for upholding principles of private enterprise and principles of representative democracy by preventing too many economic eggs from being consolidated into too few , too big baskets .
When those gigantic baskets fail , everyone gets splattered .

Breaking up large classes into several smaller ones helps students , but the improvements in many cases come in spite of what teachers do , new research suggests .
New findings from four nations , including the USA , tell a curious story .
Small classes work for children , but that 's less because of how teachers teach than because of what students feel they can do :
Get more face time with their teacher , for instance , or work in small groups with classmates .
" Small classes are more engaging places for students because they 're able to have a more personal connection with teachers , simply by virtue of the fact that there are fewer kids in the classroom competing for that teacher 's attention , " says Adam Gamoran of the University of Wisconsin - Madison , who analyzed the findings .
The data , from the USA , England , Hong Kong and Switzerland , were presented Monday at the first day of the American Educational Research Association 's annual meeting , the world 's largest gathering of education researchers .
The findings are consistent with what researchers already know , Gamoran says .
" There is not good evidence that teachers modify their instruction in response to changes in class size .
Some teachers are taking advantage of small classes and others are not .
There 's a lot of variability . "
Though two of the four studies were inconclusive , some point to promising trends .
In one study , researchers closely watched students ' behaviors in 10 - second intervals throughout class periods and found that in smaller classes in both elementary and high school , students stayed more focused and misbehaved less .
They also had more direct interactions with teachers and worked more in small groups rather than by themselves .
But overall , Gamoran says , teachers did n't necessarily take advantage of the smaller classes , often teaching as if in front of a larger group .
In one study , researchers found that few teachers took the opportunity to incorporate motivational activities or demonstrate to students what they wanted them to do as they introduced a lesson .
" It 's not like you reduce classes so teachers do something different and achievement is higher , " he says .
" That neat little package does n't exist . "
One of the teams , led by Ronald Ehrenberg of Cornell University , notes that the potential benefits of class - size reduction " may be greater than what we observe " if only a few teachers change their teaching to accommodate the smaller group .
For more than two decades , class - size reduction has been a key improvement strategy in several states , most notably in California , which since 1996 has spent billions of dollars to ensure that students get small classes in primary grades .
Smaller classes also have been endorsed by teachers unions , but recent findings have cast doubts on the idea , in California and elsewhere .
This month , researchers at Northwestern University released data from a long - term class - size reduction effort in Tennessee showing that smaller classes improve achievement overall , but they seem to benefit high - achieving students more than low achievers .
Because low - income students are more likely to be low achievers , researchers say , the effort is doing little to reduce the stubborn " achievement gap " that it intended to eradicate .

On Friday Alistair Darling told reporters in Washington that there would not be a house price crash in Britain .
Aargh !
I was reasonably confident until then that Britain would not experience the scale of disaster that has encompassed America , for the slump in house prices there has probably pushed the country into recession .
Sure , the inflated values of the past year would be trimmed and so there would be some decline for a couple of years , but not a real crash with all its disruption and misery .
We had a taste of that in the early 1990s , as Kenneth Clarke acknowledges here .
Negative equity is not a great outcome for borrowers and lenders alike , nor indeed for the economy as a whole .
So let 's hope that Mr Darling 's comment does n't prove a hostage to fortune and on this at least he proves right .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
And yet surely affordable housing is a good thing – the idea that houses should be cheap enough for all , not just a special group that qualify for a government scheme .
That would mean lower house prices relative to incomes , a smaller debt burden on buyers , less of a gap in wealth between people who had bought their homes many years ago and those now struggling to buy their first place .
But houses are not just places to live .
They are also a store of wealth , the largest asset of most people alongside their pension rights .
So there is an inevitable complicity between home - owners and everyone with an interest in housing : estate agents , mortgage lenders , politicians and so on .
The very language we use – getting on to the housing ladder , how much money we have " made " on our home – implies that there will be steady growth in house prices .
This is understandable , for the entire developed world has had 60 years of inflation , very rapid at times .
So while there have been blips , in the middle 1970s and early 1990s , when prices did fall , in the end an investment in a home has almost always proved a good one .
Inflation in the economy as a whole saved even imprudent borrowers , provided they could hang on through the dips .
Maybe inflation will save home - owners again .
In five , 10 or however many years ' time there will be another boom and people will crow about how they bought in the 2008/09 downturn and the profit they made since then .
But we should not forget that a house price boom redistributes wealth in a random and socially destructive way .
Look who benefits : the old , the well paid , people with family money , people who buy bigger houses than they need , people who live in areas of strong job growth .
And who loses ?
The young , the moderately paid , people who have to make their own way in the world , people who are modest in their housing needs , people who live in struggling regions .
So what is to be done ?
Present government efforts to try to buffer people from the effects of a price boom are really just patches .
Some , by directing homes to particular types of worker , and therefore restricting the supply of new homes coming on to the market , may make the long - term problem worse .
Housing is a familiar victim of the law of unintended consequences : look at how rent controls dried up the supply of private rented accommodation , ultimately increasing rents .
What we need is reasonable stability in house prices .
That means a period of flat , or at least flattish , prices to allow incomes to catch up .
Much better a plateau than a crash .
It would make for a much calmer housing market were mortgages to continue to be restricted , so that people were not encouraged to borrow beyond sensible limits .
We need to think about the supply of homes and that means looking at the way planning laws in practice have restricted the building programme .
Britain is not alone in having had a housing boom that has now come to an end .
Many other countries , quite aside from the US , now look pretty exposed too .
Whether Mr Darling is right or not , these are going to be tougher times .
Surely we can use this period to learn from what we have got wrong and try to see that next time we do better .

The Standish group recently completed an extensive study that examines factors influencing open - source adoption .
Based on five years of research and analysis , the report provides intriguing insights into open - source adoption levels and the way that open source is reshaping the software industry .
Individuals who participated in the Standish survey identified several key drivers for open source adoption , including lower costs , better security and reliability , and faster development speed .
According to the report , open - source software reduces the initial cost of launching new projects .
" When budgets are tight it 's all too easy to get sucked into the assumption that whatever the project may be , it will be faced with an immediate ' no . '
Open source can turn that ' no ' into a ' yes . ' , " the report says .
It also examines long - term budget benefits too and points out that open source adoption can rescue companies from the " hidden cost associated with packaged software upgrades . "
Another open - source advantage that is broadly recognized by the survey participants is security .
Over 70 percent said that Red Hat Linux is less vulnerable to security issues than Microsoft 's operating system .
When questioned on quality and reliability , the survey participants did n't see as much of a gap — 22 percent said that Red Hat Linux offers higher quality than Windows and 66 percent said that the two products offer comparable quality .
The ability to adapt existing open - source applications to meet specialized needs is one of the most significant adoption drivers addressed by the Standish report .
Starting with an existing code base can accelerate development considerably and reduce much of the cost .
" Using open source creates an instant baseline for any project .
This baseline not only includes working programs , but also requirements , documentation , support procedures , and education material , " the report says .
" In many cases , especially in infrastructure software , the baseline is a fully developed and working system . "
Although the Standish group and its survey participants have a lot of nice things to say about open source software , they also highlight some weaknesses that impede adoption .
Many companies lack confidence in their ability to handle a migration to open source .
78 percent of the survey respondents said that their organizations are only poorly or moderately skilled at integrating open source software into their IT infrastructure .
As we have previously discussed , this particular issue creates immense demand for preintegrated open - source solutions .
Despite adoption challenges , the Standish report concludes that open source software is a big win for businesses , which are saving billions and passing that savings along to consumers .
" Open source dominates web server installations and is an integral part of most e-commerce websites , " the report says .
" The open - source movement is advancing because of feature - rich , secure , high - quality , reliable software with compelling economic benefits . "
Explaining preparations for the " break out " , Hugh Duncan , 48 , from Lyme Regis , said : " The French lift the cable every evening at 7 pm to let their own boats in , but nobody out .
That 's when we were going to make our run for freedom .
The fishermen managed to deal with one boat trying to escape , but they would n't be able to deal with dozens .
This is what you might call our Trafalgar moment . "
After a hot and torrid few months , Steve Wozniak 's love affair with the iPhone is waning .
" To tell you the truth I was really disappointed when the iPhone was introduced ... half the phones in the AT&T store at the time were 3G phones , " Wozniak said at a press conference , according to a Sydney Morning Herald report .
" I was shocked because Apple is bringing the full internet [ to mobiles ] – full web pages with pictures and everything – and it's not 3G and I knew that would be a speed detriment . "
It 's a far cry from his earlier comments .
The Apple co-founder waited in line with everyone else to buy " a whole bunch " of iPhones , and recently raved that the iPhone will revolutionize cell phones and the way we communicate .
But today Wozniak sounded annoyed .
He disputed claims that Apple chose not to roll out a 3G phone due to battery concerns .
" I do n't understand why it would be a battery issue – I get as much life on my 3G phones as I get on my non -3G phones , " he reportedly said .
Wozniak also complained about the 24 - hour expiration period on iTunes movie rentals and said that although there 's a " pureness " to MacBook Air , it needs a DVD drive .
" I do n't think it 's going to be a hit , " he said .

COALINGA , California ( CNN ) -- Noel Bosse and Ken Davis watch as the numbers keep spinning at the gas pump -- 70 bucks , 80 bucks .
Gulp , guzzle , then it stops : $ 101 for about 25 gallons .
Gas prices in California are the nation 's highest , already soaring over $ 4 a gallon in some areas .
The $ 100 fill - up has arrived in the United States .
" I think it 's absolutely ridiculous , " Bosse said with disgust .
Bosse and Davis are returning from Las Vegas , Nevada , to their home near Seattle , Washington .
They 're pulling a trailer full of Arabian horses with their passenger van .
Bosse says they 're averaging 200 miles every fill - up , or 10 miles to the gallon .
Watch how soaring prices are changing lives »
Bosse has been showing dogs and horses in competitions across the country for 35 years .
With gas prices soaring , she 's starting to rethink some of the upcoming shows .
" We 're sitting here hauling a horse trailer , eating gas , " she said .
" I do n't see how people make it these days . "
California is home to the nation 's highest average gas price , $ 3.87 for regular unleaded ; diesel is pushing $ 4.43 a gallon , according to Troy Green of AAA .
San Francisco is the most expensive city , averaging $ 3.97 a gallon .
However , a drive around the city shows that many stations have jumped over $ 4 .
The national average for regular unleaded is $ 3.53 and rising daily .
Last year at this time , it was $ 2.86 per gallon .
According to AAA , 24 states and the District of Columbia are averaging at or above $ 3.50 a gallon for regular unleaded .
The state with the lowest gas is in New Jersey , at $ 3.34 per gallon .
California Gas Crunch California is home to the nation 's highest average gas prices .
Here is a glimpse of prices across the state , according to AAA as of April 23 :
 San Francisco $ 3.97 per gallon ; last year $ 3.47
 Los Angeles $ 3.85 ; last year $ 3.32
 San Jose $ 3.89 ; last year $ 3.36
 Sacramento $ 3.86 ; last year $ 3.30
 San Diego $ 3.88 ; last year $ 3.35
Green says Americans should expect the price to increase another 25 cents over the next month and continue to climb over the summer months .
" A national average approaching $ 4 a gallon should not be ruled out by consumers later this year , " he said .
Watch truckers head to Mexico for $ 2 gas »
AAA has seen that when gas prices hit " exorbitant levels , " as Green puts it , Americans change their vacation plans .
During such times , he says , Americans are more prone to travel closer to home , stay at less expensive hotels , eat at fast - food restaurants rather than fancier dine - in restaurants and plan more online trips looking for the best deals .
This year 's record high gas prices , coupled with a slow economy and the mortgage crisis , have had a cascading effect .
A person making $ 9 an hour needs to work nearly seven hours just to pay for 15 gallons at $ 4 a gallon , according to CNN. com 's gas calculator .

" It seems many American consumers are being hard hit from multiple directions , and their overall budgets are being maxed to the limit , " Green said .
As for California , Green added , " It 's unbelievable out there . "
That 's a sentiment shared by Diddy Dennis , a cab driver in San Francisco .
He 's been driving for nearly 11 years , and the gas prices are directly cutting into his wallet .
He recalls the early 2000s , when people started complaining when gas out West started hitting $ 2.60 .
" That looks like heaven now , " Dennis said .
His big smile and warm laugh provides an air of calm in his cab , even if he 's eating into his way of life every time he presses the gas pedal .
He estimates that he 's making about 60 percent less than he used to when he first started driving .
" It 's really hitting us , " he said .
San Francisco commuter Debbie Jasmin says she 's stopped driving her gas - gobbling Expedition and started taking the subway to work more .
She 's also curbed summer travel plans .
" I do n't really think we have seen the worst of it , " Jasmin said .
At a San Francisco Chevron , Scott Roberts is stunned when he pulls into the station in his pint - sized Toyota Prius , which gets more than 40 miles per gallon .
The person before him paid $ 115.80 for 27.9 gallons .
The price at the station ranges from $ 4.14 for regular unleaded to $ 4.39 for supreme unleaded .
Roberts mutters the Lord 's name in vain .
" This is brutal , " he said .
" Today 's the first time I 've seen it over $ 4 in my lifetime . "
By the time he 's finished , it 's cost him $ 43 to fill his Prius -- an amount that just a few years ago was reserved for giant sports utility vehicles and pickups .
Nearby , Dolly Sarlo fills up her black Mercedes .
She says it 's time for Americans to " vote with your dollars and to stop using gas " and use public transportation more .
" That would really , very quickly bring down the price , " she said .
She then drives off .

What Programming Languages Should You Know ?
By David Chisnall
Date : Mar 9 , 2007
Article is provided courtesy of Prentice Hall Professional .
Return to the article
David Chisnall posits that the more programming languages you know , the better .
The point is not to stuff your head with language rules .
Rather , he explains how being able to read multiple languages , even if you never code in them , can help you to select the best possible tool for each coding need — and understand the limitations of the tools you 're using .
Learning foreign languages helps to broaden your mind because some concepts are much better expressed in one language than another .
German , for example , really has no word for " fluffy , " although it does have words for " furry " and " fuzzy . "
Similarly , English has no elegant way of expressing the difference between libre and gratis in Spanish .
Natural languages adopt concepts from each other over the years and tend toward the same expressive abilities .
Programming languages are different .
A programming language may be defined by a specification , but is always limited by the abilities of the compilers and interpreters that execute it .
If a particular language does n’t support a given feature , you ca n’t just steal a few words from another language and use them , as you might with a natural language .
While you can combine languages in a single project , you typically have to do this across well - defined interfaces , rather than by just stealing some syntax from one language and using it in another .
This kind of thing is n’t just an abstract problem .
If you ’re writing code that queries a database , you ’re probably going to be using at least two languages .
Because most general - purpose languages do n’t have semantics that map clearly onto a database , you ’ll need to embed something like SQL or XPath .
Now , imagine that you want to express a transitive closure in your query .
SQL is n’t expressive enough to implement a transitive closure ( although some vendor - specific extensions permit this ) , so you might have to implement it by using a stored procedure in a third language .
The ability to use different languages when they suit the task at hand is a sign of a good coder .
The more languages you learn , the easier it is to pick up a new one .
Eventually , you start thinking of every new language as just a set of modifications to a language you know already .
So what languages should you learn that will help you to quickly build up the set of basic concepts and let you pick up other languages easily ?
The rest of this article contains my answer to this question .
Note that I ’m not necessarily advocating using any of these languages for a real project , but I believe that learning them will make you a better programmer in whatever language you do use .
C : Portable Assembly
Whatever language you choose for writing code , eventually that code will be turned into a set of very simple machine instructions .
These instructions will be executed more or less sequentially ( superscalar architectures notwithstanding ) .
A good programmer needs to be able to think at multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously , and the best way of accomplishing this goal for the lower levels is to use a language that closely mimics processor operation .
A decade or two ago , the most sensible way of achieving this objective would be by learning assembly language .
These days , however , few processors actually execute machine language instructions directly , so a language like C is n’t much different in terms of abstractions .
A modern x86 CPU , for example , typically has some hidden registers used for storing items on the stack , so the items that an assembly language programmer believes are stored in registers are not quite the same as those that the CPU actually stores .
Being one layer of abstraction higher than an assembly language , C has the advantage that it ’s not tied to a particular CPU architecture .
This faculty has helped C to gain widespread use ; even if you never write a line of C code , you undoubtedly will have to read C code at some point or other .
On VMS , there was a well - defined ABI for all procedural languages , so it was trivial to call one from another .
Microsoft Windows had COM , which allowed all languages to deal easily with objects from other languages ( as long as both languages were C++ ) , and now we have .NET , which does the same thing ( as long as both languages are C# ) .
In the UNIX world , the standard way of exporting an interface to a library is via C , irrespective of which language you ’re using .
For a program in language A , calling a function in a library written in language B almost always involves going via C .
Smalltalk
Smalltalk is the archetypal object - oriented ( OO ) language .
It was developed at Xerox PARC by a group including Alan Kay , who first coined the term object - oriented .
The concept behind object - oriented programming is that you can simplify development of software if you split your general - purpose computer into a load of simple specialized computers ( objects ) that communicate by message - passing .
This simplicity has been lost in a lot of later languages .
Smalltalk is a pure OO language : Everything is an object .
Classes are a special kind of object used to create other objects .
Even the messages passed to objects ( the Smalltalk replacement for function calls in procedural languages ) are themselves objects .
One of the most important reasons for learning Smalltalk is that the syntax is not C - like .
Most recent languages have adopted C - like syntax to make themselves more appealing to a generation of C programmers .
This fact has led to a widespread belief that C syntax is the " correct " way of designing a programming language .
Smalltalk was developed a few years after C , but before C gained widespread adoption , and so did n’t inherit the syntax .
A statement in Smalltalk , like an imperative statement in a natural language , contains a subject , a verb , and optionally an object .
Once you ’re familiar with the syntax , one thing will strike you about Smalltalk :
The language is so " small " that it ’s almost nonexistent .
Smalltalk - the - language does n’t even include conditional statements .
In fact , the only kind of statement in Smalltalk is a message - passing statement .
Conditionals are implemented in the library ; you pass a message containing a block of code to a Boolean object , and it executes it if the Boolean object is true .
The power of this approach is quickly obvious :
Since all flow - control structures are part of the language , you can define your own very easily .
Do you want a for - each control structure ?
Simply add a method to your collection class that takes a block of code as an argument and executes it with each object in the collection .
Lisp
Eric S. Raymond once said , " Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it ; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days , even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot . "
The defining feature of Lisp is the syntax — or , rather , the lack of syntax .
When you compile any programming language , one of the first things your compiler will do is generate a syntax tree .
In Lisp , you write the syntax tree yourself .
As with Smalltalk , this approach gives you a great deal of flexibility .
Your Lisp code is a simple data structure that the language is designed to process , meaning that you can easily write a Lisp program that takes a Lisp program and performs some translations on it .
Because this is such a useful thing to do , features built into the language make it easy .
Lisp macros are very similar to functions , but they ’re executed at compile time , allowing you to transform the syntax tree easily .
It ’s often said that the correct way of writing code in Lisp is to write the problem and then write a domain - specific language that will compile the problem description .
This is a very good habit to get into because , for a lot of classes of problem , something close to the domain - specific language already exists .
Once you get used to the idea that each problem has a specific language in which it can be solved easily , you ’ll be better at choosing the correct language for any task .
Erlang
A few years ago , Erlang would n’t have been on this list .
It ’s the youngest language listed here — by quite a large margin .
Why is it here ?
Because it embodies a style of programming that will become more important as more computers employ a multi-core design .
Erlang is based on the communicating sequential processes ( CSP ) model of concurrency .
It provides a mechanism for creating independent processes very cheaply and for passing messages between those processes .
What separates Erlang from the other languages discussed thus far is that Erlang is built around asynchronous communication .
C and Lisp functions — and even Smalltalk messages — typically execute synchronously ; you start one and then wait for it to finish .
Sending an Erlang message does n’t block the sending process , so it can do something else while it waits for the process handling the message to complete .
This approach allows you to write very scalable code , without the pitfalls associated with threads .
There ’s no shared memory , so you never need to deal with locks .
You can still introduce deadlock if you have two processes waiting for each other , but this situation is quite rare .
Haskell
No set of essential languages would be complete without a functional programming language , and Haskell is a very good example of this paradigm .
As much as possible , functional languages dispense with the idea of global state .
Unlike a procedure , a pure function will always return the same value when called with the same arguments ; its result does n’t depend on anything other than the arguments .
Like Erlang , Haskell is a language closely related to a theoretical model for computation .
In this case , the model is ë-calculus .
The operations in Haskell map directly to the reductions permitted by ë-calculus , making the language very popular with people interested in formal verification .
You can easily map between a Haskell program and a set of ë-calculus terms , so anything you can prove about the terms also applies to the program .
For the most part , functions are not allowed to have side effects , and those that do are easy for the compiler to spot .
If a function does n’t have side effects , then the only constraint on when it can be executed is when you use the return value .
If you never use the return value , you can avoid evaluating it at all ( lazy evaluation ) .
This property allows you to extract parallelism implicitly from functional programs .
Consider the following pseudocode :
a = foo( ) b = bar ( )
In a procedural language , foo ( ) might alter some global state , and so the outcome of bar ( ) might depend on foo ( ) .
In a pure functional language , this is n’t the case , so foo ( ) and bar ( ) can be executed concurrently .
Prolog
The final language on my list is a slightly unusual choice .
All of the others are fairly flexible general - purpose languages .
Prolog is not .
While it is Turing - complete , and thus can be used to implement any algorithm , doing so is not always sensible .
Prolog is based on predicate logic , and is very good for building knowledge - based applications .
Any system that collects arbitrary relations between objects ( or concepts ) and performs some inference or reasoning about them is a good fit for Prolog .
The real reason for learning Prolog , however , is that it ’s about as unlike C as possible while still having a useful language .
Once you can think in Prolog as easily as in an imperative language , you ’ll find it very easy to adapt to new programming models .
Like functional languages , Prolog does n’t allow global variables .
In fact , it does n’t allow assignment in the classical sense .
Variables in Prolog can have only one value for their entire lifespan — a characteristic that Erlang inherited .
The first Erlang implementation was written in Prolog , so the syntaxes of both are quite similar .
Any More ?
This list is by no means exhaustive .
Learning new languages almost always will make you a better programmer .
The important thing to remember , however , is not to restrict yourself to languages that share too many concepts .
If you know Java and C , learning C++ wo n’t stretch you .
It ’s also worth remembering that you do n’t have to use a language to benefit from knowing it .
If you know assembly language for the processor on which you ’re working , this knowledge will help you in writing high - level code , since you ’ll be able to keep in mind what ’s actually going on when you execute your code .
Similarly , familiarity with a higher - level language will help you to write better - structured code in a lower - level language .
Eventually , someone might create a programming language that is the ideal choice for all uses .
( Lisp programmers will argue that this has already happened . )
Until then , however , the more languages you know , the easier it will be for you to select the correct tool for the job .
More importantly , you ’ll be better able to determine the suitability of the language you ’re using .

PhD thesis , 2002
Inspired by the wonderful page Robert Glenn Scharein has dedicated to his PhD thesis Interactive Topological Drawing , I decided to give my own thesis a happy little home on the internet .
Like Robert , I wanted to include some of the figures from the thesis with which I was particularly pleased .

Abstract
Throughout history , geometric patterns have formed an important part of art and ornamental design .
Today we have unprecedented ability to understand ornamental styles of the past , to recreate traditional designs , and to innovate with new interpretations of old styles and with new styles altogether .
The power to further the study and practice of ornament stems from three sources .
We have new mathematical tools : a modern conception of geometry that enables us to describe with precision what designers of the past could only hint at .
We have new algorithmic tools : computers and the abstract mathematical processing they enable allow us to perform calculations that were intractable in previous generations .
Finally , we have technological tools : manufacturing devices that can turn a synthetic description provided by a computer into a real - world artifact .
Taken together , these three sets of tools provide new opportunities for the application of computers to the analysis and creation of ornament .
In this dissertation , I present my research in the area of computer - generated geometric art and ornament .
I focus on two projects in particular .
First I develop a collection of tools and methods for producing traditional Islamic star patterns .
Then I examine the tessellations of M.C. Escher , developing an “ Escherization ” algorithm that can derive novel Escher - like tessellations of the plane from arbitrary user - supplied shapes .
Throughout , I show how modern mathematics , algorithms , and technology can be applied to the study of these ornamental styles .

Favourite Figures
I enjoy creating expository diagrams .
My thesis already had a great deal of graphics by virtue of being in the field of computer graphics , but I wanted to use graphics as much as possible to explain concepts , or failing that to help clarify the writing .

WASHINGTON ( AP )  President Bush threatened a veto Tuesday in the debate to update terrorist surveillance laws , assailing Democratic plans to deny protection from lawsuits for telecommunications providers that let the government spy on U.S. residents after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
The threat came in a 12 - page letter to Senate leaders from Attorney General Michael Mukasey and National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell .
It was issued as lawmakers prepare to vote on legislation seeking to update a 1978 surveillance law without violating privacy rights .
" If the president is sent a bill that does not provide the U.S. intelligence agencies the tools they need to protect the nation , the president will veto the bill , " wrote Mukasey and McConnell .
The letter was sent to Senate leaders and the top Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence committees .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , said the letter was premature since there still is n't any legislation yet .
" It 's a little early to have a veto threat , " he said .
The existing surveillance law will expire Feb. 15 .
Bush has said he would resist extending it again .
After nearly two months of legislative wrangling , Reid announced the Senate would begin voting on amendments Wednesday .
Debate began Tuesday evening .
The administration 's veto threat was aimed at amendments that would bar retroactive immunity to phone companies and other telecom providers that have given the government access to e-mails and phone calls linked to people in the United States .
Without the retroactive protections , the letter noted , telecom providers might be unwilling to help the government track down terror suspects in the future as they were asked to do in the days following the 2001 attacks .
" Private citizens who respond in good faith to a request for assistance by public officials should not beheld liable for their actions , " Mukasey and McConnell wrote .
A bill already approved by the Senate Intelligence Committee " is not perfect , " Mukasey and McConnell wrote .
But since it provides the legal shields , they said they would support it if the amendments are dropped .
The Senate could vote on the surveillance bill and amendments this week .
Some 40 civil lawsuits have been filed against telecommunications companies .
They carry with them a threat of crippling financial penalties , which the White House says could bankrupt the companies .
Congress has struggled to strike a balance between catching terrorists and improperly spying on U.S. residents since last summer , when it sought to update the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
That law requires the government to get approval from a secret court when it seeks to electronically eavesdrop on suspected terrorists or spies in the United States .
The law does not apply to government wiretaps on people outside the country .
Over the years , however , foreign communications have been routed through technology based in the United States — raising the question of whether the government should have FISA court approval to listen in on those conversations .
The bill being debated now seeks to resolve that issue .
Civil rights and privacy advocates say current law , which Congress approved in August in a hasty attempt to update the 1978 version , still allows the government to eavesdrop on Americans without court oversight .
That law was set to expire Feb.
1 but was extended for two weeks as Congress works to hammer out a compromise .
The administration also rejected proposals to have the secret FISA court decide whether to give immunity to telecom firms , arguing that doing so could merely result in lengthy legal battles .
" It is for Congress , not the courts , to make the public policy decision whether to grant liability protection to telecommunication companies who are being sued simply because they are alleged to have assisted the government in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks , " Mukasey and McConnell wrote .

Dustin Browder , Lead Designer :
The Zerg are exciting because there 's a lot that they can do .
The Terrans are sort of limited conceptually more than the other two races .
The Protoss are all psychic and magic , who knows what they can do .
And the Zerg are equally strange and alien , there 's no preconceived notions as to what a Zerg creature can do , up to a point .
As opposed to a guy with a machine gun , you know what they 're about and have to work within those restrictions .
So it 's been cool with the Zerg , since we 've been able to run amok in terms of the kinds of abilities we 've been able to put on these units , and the kinds of wacky things that they can do .
And I guess also , the original game had a lot of delicious source material that we did n't really get to see a lot of .
We knew that the Zerg had the concept of infestation in the original game , but we did n't have a lot of units that could infest .
We had the Spawn Broodling , and the rare circumstance that a command center could be infested , but that almost never happened .
Since we had this source material that did n't get a lot of use , it was nice to explore it and put in some core units to make the Zerg feel like they were very swarmy and infesty , and spawning little horrible creatures every chance they got .
Dustin Browder : No , not yet .
The counters are pretty easy in a lot of ways .
For the most part , with the controls over cost and health and a lot of factors , the units are the most challenging portion in that respect .
The units like a Mothership or a Thor , a unit whose art speaks to a specific set of numbers .
If you start to break those numbers you get confused .
You can't have a weak Thor .
You can't have a Mothership that has very few hit points .
It just does n't work .
That 's when it starts to get challenging , when you get into art that you all kind of like , and you all can see it work , it constrains the direction you can go .
Dustin Browder : No , single - player is pretty flexible .
We can always add units and structures to single - player if we want to .
They ( multiplayer and single - player ) do n't have to be exactly the same .
You 're limited to the number of units you can have for a race in multiplayer before things get out of control .
But you can do things differently for single - player .
This is a game where you have to buy your own technology , which is different from any single - player game we 've made before .
If we want to have an extra five or six units , like Goliaths , Wraiths , and Vultures , and make these available in solo play , and give players more choice as to the kinds of purchases they 'll want to make , then that 's a choice that makes a lot of sense to us .
We 're allowed to break any rules we want , so solo play is more free in the sense that there are fewer balance requirements .
The challenge of remembering all the controls is not as frightening .
The game generally plays at a slower speed , we default you to a medium speed setting , which you can turn up but most players do n't .
Most multiplayer games are played much faster .
I think solo is the easier space in that respect .
We 've seen the Terrans and their take on the mighty Thor .
We 've seen the monolithic Protoss Mothership .
Today Blizzard unveiled the final slice of thetrifecta with a hands - on demonstration of the Zerg .
The Queen of Blades ' army is back , and they 're poised to infest a Terran base camp near you .
We sat down withLead Designer Dustin Browder to discuss the reimagining of this uniquely alien race .
At BlizzCon we went over the general design philosophy of , so let 's stick with the theme of the day , which is the Zerg .
Last we spoke , you discussed upgrading the Terran and Protoss .
Was there anything different about updating the Zerg ?
Did you find that since the Terrans are conceptually limited , you had to limit yourself with the Zerg , since you could n't come up with a rational counter for the Terrans ?
Did you find that 's success as a multiplayer game restricted your single - player design in any way ?
The best " catches " in dating land may be the worst choices in the long - run , new research shows .
Popular people who monitor themselves carefully in social situations and thereby appear to be the most socially appropriate are often highly sought after as romantic partners , a study finds , but these people show less satisfaction and commitment in relationships than socially - awkward people .
By self - monitoring , people assess how their actions affect others and adjust to fit the appropriateness of the situation .
They screen their words and behavior to suit the people around them .
" High self - monitors are social chameleons , " said Northwestern University professor of communication studies Michael E. Roloff .
" And , because they 're quick to pick up on social cues , are socially adept and unlikely to say things upsetting to others , they are generally well - liked and sought after . "
Self - monitoring is often a helpful attribute .
" Research finds [ self - monitors ] to be excellent negotiators and far more likely to be promoted at work than their low self - monitoring peers , ” Roloff said .
But there ’s a downside for high self - monitors when it comes to their romantic relationships .
" High self - monitors may appear to be the kind of people we want to have relationships with , but they themselves are less committed to and less happy in their relationships than low self - monitors , " Roloff said .
The problem seems to be that they can't turn the self - monitoring off .
" The desire to alter one 's personality to appropriately fit a given situation or social climate prevents high self - monitors from presenting their true selves during intimate interactions with their romantic partners , " Roloff said .
" High self - monitors are very likeable and successful people .
However , it appears they ’re just not deep . "
Roloff and co-authors Courtney N. Wright and Adrienne Holloway conducted a study of 97 single young adults to investigate the effects of self - monitoring on romantic relationships .
The results will be detailed in the journal Communication Reports .
The researchers surveyed study participants about the levels of emotional commitment in their romantic relationships and assessed their degrees of self - monitoring , intimate communication , levels of emotional commitment , relational satisfaction and relational commitment .
They did not survey the partners of study participants .
" That may be something we eventually should look at , " Roloff said .
High self - monitors seem to avoid face - threatening interactions and honest self - disclosure .
Thus partners of these people may be completely in the dark about the extent of their significant other ’s degree of commitment and regard .
" It 's not that high self - monitors are intentionally deceptive or evil , " Roloff said .
" They appear to have an outlook and way of achieving their goals that makes them attractive to us socially but that prevents them from being particularly happy or loyal in their romantic relationships . "
Conversely , the researchers found that low self - monitors — people who are the least concerned with social appropriateness and are unlikely to mask their feelings or opinions to avoid confrontation or preserve their self - image — are more committed to and more satisfied with their relationships .
Those awkward people who always seem to be sticking their feet in their mouths may ultimately be more genuine and capable of intimate relationships .
However , their honesty and loyalty can extract a price from their partners , because they may be more likely to say blunt and hurtful things .
Fortunately , Roloff said , self - monitoring is normally distributed , so most people end up with a partner who falls somewhere in the middle .
A person who moderately self - monitors may have great social skills and the ability to be unguarded with their partner when necessary .

Democratic lawmaker warns against Ala. ex -gov. Siegelman testifying to Congress Associated Press
Published : Monday March 31 , 2008

Print This Email This WASHINGTON - Democratic Rep. Artur Davis of Birmingham warned House Democrats Monday against calling Don Siegelman to testify before Congress , saying Republicans would use the occasion to try to embarrass the former Alabama governor .
In a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , D - Mich . , Davis said it would be " extremely unwise " to open Siegelman up to fresh attacks and could jeopardize his appeal .
Davis said the appearance would probably turn into a partisan debate over Siegelman 's guilt or innocence and shift attention from the committee 's true goal of determining whether Republican politics influenced his prosecution on corruption charges .
" I fear that we will undermine what we value most if we divert this committee into a fact - finding quest into what Don Siegelman did or did not do , " Davis wrote .
A former federal prosecutor , Davis is a member of the Judiciary Committee who has worked closely with Conyers and other Democrats to focus attention on Siegelman 's case .
But Davis said he was not told of the committee 's decision last week to seek Siegelman 's testimony and would have advised against it , even before the former governor was released from prison Friday while he appeals his case .
Davis said the committee should focus on getting testimony from political operatives , particularly from former chief White House adviser Karl Rove .
Siegelman 's testimony would probably provide little new information about Justice Department behavior , he said .
" We may offer ( Siegelman ) a day in the court of public opinion , but our critics will assail us for doing nothing more than second - guessing a jury verdict , " Davis wrote .
" The Republican opposition within the committee will use the occasion to discredit him with the least flattering facts of the trial and his governorship .
It is even conceivable that they could call some of the cooperating witnesses who testified against Siegelman to further damage his credibility . "
A spokeswoman for the committee said Conyers had no immediate comment on the letter .
Siegelman 's attorneys , who last week said Siegelman was eager to testify , could not immediately be reached Monday afternoon .
Siegelman and former HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy were convicted in June 2006 on bribery and obstruction of justice charges .
Federal prosecutors accused Siegelman of appointing Scrushy to a hospital regulatory board in exchange for Scrushy arranging $ 500,000 in contributions to Siegelman 's campaign for a statewide lottery .
The defense has argued there was no personal gain or quid - pro-quo in the deal , and Siegelman has long maintained that his prosecution was politically motivated .
After Siegelman served nine months in a sentence of more than seven years , the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ordered his release last week while the case is on appeal , saying the former governor had raised " substantial questions of fact and law " in challenging his conviction .
Last year , a GOP lawyer who once worked on the campaign of Republican Gov. Bob Riley said she overheard conversations among campaign officials in 2002 suggesting that Rove was involved in Siegelman 's prosecution .
Sentencing transcripts reveal that their daughter , Celeste , and Ms Deaves 's two other children from a previous marriage were taken into care by South Australia 's Department for Families and Communitiesbut had since been returned .
South Australian District Court judge Steven Millsteed took into account the pair 's early guilty pleas and the " consensual nature of your relationship " and recorded a single conviction for each of them .
They were released on a $ 500 good behaviour bond .
According to the transcripts , Mr Deaves was married to Ms Deaves 's mother about 40 years ago .
She divorced him when he was serving a prison sentence for armed robbery , while Ms Deaves was three or four years old .
Mr Deaves 's former wife did not encourage contact between him and his daughter , and it was about 30 years before they resumed contact .
By about 2000 , Mr Deaves was living with another wife and child at Yongala in South Australia and Ms Deaves was living with a former husband and two children , now nine and 11 , in Sydney .
Ms Deaves took her two children to stay with Mr Deaves in 2000 for about three weeks , during which time they became attracted to each other but did not develop a physical relationship .
Later in the year Mr and Ms Deaves each ended their marriages and began living together and moved to Rockhampton .
The first count of incest related to the conception of the first child while the second related to their second , Celeste , who was born last year after the couple moved to Port Pirie in South Australia .
They then moved to Bordertown in South Australia where the couple attracted the attention of the Department for Families and Communities .
" The police subsequently investigated the matter .
When interviewed by police you both made full admissions , " Judge Millsteed told the pair during sentencing .
Judge Millsteed said the offences were " atypical " cases of incest .
" This is not a case where a father has violated his daughter and used his position of authority to take advantage of her powerlessness , " he said .
" Rather , this is a case of a mutually consensual union , formed by adults , who had previously had little contact .
" However , the offence of incest exists not merely to protect children from sexual abuse .
In my view , other relevant factors include the need to prevent the high risk of congenital defects of children born of incestuous relationships and to prevent children , who are brought up in a family unit founded on an incestuous relationship , suffering psychological harm and social stigmatisation .
Those factors assume significance in this case . "
Judge Millsteed acknowledged that as a condition of bail , Mr Deaves was banned from contacting Ms Deaves or her children but " this order has exacerbated your depression and caused you to attempt suicide on two occasions " .
" I will not make it a condition of bond that you not see each other .
In my view such a condition would be unfair , " Judge Millsteed said .
The pair were banned from sexual contact with each other as part of their bond .
Mr Deaves 's former wife , Dorothy Deaves , disputed the couple 's claim that they had no contact with each other for about 30 years and fell in love when they were virtually strangers to each other .
She said she was married to Mr Deaves for 16 years " until he took off with her " in October 2000 .
She claimed that , rather than being a stranger to her father , Ms Deaves had been present at their wedding reception in Sydney when she would have been about 15 .
" They were in contact all the time , " Mrs Deaves , 69 , said .
She said it had affected her deeply when Mr Deaves ended his third marriage to run off with his daughter .
" Ever since it happened to a certain extent I have gotten over it but I was devastated for a long time , " she said .
" The whole thing is so disgusting you just do n't know where to turn . "
EVEN when the sky is blue over Quincy , clouds hang in the air .
The small town in the centre of the state of Washington is home to half a dozen huge warehouses that power the global “ computing clouds ” run by internet companies such as Yahoo ! and Microsoft .
The size of several football pitches , these data centres are filled with thousands of powerful computers and storage devices and are hooked up to the internet via fast fibre - optic links .
Yet even more intriguing than the buildings ' size is their location .
Quincy is literally in the middle of nowhere , three hours ' drive from the nearest big city , Seattle .
But it turns out to be a perfect location for data centres .
As computing becomes a utility , with services that can be consumed from everywhere and on any device , ever more thought is being put into where to put the infrastructure it needs .
Where the cloud touches down is not just the business of the geeks .
Data centres are essential to nearly every industry and have become as vital to the functioning of society as power stations are .
Lately , centres have been springing up in unexpected places : in old missile bunkers , in former shopping malls — even in Iceland .
America alone has more than 7,000 data centres , according to IDC , a market - research firm .
And each is housing ever more servers , the powerful computers that crunch and dish up data .
In America the number of servers is expected to grow to 15.8 m by 2010 — three times as many as a decade earlier .
Until a few years ago , the location of servers was an afterthought , says Jonathan Koomey , a consulting professor of environmental engineering at Stanford University .
Most sat in cupboards or under desks .
The computers in corporate data centres were often housed in the firm 's basement .
And dedicated “ server farms ” , which came of age during the dotcom bubble and often housed the machines of internet start - ups , were mostly built in Silicon Valley and other high - tech hubs .
The geography of the cloud
Now this haphazard landscape is becoming more centralised .
Companies have been packing ever more machines into data centres , both to increase their computing capacity and to comply with new data - retention rules .
As space gets tight and energy costs climb , many firms have begun consolidating and simplifying their computing infrastructure .
Hewlett - Packard , the world 's biggest computer - maker , for instance , is replacing its 85 data centres across the world with just six in America .
Internet firms , meanwhile , need ever larger amounts of computing power .
Google is said to operate a global network of about three dozen data centres with , according to some estimates , more than 1 m servers .
To catch up , Microsoft is investing billions of dollars and adding up to 20,000 servers a month .
As servers become more numerous , powerful and densely packed , more energy is needed to keep the data centres at room temperature .
Often just as much power is needed for cooling as for computing .
The largest data centres now rival aluminium smelters in the energy they consume .
Microsoft's $ 500 m new facility near Chicago , for instance , will need three electrical substations with a total capacity of 198 megawatts .
As a result , finding a site for a large data centre is now , above all , about securing a cheap and reliable source of power , says Rich Miller of Data Center Knowledge , a website that chronicles the boom in data - centre construction .
The availability of cheap power is mainly why there are so many data centres in Quincy .
It is close to the Columbia River , with dams that produce plenty of cheap hydroelectric power .
There is water for cooling , fast fibre - optic links , and the remoteness provides security .
For similar reasons , Google chose to build a new data centre at The Dalles , a hamlet across the Columbia River in the state of Oregon .
Such sites are in short supply in America , however .
And with demand for computing picking up in other parts of the world , the boom in data - centre construction is spreading to unexpected places .
Microsoft is looking for a site in Siberia where its data can chill .
Iceland has begun to market itself as a prime location for data centres , again for the cool climate , but also because of its abundant geothermal energy .
Hitachi Data Systems and Data Islandia , a local company , are planning to build a huge data - storage facility ( pictured at top of article ) .
It will be underground , for security and to protect the natural landscape .
So will all data centres end up in remote places like Quincy or Iceland ?
Not necessarily .
For many applications , speed is of the essence .
To make sure that its web - search results show up almost instantly , Google has to distribute its data centres around the world .
Financial - services firms want to have access to trading data in real time , which explains the high density of data centres near New York and London .
And fast - moving online games must be hosted near their players .
Even when speed does not matter , many firms want their servers close by , says Mike Foust , the boss of Digital Realty Trust , which builds and rents out data centres .
Sometimes this is for maintenance ; sometimes it is because “ server huggers ” do not want to let go .
Security also counts .
The Boyd Company , which advises companies about where to put their data centres , thinks more should be built in the provinces .
Demand for secure locations for back - up centres , which many firms now have to maintain , will give rise to huge regional data centres , such as the one being built in Newport in Wales .
The criteria that companies use to pick a site keep evolving , says Mike Manos , Microsoft 's director of data centres .
His team feeds 35 sets of data into an electronic “ heat ” map of the world .
With colours that range from green to red , it shows where conditions are favourable and which places should be avoided .
And Microsoft needs a lot of choice : if a new service suddenly becomes popular , it needs to be able to increase computing capacity quickly .
That is also why it uses shipping containers pre-loaded with up to 2,000 servers , which can be up and running within hours .
In the firm 's Chicago data centre , over 200 such containers will populate an entire floor .
Yet it will not just be market economics that determines the shape of the clouds .
Local governments give tax breaks in the hope that the presence of big data centres will attract other businesses ( the computing plants themselves usually employ only a few dozen people ) .
Regulation is a factor , too .
SWIFT , a bank - transfer consortium , has announced plans to build a data centre in neutral Switzerland , so that data collected in Europe will not be stored in an American facility , where it could be subpoenaed by the United States government .
In future the geography of the cloud is likely to get even more complex .
“ Virtualisation ” technology already allows the software running on individual servers to be moved from one data centre to another , mainly for back - up reasons .
One day soon , these “ virtual machines ” may migrate to wherever computing power is cheapest , or energy is greenest .
Then computing will have become a true utility — and it will no longer be apt to talk of computing clouds , so much as of a computing atmosphere .
“ If man can by patience select variations useful to him , why , under changing and complex conditions of life , should not variations useful to nature ’s living products often arise , and be preserved or selected ?
What limit can be put to this power , acting during long ages and rigidly scrutinising the whole constitution , structure , and habits of each creature , — favoring the good and rejecting the bad ?
I can see no limit to this power , in slowly and beautifully adapting each form to the most complex relations of life .
The theory of natural selection , even if we look no farther than this , seems to be in the highest degree probable . ”
The products of human selection surround us .
From the ubiquitous species we have modified for food , to our domestic pets and decorative plants , we have ingeniously developed much of our organic environment .
By hybridizing and crossbreeding the variations we discovered in natural populations , we have reengineered organisms to meet both our needs and our whims .
It is no surprise that Charles Darwin began what he called his “ one long argument ” for natural selection with so clear evidence of the malleability of species .
His proposal of “ descent with modification ” stated simply that the process of selection would , over time , create new species distinct and separate from the original .
Unlike human selection , which operates with certain ends in mind , the success of natural selection is driven by fitness : those that are best suited to the environment are likely to leave more offspring .
Darwin believed that the slow , gradual work of “ survival of the fittest ” would change species bit by bit .
He believed that evidence of these incremental changes would eventually be found in the fossil record .
Indeed , a few “ missing links ” or transitional forms have been unearthed , but the problem of incremental change remains one of the theory ’s greatest challenges .
This is not a newly discovered difficulty .
While the concept of punctuated equilibrium has for the most part replaced the gradualist view of evolution , an inability to believe that small variations enhance the survival and reproductive potential of individuals fuels ongoing criticism .
Even if change occurred quickly , must there not have been a time when individuals derived benefit from sporting half a wing , a partly developed eye , or the rudimentary beginnings of a male - female reproductive system ?
In the late 1800s , when science was more a gentlemen ’s activity than an academic profession , novelist Samuel Butler pointed to related difficulties in his book Life and Habit ( 1877 ) : “ If the differences between an elephant and a tadpole - like fish have arisen from the accumulation of small variations that have had no direction given them by intelligence and sense of needs , then no time conceivable by man would suffice for their development . ”
The Argument Continues
This problem of how blind processes of evolution create new species and biological systems through small steps is also addressed in two recent books .
In The Plausibility of Life : Resolving Darwin ’s Dilemma , Marc Kirschner and John Gerhart ask , “ Could they [ complex structures with specific complex functions : eyes , hearts , wings , etc. ] have been plausibly assembled , small piece by small piece , each presupposing a selective advantage ? ” Kirschner , of Harvard Medical School , and Gerhart , of the University of California–Berkeley , believe they have uncovered the way nature creates variations that are finished products rather than stages on the way to completion .
They argue that they have solved the bit - by - bit dilemma by uncovering a mechanism that can show “ how random genetic change is converted into useful innovation . ”
Michael Behe , in The Edge of Evolution : The Search for the Limits of Darwinism , speaks to the same bit - by - bit problem .
He calls this difficulty of unfinished steps “ irreducible complexity . ”
Behe , of Lehigh University , became the poster boy for Intelligent Design after the 1996 publication of his previous book , Darwin ’s Black Box .
There he wrote , “ To a person who does not feel obliged to restrict his search to unintelligent causes , the straightforward conclusion is that many biochemical systems were designed . ”
As his new title implies , he believes that while natural selection can explain many things about life on earth , random mutation and selection have been “ grossly oversold to the modern public ” as a solution for the planet ’s biodiversity .
“ Most mutations that built the great structures of life must have been nonrandom . ”
Randomness
Darwin did not invent the evolutionary worldview ; he merely offered ( along with his contemporary Alfred Wallace ) a mechanism through which biological adaptation could occur .
The system he proposed , however , insisted that variation and natural selection worked blindly and without forethought or intention .
Prior to Origin of Species , the prevailing theory of evolution had been of change driven by need , as alluded to by Butler above , or the aspiration of all life toward higher or ideal forms .
Although no one of that period understood the source of variation as we do today ( the genetic code ) , nor how an organism functions at the cellular level ( the control of gene expression ) , the impetus for evolution was believed to be within each organism .
Imagining such an internal drive offered some comfort and sensibility .
It implied that all living things had a responsible part to play in their own success and adaptation as well as in their connection and interaction with other individuals .
Although even Darwin succumbed to inventing a physiologic system whereby an organism ’s life experiences could be packaged and passed on to the next generation , he remained dedicated to the random and purposeless nature of evolution .
The concept of natural selection was then and remains today a disruptive idea ; it leaves everything to be arbitrated by chance .
Chance rolls out variations randomly , and the environment selects those that are best fit to survive and pass on their traits to the next generation .
This idea that nature is a “ blind watchmaker ” — that undirected natural processes can , on their own , create complexity — is both the core of modern evolutionary theory and at the heart of why the theory feels so uncomfortable to many .
To understand what these two new texts have added to the discourse , it is helpful to understand that these authors are not working with new questions or controversies .
Origin or Genesis ?
Admitting in Origin the difficulty of expecting “ extremely slight and gradual ” changes to come together to create so complex a structure as the vertebrate eye , Darwin noted : “ I have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at others hesitating to extend the principle of natural selection to so startling a length . ”
Then he added the statement which has become the challenge of many a critic over the last century : “ If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed , which could not possibly have been formed by numerous , successive , slight modifications , my theory would absolutely break down .
But I can find out no such case . ”
Darwin included these comments in his sixth edition of Origin , in response to St. George Mivart ’s critical text , On the Genesis of Species .
A naturalist like Darwin , Mivart argued that “ natural selection utterly fails to account for the conservation and development of the minute and rudimentary beginnings , the slight and infinitesimal commencements of structures , however useful those structures may afterwards become . ”
Focusing briefly on insects that mimic plants ( for example , katydids and walking sticks ) , Mivart continued that to end up with such biological structure “ out of utterly indifferent and indeterminate infinitesimal variations in all conceivable directions ” appears impossible .
Darwin ’s critics were looking for something , just as they do today , that showed evolution had purpose .
Few people doubted the idea of change in the late 1800s , but the idea of change without purpose , without the directing power of a Creator , was just not acceptable .
But of course , as we know , Darwin held his ground : “ Variability is governed by many unknown laws , of which correlated growth is probably the most important .
. . .
To adapt a species to new habits of life , many co-ordinated modifications are almost indispensable . ”
Plausible Answers ?
Kirschner and Gerhart begin where Darwin left off .
How can novel , directionless variations add up to complexity ?
“ Ignorance about novelty , ” they offer , “ is at the heart of skepticism about evolution , and resolving its origins is necessary to complete our understanding of Darwin ’s theory . ”
Outlining what they call “ evolvability , ” the authors conclude that life is indeed plausible by natural selection if the results of random mutation are biased toward useful variation .
Their hypothesis is called “ facilitated variation . ”
It is based on the observation that all living things share the same basic biochemistry and cell structure .
This commonality , all the way up from genetic code to protein structure to embryological development , is evidence of the building process of natural selection , they believe .
The authors argue that this uniformity has only the appearance of design and planning .
Using human design of clocks as a model of what “ intelligent design ” must look like ( William Paley ’s famous discovered brass watch takes center stage in their discussion , which bookends the introduction and conclusion of the text ) , Kirschner and Gerhart describe the many ways in which intelligent humans solve a single problem .
The “ evolution ” of keeping time created the hourglass , wristwatch , grandfather clock and atomic clock , for example ; all do the same job but are completely different machines .
There is no commonality of mechanism .
From this they assert that living things do not show design , as the same mechanism is used over and over by seemingly unrelated organisms .
If living things were the work of a Creator , they ask , would n’t each organism be unique , built from its own particular and idiosyncratic plan ?
On the other hand , as Darwin astutely observed , “ have we any right to assume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man ? ”
Kirschner and Gerhart insist that what looks like intelligence — conserving and using the same system in a variety of ways — is actually the result of life having evolved a way to channel random mutation toward nonrandom ends :
“ The bias introduced by facilitated variation accelerates the process of natural selection by giving it more viable variation of a type likely to be appropriate to the selective conditions than it would have been if variation occurred in all directions . ”
Summing up Darwinian theory as “ genetic variation , phenotypic variation , and selection , ” Kirschner and Gerhart posit that while genes may vary randomly , the phenotypic or body changes that can actually result from these mutations are directional , a rearrangement of modules creating a greater variety of possibly useful variations rather than a disorganized mess of “ not quites ” or “ halfway theres . ”
They write , “ Novelty in the organism ’s physiology , anatomy , or behavior arises mostly by the use of conserved processes in new combinations , at different times , and in different places and amounts , rather than by the invention of new processes . ”
“ The novelty and the complexity of the [ prokaryotic ] cell is so far beyond anything inanimate in the world today that we are left baffled by how it was achieved . ”
The origin of these “ conserved processes ” remains unanswered .
Where and how did these common traits first arise ?
“ There is really no alternative but to think that new core processes , such as those that first arose in eukaryotic cells , were cobbled together from the existing processes in prokaryotic cells . ”
Unfortunately , this is where the solution to Darwin ’s dilemma sputters to a halt : “ The novelty and the complexity of the [ prokaryotic ] cell is so far beyond anything inanimate in the world today that we are left baffled by how it was achieved .
. . .
We can do little more than speculate . ”
Another View of Design
According to Michael Behe , Kirschner and Gerhart have just reached the twilight zone of evolutionary biology , the edge of Darwinism .
The problem , Behe agrees , is random mutation , but he also believes that the source code on which mutation can operate is not beyond speculation .
He wants to find “ the line between the random and the nonrandom that defines the edge of evolution . ”
That line is drawn exactly where facilitated variation begins : the core biochemical processes common to all life .
In this sense the three authors are seeking to answer the same question that challenged Darwin regarding Origin : How does variation work ?
Behe is , at the most basic level , attempting to place purpose back into evolution : “ As Darwin thought , life descended with modification from one stage to another .
Mutations arose in a long series — but many were not random . ”
Common descent is true but trivial , Behe believes .
“ It says merely that commonalities were there from the start , present in a common ancestor .
It does not even begin to explain where those commonalities came from , or how humans subsequently acquired remarkable differences .
Something that is nonrandom must account for the common descent of life ” ( Behe ’s emphasis ) .
While Kirschner and Gerhart would call this nonrandomness “ facilitated variation ” at best , or even leave it on the shelf for another day , Behe attributes it to the intervention of a supernatural hand .
“ The bottom line is that , while great progress has been made toward understanding how animals are made , and has revealed unexpected , stunning complexity , no progress at all has been made in understanding how that complexity could evolve by unintelligent processes . ”
“ For a bevy of reasons having little to do with science , this crucial aspect of Darwin ’s theory — the power of natural selection coupled to random mutation — has been grossly oversold to the modern public . ”
Countering the plausibility argument , Behe returns to irreducible complexity .
Assured that complex systems require multiple coherent steps to be created , he repeats that “ without the intimate involvement of a directing intelligence , [ mutations ] would not come about in nature . ”
This does not mean that natural selection is invalid .
Behe spends much of his book showing where selection is not over the edge , particularly with diseases .
In this , he says , natural selection may certainly work with what already exists .
Kirschner and Gerhart concur : “ Mutation only changes what already exists .
It does not create new anatomy , physiology , and behavior from nothing . ”
Looking for a Sign
Like taking sides for candidates of opposing parties , loyalists find no value in their favorite ’s adversary .
Thus it is unfortunate that few party - line Darwinists would be interested in The Edge of Evolution and few IDers in The Plausibility of Life .
Both texts are valuable ; each gives the reader new insights into the state of evolutionary science as well as clear explanations of how living things function .
To simply play one against the other , to join one camp and ignore the other side ’s argument , is myopic .
Science is defined as materialist .
Thus it will never buckle to the concept of intelligent selection .
Nor will it agree that any of the complexities of nature are evolutionarily irreducible .
From the scientific perspective , the answer to complexity will always be natural selection and other random factors ; the mere existence or fact of a thing — an eye , a chemical pathway , a beautiful turn of color — will always trump irreducibility .
The scientific method cannot accept a nonmaterial basis for any theory ; this is not how scientific endeavor proceeds .
That does not mean , however , that nonscientific perspectives are invalid .
Behe suggests that it is foolish to believe that scientific method is the final arbiter of all questions of natural form and behavior .
“ The beginning of life needed a directing intelligence , ” he insists .
Such tenacity does not make his position true either , of course .
But neither should it be ignored because it is beyond the pale .
Unconventional thinkers such as Behe often move the conversation forward in unlikely ways .
But even
Behe is careful to walk softly when claiming the necessity of a causative agent to implement what he finds otherwise biologically impossible :
“ The idea of intelligent design , although congenial to some religious views of the universe , is independent of them .
. . .
One ca n’t leap directly from design to a transcendent God . ”
Darwinism is certainly flawed ; it has been revised and revised again as new information concerning the nature of life has come to light over the past century and a half .
This is no surprise , nor does it mean the idea of evolution is a house of cards ready to implode .
Facilitated variation is a new revision .
Will it stand up to future scrutiny ?
While Behe does not believe so , one cannot discredit Kirschner ’s and Gerhart ’s efforts to compile in one place the immense evidence of a commonality of life on earth .
For the biologist , realizing this deep unity among living things may be the most unexpected discovery science has made in the last few decades .
For Behe and others , it is really not surprising in the least ; the conservation of complex systems across all life is a most obvious sign of intelligence at work .

Good news for voters across American on Friday , as the judge in the Pima County , AZ , court case has finally agreed that citizens can try and see how citizens voted in elections , even if they are run by Diebold .
Via email from AZ Electon Integrity advocate Jim March ...
All Diebold database files held in the trust 's vault are to be released .
These go back to 1998 .
Database files in future elections are to be made available at the time of the final canvass .
The judge appears to be suggesting that CD / DVDs or similar media with this material be prepared by the county for immediate release so that the material can affect challenges within the statutory five - day limit from the day of the canvass .
There is nothing in this order regarding the legal bills rung up by [ plaintiff's ]
Attorney Bill Risner .
However , given the now - absolute victory in this revised order ( attached ed note : download here [ PDF ] ) plus recent changes to AZ law supporting legal fees and costs where a government agency loses a public records suit , it seems very clear Mr. Risner is getting paid Judge Miller 's final decision came in this morning on the public records case filed by the Pima Democratic Party .
In short :
Congratulations !
And thank you , EI folks in AZ !!!

From March 3 - 9 , 2008 , a house made from 60,000 newspapers was on display in Gillett Square , East London .
The house was built by Sumer Erek , a London - based Turkish - Cyprist artist .
The Newspaper House is a public art installation about " making public use of a public space using public waste .
The installation forces us to look at our own waste , as individuals and collectively , through both the familiarity of the material and the sheer mass of it . "
People contributed their old newspapers for this exhibit .
Organizations such as Metronet Rail and Project Freesheet also donated thousands of papers .
A shell of a house was used to start out , and Sumer Erek built the house from the inside , using the shell as a mold .
The shell was also used to protect from the elements .
Other materials used were timber and cable ties .
The timber added extra support to the structure of the Newspaper House .
Cable ties were used to secure the rolls of newspaper .
Volunteers donating their old newspapers were allowed to insert their own news into the papers before they became rolled .
I wonder what would have happened if you stuck an important document or something by accident into your newspaper and then happened to donate it to this project and did n't realize it until it was all built ?
" Sorry Officer , I put my registration inside a newspaper that was used to build a - oh , nevermind , just give me the ticket . "
This would definitely happen to me if given the chance .
The first question that entered my mind was whether this house was going fall apart if it happened to rain .
Quoted from their site : " ... all the newspaper structure has been coated but it does not matter as the sticks are so tight that the rain will not affect the installation . "
The project is produced by Creative City , and the installation is the work of Sumer Erek .

The physical basis of Schrodinger 's theory was this :
Ordinarily , one can think of a particle as a dot ; but one should really visualize it as a little clump of waves , a ' ' standing wave ' ' in today 's parlance .
Do n't bother thinking of electrons as particles , Schrodinger said , and forget about this quantum - leap business .
Just apply rules of wave interactions .
Beyond constructing a mechanism for particle interactions , Schrodinger linked the quantum world of the microscopic to the classical world of macroscopic objects .
Waves now existed , figuratively speaking , in atoms as well as in oceans .
Physicists could understand waves , which they had endlessly studied .
Schrodinger 's wave mechanics saved quantum theory and at the same time threatened its underpinnings .
It utilized continuous phenomena , waves , to explain the discontinuous quantum world of the atom .
For this , Schrodinger earned the Nobel Prize in Physics ( in 1933 ) and the undying enmity of the great Werner Heisenberg .
Schrodinger had destroyed Heisenberg 's precious matrices .
Schrodinger was old .
He was an outsider from Zurich , not part of the Gottingen - Copenhagen quantum clique .
Worst of all , he was right .
The clique felt compelled to retaliate .
Pauli referred to Schrodinger 's views as '' Zurich superstitions . ''
Heisenberg was less charitable , calling the theory '' abominable ' ' and worse .
Heisenberg would later eat his words .
In 1927 he incorporated Schrodinger 's wave functions as an integral part of his uncertainty principle .
How does one explain Schrodinger 's sudden burst of genius , uncommon even in that post - World War I era of uncommon geniuses ?
The man appears to have been extraordinarily common .
The picture of Schrodinger that emerges from Mr. Moore 's book is one of a conceited , selfish , childish , hopelessly middle - class nerd , one who worried about his awards and medals and was obsessed with his pension and salary .
( He did n't accept an offer from Princeton University because it would n't give him parity with Einstein . )
He even drove a BMW .
Mr. Moore is exhaustive in his research of Schrodinger 's life , but , as in a scientific paper , he is heavy on data and parsimonious in his explanation of that data .
Mr. Moore is a chemist and - if you 'll forgive the cheap shot - the book is more of a quantitative analysis than a deep psychological portrait .
On the other hand , his objectivity allows him to study candidly , and nonjudgmentally , two major obsessions of Schrodinger 's life - the Eastern philosophy of Vedanta and sex .
Mr. Moore informs us that Schrodinger kept a series of '' little black books ' ' in which he recorded the names of all his loves with a code to indicate '' the denouement , '' as the author puts it , of each affair .
He unbuttons Schrodinger 's code and reveals a life of stunning promiscuity .
Schrodinger admitted he detested his wife , Anny , sexually , and took on a series of mistresses , three of whom bore him illegitimate daughters .
Immediately after his triumph in wave mechanics , he agreed to tutor 14 - year - old twin girls named Withi and Ithi Junger .
Schrodinger called the latter '' Ithy - bitty ' ' and regularly fondled her during their math lessons .
He finally seduced her when she was 17 , assuring her she would n't get pregnant .
She did , Schrodinger immediately lost interest in her , and the girl underwent a disastrous abortion that left her sterile .
He then took on Hilde March , the wife of his assistant Arthur March , as his mistress , and she bore him a daughter .
March , ever the dutiful assistant , agreed to be named the father , while his wife moved eventually into the Schrodinger household to serve as Schrodinger 's '' second wife . ''
Well , the great man 's sordid affairs go on and on , and Mr. Moore faithfully serves up all of the titillating details .
He concludes that Schrodinger needed '' tempestuous sexual adventures ' ' to inspire his great discoveries .
Unfortunately , the notebook for the critical year 1925 has disappeared , so the woman who erotically guided Schrodinger to his famous wave equation , '' like the dark lady who inspired Shakespeare 's sonnets , '' the biographer tells us , '' may remain forever mysterious . ''
As for Vedanta , the recent rash of new - age physics writers will be chagrined to learn that Schrodinger himself rejected the idea that philosophical conclusions can be drawn from wave mechanics or any work in theoretical physics .
But Mr. Moore believes that Vedanta - which holds that through the Self one can comprehend the essence of the universe - may have been instrumental in Schrodinger 's discovery of wave mechanics .
Much has been written about Schrodinger 's insistence that the electron is not a particle ; it does n't just behave like a wave , he said , but rather is a wave , as real as a radio wave or an ocean wave .
This belief of Schrodinger 's , soon discarded by other physicists , is played down by Mr. Moore , who points out that Schrodinger actually wavered on this point very early on .
After wave mechanics , Schrodinger attempted , and failed ( as did Einstein ) , to forge a unified field theory , but he did write a bizarre and wonderful book entitled '' What Is Life ? ' ' in which he was the first to suggest that a chromosome is nothing more than a message written in code .
The book inspired at least two young scientists to seek careers in biology - James Watson and Francis Crick , who eventually were given the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for decoding DNA .
Schrodinger never accomplished his greatest dream , to reinstate classical physics with its almost Vedantic continuity over the lumpiness of quantum mechanics .
Perhaps as a revenge against his quantum enemies , he did leave behind a paradox that torments scientists to this day .
The paradox of Schrodinger 's cat links the squishy quantum microworld , with its statistical probabilities that replace cause and effect , to the Newtonian macroworld of everyday objects that obey hard - and - fast rules of causality .
Put a cat in a box , Schrodinger said , with a flask of lethal acid .
In a Geiger tube , place a small quantity of radioactive material , so little that in the course of an hour one atom has a 50 - 50 chance of disintegrating , setting off the Geiger counter , which will trigger a hammer that shatters the flask of acid that will kill the cat .
So , after one hour is the cat dead or alive ?
Schrodinger said that if one used the quantum wave function to describe the entire system , '' the living and the dead cat ' ' would be '' smeared out ( pardon the expression ) in equal parts . ''
Schrodinger intended his paradox as a sarcastic comment on quantum probability or ' ' blurred variables . ''
One can resolve the uncertainty , he explained , by looking in the box .
Schrodinger himself , however , must always remain somewhat blurred , despite Walter Moore 's heroic efforts in this important book about the century 's most enigmatic scientist .
For the average reader , '' Schrodinger ' ' may be tough going , but it serves up a wonderfully frank and unglamorized , albeit narrow , history of the development of quantum mechanics .
Much of the science in this book is only opaquely explained , but explaining science is not the book 's main function .
It is an attempt to analyze a soul , and in that respect , it surpasses even '' The Double Helix ' ' by James Watson in its examination of the most visceral drives of a great scientist .
Internet users are quite familiar with the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart ( CAPTCHA ) , a quick method that verifies whether or not the user trying to sign up is a person or a bot .
A picture with swirled , mangled , or otherwise distorted characters is displayed and the user then types in the correct letters or numbers .
Thus far , the system has worked well to slow down malicious bots , but recently the groups behind such software have made significant strides .
A security firm is now reporting that the CAPTCHA used for Windows Live Mail can now be cracked in as little as 60 seconds .
Back in early February , a group cracked Windows Live Hotmail 's CAPTCHA .
A few weeks later , Gmail 's version followed suit .
In just over a month 's time , some anti-spam vendors were forced to completely block the domain for the popular service as bots signed up for thousands of bogus accounts and began to flood the tubes with e-mail advertisements for lottery tickets and watches .
The close proximity of the two cracks has done everything but sealed CAPTCHA 's fate .
To make matters worse , Websense Security Labs is now reporting that the method for getting around Windows Live Mail 's CAPTCHA has been improved to the point that a bot can decipher the text and make a guess in less than six seconds , on average .
Windows Live Hotmail 's Anti-CAPTCHA automatic bot , which hooks itself into Internet Explorer on a victim 's machine , has a success rate of about 10 - 15 percent .
That means that it takes up to one minute for a single bot to create a new account .
Windows Live Hotmail 's CAPTCHA
In one day , the bot can amass at least 1,440 accounts .
And that 's just one bot .
This same bot can then send spam to multiple e-mail addresses ( using both CC and BCC lists ) continuously , switching between accounts ( both in the from : and to : fields ) in order to lower the chance of being spotted .
Spammers love getting their hands on live.com and hotmail.com addresses since the chance of such popular domain names being blacklisted are slim to none .
Because of how large the Windows Live account system is , in terms of both users and the wide array of services the account is tied to , anti-spam vendors should not be the only ones worried .
However , the problem for Microsoft is much bigger than simply tracking down the spamming accounts .
Microsoft , Google , and all other websites that currently use CAPTCHA , need to find a solution that puts them a step ahead of the spammers .
Using better images and improving CAPTCHA will simply prolong the arms race .
Spammers will make the proper adjustments to their bots , then make them even faster .
Hopefully a workable solution can be found that does n't make onerous demands on the sincere user .
Finding , testing , and implementing a CAPTCHA alternative will of course take time , and while we wait , the spam just comes flooding in .

SAN FRANCISCO  Seagate Technology , the largest maker of computer hard drives , made a pre-emptive strike against an emerging competitor on Monday when it filed a lawsuit in federal court accusing STEC Inc. of patent infringement .
In the suit , Seagate contends that STEC ’s solid - state drive products violate four Seagate patents covering how such drives interface with computers .
STEC , based in Santa Ana , Calif. , makes solid - state drives for corporations and other large enterprises , a market that Seagate executives have said the company plans to enter this year .
The suit was filed in Federal District Court in the Northern District of California .
Patrick Wilkison , vice president of marketing and business development at STEC , said Seagate was clearly feeling threatened by the growing demand for solid - state drives and that it was “ defending its turf . ”
He added that Seagate executives did not contact STEC about infringement before filing the complaint .
This is rightly a big issue in Ohio .
And I have laid out my criticism , but in addition my plan , for actually fixing NAFTA .
Again , I have received a lot of incoming criticism from Senator Obama .
And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama 's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous .
So I would hope that , again , we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA .
It is not working .
It was , unfortunately , heavily disadvantaging many of our industries , particularly manufacturing .
I have a record of standing up for that , of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate , and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements .
MR. WILLIAMS : Senator , thank you .
Before we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert , Senator Obama .
SEN .
OBAMA : Well , I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she 's always opposed NAFTA .
In her campaign for Senate , she said that NAFTA , on balance , had been good for New York and good for America .
I disagree with that .
I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street .
And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois , you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal .
Now , I think that Senator Clinton has shifted positions on this and believes that we should have strong environmental standards and labor standards , and I think that 's a good thing .
But you know , when I first moved to Chicago in the early ' 80s and I saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black , white , and Hispanic -- and I worked on the streets of Chicago to try to help them find jobs , I saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements , if they 're not properly structured , can be devastating .
And as president of the United States , I intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the labor standards , the environmental standards and the safety standards that are going to protect not just workers , but also consumers .
We can't have toys with lead paint in them that our children are playing with .
We can't have medicines that are actually making people more sick instead of better because they 're produced overseas .
We have to stop providing tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States of America .
And if we do those things , then I believe that we can actually get Ohio back on the path of growth and jobs and prosperity .
If we do n't , then we 're going to continue to see the kind of deterioration that we 've seen economically here in this state .
MR. RUSSERT : I want to ask you both about NAFTA because the record , I think , is clear .
And I want to -- Senator Clinton .
Senator Obama said that you did say in 2004 that on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America .
You did say that .
When President Clinton signed this bill -- and this was after he negotiated two new side agreements , for labor and environment -- President Clinton said it would be a force for economic growth and social progress .
You said in '96 it was proving its worth as free and fair trade .
You said that -- in 2000 -- it was a good idea that took political courage .
So your record is pretty clear .
Based on that , and which you 're now expressing your discomfort with it , in the debate that Al Gore had with Ross Perot , Al Gore said the following : " If you do n't like NAFTA and what it 's done , we can get out of it in six months .
If you are looking for inspiration for grid and column design , here is a nice collection of 32 column - based websites .
These sites show how grid layout can be applied on various type of sites — whether a massive content editorial site or just a personal blog .
Check out how the layout can be divided into 3 columns , 4 columns , a mixture of narrow and wide columns .

Web design has significantly improved over the last years .
It ’s more user - friendly and more appealing today — and there is a good reason behind it : over the years we ’ve found out that design with focus on usability and user experience is just more effective .
Modern cut - edge design is n’t filled with loud happy talk and blinking advertisements .
We ’ve learnt to initiate the dialogue with visitors , involve them into discussions and gain their trust by addressing their needs and speaking with them honestly and directly .

It ’s more user - friendly and more appealing today — and there is a good reason behind it : over the years we ’ve found out that design with focus on usability and user experience is just more effective .
Modern cut - edge design is n’t filled with loud happy talk and blinking advertisements .
We ’ve learnt to initiate the dialogue with visitors , involve them into discussions and gain their trust by addressing their needs and speaking with them honestly and directly .
Few weeks ago we ’ve presented 10 Principles Of Effective Web Design — a comprehensive article about effective Web design and provided you with insights about how users actually think as well as with some examples of how effective designs can be achieved .
This article highlights 5 further principles , heuristics and approaches for effective Web design — approaches which , used properly , can lead to more sophisticated design decisions and simplify the process of perceiving presented information .
Please notice that you might be interested in 30 Usability Issues explains important usability issues , terms , rules and principles which are usually forgotten , ignored or misunderstood .
1. Use An Effective Marketing Principle
In order to sell a product or a service you need to be able to effectively inititate the dialogue with random visitors of your site .
Since your visitors have actually come to your site , they are willing to hear to you and learn what you have to offer .
So how do you approach this potential clientele to maximize your earning at the end of the month ?
Suggested by Strong in 1925 , AIDA is the effective marketing model which describes a common list of events that are very often undergone when a person is selling a product or service :
A - Attention ( Awareness ) : attract the attention of the customer .
- Attention ( Awareness ) : attract the attention of the customer .
I - Interest : raise customer interest by demonstrating features , advantages , and benefits .
- Interest : raise customer interest by demonstrating features , advantages , and benefits .
D - Desire : convince customers that they want and desire the product or service and that it will satisfy their needs .
- Desire : convince customers that they want and desire the product or service and that it will satisfy their needs .
A - Action : lead customers towards taking action and / or purchasing .
- Action : lead customers towards taking action and / or purchasing .
Nowadays some have added another letter to form AIDA( S ) : S - Satisfaction - satisfy the customer so they become a repeat customer and give referrals to a product .
In this context customers should notice that AIDA is usually the way how potential buyers are tricked into buying products or services they actually do n’t need .
To gain users ’ trust designers need to make sure that the site provides genuine information and there is no hidden context in which the content can be understood in a different way .
It ’s also more effective to offer visitors concrete arguments , situations and ideas of how a product or a service can be used instead of bombarding them with loud and empty ad - slogans .
Consider the example presented above .
traffik follows the AIDA principle .
If the visitors expect some information about a Content Management System they expectation is immediately confirmed with a brief introduction at the top of the site .
Thus , potential customers are attracted and remain on the site ( Attraction , a ) .
The interest is then raised by showcasing features and benefits of the product ( Interest , i ) .
To communicate how the service will satisfy user ’s needs the brown info - block at the right hand at the bottom of the page is used ( Desire , d ) .
Finally the users are guided to “ Take the tour ” and “ Free 30 day trial ” buttons which attempt to lead customers towards purchasing ( Action , a ) .
A lot of other models are known in order to sell , e.g. the BOSCH - Formula ( developed by Peter Hubert ) :
Be inquisitive , ask open questions
Offer solutions , talk about the endresult benefits for the customer
Stimulate the senses , let the customer test your product
Cross your sales , think of all the necessary accessories
Hit the closing point , sell when the customer is ready to buy .
2. Experiment With Few Colors
Dark body copy on white background and light body copy on black background are passive .
Vibrant colors can help to highlight some specific elements of the site which you ’d like to point users ’ attention to .
However , you do n’t need to use a vibrant palette to create an effective Web design .
Sometimes it ’s useful to pick a moderate number of colors and use them efficiently .
Thus your visitors will immediately see what ’s more important .
It will also be easier for you to focus their attention on the most important areas of the site .
Sidebarecreative.com uses only one dominant vibrant color — blue color stands for links , buttons and clickable elements .
White stands for important information which summarizes the content of the current page .
The rest is the content of the site with some light blueish hover effects .
Excellent , modest and expressive use of colors .
That ’s effective .
Wilson Miner uses green , blue and pink .
The dominating green color looks fresh and comforting .
Blue stands for the links and pink for the hover effect .
Notice the structure of the site .
Although only few colors are actually used , one can immediately recognize clickable areas and detect the different sections of the site .
3. Strive For Balance
In Web design balance is important because it provides users with some sense of closure and gives the feeling of permanence and stability .
Balanced designs are easier to digest and to understand , because they create a visual hierarchy which clearly displays what is more important on the web - site and what is less important .
Source : The Elements of Design Applied to the Web
Apple ’s design is probably one of the best examples of the symmetrical ( also called formal ) balance .
Single design elements have either very distinctive ( above ) or very similar ( below ) weight .
They are placed on both sides of an imaginary vertical line on the page which goes through the middle of the user ’s screen .
The design is rather static and restful which makes it easier for the visitors to comprehend the information which is presented through it .
Result : balance creates a simple visual harmony .
Why is Apple ’s design so efficient ?
Because it ’s user - centric and product - centric .
The design of Apple ’s site resembles a theatre stage where visitors are the audience and the product is the entertainer .
Notice that the site presents only the product and nothing else .
Apple manages to initiate the dialogue offering only most important options .
Signalfeuer uses an asymmetrical ( informal ) balance which allows for the more dynamic use of white space ( and this is probably the main advantage of asymmetrical balance ) .
The left block is smaller than the right one , however the site offers a very strong balance by using an impressive and balanced grid .
Also the choice of colors is quite impressive .
According to the ( gone ) article Principles of Design , “ asymmetrical balance may be unequal in position and intensity .
To create asymmetrical balance , there must be an increase in intensity to compensate for the change in position .
Intensity can be increased by changing size , shape , or tone .
For a particular job , the designer might choose to position the elements to one side of the picture plane .
The white space opposing must then act as a counter - balancing force . ”
4. Strive For Clarity
Independently of the design approach , the clarity of both layout and presented information should be given one of the highest priorities in the design process .
If there is any chance of misunderstandings and ambiguious titles make sure to get rid of them or specifiy explicitly what is meant .
Being more specific is usually better than being less specific .
To achieve clarity you do n’t need to make use of “ standard ” design layouts or basic templates .
Risk design experiments if you want to , but keep the clear visual hierarchy and structure of the site ’s content in mind .
The more organized your categories are , the easier it will be for your visitors to find their path through your site .
Hovie displays an unusual yet very clear design solution .
The site consists of five blocks ; the first one stands for the main menu which appears when the site is loaded .
Sub - menu appears when some section in the main menu is selected .
The current position is displayed by arrows next to the selected option in the navigation menu .
In the content area a brief description and the caption of the images displayed above is presented .
The design is consistent throughout all pages .
Is there any possibilty to somehow misunderstand the design ?
Not really .
That ’s simple , clear and effective .
Another example : Astheria focuses on white space and has a balanced grid - based design solution .
Although the design is rather subtle and uses only one appealing color , you can see immediately where you are now and what options are available .
Power of typography at its best .
Unfortunately , the site does n’t display which links have already been visited ( Update : Kyle Meyer has added : visited - state now ) .
5. Address Your Users ’ Needs
As web - developer you have the primary task to comfort your visitors , addressing their needs and providing them with sufficient clues for seamless and intuitive navigation .
However , to achieve this you need more than just considering an average profile of your users and stick to the decision he / she will be happy with .
To maximize your exposure you have to consider various types and profiles of your visitors .
You need to identify major groups and offer each group the functionality its members would be comfortable with .
That does n’t mean that you need to create multiple versions of your web - site ; it rather means that you can integrate multiple levels of user interaction in one single design layout .
For instance , according to Shneiderman ’s principles of User Interface Design , it ’s important to enable frequent users to use shortcuts — to increase the pace of interaction use abbreviations , special keys , hidden commands etc .
Ffffound.com offers both usual navigation and a Javascript - based keyboard navigation .
This functionality is not directly seen to newbies who can browse through the site in a usual manner .
Advanced users , however , are able to navigate more efficiently .
Of course , you need to make it explicit and clear how to use any advanced functionality and what benefits it offers .
Another possibilities would be bookmarklets , toolbars or some specific tools such as e.g .
Flickr uploader .
Offering these tools you ’ll offer your users easier ways to use your service and they ’ll have no need to search for alternatives .
Conclusion
Effective Web design does n’t have to be colorful and pretty — it needs to be clear and intuitive .
Make sure you help your visitors to understand the benefits of your web - site and offer them an easy way to explore and use your site .
Symmetrical and asymmetrical balance can be helpful in achieving a solid and clear design solution and thus provide a foundation for rich user interaction .
To maximize your exposure , consider different types of users and offer them multiple levels of user interaction which would bring them back to your site .
A colossalblack hole has been spotted exiting its home galaxy , kicked out after a hugecosmic merger took place .
The event , seen for the first time , was announced today .
When two collidinggalaxies finally merge , it is thought that the black holes at their coresmay fuse together too .
Astronomers have theorized that the resulting energyrelease could propel the new black hole from its parent galaxy out into space , but no one has found such an event .
" Wehave observed the pre-merger stages of black holes , " said Stefanie Komossaof the Max Planck Institute for extraterrestrial Physics , part of the team thatmade the new discovery .
" But we have n't seen the actual mergerevent . "
Komossa andher team have now detected the consequences of such a merger : a 100 - million - solar mass black hole inthe process of leaving its home galaxy .
" Theconsequence was that the merged black hole , the final product , the new blackhole was expelled from the galaxy , " Komossa said .
The team 's results aredetailed in the May 10 issue of the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters .
Blackholes get a kick
Komossaexplained that the theory behind these mergers follows from the observationsthat many galaxies have very massive black holes at their cores .
If twogalaxies with these black holes collide , " then it 's sort of inevitablethat these two black holes will come very close to each other . "
The blackholes may not merge right away though .
" Onepossibility is that for a long time they just orbit each other , " likebinary stars , Komossa told SPACE.com .
Eventually , the orbitingblack holes might interact with a star or surrounding gas which could causethem to lose angular momentum .
" That would be a way to push themever - closer towards each other , " Komossa said .
Eventually , the black holes would fuse , and " in the final coalescence , or merger , ofthese two black holes , a giant burst of gravitational waves is emitted , " she said .
" Since these waves are generally emitted in one preferreddirection , the black hole is then kicked in the other direction . "
The " kick " the black hole receives is akin to the recoil of a rifle .
Itcan propel the black hole to speeds of up to several thousand kilometers persecond , according theoretical simulations .
The escaping black hole Komossa andher team observed was racing along at 5,900,000 mph ( 2,650 kilometers persecond ) .
The pull ofthe galaxy 's gravity is no match for these incredible speeds , and the blackhole , " will inevitably go to intergalactic space , " Komossa said .
Galacticevolution
In theory , these mergersand escapes would leave several black holes without galaxies and galaxieswithout black holes out in space .
Detectingblack holes at the center of galaxies is a difficult process .
Because theirgravity is so powerful , light is trapped , which is why they 're black .
Only bylooking at their effects on surrounding material are they presumed to exist , andthis is typically done only with relatively nearby galaxies , so looking for amissing black hole in the center of a distant galaxy is a tricky prospect .
Theevolution of black holes and galaxies is very closely linked , so what exactlythe effect would be on the separated partners is uncertain and the subject offurther research .
Insimulations where a black hole receives a slightly weaker kick , it can't escapethe galaxy 's gravity , so it falls back and oscillates until it comes to restagain at the galaxy 's core .
Recent simulations of this situation showed thatstellar orbits adjust to the yo- yoing black hole , " so it clearly has aneffect on the core of the galaxy , " Komossa said .
Perhaps it is fitting that the Iraq Study Group chose to make its report public on “ Pearl Harbor Day , ” calling on , inter alia , President Bush to seek Irans help in extricating us from the mess he got us into by his “ preemptive ” attack on oil - rich Iraqs non-existent nuclear weapons program .
Perhaps even Bush will pause , briefly , to ponder the probable consequences of launching yet another preemptive attack , this time on oil - rich Irans non-existent nuclear weapons program .
Of course , the Japanese preemptive attack on our blockade fleet ( which was moored at Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands , an American “ possession ” ) on December 7 , 1941 , was provoked ; by President Roosevelt ’s embargo of July 24 , 1941 , on Japanese imports of oil .
You see , in 1940 , when Roosevelt stood for re-election to an unprecedented third term , he promised American mothers on a stack of Bibles that he was never going to send American boys to fight “ in any foreign wars ” !
Unless , of course , we were attacked .
Aha !
Of course , in Bushs 2002 State of the Union Message , he gave notice to mothers , everywhere , that he was not going to wait to be attacked .
That he fully intended to launch pre-emptive strikes against the likes of Iraq , North Korea and Iran  using nuclear weapons , “ if necessary ”  if he suspected they were acquiring or seeking to acquire nuclear weapons and / or ballistic missile delivery vehicles .
But , back to Pearl Harbor .
Why did Roosevelt slap an oil embargo  an act of war  on Japan , a country that had done nothing to us ?
And why did he do it when he did it ?
Well , apparently Roosevelt slapped the embargo on Japan when he did because Hitler had invaded the Soviet Union only a few weeks before , on June 22 , 1941 , and it already looked like the Wehrmacht would be in Moscow in a matter of weeks .
And for the commie - symp intellectual fore - fathers ( around Roosevelt ) of todays Likudniks ( around Bush ) , that would never do .
Japan  although nominally allied with Germany and other European Axis Powers  had little interest in their European war .
In fact , Japan had been engaged in an all - out war on the Asian mainland since 1933 , the year Roosevelt became president and Hitler came to power in Germany .
By the fall of 1941 , Japan ’s armies occupied a huge hunk of Asia , including Korea , Taiwan , Vietnam and almost a third of China .
But the Japanese were then  as they are today  resource poor .
In particular , they were completely dependent on oil ( and rubber ) from Indonesia and Borneo and other possessions of the European colonial powers in the southwest Pacific and Indian oceans .
So , after months of fruitless negotiations with Roosevelt about lifting his stranglehold on them , Admiral Yamamoto issued Combined Fleet Order No. 1 .
The Imperial 1st Fleet  which included all the Japanese aircraft carriers  was to attack our principal blockade fleet at Pearl Harbor .
The Imperial 2nd Fleet was to attack all Dutch , British and U.S. aircraft , air fields , warships and naval installations in the Dutch East Indies , on the Malay Peninsula and in the Philippines Islands .
The 2nd Fleet was also to support the invasion that same day of Malaya and the Philippine Islands by units of the Japanese army .
The Japanese “ shock and awe ” attacks were spectacularly successful .
They destroyed most of the aircraft and sank most of the warships they found , including the pride of the Royal Navy , HMS Prince of Wales .
All eight of our battleships at Pearl Harbor were essentially sunk by the Japanese , and nearly all Army Air Corps aircraft destroyed .
Now , Roosevelt et al did expect  and had warned our forces in the Pacific  that the Japanese might well attack us because of the oil embargo in late November or early December , 1941 , but at Clark Field and / or Subic Bay in the Philippines .
Roosevelt et al never dreamed that the Japanese would  or could  come all the way to Hawaii to wipe out the Pacific Fleet .
And in their worst nightmares , Roosevelt and Churchill never imagined that the Japanese  having sunk our battleships and destroyed our land - based bombers  could then actually invade and quickly conquer Singapore and the Philippines , as they proceeded to do .
Who fought and ultimately won the War in the Pacific ?
Basically , it was our reconstituted and greatly enhanced “ embargo ” fleet .
In the Pacific , the war was from the very beginning a naval war , about oil .
In 1973 , when the Arabs slapped an oil embargo on us , because of our support for Israel in their war against Egypt and Syria , we only imported about a quarter of the oil we consumed .
Still , there was panic for a while .
There were gasoline and home - heating oil shortages because of federally - imposed price controls , but prices still went sky high , increasing by about a factor of five within a few months .
Now , if Bush launches a preemptive war of aggression against Iran  “ provoked ” by their refusal to give up their “ inalienable ” rights , guaranteed to them under the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , to the peaceful use of nuclear energy ( subject , of course , to a comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency )  sky - high gasoline prices will be the least of our worries .
In particular , what about our Navy , the warships and supply ships in the Persian Gulf ?
They provide absolutely essential support to our armed forces in Iraq , Kuwait , Qatar and elsewhere .
But those ships are sitting ducks for Iranian supersonic sea-skimming anti-ship missiles , and are far more vulnerable than were our ships at Pearl Harbor .
And without the Navys support , how long do you think those garrisons in Iraq  already besieged  will last ?
So , Bush has wisely “ decided ” to follow the advice of the Iraq Study Group ; to “ reach out ” to the Iranians for help in extricating us from the unbelievably disastrous mess he has gotten us into in Iraq , rather than launching yet another “ shock and awe ” bombing campaign against the non-existent  according to the IAEA  Iranian nuclear weapons program  right ?
What ?
And betray the Likudniks ?
Japanese Gun Control
BY DAVID B KOPEL [ *]
2 Asia-Pacific Law Review 26 ( 1993 ) .
More by Kopel on Japan .
I. Introduction
In October 1992 , in Louisiana , a Japanese exchange student named Yoshihiro Hattori went into the wrong house on the way to a Halloween party .
The homeowner 's wife screamed for help and the homeowner drew his .44 pistol and yelled for the student to ' freeze ! '
Not understanding the American idiom that ' freeze ! ' means ' Do n't move or I 'll shoot ' , the student continued advancing towards the homeowner .
The homeowner pulled the trigger and shot him dead .
[1 ]
While the incident initially attracted only brief attention in the national American press , the shooting horrified Japan ; hundreds of thousands of Japanese have signed petitions calling for the United States to implement gun prohibition , and Hattori 's parents have announced plans to begin working with the American lobby , Handgun Control Inc . [ 2 ]
To many Japanese , and to many Americans , it is simply incomprehensible that the United States has not implemented strict gun controls or prohibitions along the Japanese model .
Gun control in Japan is the most stringent in the democratic world .
The weapons law begins by stating ' No - one shall possess a fire - arm or fire - arms or a sword or swords ' , and very few exceptions are allowed .
[ 3 ]
Gun ownership is minuscule , and so is gun crime .
As gun crime in other nations increases , many advocates of gun control urge that Japan 's gun control policy be imitated . [ 4 ]
But before other nations , particularly the United States , decide that Japanese - style gun control is the magic elixir for the disease of gun violence , it is necessary to understand more fully what Japanese gun control is .
Exactly what kinds of controls on guns are imposed by the police ?
How do the controls fit into the context of the overall relationship between the people and the Government ?
How has Japan , which earlier was a violent nation with large numbers of guns , become almost totally disarmed and come to have such a low violent crime rate ?
Why do the Japanese comply with stringent controls , when much milder controls have met such intense resistance in America and other Western nations ?
And what effect have Japanese gun controls had on suicide ?
II . Gun Possession and Gun Crime : Almost Nil
The only type of firearm which a Japanese citizen may even contemplate acquiring is a shotgun .
[ 5 ]
Sportsmen are permitted to possess shotguns for hunting and for skeet and trap ( p.27 ) shooting , but only after submitting to a lengthy licensing procedure . [ 6 ]
Without a license , a person may not even hold a gun in his or her hands .
The licensing procedure is rigorous .
A prospective gun owner must first attend classes and pass a written test . [ 7 ]
Shooting range classes and a shooting test follow ; 95 per cent pass . [ 8 ]
After the safety exam , the applicant takes a simple ' mental test ' at a local hospital , to ensure that the applicant is not suffering from a readily detectable mental illness .
The applicant then produces for the police a medical certificate attesting that he or she is mentally healthy and not addicted to drugs . [ 9 ]
The police investigate the applicant 's background and relatives , ensuring that both are crime free .
Membership in ' aggressive ' political or activist groups disqualifies an applicant . [ 10 ]
The police have unlimited discretion to deny licenses to any person for whom ' there is reasonable cause to suspect may be dangerous to other persons ' lives or properties or to the public peace ' . [ 11 ]
Gun owners are required to store their weapons in a locker , and give the police a map of the apartment showing the location of the locker .
Ammunition must be kept in a separate locked safe .
The licenses also allow the holder to buy a few thousand rounds of ammunition , with each transaction being registered . [ 12 ]
Civilians may also apply for licenses to possess air rifles - - low - power guns that are powered by carbon dioxide rather than by gunpowder .
Civilians can never own handguns .
Small calibre rifles were once legal , but in 1971 , the Government forbade all transfers of rifles .
Current rifle license holders may continue to own them , but their heirs must turn them into the police when the license - holder dies . [ 13 ]
Total remaining rifle licenses are 27,000 . [ 14 ]
Even shotguns and air rifles , the two legal types of firearm , are becoming rarer and rarer , as few people find it worthwhile to pass through a burdensome gun licensing process .
The number of licensed shotguns and air rifles declined from 652,000 in 1981 to 493,373 in 1989 . [ 15 ]
Although there is no mandatory minimum penalty for unlicensed firearm possession , 81 per cent of sentences for illegal firearm or sword possession are imprisonment for a year or more , perhaps because most gun crimes are perpetrated by professional criminals . [ 16 ]
The maximum penalty is ten years in prison and a one million yen fine .
Gun crime does exist , but in very low numbers .
There were only 30 crimes committed in 1989 with shotguns or air rifles . [ 17 ]
With no legal civilian handgun possession , Japan experiences in an average year less than 200 violent crimes perpetrated with a handgun , of which almost all are perpetrated by Boryokudan , organised crime groups . [ 18 ]
Most gun crimes involve only unlicensed possession , and not the commission of another crime .
Including the possession cases , there are about 600 handgun crimes a year and 900 long gun crimes . [ 19 ] ( p.28 )
In the years after the Second World War , former soldiers were the major source of illegal guns .
Today , illegal guns are usually smuggled from overseas ( especially from the Philippines and the United States ) by organised crime gangs which also import pornography , drugs , and illegal immigrants . [ 20 ]
A small number of craftsmen specialise in converting toy and model guns into working handguns for criminals . [ 21 ]
Gangster appetites for guns , and success in procuring them is said by the police to be increasing .
[ 22 ]
Of weapons confiscated from gangsters , guns accounted for only six per cent in 1960 , but 39 per cent in 1988 . [ 23 ]
On the other hand , the number of real handguns confiscated by the police has fallen from 1,338 in 1985 to 875 in 1989 .
The number of converted toy handguns seized has fallen from a high of 569 in 1985 to 128 in 1989 . [ 24 ]
Because gun crime still exists in tiny numbers , the police make gun licenses increasingly difficult to obtain .
The test and all - day lecture are held once a month .
The lecture almost always requires that the licensee take a full day off from work -- not a highly regarded activity by Japanese employers .
An annual gun inspection is scheduled at the convenience of the police , and also requires time off from work .
Licenses must be renewed every three years , with another all - day safety lecture and examination at police headquarters .
Tokyo is the safest major city in the world .
Only 59,000 licensed gun owners live in Tokyo . [ 25 ]
Per one million inhabitants , Tokyo has 40 reported muggings a year ; New York has 11,000 . [ 26 ]
The handgun murder rate is at least 200 times higher in America than Japan . [ 27 ]
The official homicide rate in Japan in 1988 was 1.2 homicide cases per 100,000 population , while in America it was 8.4 homicide cases per 100,000 . [ 28 ]
Robbery is almost as rare as murder .
Indeed , armed robbery and murder are both so rare that they usually make the national news , regardless of where they occur . [ 29 ]
Japan 's robbery rate is 1.4 per 100,000 inhabitants .
The reported American rate is 220.9 . [ 30 ]
People walk anywhere in Japan at night , and carry large sums of cash . [ 31 ]
III .
A Police State
Illegal gun possession , like illegal drug possession , is a consensual offense .
There is no victim to complain to the police .
Accordingly , in order to find illegal guns , the Japanese police are given broad search and seizure powers .
The basic firearms law permits a policeman to search a person 's belongings if the officer judges there is ' sufficient suspicion that a person is carrying a fire - arm , a sword or a knife ' or if he judges that a person 'is likely to endanger life or body of other persons judging reasonably from his abnormal behavior or any other surrounding circumstances ' . [ 32 ]
Once a weapon is found , the policeman may confiscate it .
Even if the confiscation is later admitted to be an error , the firearm is sometimes not returned . [ 33 ] ( p.29 )
In practice , the special law for weapons searches is not necessary , since the police routinely search at will .
They ask suspicious characters to show them what is in their purse or sack . [ 34 ]
In the rare cases where a policeman 's search ( for a gun or any other contraband ) is ruled illegal , it hardly matters ; the Japanese courts permit the use of illegally seized evidence . [ 35 ]
And legal rules aside , Japanese , both criminals and ordinary citizens , are much the more willing than their American counterparts to consent to searches and to answer questions from the police . [ 36 ]
' Home visit is one of the most important duties of officers assigned to police ...' explains the Japanese National Police Agency .
In twice - a- year visit , officers fill out Residence Information Cards about who lives where and which family member to contact in case of emergency , what relation people in the house have to each other , what kind of work they do , if they work late , and what kind of cars they own . [ 37 ]
The police also check on all gun licensees , to make sure that no gun has been stolen or misused , that the gun is securely stored , and that the licensees are emotionally stable . [ 38 ]
The close surveillance of gun owners and householders comports with the police tradition of keeping close tabs on many private activities . [ 39 ]
For example , the nation 's official year - end police report includes statistics like ' Background and Motives for Girls ' Sexual Misconduct ' .
The police recorded 9,402 such incidents in 1985 , and determined that 37.4 per cent of the girls had been seduced , and the rest had sex ' voluntarily ' .
The two leading reasons for having sex voluntarily were ' out of curiosity ' for 19.6 per cent , and ' liked particular boy ' , for 18.1 per cent . [ 40 ]
The fact that police keep records on sex is simply a reflection of their keeping an eye on everything , including guns .
Every person is the subject of a police dossier . [ 41 ]
Almost everyone accepts the paradigm that the police should be respected .
Because the police are so esteemed , the Japanese people co-operate with their police more than Americans do .
Co-operation with the police also extends to obeying the laws which almost everyone believes in .
The Japanese people , and even the large majority of Japanese criminals , voluntarily obey the gun controls .
There is no right to bear arms in Japan .
In practical terms , there is no right to privacy against police searches .
Other Western - style rights designed to protect citizens from a police state are also non-existent or feeble in Japan .
After the arrest , a suspect may be detained without bail for up to 28 days before the prosecutor brings the suspect before a judge . [ 42 ]
Even after the 28 day period is completed , detention in a Japanese police station may continue on a variety of pretexts , such as preventing the defendant from destroying evidence .
Rearrest on another charge , bekken taihö , is a common police tactic for starting the suspect on another 28 day interrogation process .
' Rearrest ' may ( p.30 ) occur while the suspect is still being held at the police station on the first charge .
Some defendants may be held for several months without ever being brought before a judge . [ 43 ]
Courts approve 99.5 per cent of prosecutors ' requests for detentions . [ 44 ]
Criminal defense lawyers are the only people allowed to visit a suspect in custody , and those meetings are strictly limited .
In the months while a suspect is held prisoner , the defense counsel may see his or her client for one to five meetings lasting about 15 minutes each .
Even that access will be denied if it hampers the police investigation .
While under detention , suspects can be interrogated 12 hours a day , allowed to bathe only every fifth day , and may be prohibited from standing up , lying down , or leaning against the wall of their jail cells . [ 45 ]
Amnesty International calls the Japanese police custody system a ' flagrant violation of United Nations human rights principles ' . [ 46 ]
The confession rate is 95 per cent . [ 47 ]
As a Tokyo police sergeant observes , ' It is no use to protest against power ' . [ 48 ]
Suspects are not allowed to read confessions before they sign them , and suspects commonly complain that their confession was altered after signature .
The police use confession as their main investigative technique , and when that fails , they can become frustrated and angry .
The Tokyo Bar Association states that the police routinely ' engage in torture or illegal treatment ' .
The Tokyo Bar is particularly critical of the judiciary for its near - total disinterest in coercion during the confession process .
' Even in cases where suspects claimed to have been tortured and their bodies bore physical traces to back their claims , courts have still accepted their confessions ' . [ 49 ]
In Japan , the legal system is , in effect , an omnipotent and unitary state authority .
All law enforcement administrators in Japan are appointed by the National Police Agency and receive their funding from the NPA .
Hence , the police are insulated from complaints from politicians or other citizens . [ 50 ]
There is hardly any check on the power of the state , save its own conscience .
What does the breadth of police powers have to do with gun controls ?
Japanese gun controls exist in a society where there is little need for guns for self - defense .
Police powers make it difficult for owners of illegal guns to hide them .
Most importantly , the Japanese criminal justice system is based on the Government possessing the inherent authority to do whatever it wishes .
In a society where almost everyone accepts nearly limitless , unchecked Government power , people do not wish to own guns to resist oppression or to protect themselves in case the criminal justice system fails .
Extensive police authority is one reason the Japanese gun control system works .
Another reason is that Japan has no cultural history of gun ownership by citizens . ( p.31 )
IV .
A History of Civilian Disarmament
The late historian Richard Hofstadter rejected the idea that America 's violent past might explain its present cultural attachment to the gun .
He pointed out that Japan also had a violent past , but has managed to tame its passions and evolve to a more pacific , weapon - free state . [ 51 ]
But the Japanese past , while violent , laid no cultural foundation for a gun culture .
Weapons always were , and remain today , the mark of the rulers , not the ruled .
A. Masters of Gun Manufacture
Guns arrived in Japan along with the first trading ships from Portugal in 1542 or 1543 .
Confident of the superiority of Japanese civilisation , the Japanese dubbed the Western visitors namban , ' Southern barbarians ' . [ 52 ]
The Portuguese had landed on Tanegashima Island , outside Kyushu .
One day the Portuguese trader Mendez Pinto took Totitaka , Lord of Tanegashima for a walk ; the trader shot a duck .
The Lord of Tanegashima made immediate arrangements to take shooting lessons , and within a month he bought both Portuguese guns , or Tanegashima as the Japanese soon called them . [ 53 ]
The Tanegashima caught on quickly among Japan 's feuding warlords .
The novelty of the guns was the main reason that the Portuguese were treated well . [ 54 ]
Lord Oda Nobunaga noted that ' guns have become all the rage ... but I intend to make the spear the weapon to rely on in battle ' .
Nobunaga was worried about how long -- 15 minutes -- it took to prepare a gun shot , and how weak the projectile was .
The Portuguese guns , among the best of their era , were matchlocks ( ignited by a match ) , and Japan 's rainy weather made the gun 's ignition system unreliable . [ 55 ]
Despite some initial problems , the Japanese rapidly improved firearms technology .
They invented a device to make matchlocks fire in the rain ( the Europeans never figured out how to do this ) , refined the matchlock trigger and spring , developed a serial firing technique , and increased the matchlock 's calibre .
They also dispensed with pre-battle introductions . [ 56 ]
Superior quality guns were produced ; during the 1904 Russo - Japanese war , 16th century matchlocks were converted to modern bolt - action and performed admirably . [ 57 ]
The Arabs , the Indians , and the Chinese had all acquired firearms long before the Japanese .
But only the Japanese mastered large - scale domestic manufacture . [ 58 ]
By 1560 , only 17 years after being introduced in Japan , firearms were being used effectively in large battles .
That year , a bullet killed a general wearing full armour . [ 59 ]
In 1567 , Lord Takeda Harunobu declared , ' Hereafter , guns will be the most important arms ' . [ 60 ]
He was right .
Less than three decades after Japan saw its first gun , there were more guns in Japan than any other nation on the planet .
Several Japanese feudal lords had more guns than the whole British army . [ 61 ] ( p.32 )
It was Lord Oda Nobunaga , an early critic of the Portuguese matchlocks , whose army truly mastered the new firearms technology . [ 62 ]
At Nagashino in 1575 , 3,000 of Nobunaga 's conscript peasants with muskets hid behind wooden posts and devastated the enemy 's cavalry charge .
There was no honour to such fighting , but it worked . [ 63 ]
Feudal wars between armies of samurai knights had ravaged Japan for centuries .
Nobunaga and his peasant army , equipped with matchlocks , conquered most of Japan , and helped bring the feudal wars to an end . [ 64 ]
Guns dramatically changed the nature of war .
In earlier times , after the introductions , fighters would pair off , to go at each other in single combat -- a method of fighting apt to let individual heroism shine .
Armoured , highly trained samurai had the advantage .
But with guns , the unskilled could be deployed en masse , and could destroy the armoured knights with ease . [ 65 ]
Understandably , the noble bushi class thought firearms undignified .
Even Lord Nobunaga personally refused to use guns and included samurai warriors in his armies .
The warriors who became heroes were still those who used swords or spears . [ 66 ]
B. The Sword Hunt
Yet as Japan grew more pre-eminent in firearms manufacture and warfare , she moved closer to the day when firearms would disappear from society .
The engineer of Japan 's greatest armed victories , and of the abolition of guns in Japan , would be a peasant named Hidéyoshi .
Starting out as a groom for Lord Nobunaga , Hidéyoshi rose through the ranks to take control of Nobunaga 's army after Nobunaga died .
A brilliant strategist , Hidéyoshi finished the job that Nobunaga began , and re-unified Japan 's feudal states under a strong central government . [ 67 ]
Having conquered the Japanese , Hidéyoshi meant to keep them under control .
On 29 August 1588 , Hidéyoshi announced ' the Sword Hunt ' ( taiko no katanagari ) and banned possession of swords and firearms by the non-noble classes .
He decreed :
The people in the various provinces are strictly forbidden to have in their possession any swords , short swords , bows , spears , firearms or other arms .
The possession of unnecessary implements makes difficult the collection of taxes and tends to foment uprisings ...
Therefore the heads of provinces , official agents and deputies are ordered to collect all the weapons mentioned above and turn them over to the Government . [ 68 ] ( emphasis added )
Although the intent of Hidéyoshi's decree was plain , the Sword Hunt was presented to the masses under the pretext that all the swords would be melted down to supply nails and bolts for a temple containing a huge statue of the Buddha .
The statue would have been twice the size of the Statue of Liberty . [ 69 ]
The Western missionaries ' Jesuit Annual Letter reported that Hidéyoshi ' is depriving the people of their arms under the pretext of devotion to religion ' .[ 70 ] ( p.33 )
Once the swords and guns were collected , Hidéyoshi had them melted into a statue of himself .
The historian Stephen Turnbull writes :
Hidéyoshi's resources were such that the edict was carried out to the letter .
The growing social mobility of peasants was thus flung suddenly into reverse .
The ikki , the warrior - monks , became figures of the past ...
Hidéyoshi had deprived the peasants of their weapons .
Iéyasu [ the next ruler ] now began to deprive them of their self respect .
If a peasant offended a samurai he might be cut down on the spot by the samurai 's sword . [ 71 ]
The inferior status of the peasantry having been affirmed by civil disarmament , the Samurai enjoyed kiri - sute gomen , permission to kill and depart .
Any disrespectful member of the lower class could be executed by a Samurai 's sword . [ 72 ]
Hidéyoshi forbade peasants to leave their land without their superior 's permission and required that warriors , peasants , and merchants all remain in their current post . [ 73 ]
After Hidéyoshi died , Iéyasu founded the Tokugawa Shogunate , which would rule Japan for the next two - and - a - half centuries .
Peasants were assigned to a ' five - man group , ' headed by landholders who were responsible for the group 's behaviour .
The groups arranged marriages , resolved disputes , maintained religious orthodoxy , and enforced the rules against peasants possessing firearms or swords .
The weapons laws clarified and stabilised class distinctions .
Samurai had swords ; the peasants did not . [ 74 ]
The total abolition of firearms never took place by a formal decree .
Hidéyoshi had taken the first step , by disarming the peasants .
In 1607 , the Tokugawa Shogunate took the second step by dictating that all gun and powder production take place in Nagahama . [ 75 ]
Permission from the central Government was required to engage in the business . [ 76 ]
In theory , the gunsmiths could fill any orders they got , as long as they got permission from the Teppo Bugyo( commissioner of guns ) .
In practice , almost no orders except those by the Government were permitted . [ 77 ]
The gunsmiths , starving for lack of business , slipped out of Nagahama .
Some went to work for Lord Tokitaka 's heirs on Tanegashima Island , where guns had first arrived in Japan .
In 1609 , the Government ordered the gunsmiths back to Nagahama .
This time , they would receive an annual pension , regardless of whether they produced guns , as long as they stayed put and let the Government keep an eye on them . [ 78 ]
The pensions were low , and the work ethic was still strong .
Many gunsmiths turned to sword production .
The Government compensated the other smiths by paying increasingly high prices for small gun orders .
By 1625 , the government monopoly was secure .
There were four ( p.34 ) master gunsmith families , and forty families of ordinary gunsmiths under them .
The Government ordered 387 matchlocks a year , and cut orders even further in 1706 . [ 79 ]
Eventually , the number of gunsmiths dwindled to 15 families , who supported themselves with government repair orders . [ 80 ]
The historian Noel Perrin offers five reasons why Japan was able to renounce the gun while Europe was not , despite the fierce resistance to guns by the European aristocracy .
First , the Samurai warrior nobility , who hated guns , amounted to 6 - 10 per cent of the population , unlike in Europe , where the noble class never exceeded 1 per cent .
The nobility simply counted for more in Japan . [ 81 ]
Second , Japan was so hard to invade , and the Japanese were such formidable fighters , that swords and bows sufficed for national defense . [ 82 ]
Invasions were unlikely in any case .
One hundred miles separate Japan from Korea ; 500 divide Japan and China .
Third , writes Perrin , swords were what the Japanese truly valued .
Guns depreciated the importance of swords , so a policy of protecting swords by eliminating guns was bound to be popular , at least with the classes who carried swords .
Hailed as ' the soul of the samurai ' , the sword was the physical embodiment of aristocratic honour and of the soul itself . [ 83 ]
When gun manufacture was still legal , and the Government decided to honour the four leading gunsmiths , it gave them swords . [ 84 ]
The cult of the sword persisted into the Second World War , when Japanese officers lugged traditional , cumbersome swords into Southeast Asian jungles . [ 85 ]
Even today , the sword is a common source of Japanese metaphor .
Self - indulgent behaviour is called ' the rust of my body ' , identifying one 's body with a sword . [ 86 ]
The fourth reason Perrin cites for the success in elimination of guns was a general reaction against outside influences , particularly Christianity .
Although the firearms made in Japan were the world 's best , they remained a symbol of Western technology . [ 87 ]
Finally , writes Perrin , in a society where aesthetics were prized , swords were valued because they were graceful to use in combat . [ 88 ]
Sociologist William
Tonso adds one more reason why Japan saw no need for guns ; there was not a great deal of big game to hunt . [ 89 ]
The abolition of firearms and abandonment of military aggression were just one element of the sakoku policy of isolation from the world and exaltation of ' Japaneseness ' .
The policy worked .
Edwin O. Reischauer , America 's leading historian of Japan , writes : ' The brawling , bellicose Japanese people of the sixteenth century gradually were transformed into an extremely orderly , even docile people ... Nowhere in the world was proper decorum more rigorously observed by all classes , and nowhere else was physical violence less in evidence in ordinary life ' . [ 90 ]
When Commodore Perry and his ' Black Ships ' arrived in 1853 , Japan was backwards only in technology .
An officer in Commodore Perry 's fleet reported , ' These people seemed scarcely to know the use of firearms ' . [ 91 ]
Japan had built a more harmonious , peaceful society than any Western nation has before or since . [ 92 ]
True , the Japanese paid a price for their order .
Freedom was an alien concept .
Interclass , social , and geographic mobility were extinguished .
Indeed , as Turnbull points out , ( p.35 ) Hidéyoshi's hunt for swords and firearms marked the end of social freedom in Japan .
The abolition of firearms probably would not have succeeded if Japan had a free economy or a free political system .
If the Japanese sacrificed a certain degree of economic and personal freedom , they also spared themselves the bloody conflicts that engulfed the Western world .
Though Japan had lived happily without guns , militarism , violence , or foreign influence , Commodore Perry 's arrival shook the nation deeply .
The Japanese realised that , however harmonious their society , they were centuries behind the West technologically , and , like China , in imminent danger of colonisation .
The Government tried to strengthen itself by adopting Western military technology and sending missions abroad to learn about the West . [ 93 ]
Under Hidéyoshi , the peasant class had lost its political power , and with it the privilege of owning arms .
When the aristocracy lost its own political power during the Meiji period , it too lost its right to bear arms .
In 1876 , the Government forbade the samurai to wear their two swords .
The next year , 40,000 discontented conservative samurai rose up in the Satsuma Rebellion led by the Shimpuren ( ' God- wind League ' ) .
They rejected the chance to use imported muskets , fought with swords instead , and were crushed by the conscript peasant army using guns . [ 94 ]
The new Japanese Government embarked on a rapid industrialisation program , including development of a self - sufficient munitions industry . [ 95 ]
During the early 20th century , the gun controls were slightly relaxed .
Tokyo and other major ports were allowed to have five gun shops each , other prefectures , three .
Revolver sales were allowed with a police permit , and registration of every transaction were required .
Nevertheless , the ownership of revolvers was ' practically nil ' according to one American observer . [ 96 ]
In the 1920s and 1930s , the military came increasingly to control civilian life .
Sonoda explains : ' The army and the navy were vast organizations with a monopoly on physical violence .
There was no force in Japan that could offer any resistance ' . [ 97 ]
The 1930s degenerated into a horrible period of government by assassination , as military factions attempted to destroy each other , and as militarists murdered opponents of war . [ 98 ]
Despite the strict gun laws , the frequency of assassinations far exceeded anything seen in Europe or North America this century .
Even today , assassinations still occur . [ 99 ]
Under Hidéyoshi and the Tokugawa Shogunate , strict gun control succeeded in Japan because it was consistent with the cultural needs of Japanese society .
Today , the gun control policy continues to succeed because it continues to match the basic character of Japanese society .
( p.36 )
V. The Preference for Paternalism
The Japanese historian , Nobutaka Ike , observes in modern Japan a ' preference for paternalism ' .
[ 100 ]
An American historian writes : ' Never conquered by or directly confronted with external forms of political rule ( except for the MacArthur occupation ) , they remained unaware of the relative , fallible nature of authority .
Authority was a " given " , taken for granted as an unalienable part of the natural order ' .
[ 101 ]
A Tokyo University historian describes 'an assumption that the state is a prior and self - justifying entity , sufficient in itself .
This results in a belief that ... the state should take precedence over the goals of other individuals and associations ...'. [ 102 ]
The differing meanings of the phrase ' rule of law ' highlight the contrast between American and Japanese views of authority .
In America , observes Noriho Urabe , ' rule of law ' expresses the subordination of Government to the law .
In Japan , the ' rule of law ' refers to the people 's obligation to obey the Government , and is thus ' an ideology to legitimize domination ' . [ 103 ]
The Japanese individual 's desires are ' absorbed in the interest of the collectivity to which he belongs ' , whether that collectivity be the nation , the school , or the family . [ 104 ]
There is no theory of ' social contract ' , and no theory that individuals pre-exist society and have rights superior to society .
[ 105 ]
The strongest sanctions are not American - style punishments , but exclusion from the community .
[ 106 ]
When Japanese parents punish their children , they do not make the children stay inside the house , as American parents do .
Punishment for a Japanese child means being put outside .
The sublimation of individual desires to the greater good , the pressure to conform , and internalised willingness to do so are much stronger in Japan than in America . [ 107 ]
More than gun control , more than the lack of criminal procedure safeguards , more than the authority of the police , it is the pervasive social controls of Japan that best explain the low crime rate .
Other nations , such as the former Soviet Union , have had severe gun control , less criminal justice safeguards , and more unconstrained police forces than Japan .
But the Soviets ' crime rate was high and Japan 's minuscule because Japan has the socially - accepted and internalised restraints on individual behaviour which the Soviets lack .
While social controls fell and crime rose everywhere in the English - speaking world in the 1960s , social controls remained and crime fell in Japan . [ 108 ]
More than the people of any other democracy , the Japanese accept the authority of their police and trust their government .
In this cultural context , it is easy to see why gun control has succeeded in Japan , the people accept gun control with the same readiness that they accept other Government controls .
Further , they have little incentive to disobey gun controls , since they have hardly any cultural heritage of gun ownership . ( p.37 )
VI .
An Unarmed Government
The Japanese Government promotes a social climate for gun control by the good example of disarming itself .
The police have little interest in using or glamorising guns .
When the national police agency was created in the late nineteenth century , many members were ex-samurai who were unemployed because of the abolition of feudalism .
They , of course , believed that guns were for cowards , and that real men fought with the martial arts .
Indeed , the Japanese police only took up firearms when ordered to do so in 1946 by General MacArthur .
Two years later , when the American occupation forces noticed that few police officers had obeyed the order to arm , the Americans supplied the police with guns and ammunition . [ 109 ]
The police have only .38 special revolvers , not the high - capacity 9 mm handguns often toted by the American police .
[ 110 ]
No officer would ever carry a second , smaller handgun as a back up , as many American police do .
Policeman may not add individual touches , such as pearl handles or unusual holster , to dress up their gun .
While American police are often required to carry guns while off - duty , and almost always granted the privilege if they wish ( even when retired ) , Japanese police must always leave their guns at the station .
Unlike in the United States , desk - bound police administrators , traffic police , most plainclothes detectives , and even the riot police do not carry guns . [ 111 ]
Instead of using guns , the police rely on their black belts in judo or their police sticks .
Indeed , police recruit training spends 60 hours on firearms compared to 90 hours on judo , and another 90 on kendo ( fencing with sticks ) .
( The number of hours that Japanese police recruits do spend on firearms training is larger than what most of their American counterparts receive ; that the Japanese are so thoroughly instructed in a weapon which they are expected to use in only the rarest of circumstances testifies to the highly cautious approach of the Japanese police towards firearms . )
After police school , few officers show any interest in further firearms training , while continued judo and kendo practice is frequent .
Annual police martial arts contests are important events .
Sixty percent of officers rank in one of the top judo brackets .
Beer bellies are non-existent .
In contrast , many American policemen , if confronted with deadly assault , have no combat technique to use except gunfire . [ 112 ]
The American police 's heavy reliance on guns serves , intentionally or not , to legitimise a similar attitude in the rest of the population .
The official Japanese police culture discourages use or glamorisation of guns .
One poster on police walls orders : ' Do n't take it out of the holster , do n't put your finger on the trigger , do n't point it at people ' .
[ 113 ]
Shooting at a fleeing felon is unlawful under any circumstance .
Police and civilians can both be punished for any act of self - defense in which the harm caused was greater than the harm averted . [ 114 ]
In an average year , the entire Tokyo police force only fires a half - dozen or so shots . [ 115 ] ( p.38 )
The police being disarmed , criminals reciprocate .
Although guns are available on the black market , there is little use of guns in crime .
The riot police leave their guns at the station ; and the masses of angry students who confront the riot police also eschew modern weapons .
The two sides instead study medieval military tactics , using mass formations of humans as battering rams or as shields .
For a short time in the early 1970s , some demonstrators broke the informal rules by resorting to molotov cocktails and home - made pistols similar to zip guns .
The riot police augmented their armour , but continued to eschew firearms .
In 1972 , the radical students resumed adherence to the old code , and the firearms vanished . [ 116 ]
Comparative criminologist , David Bayley , a proponent of stricter American gun controls , suggests that American police attitudes towards guns makes it impossible for gun control to be achieved .
As long as the police are armed , writes Bayley , they send the implicit message that armed confrontations with civilians are the norm , and that shootings of police officers , while sad , are nothing extraordinary . [ 117 ]
The model of Governmental disarmament is repeated at the broadest levels of Japanese society .
The military barely exists .
Japan 's rejection of militarism sets another good example for both gun control and for non-violence in general .
The lack of involvement in foreign war , in earlier centuries and today , may be an important factor in Japan 's culture of conformity and non-criminality . [ 118 ]
VII .
Suicide
The Japanese experience does not seem to support the hypothesis than fewer guns means fewer suicides .
While the Japanese gun suicide rate is one - fiftieth of America's , the overall suicide rate is nearly twice as high as America's . [ 119 ]
Teenage suicide is 30 per cent more frequent in Japan than America .
Every day in Japan , two Japanese under 20 years old kill themselves . [ 120 ]
Japan also suffers from double or multiple suicides , shinju .
Parents bent on suicide take their children with them , at the rate of one per day , in oyako - shinju .
In fact , 17 per cent of all Japanese officially defined as homicide victims are children killed by suicidal parents . [ 121 ]
One reason that the official Japanese homicide rate is so low is that if a Japanese woman slits her children 's throats and then kills herself , police statistics sometimes record it as a family suicide , rather than a sensational murder .
Thus , Japan 's tight family structures , which keep the overall crime rate low , are not unalloyed blessings .
Of the many reasons suggested by researchers for the high Japanese suicide rate , one of the most startling is weapons control .
Japanese scholars Mamon Iga and Kichinosuke Tatai argue that one reason Japan has a suicide problem is that people have little sympathy for ( p.39 ) suicide victims .
Iga and Tatai suggest that the lack of sympathy ( and hence the lack of social will to deal with a high suicide rate ) is based the Japanese ' feelings of insecurity and consequent lack of empathy .
They trace the lack of empathy to a ' dread of power ' .
That dread is caused in part by the awareness that a person cannot count on others for help against violence or against authority .
In addition , say Iga and Tatai , the dread of power stems from the people being forbidden to possess swords or firearms for self - defense . [ 122 ]
Stated another way , firearms prohibition is part of a culture that subordinates the individual to society .
When the individual finds himself not fitting into social expectations , self - destruction may often seem appropriate , since in a conflict between the individual and society , society is , by definition , always right .
It is interesting to note that the overall violent death rates ( counting both murders and suicides ) in many of the developed countries are approximately the same .
America has a high murder rate , but a relatively low suicide rate .
Japan and Switzerland have very low murder rates , but suicide rates twice the American level .
Seymour Martin Lipset notes the high suicide rates in Japan and western European countries and speculates that ' psychopaths there turn it on themselves ' . [ 123 ]
VIII .
Conclusion
The idea that Japanese gun laws should serve as model for other nations is not uncommon .
Some Americans propose laws even more severe than Japan's . [ 124 ]
Often , the suggestion comes as an offhand remark in an newspaper editorial , but even when the suggestion is advanced by scholars , the reasoning is often superficial and unpersuasive .
L Craig Parker , an American expert on the Japanese police , proposes that the United States adopt Japanese gun control and also other Japanese strategies , such as a National Police Agency .
Parker 's brief discussion of guns , however , simply recites statistics showing that Japan has less guns and less gun crime .
His only evidence that gun control would actually reduce crime in America is a study by Dr Leonard Berkowitz arguing that guns cause aggression .
Actually , what the studies by Berkowitz and others showed was that people acted more aggressively towards other people if the other person was associated with weapons ; for example , motorists reacted more aggressively to other vehicles slow to accelerate when a red light turned green if the slow car had a rude bumper sticker and a rifle in a gun rack . [ 125 ]
Summing up the perspective of many gun prohibitionists , one Japanese newspaper reporter writes , ' It strikes me as clear that there is a distinct correlation between gun control laws and the rate of violent crime .
The fewer the guns , the less the violence ' . [ 126 ]
But the claim that fewer guns correlates with less violence is plainly wrong .
America experienced falling crime and homicide rates in the 1940s , 1950s , and early 1980s , all periods during which per capita gun ( p.40 ) ownership , especially handgun ownership , rose . [ 127 ]
And Japan , with its severe gun control , suffers no less murder than Switzerland , one of the most gun-intensive societies on earth . [ 128 ]
Japan 's gun control does play an important role in the low Japanese crime rate , but not because of some simple relation between gun density and crime .
Japan 's gun control is one inseparable part of a vast mosaic of social control .
Gun control underscores the pervasive cultural theme that the individual is subordinate to society and to the Government .
The same theme is reflected in the absence of protection against Government searches and prosecutions .
The police are the most powerful on earth , partly because of the lack of legal constraints and particularly because of their social authority .
Powerful social authorities , beginning with the father and reaching up to the state , create a strict climate for obeying both the criminal laws and the gun control laws .
The voluntary disarmament of the Japanese Government reinforces this climate .
Ethnic homogeneity and economic equality remove some of the causes of criminality .
Simply put , the Japanese are among the most law - abiding people on earth , and far more law - abiding than Americans .
America 's non -gun robbery rate is over 70 times Japan's , an indication that something more significant than gun policy is involved in the differing crime rates between the two nations . [ 129 ]
Neither Japanese nor American prisoners have guns , but homicide by prisoners and attacks on guards occur frequently in American prisons , and almost never in Japanese prisons . [ 130 ]
Another indication that social standards matter more than gun laws is that Japanese - Americans , who have access to firearms , have a lower violent crime rate than do Japanese in Japan . [ 131 ]
As a general matter , gun control does not take a great deal of police time to enforce because the Japanese voluntarily comply .
The Japanese have acceded that gun control protects them effectively .
There was and is little need for individual self - defense guns .
Even if gun control were resisted , it would be relatively easy to enforce in Japan .
Police freedom to search and seize would help , and so would Japan 's status as an island , which makes control of illegal imports such as drugs or guns easier than in the United States . [ 132 ]
The civilian stock of gun ownership was always small .
Hence , civil disarmament was easy to enforce .
In Japan , the police set records in a year when they confiscate 1,767 handguns from gangsters . [ 133 ]
It is not uncommon for that many illegal handguns to be seized by the police in a single American city in one year .
Some of the Japanese tour groups in Hawaii take their customers to local gun clubs to do something that the customers have never done before : see , hold , and shoot a real gun . [ 134 ]
In short , while many persons may admire Japan 's near prohibition of gun ownership , it is not necessarily true that other nations , such as the United States , could easily replicate the ( p.41 ) Japanese model .
Japan 's gun laws grow out of a culture premised on voluntary submission to authority , a cultural norm that is not necessarily replicated in Western democracies .
Washington ’s efforts to discredit the Venezuelan Government have increased over the past few weeks .
Tactics and strategies applied in prior years attempting to overthrow the Chávez administration through a coup d’etat , an illegal oil industry strike that crippled the Venezuelan economy and a constitutional recall referendum on Chávez ’s mandate infused with illegal campaign contributions by the U.S. government to the Venezuelan opposition , all failed miserably .
After a brief period of reevaluation , the Bush Administration has recently launched a new strategy intended to isolate and eventually topple the Venezuelan Government .
The new aggression towards Venezuela is direct , open , public and hostile .
The Bush Administration , through its Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice , and her spokesmen , its Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and his spokesmen , and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , Porter Goss , has made clear that Venezuela is a target for Washington this year .
This time around , the strategy is clear : turn President Chávez into an international pariah in the world media and justify an intervention to save democracy .
Even more transparent are the mechanisms utilized to implement the strategy .
Since early January 2005 , major U.S. publications and television stations , including the Washington Post , Wall Street Journal , Los Angeles Times , Miami Herald , Fox News Network and CSNBC , to name a few , have published or broadcast well over 60 articles and programs regurgitating State Department accusations that President Chávez presents a “ negative force in the region , ” [ 1 ] is a “ threat to democracy , ” a “ semi-dictator , ” or that the Venezuela Government provides refuge and collaborates with “ terrorist ” groups , such as the Colombian FARC and ELN .
Such accusations are dangerous in today ’s world , where the Bush Administration is omnipotent to act preemptively to “ spread liberty ” and implement “ regime change ” where and when it sees fit .
The new strategy applied towards Venezuela represents a major policy shift for the Bush Administration .
While prior actions were more subtle , clandestine and low profile , the revised plan is confrontational .
Washington is now trying to openly intervene in Venezuela to remove Chávez from power , but attempts to excuse such actions by branding Chávez as a dictator and a major threat to U.S. national security .
Several recent articles in U.S. media have demonstrated such objectives .
The April 11 , 2005 edition of The National Review , an ultraconservative magazine representing right - wing views similar to those of Washington ’s ultraconservative right - wing government , presents a cover image of President Chávez , in military fatigues , a red beret and a face ten years younger , alongside President Fidel Castro of Cuba , with the byline , “ The Axis of Evil … Western Hemisphere Version ” .
The feature article , by rabidly anti-Castro Cuban - American Otto Reich , former Special Advisor to George W. Bush on Latin American Affairs and former Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs , along with a list of other top positions in the Reagan , Bush I and II administrations , presents an attempt to terrorize readers into believing Venezuela has become the primary threat to U.S. national security in the region .
Reich also claims that the U.S. ’s most “ pressing specific challenge is neutralizing or defeating the Cuba - Venezuela axis . ” [ 2 ]
The terms “ neutralizing ” and “ defeating ” are not friendly .
They imply hostility , violence and dominance .
These are not terms used within the sphere of diplomacy , they are expressions used in the context of armed conflict .
Such statements by Reich , who now works in the private sector as a U.S. Government Consultant , may seem laughable to many , but in the context of an administration that shares Reich ’s extremist views on Latin America and in light of the recent augment in public aggression towards the Venezuelan Government by high - level Bush officials , these remarks may not be far off .
In fact , Reich ’s recent article falls perfectly in line with the onslaught of Chávez - bashing commentaries and “ news stories ” published in U.S. papers since January .
Over the past two weeks , the Spanish - language version of the Miami Herald , El Nuevo Herald , has run a three - part series on the growing threat of organizations and individuals that support the Venezuelan Government from within the United States .
[ 3 ]
The articles , written by right - wing Cuban - American journalist Casto Ocando , who has written dozens of fervently anti-Chávez articles for that same paper , pretend to expose a network of Chávez supporters in universities and progressive groups that , at the appeal of the journalist , should be considered “ foreign agents ” or almost “ terrorist ” by the U.S. Government and public .
One of the articles even includes a map of where such pro-Chávez groups are located in the U.S. , with a large image of President Chávez in military fatigues imposed on top , as though the author were exposing some clandestine terrorist network secretly operating within the United States .
The groups and institutions mentioned by the Herald that form part of the “ sinister ” pro-Chávez network in the U.S. include Harvard University , New York University , Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , Global Exchange , Global Women ’s Strike , San Romero de las Americas Church in New York and its Pastor , Luis Barrios , the catholic missionary Maryknoll group , the author of this article ( yes , me ) , and several Bolivarian Circles , small community - based organizations that support Chávez modeled from the Venezuelan grassroots organizations that carry the same name .
Sounds like a scary group !
I am sure that thoughts of Maryknoll missioners , prestigious university professors , Harlem - based Pastors and the environmentally - friendly Global Exchange all lauding a foreign government that is investing its oil wealth in improving health care , education , housing and raising salaries , has driven fear into the hearts and minds of ordinary Americans . [ 4 ]
Media-CIA Relationship Exposed
But maybe the author ’s intent and not the content of the article should cause alarm .
During the publishing of the three - part series on the growing threat of pro-Chávez supporters in the U.S. , journalist Casto Ocando appeared on a local Miami television show on Channel 22 , discussing such “ threats ” in detail alongside fellow Cuban - American Félix Rodríguez , ex-CIA Officer responsible for the assassination of Ernesto “ Che ” Guevara and who was also an Iran - Contra operative . [ 5 ]
Just days earlier , this expert in CIA assassination techniques used against foreign leaders , Félix Rodríguez , was interviewed on that same program , “ Maria Elvira Confronta ” ( Maria Elvira Confronts ) , providing details about an assassination plot in motion against President Hugo Chávez . [ 6 ]
Ocando and Rodríguez ’s association merely points to a collaborative effort between CIA and news media , a relationship established decades ago by the United States Government .
On that same Miami program in October 2004 , the anti-Chávez Venezuelan actor , and coup participant , Orlando Urdaneta , appeared ordering the assassination of President Chávez and other “ top figures ” in the Venezuelan Government . [ 7 ]
Just weeks later , on November 18 , 2004 , lead government Prosecutor Danilo Anderson was assassinated by a powerful car bomb .
At that time , Anderson was in charge of several high profile cases , including the prosecution of coup leaders and participants .
His death marked the first political assassination in recent Venezuelan history .
The Venezuelan Government has repeatedly requested the State Department investigate these threats of violence against President Chávez coming from within the United States , yet no formal response has been issued and no actions have been taken .
Despite initial denials from State Department spokesmen regarding accusations from the Venezuelan Government that Washington was engaging in a coordinated effort with the media to discredit President Chávez , facilitate expressions of violence against the Venezuelan head of state and spread unsubstantiated rumors about terrorist connections and human rights violations , in early March 2005 , Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs , Roger Noriega , confirmed to the press that the United States had launched a “ campaign ” to raise consciousness in the region about “ the growing threat of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez . ” [ 8 ]
And what better way to publicize a campaign than through the mass media ?
The Office of Public Diplomacy Revived
In 1983 , the United States Government , by direct order of President Ronald Reagan ’s White House , established the Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbean ( LPD ) under the authority of the Department of State .
The LPD was staffed by personnel from the United States military , the U.S. Information Agency ( USIA ) , the government ’s primary propaganda office , and the Agency for International Development ( USAID ) .
Its primary advisor was the National Security Council , the most elite intelligence advisory committee in the U.S. , reporting directly to the President .
The notorious Otto Reich was chosen to direct the Office of Public Diplomacy , in order to spearhead the campaign to oust the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua .
Declassified documents from the U.S. Government , obtained by the National Security Archives , evidence the covert and illegal use of news media to promote U.S. foreign policy . [ 9 ]
Reich employed the personnel from U.S. military “ Psyops ” ( Psychological Operations Group ) to produce different kinds of propaganda and information for the LPD Office .
“ Psyop ” job duties included preparing “ daily summaries of exploitable information ” , “ analyzing media trends and highlighting areas of concern ” and “ suggesting themes and media for use ” by the Office of Public Diplomacy . [ 10 ]
The media used by the Office of Public Diplomacy to promulgate U.S. foreign policy on Nicaragua included The Wall Street Journal , The Washington Post , The New York Times , USA Today , CBS News , NBC News and Newsweek Magazine , amongst others .
The types of messages disseminated through Reich ’s office , as developed by the National Security Council and the Psyops , were intended to encourage the perception that U.S. aid to the contras , labeled “ freedom fighters ” by the U.S. , was a vital national interest of the United States .
To achieve that goal , Reich ’s office was to convince the U.S. public that the contras were fighters for freedom in the American tradition of democracy and the Sandinistas were “ evil ” .
The themes invoked in the psychological propaganda attempted to convince the public that the Sandinistas were engaging in a “ military build - up ” , had a “ communist connection ” and were “ human rights violators ” repressing “ freedom of the press ” , “ right of assembly ” , “ freedom of speech ” , responsible for the “ destruction of the economy ” and were “ linked to worldwide terrorism . ”
In 1987 , the United States General Accounting Office ( GAO ) determined that the Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbean had engaged in illegal and unethical practices and had violated government regulations .
[ 11 ] GAO and the Congress subsequently shut down the Office permanently .
But Otto Reich , instead of receiving punishment for his illegal actions throughout the years he headed the LPD was promoted to the position of U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela and stationed in Caracas .
During that period , he helped liberate Cuban terrorist Orlando Bosch , responsible for blowing up a Cubana de Aviación airplane flying from Barbados , killing all of the more than 65 people aboard the flight .
Reich later helped facilitate the entry of Bosch into the United States , where he roams free today . [ 12 ]
Otto Reich ’s Misinformation Campaign
Otto Reich was the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs , the position Roger Noriega holds today , during the April 2002 coup d’état against President Chávez .
This author has disclosed numerous documents from the Department of State and the CIA that evidence U.S. involvement in that coup . [ 13 ]
Amongst these documents is a heavily censured cable marked “ confidential ” , drafted by Otto Reich , laying out the State Department ’s position on the coup .
Despite the fact that the U.S. Government was well aware of the detailed coup plans , as revealed in a CIA Senior Executive Intelligence Brief dated April 6 , 2002 [ 14 ] , Reich , the master of mis-information , told all diplomatic representatives of the U.S. that they were to promote this false version of events :
“ On April 11 , hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans gathered to seek redress of their grievances .
Chávez supporters fired on anti-government protestors resulting in more than 100 wounded or killed ….
The government prevented five independent television stations from reporting on events .
After meeting with senior military officers , Chávez allegedly resigned the presidency .
A provisional civilian government , led by Pedro Carmona , assumed power and promised early elections . ” [ 15 ]
The intent of the U.S. Government was to misinform the world of the events giving rise to the illegal coup d’état that briefly overthrew President Chávez , therefore justifying its own participation in such actions and reinforcing its strategy to “ legitimately ” remove Chávez from power .
The fact that the U.S. Government had clear knowledge of the coup plans and actors in the weeks before the coup provides undisputed evidence of this fact .
The CIA intelligence brief of April 6 , 2002 unmistakably informed top level U.S. Government officials that , “ Dissident military factions …are stepping up efforts to organize a coup against President Chávez … the level of detail in the reported plans …targets Chávez and 10 other senior officials for arrest …
To provoke military action , the plotters may try to exploit unrest stemming from opposition demonstrations … ”
The CIA briefs from the weeks before also claimed knowledge of the coup ’s organizers : “ … the private sector , the media , the Catholic Church and opposition political parties ….
[ along with ] disgruntled military officers … still planning a coup , possibly early this month … ” [ 16 ]
Reich ’s efforts at the time of the coup against President Chávez in Venezuela were merely to continue what he was best at , disseminating false information – propaganda – intended to promote U.S. foreign policy , just as he had done fifteen years early in Nicaragua .
Today ’s campaign against Venezuela starkly parallels those tactics used back in the eighties by the Office of Public Diplomacy .
Though Reich no longer maintains an official position within the Bush Administration , his capacity as a private sector U.S. Government Consultant on International Affairs clearly shows his ties and influence remain .
And others in powerful positions within the U.S. Government are his colleagues from the low intensity conflict years in Central America during the Reagan - Bush administrations .
John Negroponte , former U.S. Ambassador in Honduras during the eighties is soon - to - be the new Director of National Intelligence , the highest capacity in the intelligence community , Charles Shapiro , ex-Ambassador to Venezuela during the coup who previously was a State Department diplomat in Central America during the eighties is now Under - Secretary of State for the Andean Region ( covering Venezuela ) , Reich ’s old buddy Roger Noriega took his place as Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs and Porter Goss , ex-CIA Official and member of the Operation 40 assassination squad in the 1960s , alongside Cuban terrorist Orlando Bosch , is now Director of the CIA .
Such relationships and backgrounds make it no surprise to see that today ’s campaign against Venezuela employs the same themes used , successfully , against the Sandinistas in the eighties .
In addition to the similar use of the National Endowment for Democracy and USAID to funnel millions into Venezuelan opposition parties and NGOs , the U.S. Government attempts to portray Chávez in the same exact light as the Sandinistas .
Repeated declarations from the State and Defense Departments , recycled in major U.S. media , claim the Chávez Government is engaging in a “ military build - up ” or “ arms race ” with its recent purchase of new weaponry from Russia ( note that the U.S. Government is the ONLY government to express such concerns .
None of Venezuela ’s neighbors have even raised an eyebrow .
And Brazil has publicly stated they have no concerns whatsoever with Venezuela ’s recent arms purchase ) ; that Chávez is a “ communist ” in the likes of Fidel Castro ; that his government “ violates human rights ” including “ freedom of the press ” , the “ right to assembly ” , “ freedom of speech ” , “ persecution of opposition groups and actors ” and that his administration is responsible for the “ poverty ” and “ economic devastation ” that has affected the country in recent years .
If you read a few paragraphs above in this commentary , you will find the same identical themes were used to discredit the Nicaraguan government by Reich ’s Office of Public Diplomacy .
Note that all of these claims against President Chávez and the Venezuelan Government are false .
There is more freedom of the press and freedom of speech in Venezuela than under any prior government .
The Chávez administration has never suspended any constitutional rights and in fact has expanded human rights under the 1999 Bolivarian Constitution that was promoted by President Chávez himself and ratified by an unprecedented national referendum .
In The Us , Telling the President He “ Sucks ” Can Land You in Jail
Recently , The Washington Post , published yet another article attempting to reinforce the false accusations repeated over and over again by State Department officials .
The Post has been the media most frequently utilized to reiterate U.S. foreign policy towards Venezuela and its editorial board is unquestionably anti-Chávez .
Remember , The Post figured prominently on the list of media utilized by Reich ’s Office of Public Diplomacy to disseminate “ black propaganda ” attempting to smear the Nicaraguan Government ’s reputation in the 1980s .
It appears as though such efforts have been revived in the case of Venezuela .
An article by Jackson Diehl , “ Chávez ’s Censorship : Where Disrespect Can Land You in Jail ” ( Washington Post , Monday , March 28 , 2005 , p.A17 ) , attempts to convince readers that a reformed Penal Code in Venezuela is somehow a repressive tool of an authoritarian regime .
Diehl references Article 147 : " Anyone who offends with his words or in writing or in any other way disrespects the President of the Republic or whomever is fulfilling his duties will be punished with prison of 6 to 30 months if the offense is serious and half of that if it is light . "
Yet this journalist fails to mention U.S. laws on the same subject matter , which are actually much stricter and truly repressive .
Title 18 of the U.S. Code , Section 871 , “ Threats Against the President or his Successors ” provides for up to five years of prison for any kind of “ threat ” against a U.S. President , Vice - President , his spouse or any one in the succession line who could become President , which includes a grand portion of Congress .
Section 871 has been used to jail individuals for telling a U.S. President he “ sucks ” [ 17 ] , informing a President that , " God will hold you to account , Mr. President ” [ 18 ] or for wearing “ anti- war ” or “ anti- Bush ” t- shirts . [ 19 ]
And lest we forget the more than 1800 protestors jailed during the August 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City for the crime of …protesting the president .
Moreover , by an Executive Order of the President of the United States and under the Patriot Act , a highly repressive law passed after September 11 , 2001 by the U.S. Congress , any non-U.S. citizen “ who has been deemed by the president to have been or have harbored a member of the al Qaeda organization , or anyone who has engaged in , aided , abetted , or conspired to commit acts of international terrorism , or acts that “ threaten to cause , or have as their aim to cause injury to or adverse effects on the United States , ” is subject to trial in a military tribunal in accordance with rules and procedures to be established by the secretary of defense . ” [ 20 ]
This means that the more than 18 million immigrants living in the United States , many of them legally , can be deemed by the President of the United States to have “ aided and abetted ” or somehow collaborated with “ terrorists ” , which is under the sole discretion of the President , and detained indefinitely with no rights and subject to a military tribunal .
Military tribunals do not respect rights to due process or even minimal civil or human rights .
So , basically , telling a U.S. President he “ sucks ” could end you in Guantánamo , dressed in orange , with no rights .
But remember , the U.S. holds a double standard when it comes to threatening the President .
The laws only apply to the U.S. President , and close allies of course .
Discussing in detail plans to assassinate the Venezuelan President on U.S. television carry no consequence .
Even maintaining armed militia training camps in Miami led by ex-Venezuelan military officers who claim to be preparing to overthrow Chávez is encouraged by the U.S. Government . [ 21 ]
Such terrorists operate and live freely within U.S. territory , and some even receive financing from the U.S. Government . [ 22 ]
Attacks against Venezuela Continue
The attacks against the Venezuelan Government have only increased since January , and there is no expectation that they will cease at this point .
Just days ago , the State Department released a report entitled “ Supporting Human Rights and Democracy : The U.S. Record 2004 - 2005 " , lauding its own efforts to promote democracy around the world , including efforts to invoke regime changes in some cases .
The report condemns Venezuela as a human rights abuser , detrimental to democracy in the region .
Its presenter , Michael Kozak , gave an ultimatum to the Venezuelan Government in his press conference , stating “ If you wish to have a decent relationship with us , you will have to reorient aspects of your governance towards the right direction . ” [ 23 ]
Sounds like a threat , one that surely will not be heeded by the Venezuelan Government .
But what is clear is that the bully tactics continue and finally , after the calls of many anti-Chávez groups in the U.S. and Venezuela combined with the powerful lobby of the anti-Castro Cuban - American community in Miami , the Bush Administration has finally decided to look south .
Venezuela , one of the top exporters of oil to the United States , may become the next target of a unilateral , preemptive strike .
Hopefully , the country will be able to fend off U.S. aggression , as it has successfully done in the past .
Venezuela has regional support from Brazil , Argentina , Uruguay , Chile , Bolivia , Cuba and even neighboring Colombia , despite the heavy U.S. influence and military presence in that nation .
Any type of conflict provoked by the Bush Administration against Venezuela would not be looked at favorably in the region , and surely would force a multilateral defense .
South America is more united today than ever before in history , and that is the true threat to the United States .
As the Venezuelan Vice President , José Vicente Rangel , confirmed recently , “ Latin America is no longer the backyard of the United States . ”
Eva Golinger , a Venezuelan - American attorney , is the author of “ The Chávez Code : Cracking U.S. Intervention in Venezuela ” , soon to be available through Amazon.com or directly through the author .

Every generation of schoolchildren has them , the playground put - downs that can leave a pupil 's reputation in tatters among their peers .
For the current generation , " gay " , " bitch " and " slag " are the most frequently used terms of abuse , according to a survey by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers ( ATL ) .
They are used by children of all ages , from nursery school upwards .
But the worst offenders are secondary school pupils , says the teaching union .
WHAT TEACHERS HEAR Gay ( 83 % ) Bitch ( 59 % ) Slag ( 45 % ) Poof ( 29 % ) Batty boy ( 29 % ) Slut ( 26 % ) Queer ( 26 % ) Lezzie ( 24.8 % ) Homo ( 22 % ) Faggot ( 11 % ) Sissy ( 5 % ) Source : ATL
The most popular by far is " gay " .
Of the teachers interviewed , 83 % said they heard it being used regularly and much more than its nearest rivals , bitch ( 59 % ) and slag ( 45 % ) .
So how did it achieve this dubious honour ?
The word has had many meanings over the centuries , often sexual , says Clive Upton , professor of Modern English Language at Leeds University .
" In the early 19th Century it was used to refer to women who lived off immoral earnings , " he says .
Around the 1970s it was claimed by the homosexual community as a descriptive term for their sexual orientation , now its most popular meaning .
By the 1980s it was finding its way into schools as a playground insult .
" Every generation grows up with a whole lexicon of homosexual insults , in my day it was ' poofter ' or ' bender ' , " says slang lexicographer Tony Thorne .
" They were used much more because they were considered more offensive than ' gay ' , which is more neutral .
' Tease '
" It 's only in the last four years that I 've documented it being used so much by young people .
It 's what we call a ' vogue ' word , which is a fashionable word . "
One reason for this increase in use could be because " gay " has partly lost its sexual connotations among young people , he says .
While still pejorative , for the majority of youngsters it has replaced words such as " lame " .
" I have interviewed scores of school kids about this and they are always emphatic that it has nothing at all to do with hostility to homosexuals , " says Mr Thorne , compiler of the Dictionary of Contemporary Slang .
" It is nearly always used in contexts where sexual orientation and sexuality are completely irrelevant . "
The ATL survey seems to say otherwise , lumping it in with clear insults such as poofter and batty boy .
But Katie , a 12 - year - old from Colchester , knows it in different context .
A bad pair of trainers is much more likely to be called " gay " than a person , she says .
" It 's used as more of a way to tease a friend rather than have a real go at someone .
I would n't call someone ' gay ' because I know that 's sort of bullying them . "
Terms such as ' batty boy ' are clear homophobic insults and much more straightforward to deal with
Deborah
Teaching assistant
The use of " gay " in this particular way was first recorded at the end of the 1970s and developed among US high school students , says Mr Throne .
It 's not only youngsters in the UK who have recently adopted it , the same has happened to the German equivalent , schwul , he adds .
This mutation of the word is one reason why using " gay " as in a pejorative sense often goes unchallenged .
Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles caused controversy in 2006 for his casual use of the word .
He said he'd used it to describe something as " rubbish " and was backed by the BBC .
" The word has what we call multiple coinage and that 's the problem , " says Mr Thorne .
" While teenagers are generally using it to mean ' lame ' it can separately be used as a homophobic term of abuse . "
It 's this ambiguity that prevents some teachers from tackling pupils who use it in a negative sense , says ATL .
They are afraid of " blowing trivial matters out of proportion " .
Force
" It 's tricky because it 's often a casually throwaway remark and said without any obvious malice , " says Deborah , a teaching assistant from Essex .
" Terms such as ' batty boy ' are clear homophobic insults and much more straightforward to deal with . "
Every generation has abusive words
But while " gay " may have changed for some , it is still being used as a means of bullying , as are many other homophobic insults ( see table , above ) .
Last year , the Westminster government announced the first guidelines for schools on how to deal with homophobic bullying .
Gay lobby group Stonewall says 65 % of young gay people experience homophobic bullying .
And many who are n't gay also get labelled as such .
" It 's a form of peer group control , " says psychologist Helen Cowie .
" Boys have to be masculine and macho and anyone who is n't must go along with it or face being bullied .
It 's a form of bullying that domineering people seek out vulnerable people and school age is a time of emergent sexuality which is itself a vulnerable time . "
Fellow psychologist Ian Rivers says the potency of such words is in the fact they " go to the very core of who we are " .
Yet sexual orientation is also invisible .
" It 's not about your heritage or your race , it 's not about things which someone can see . "
So it can't even be challenged , he says .
" How can children demonstrate that they are heterosexual .
There 's no effective recourse and this is what makes it so effective as a bullying tactic . "
Donald Christie , professor in the Department of Childhood and Primary Studies , says " sexual orientation " is a source of potential vulnerability .
" If there 's an area of life that children themselves feel insecure about they 're aware of their own vulnerability .
The whole point of bullying is about identifying and accentuating weakness in others . "
Ms Cowie has observed schools developing children as " peer supporters " to listen , mediate and support bullied children .
But " boys have a " harder time " adopting such roles because the attributes are not seen as masculine .
" In one school we studied they were known as queer supporters , " she notes .
Recalling her time as a boys ' secondary school teacher in the 1970s , Ms Cowie recalls how " obsessed " pupils were with homosexual innuendo .
" It did n't seem to matter what you read to the class they 'd always find an gay innuendo . "
In response to Doug and A Dawson .
I 'm a gay man , and as an adult would n't take much offence to hearing the word in the context of " uncool " .
Thats because I 've grown up , accepted myself , and accepted there are idiots and bigots out there .
However , consider a teenage boy or girl , just coming to terms with themselves and hearing the common term describing their sexuality - gay - being used as a synonym for something uncool , " sad " and disappointing .
But there 's a problem - focusing on this issue of terminology might allow the issue to be painted as " PC " when there is actually a very real problem of true homophobic bullying in schools that goes untackled .
Schools take the issue of race incredibly serious and have specific policies in place .
Its now time to do the same for homophobic bullying .
David Phillips , London , United Kingdom
It 's wrong to use it as a term for lame or rubbish , if someone was to use the " N " word in the same respect we would not hear the end of it .
Carl Lander , Ipswich , England
As a gay secondary school student , the word gay became increasingly less offensive even during the times when I was coming to terms with my own sexuality simply due to its saturation into playground language .
I recall its use evolving around the same time as " gay " was starting to be used as a noun .
" You 're a gay " was a very common put down , and was not always meant to make a claim that a person was homosexual or otherwise .
No doubt , a new socially acceptable casual word for " homosexual " will emerge in coming years once " gay " takes precedence as a negative term .
Terry , London
A large element of the reason , I 'm sure , is the common , vulgar assumption that only rough , tough working class types are " real men " , and that any male showing any sign of intelligence or interest in cultural or intellectual matters must be homosexual .
Albert Steptoe used to deride any such person as " he 's a poof " , and I ( from a working - class background but with a grammar school education , professional qualification and a university degree ) have also encountered it myself , though I have never shown any sign at all of homosexuality .
It 's basically a fear of the different : if different in one way they must be different in another , easily mocked , way .
Ray Ward , London , UK
" It 's only in the last four years that I 've documented it being used so much by young people . "
Where did Tony Thorne do his research ?
I would contend that " gay " has been one of the most commonly used derogatory words in playgrounds for more like 15 years , maybe longer .
AJL , London
Whilst the term " gay " is certainly a popular one , I would like to question the homophobic nature of the insult .
Having left secondary education only 20 months ago , school life is still very fresh in my mind .
The simple truth is that whilst teenagers throw the insult around with careless abandon , none of them are actually homophobic - the word has essentially picked up another meaning .
Those in the school grounds use it as an abrupt way of denouncing something as " uncool " .
I 'll happily admit to using the term to describe things I am unhappy with , but I certainly have no negative feelings towards those of a different sexual orientation .
Yet another misunderstanding of the youth by older generations .
Doug , Hampton
Stupid justification for allowing homophobic anti-gay sentiment to go unchallenged .
Try being a gay teacher or student and tell me " it does n't refer to sexuality " .
Imagine you are a gay student and someone calls something gay , and you say " do n't say that , because I 'm gay and I 'm not stupid " .
Guess what would happen to that kid ?
Trent , London
I blame Ali G .
Mo , London
I am a secondary school teacher and hear ' gay ' in a number of contexts every day .
The vast majority of usage is totally harmless and it is up to teachers to keep ahead of the game and use common sense - teachers are often guilty of taking this word out of context and ' creating ' a situation .
A Dawson , Hull
I suspect this is a reaction to the pushing of politically correct ideas on a reasonable population .
The homosexual community adopted " gay " as a positive description .
People come straight back and use it as a pejorative .
The same has happened with the term " special " which comes from " special needs " .
This was coined as an unemotive description but I often hear it used by young people to question people 's intellectual capacity .
The currency of kids ' conversation is often mean - and that 's part of the rough and tumble of their lives .
Children relish in the use of unacceptable terminology .

Teachers should be challenging and educating children .
I wonder how a homosexual teenager or child feels about growing up " gay " ( the term we all use ) when the connotation of this among children is that it is second class and pathetic ?

The first deep - sea mining machines - for extracting gold , silver and copper deposited near volcanic fissures on the ocean floor - are being built by a British engineering company .
The pioneering designs , which will resemble giant , abrasive vacuum cleaners , are at the forefront of an emerging underwater mineral extraction industry that is sounding alarm bells among marine biologists and environmental scientists .
A £ 33 m contract for two seafloor mining tools , capable of working at depths of more than a mile ( 1,700 metres ) , was awarded last December to the Newcastle upon Tyne firm , Soil Machine Dynamics .
If delivered according to schedule , the machines could begin excavation work by 2010 in the Pacific and inaugurate a new era in sub-sea exploration and mining .
The operation to recover these " poly - metallic " minerals , which are found in far higher concentrations than land - based ores , will generate a rich revenue source at a time when commodity prices are hitting record levels .
Big change
" We are leading the mining industry into the deep oceans , " says Scott Trebilcock , vice - president of business development at Nautilus Minerals Inc , the Canadian prospecting company that has ordered the machines .
" This is as big a change as it was for the oil and gas industry when it went offshore in the 1960s and 70s .
Billions of dollars have been spent over decades developing [ underwater ] pumps , hydraulics and trench - digging machinery .
We can use their technology for new targets : the poly - metallic deposits that contain gold , silver , zinc and copper . "
Nautilus 's first project , the Solwara 1 field , is within Papua New Guinea 's territorial waters , but the firm , whose operational management is based in Brisbane , Australia , has also taken up licence options on sites near Tonga , Fiji and New Zealand .
Those locations have been chosen because of proximity to volcanic activity at the margins of the Earth 's tectonic plates .
" Deposits are formed from heated sea-water , " Trebilcock explains .
" As it filters deeper into cracks , it absorbs sulphur and becomes acidic .
It can reach 300C and dissolves minerals until it bubbles up and hits water on the ocean floor , which is at approximately 2C . "
The metals precipitate out of solution and are deposited on the seabed .
These so - called SMS - seafloor massive sulphides - resemble giant " elephant turds " , according to one oceanographer .
Nautilus will work on underwater old vents that have cooled , some way back from the super - heated , active plate edges .
" Our material is 8 % - 10 % copper , " Trebilcock says .
" In land mines , the average is 0.59 % .
So for every tonne of copper produced , we move 40 times less material . "
Similar SMS deposits lie on the ocean floors around the world , particularly in the Arctic and along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge .
Those areas , however , are at far greater depths and are subject to worse sea conditions .
Soil Machine Dynamics is designing and assembling a tool that has a rotating , cutting head - like the machines used to hew coal out of underground seams - surrounded by a giant suction pipe .
The company describes the equipment as " a novel design for recovering ore which is found in massive sulphide deposits in rugged terrain .
It draws on technology ... developed in recent projects for trenching systems . "
The two seafloor mining systems will suck up 1.5 m tonnes of ore annually .
Trebilcock believes the operation will cause far less environmental damage than a similar - sized onshore mine .
He says : " There 's no disturbance to the site around the mine .
We 'll have no waste rock .
Everything we take up will be smelted .
" We have carried out an environmental impact study , which will be published this year .
We will have to show that we do n't have any long - term impact on any species or ecosystems .
We have spoken to NGOs and the Papua New Guinea government about this .
" Oil and gas [ companies ] disturb a far larger area when they open up a new field .
The dredging industry takes millions of tonnes off the ocean floor .
We have significant [ environmental ] advantages over land - based companies . "
However , some environmental groups , including WWF , are concerned that underwater mining will lead to despoilation of vast tracts of the seabed before they can be explored .
" These sites have limited physical integrity and great biodiversity , " Simon Cripps , director of WWF 's global marine programme , recently told Chemistry World magazine .
" We would like to see a thorough , independent impact assessment before any mining work begins . "
Catherine Coumans , a coordinator at Mining Watch Canada , has been to Papua New Guinea to examine the impact of mining .
" I have studied mines . . . where the tailings [ wastes ] are flushed out to sea or simply dumped in rivers , " she says .
" [ Papua New Guinea ] has , tragically , some of the worst forms of mining and disposal .
Now it is going to have experimental undersea mining .
New frontier
" There are concerns about disturbance of the sea bottom .
Very little is known about it .
This is a new frontier that has yet to be explored with a fragile , marine ecosystem .
There 's no significant independent work that has been done on the impact of mining .
I would challenge the company to provide an independent scientific study . "
Nautilus will not be the first underwater mining operation in the world .
De Beers has been stripping diamonds from the seabed off Namibia for several years , but at far shallower depths - generally around 150 metres .
Metal detecting
US scientists first began probing the Pacific seabed for manganese nodules in the 1970s .
The price of the metal plunged shortly after and exploration was suspended .
Nautilus is not alone in prospecting for concentrated ores on the deep - sea floor .
Neptune Minerals , a UK registered company , is also working on deposits left around extinct " black - smoker " vents .
The firm , which has headquarters in Australia , has identified SMS deposits in several locations .
Exploration licences have been applied for by Neptune in territorial waters off Papua New Guinea , Japan , New Zealand , Palau , the Federated States of Micronesia , the Northern Mariana Islands , Vanuatu and Italy .
An estimated 350 vent fields have been found worldwide .
Both firms cite gold , silver , copper and zinc as main targets .
Nautilus says its operation will be profitable as long as the price of copper stays above $ 1.50 a pound ; it is now $ 3.80 .
The cost of metals has been boosted by the expansion of China and India 's economies , likely to sustain prices for some time .
Nautilus plans to extract 6,000 tonnes daily - some 1.8 m tonnes a year - from a field in the Bismarck Sea .
It says it should eventually recover up to 500,000 ounces of gold and 160,000 tonnes of copper a year .

On Saturday , April 5 , the London Telegraph reported that " British officials gave warning yesterday that America ’s commander in Iraq will declare that Iran is waging war against the US - backed Baghdad government .
A strong statement from General David Petraeus about Iran ’s intervention in Iraq could set the stage for a US attack on Iranian military facilities , according to a Whitehall assessment . "
The neocon lackey Petraeus has had his script written for him by Cheney , and Petraeus together with neocon warmonger Ryan Crocker , the US governor of the Green Zone in Baghdad , will present Congress next Tuesday and Wednesday with the lies , for which the road has been well paved by neocon propagandists such as Kimberly Kagan , that " the US must recognize that Iran is engaged in a full - up proxy war against it in Iraq . "
Do n’t expect Congress to do anything except to egg on the attack .
On April 3 the International Herald Tribune reported that senators and representatives have made profits from their investments in defense companies totaling $ 196 million .
Rep. Ike Skelton , the Democrat chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , is already on board with the attack on Iran .
The London Telegraph quotes Skelton : " Iran is the bull in the china shop .
In all of this , they seem to have links to all of the Shi’ite groups , whether they be political or military . "
All Skelton knows is what the war criminal Bush regime tells him .
If Iran really does have all these connections , then it behooves Washington to cease threatening Iran and to make nice with Iran in order to stabilize Iraq and extract the US from the nightmare .
Reporting from Tehran on April 4 , Reuters quotes Mohsen Hakim , whose father , Abdul Aziz al - Hakim , leads the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council , an ally of the Maliki US puppet - government in Iraq : " Tehran , by using its positive influence on the Iraqi nation , paved the way for the return of peace to Iraq and the new situation is the result of Iran ’s efforts . "
Instead of thanking Iran and working with Iran diplomatically to restore stability to Iraq , the Bush regime intends to expand the nightmare with a military attack on Iran .
Ryan Crocker was quick to dispute Hakim ’s report that Iran had used its influence to end the fighting in Basra .
Crocker alleged that Iran had started the fighting .
The absurdity of Crocker ’s claim is obvious as even the neocon US media reported that the fighting in Basra was started by the US and Maliki in an effort to clear out the Shi’ite al - Sadr militias .
Most experts saw the attack on al - Sadr for what it was : an effort to remove a potential threat to the US supply line from Kuwait in the event of a US attack on Iran .
Crocker alleges that the rockets dropping on the Green Zone during the Basra fighting were made in 2007 in Iran .
As should be obvious even to disengaged Americans , if Iran were to arm the Iraqi insurgency , the insurgents would have modern weapons to counter US helicopter gunships and heavy tanks .
The insurgents have no such weapons .
The neocon lie that Iran is the cause of the Iraqi insurgency is just another Bush regime lie like the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and connections to al Qaeda and the lie that the Taliban in Afghanistan attacked the US .
The Bush regime will tell any lie and orchestrate any event in order to " finish the job " in the Middle East .
" Finishing the job " means to destroy the ability of Iraq , Iran , and Syria to provide support for the Palestinians and for Hezbollah in southern Lebanon against Israeli aggression .
With Iraq and Iran in turmoil , Syria might simply give up and become another American client state .
With Iraq and Iran in turmoil , Israel can steal the rest of the West Bank along with the water resources in southern Lebanon .
That is what " the war on terror " is really about .
The entire world knows this .
Consequently , the US and Israel are essentially isolated .
The US can only count on the support that it can bribe and pay for .
At the NATO - Russian summit in Bucharest , Romania , on April 4 , Russian President Putin said : " No one can seriously think that Iran would dare attack the U.S. Instead of pushing Iran into a corner , it would be far more sensible to think together how to help Iran become more predictable and transparent . "
Of course it would , but that is not what the warmonger Bush regime wants .
Perhaps the British government has derailed the plot to attack Iran by leaking in advance to the London Telegraph the disinformation Cheney has prepared for Petraeus and Crocker to deliver to the complicit US Congress next Tuesday and Wednesday .
On the other hand , the US puppet media is likely to bury the real story and to trumpet Petraeus ’ claims that Iran has , in effect , already declared war on the US by sending weapons to kill US troops in Iraq .
By next Thursday we will know from how the Petraeus - Crocker dog and pony show plays in the US Congress and media whether the Bush Regime will commit yet another war crime by attacking Iran .

Wealthy Democrats are preparing a four - month , $ 40 million media campaign centered on attacks on Senator John McCain .
Dems plan $ 40 M hit on McCain
Wealthy Democrats are preparing a four - month , $ 40 million media campaign centered on attacks on Sen. John McCain .
And it will be led by David Brock , the former investigative reporter who first gained fame in the 1990s as a right - wing , anti-Clinton journalist .
The planned campaign is the product of a shakeup in the top ranks of the struggling independent Democratic groups .
Brock , now best known as the ex-conservative founder of the liberal group Media Matters , last month quietly assumed the chairmanship of what 's expected to be the main vehicle for independent Democratic attacks on McCain , now called Progressive Media USA .

The move comes after the groups that had been expected to spearhead attacks on McCain — the Fund for America and Progressive Media USA 's previous incarnation , the Campaign to Defend America — failed to raise the money needed to dent McCain 's armor .
" We 're a little behind where we need to be , " he said .
But after a dinner Tuesday night at the Manhattan apartment of liberal megadonor George Soros , at which Brock and consultant Paul Begala laid out the group 's plans , Brock said his group now has commitments worth $ 7.5 million — almost twice what the Fund for America is expected to report raising in the first quarter of this year .
He said the group would begin running ads before it meets its $ 40 million goal .
Brock suggested that the group could do the work of a press corps that , he says , has " fallen down on the job " when it comes to McCain .
" A void that might be filled , while the Democrats fight it , out by the press is not going to be filled , because the press is in love with John McCain , " Brock said in an interview at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan .
" It 's what McCain is allowed to say without being challenged by facts that will show him to have said something different in the past . "
Brock 's most recent book is called " Free Ride : John McCain and the Media . "
Brock would n't detail Progressive Media USA 's strategy , and stressed that — as required by his group 's nonprofit status — the spending would be on a mix of direct electoral politics and issue ads with no direct connection to the race .
But he said he 's scrambling to raise " a few million " dollars more this month to get ads on the air — ads which have already been drafted for the group by a number of Democratic consulting firms .
" There 's a sense of urgency , and people want to go , and we want to go , and the question is bringing the money in to say we 're ready to go , " he said .
Brock 's remarkable emergence as a leader of the Democratic Party 's shadow campaign efforts marks a milestone in a long personal journey that began in the early 1990s with the notoriety he gained from magazine stories written for The American Spectator , a conservative monthly .
Among his controversial articles was one alleging that Bill Clinton had used Arkansas state troopers to facilitate his philandering , a piece that set the wheels in motion for Paula Jones to file suit against Clinton for sexual harassment .
In 1993 , Brock authored " The Real Anita Hill , " a critical book about the woman who accused Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment .
Brock later apologized to Clinton in a public letter and broke publicly with the conservative movement .
He wrote about his disillusionment in his 2002 memoir " Blinded by the Right , " and Hillary Rodham Clinton later helped him establish Media Matters , which criticizes reporters for alleged right - wing " misinformation . "
Brock is now seen in political circles as closer to Sen.
Hillary Clinton 's campaign than to Sen. Barack Obama's , but Brock said he has already met with former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle , a close Obama ally .
" This is a unity play , " Brock said .
Donors had begun to complain that while the Campaign to Defend America had built a large organization — it has , Brock said , 29 staffers , most devoted to " research " — it had failed to show it could mount a large - scale media campaign .
The Campaign to Defend America aired a single ad called " McSame " in small markets in Ohio and Pennsylvania and ran polls after it aired to test its impact .
The ad features President Bush 's head cut and pasted onto McCain 's shoulders , as a narrator intones that their policies on a range of issues are " McSame . "
" We need a new direction , not the McSame old thing , " the narrator concludes .
" It tested off - the - charts well , " said Brock , referring to his group 's research into viewers ' reactions to the ad .
Brock 's words , and his unpaid chairmanship , reflect alarm that Democrats are missing an opportunity to define McCain , even as the presumptive nominee tours the country telling his own story .
The plan , conceived last fall , had been for the Fund for America to raise $ 100 million from wealthy Democrats , and to transfer it to groups including the Campaign to Defend America and America Votes , a Soros - backed independent group aimed at strengthening Democrats ' field organizing .
But Fund for America has been unable to raise the money , and Campaign to Defend America had agreed not to raise its own money .
Last Thursday , Brock said , he informed an official of the fund that his group would begin directly raising its own funds , a move that puts the usefulness of the Fund for America in question .
" We are as committed at Progressive Media USA to having the money we need to fully execute our mission as we are to seeing to it that America Votes has the money to execute its mission , " he said , a formulation that appeared pointedly to exclude the Fund for America , which had been established as a kind of parent organization .
Brock added that he was open to continue to raise money jointly with the Fund for America — if the distribution is " equitable . "
The organizational shakeup also reflects a move away from MoveOn.org , the influential activist group that relies on money from small donors , and back toward the Democratic establishment .
Brock 's arrival means that Tom Matzzie , a former MoveOn staffer who remains the secretary of Progressive Media USA , is no longer the group 's most visible official .
A founder of MoveOn , Wes Boyd , also left the group 's board , and a former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Susan McCue , joined as the group 's treasurer .
Brock said that with the help of a new legal team , the group had solved a key question connected to its financing .
Incorporated as a 501 ( c ) 4 nonprofit , the group has the advantage of not being required to disclose its donors .
But it is barred by law from taking money from unions , a major source of funds for progressive causes .
Brock said he was creating a linked 527 group , Progressive Media Action , which would accept — and disclose — union and other funds .
Though donors and operatives say they expect the group 's highest profile work to be attacks against McCain , the new Democratic groups were conceived to build an infrastructure lasting beyond this election , and Brock — whose Media Matters is on the vanguard of the well - funded new liberal establishment — said Progressive Media USA would live beyond this year 's election .
Brock said Los Angeles real estate magnate Steve Bing was among a group of donors backing his group 's long - term mission — despite many Democrats ' expectations that Bing and other Clinton supporters would only contribute if Clinton is the nominee .
Soros , the group 's key backer , supports Obama , and hosted a key , early gathering of the senator 's wealthy New York supporters .
Brock said the group would be a ready - made vehicle to conduct media campaigns backing liberal causes on short notice , an analog to the partisan conservative message machine , giving liberals " the ability to create a real echo chamber . "
He recalled that in 2004 , his fledgling group had debunked " 90 percent " of the content of an advertisement Swift Boat Veterans ' for Truth that challenged Sen .
John Kerry 's war record — but had no way to distribute the information .
" Progressive Media USA will be a permanent part of progressive media infrastructure , " he said .
But while the group 's long - term goals may be broader , Brock says his commitment to the group is on a different timetable .
" I 've committed to doing this through November , " he said .
Let me be the first to say that sucks .

WITH some fanfare , the world ’s largest pork producer , Smithfield Foods , recently announced that it intended to phase out certain cages for its breeding females .
Called gestation crates , the cages virtually immobilize pigs during their pregnancies in metal stalls so narrow they are unable to turn around .
Numerous studies have documented crated sows exhibiting behavior characteristic of humans with severe depression and mental illness .
Getting rid of gestation crates ( already on their way out in the European Union ) is welcome and long overdue , but more action is needed to end inhumane conditions at America ’s hog farms .
Of the 60 million pigs in the United States , over 95 percent are continuously confined in metal buildings , including the almost five million sows in crates .
In such setups , feed is automatically delivered to animals who are forced to urinate and defecate where they eat and sleep .
Their waste festers in large pits a few feet below their hooves .
Intense ammonia and hydrogen sulfide fumes from these pits fill pigs ’ lungs and sensitive nostrils .
No straw is provided to the animals because that would gum up the works ( as it would if you tossed straw into your toilet ) .
In my work as an environmental lawyer , I ’ve toured a dozen hog confinement operations and seen hundreds from the outside .
My task was to evaluate their polluting potential , which was considerable .
But what haunted me was the miserable creatures inside .

What do I get for my federal taxes ?
Our public schools are failing , Social Security is insolvent , Medicare & Medicaid are run by a corrupt government that uses taxpayer money to overpay the corporations that run it .
Our military is in shambles , our economy is on the brink of complete collapse and all our leaders can think of to do in order to solve the problem is to use our tax dollars to bail out the mistakes of corporations while Americans end up homeless and broke .
And stuck with the bill .
Do people understand how much money we have spent in Iraq ?
Seriously really , get a grip and really GET how much money has gone down the hole ?
And even if they do , do they realize that the Iraq bill , from a dollar perspective , HASN'T COME DUE YET ???
The shit going on with the economy right now has NOTHING to do with the THREE FUCKING TRILLION DOLLARS that this clusterfuck in Iraq will eventually cost us .
$ 3,000,000,000,000 / 300,000,000 = $ 10,000 / ea .
That means that RIGHT NOW , without ANY interest , each and every American in this country is in for $ 10 fucking K .
On top of our current federal and state income tax burden .
Now , I pay for electricity .
I pay for internet .
I pay for television and I pay for my phone .
The tax I pay at the pump covers most of the cash either state or federal government spend on shit like road repairs , but whatever .
I pay for the gas to heat my home and cook my food .
I pay a shitload at the hospital and even pay tax on some of that shit .
I pay sales tax .
I even pay retail tax , even though the corporations pass ALL their taxes on to me when I buy their shit .
So what the fuck do I get ?
A military that is now broken .
An infrastructure that is crumbling .
A justice system that favors their own , the rich and the politicians , and if to add insult to injury , herd me like a fucking piece of cattle and actually go out of their way to find a reason to make me pay them for some bullshit slight .
So what the hell is a rational guy supposed to do ?
What did our forefathers do , when faced with this kind of bogus farce of representation , when bullied into paying for something they do n't even want or need ?
When a man with a checkbook has greater sway than a million voices , OR EVEN ONE FUCKING VOICE , then has n't our grievance become that of the founders of this country ?
My wife and I are very similar , but we definitely have our differences .
She does n’t care for Chick - fil - A , but I love it .
I love all of their stuff , and their management is great in my area .
Every Chick - Fil - A in the Jacksonville area is very clean , has great service , and the food is very fresh .
She debated with me that it was so unhealthy , and it ’s too greasy for her .
Then , I was reading an article in Men ’s Health a few months ago that rated Chick - fil - A an “ A ” for fast food choices , because all of the choices on the menu are less than 500 calories .
Granted , there are some choices that are worse than others on the menu , but generally Chick - fil - A strives to make their food as healthy as fast food can be by using leaner frying oils , wheat buns on the chargrilled chicken sandwiches , and offer light dressings .
They also offer side salads and fruit cups as an alternative to their fatty “ but delicious ” waffle fries .
Not to mention , you can get a lunch or dinner for less than $ 8.00 on most meals .
One of the biggest fallacies about fast food right now is that the upscale fast food places are more healthy .
Restaurants such as Chipotle and Panera Bread portray an image that it is healthier for you rather than greasy burgers and french fries .
But in reality , the items on their menus are gut busters .
Many of the Panera Bread signature sandwiches are 700 to 900 calories each !
Pair that with soup and a drink , and you ’re well over 1,000 calories .
We all know that humongous Chipotle burritos are a portion ’s worst nightmare .
It ’s tough to eat one of their burritos that is n’t less than 1,000 calories .
Plus , they come at a premium price .
You will typically pay $ 9.00 to $ 10.00 per meal at these half sit - down restaurants .
Here are two suggestions for healthy , cheap meals from Chick - fil - A that I recommend .
Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich : 270 calories , 3.5 grams of fat , 33 carbs , and 28 grams of protein Side Salad with Fat Free Honey Mustard / Sunflower Seeds / Croutons : 270 calories , 12.5 grams of fat , 24 carbs and 6.5 grams of protein .
Diet Coke or Diet Lemonade : 25 calories for the Diet Lemonade , 0 for Diet Coke

Rupert Murdoch 's takeover of the Wall Street Journal has been swift and smooth - till now .
Marcus Brauchli , the modernizer who sought to reconcile the storied business newspaper with its new owners , is reported to be quitting his position .
Sources at the Journal tell Time that Brauchli is submitting a letter of resignation , with his departure to be announced as early as Tuesday morning .
It 's a surprise .
Brauchli was one of the few Journal managers who tacitly supported the takeover of the Journal by Murdoch 's News Corporation , hoping the removal of the Bancroft family and a deep - pocketed backer would free a newspaper which had become hidebound .
And Murdoch aides showed no signs of wanting him out ; the Journal 's new publisher , Robert Thomson , was a friend of Brauchli when both were foreign correspondents in the Far East .
But the Australian media mogul , and his lieutenants , have shown growing impatience with the Journal 's resistance to their plans .
Murdoch plans to turn the Journal into a full - fledged competitor to the New York Times .
even if that means sacrificing the Journal 's grip on business readers , or its prized reputation for elegant long - form writing .
Brauchli is the first high - profile casualty of this clash .
McCain economic advisor : Gas prices unrelated to Iraq war David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday April 7 , 2008

Print This Email This John McCain 's critics have seized on his admission to the Wall Street Journal editorial board that he " does n't really understand economics , " suggesting it means McCain is the wrong candidate to deal with a struggling economy .
McCain economic advisor Carly Fiorina attempted to dispel those concerns in an appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe. Fiorina , who served as CEO of Hewlett - Packard until her dismissal in 2005 over issues relating to the direction of the company , has been suggested as a possible McCain running mate .
However , she may not have done her candidate any favor when she stated that skyrocketing gas prices " have nothing to do with the Iraq war . "
" John McCain impressed me as somebody who understood how the economy worked , " Fiorina began , speaking of her first meeting with McCain in 2000 .
" I think that comment [ about not understanding economics ] , which was made one time and blown totally out of proportion , is frankly more a reflection of John McCain 's innate humility than anything else . "
Mika Brzezinski then brought up McCain 's remarks about remaining in Iraq for 100 years .
" When you think about how much this war has cost this country , " she asked , " how does the Iraq War play into his economic goals ? "
" There 's no question that the Iraq War is costing us a lot of money , " Fiorina replied .
" But it 's also the case that the housing crisis has nothing to do with the Iraq War .
High fuel prices have nothing to do with the Iraq War , per se .
And high food prices , in particular , have nothing to do with the Iraq War . ...
It 's not fair ... to try and make the Iraq War the cause of our our current economic difficulties . "
Democratic candidate Barack Obama has recently argued , " When you 're spending over $ 50 to fill up your car because the price of oil is four times what it was before Iraq , you 're paying a price for this war .
When Iraq is costing each household about $ 100 a month , you 're paying a price for this war . "
Joe Scarborough further reminded Fiorina that in 2004 she had offered a controversial defense of outsourcing , saying , " There is no job that is America 's god - given right any more . "
" Where do we go from here ? "
Scarborough asked " A year ago , John McCain started calling for a substantial reform of unemployment insurance , " Fiorina replied .
" He said we need to train people so they can compete .
...
We help them get back in the game by giving them the skills they need to compete for 21st century jobs . "

Job woes are in the news , but here 's a different twist : Human - resources executives at some of the country 's largest companies say they 'll be facing a tougher hiring environment this year — not because they have no jobs to fill but because they 'll have trouble filling slots with suitable candidates .
A recent survey of HR executives at Fortune 500 and smaller companies found they expect mid- and senior - level employees will be more difficult to hire in 2008 .
Most said they 'd probably be paying 5 to 15 percent salary premiums to fill accounting , finance , marketing , sales , engineering , information technology , clinical , and midlevel management positions .
Entry - level positions wo n't be harder to fill , according to the survey , and new hires in retail and clerical positions can expect to see the smallest bump in salary .
The results come as the Labor Department reports that new jobless claims for the week ending February 23 climbed above expectations and continuing jobless claims hit their highest point in more than two years .
An index that measures help - wanted advertising in major newspapers was also down in January , prompting Conference Board labor economist Ken Goldstein to suggest the labor market " could grind to a halt . "
But such widely reported unemployment figures have been masking the continued demand for employees in industries like healthcare , IT , finance , engineering , and sales , says Daniel Solomons , CEO and president of Hyrian , the recruitment process outsourcing firm that conducted the survey .
Accounting firms , which are thriving as corporations need to file paperwork to comply with the Sarbanes - Oxley reform law , are in serious need of workers , including recent college grads .
That means the industry 's top talent is hearing from company recruiters several times a week , says Ben Gotkin , national director of experienced recruiting for RSM McGladrey , an accounting and consulting firm with 8,000 employees .
" In our industry , [ it 's ] associate level on up , " Gotkin says .
" The talent is that much in demand .
They 're getting calls from third - party agencies , headhunters ; they 're getting calls from competitors ; they 're getting calls from industry .
This happens constantly . "
RSM expects to make between 2,000 and 2,200 hires just this year , Gotkin says .
There 's also strong , across - the - board demand for marketing , sales , and finance professionals .
William Rothwell , a professor of workforce education and development at Penn State University , says companies are being hit now with a " double whammy . "
" For years , companies have been downsizing , particularly at the middle - manager level , " Rothwell says .
" And now the baby boomers are nearing retirement .
There 's a correlation between age and level in a company , so many senior executives are now nearing retirement age . "
Many companies have also been ignoring succession planning , he adds .
In a bid to save money , they 've cut back on training and development of midlevel executives .
At Christiana Care Health System in Wilmington , Del. , executives realized two years ago that they needed a succession plan and a strategy for finding leadership talent .
" You either need to go buy it or you need to go build it , " says Sean Ellsworth , director of recruiting services at Christiana .
Hiring an executive on the open market takes a good six months , Ellsworth says , noting that part of the healthcare supply issue seems to be a personality question :
People who are attracted to the medical field are not always driven to leadership .
Christiana executives decided to start building their own talent pool , beginning by hiring a vice president of systems learning to lead education and development efforts for the healthcare system 's 10,640 employees .
So how can workers make themselves known to HR executives and recruiters , whether they 're looking to change companies or get promoted ?
Phone a friend .
Gotkin says RSM McGladrey hires about one third of its employees from employee referrals .
Recruiters are also using online networking sites like LinkedIn .
Shine in your current job .
Attentive employers will take notice of people who demonstrate the capacity for leadership , Ellsworth says .
The workers whom Christiana is looking to attract are " action oriented ... transformational leaders , " he says .
Scientists at Oregon State University ’s Hatfield Marine Science Center have recorded more than 600 earthquakes in the last 10 days off the central Oregon coast in an area not typically known for a high degree of seismic activity .
This earthquake “ swarm ” is unique , according to OSU marine geologist Robert Dziak , because it is occurring within the middle of the Juan de Fuca plate – away from the major , regional tectonic boundaries .
“ In the 17 years we ’ve been monitoring the ocean through hydrophone recordings , we ’ve never seen a swarm of earthquakes in an area such as this , ” Dziak said .
“ We ’re not certain what it means .
But we hope to have a ship divert to the site and take some water samples that may help us learn more . ”
The water samples may indicate whether the process causing the earthquakes is tectonic or hydrothermal , he added .
At least three of the earthquakes have been of a magnitude of 5.0 or higher , Dziak said , which also is unusual .
On Monday ( April 7 ) , the largest event took place , which was a 5.4 quake .
Seismic activity has continued through the week and a 5.0 tremor hit on Thursday .
Numerous small quakes have continued in between the periodic larger events .
Few , if any , of these earthquakes would be felt on shore , Dziak said , because they originate offshore and deep within the ocean .
The earthquakes are located about 150 nautical miles southwest of Newport , Ore. , in a basin between two subsurface “ faulted ” geologic features rising out of the deep abyssal sediments .
The hill closest to the swarm location appears to be on a curved structure edging out in a northwestern direction from the Blanco Transform Fault toward the Juan de Fuca ridge , Dziak said .

Analysis of seismic “ decay ” rates , which look at the decreasing intensity of the tremors as they radiate outward , suggest that the earthquakes are not the usual sequence of a primary event followed by a series of aftershocks , Dziak said .
“ Some process going on down there is sustaining a high stress rate in the crust , ” he pointed out .
Dziak and his colleagues are monitoring the earthquakes through a system of hydrophones located on the ocean floor .
The network – called the Sound Surveillance System , or SOSUS – was used during the decades of the Cold War to monitor submarine activity in the northern Pacific Ocean .
As the Cold War ebbed , these and other unique military assets were offered to civilian researchers performing environmental studies , Dziak said .
Hatfield Marine Science Center researchers also have created their own portable hydrophones , which Dziak has deployed in Antarctica to listen for seismic activity in that region .
The sensitive hydrophones also have recorded a symphony of sounds revealing not only undersea earthquakes , but the movement of massive icebergs , and vocalizations of whales , penguins , elephant seals and other marine species .
This is n’t the first time the researchers have recorded earthquake swarms off the Oregon coast , Dziak said .
In 2005 , they recorded thousands of small quakes within a couple of weeks along the Juan de Fuca Ridge northwest of Astoria .
Those earthquakes were smaller , he pointed out , and located along the tectonic plate boundary .
This is the eighth such swarm over the past dozen years , Dziak said , and the first seven were likely because of volcanic activity on the Juan de Fuca ridge .
The plate does n't move in a continuous manner and some parts move faster than others .
Movement generally occurs when magma is injected into the ocean crust and pushes the plates apart .
“ When it does , these swarms occur and sometimes lava breaks through onto the seafloor , ” Dziak pointed out .
“ Usually , the plate moves at about the rate a fingernail might grow – say three centimeters a year .
But when these swarms take place , the movement may be more like a meter in a two - week period . "
But this eighth swarm may be different .
“ The fact that it ’s taking place in the middle of the plate , and not a boundary , is puzzling , ” Dziak admitted .
“ It ’s something worth keeping an eye on . ”
I have no doubt Sarah Lacy ( I ’m seeing it spelled Lacey , but L - a - c-y is how she spells it , so I assume that ’s correct ) is a very talented reporter , but as an on - stage interviewer , today she set the benchmark for remarkable badness .
And I say that as someone who has once or twice conducted a remarkably bad on - stage interview .
I also say it as someone in the audience who was sitting in awe as it was taking place .
I say it as someone who gets so uncomfortable when I see people doing badly on stage , that I often have to leave the room to avoid seeing them bomb .
I say it as someone who could n’t leave the room because what was taking place was so mesmerizing in its awesome badness .
It ’s not an easy job — as Sarah screamed at the audience today after finally realizing how bad the audience thought she was doing .
However , it ’s a job , and if you ’re going to do it , you should at least understand your role .
From my rough notes of her interview of Mark Zuckerberg at South by Southwest , you can see I sensed a train wreck was occurring about two questions into the now infamously bad session .
Unfortunately , the drama of the poor performance ( or , better said , the dramatically poor performance ) by the interviewer has drowned out anything of news value that may have been revealed by Zuckerberg .
As it is destined to become one of the most memorable horrible on - stage interviews , I thought I ’d chime in with what I think took place .
More importantly , I thought I ’d throw in a few thoughts — and recommendations for Sarah and other on - stage interviewers ( including me ) :
1 . I disagree with the suggestion by some that the audience turned on her because of her gender .
Despite her twirling of hair and flirtatious , giggling , silly manner , I do n’t believe that her imitation of an airhead ditz is what angered the audience .
2 . I disagree with some who have suggested that she did bad because she is not a geek .
The questions she asked Zuckerberg were not the problem .
Indeed , she probably asked some good questions .
I guess she did — but I ’m sure it was hard for him to understand the questions that were hidden somewhere in the OMG , I ’m so tight with you , speak .
3 . Sarah seemed to think her job was to break a story — to get Zuckerberg to say something he ’d not said before .
On Twitter , post - debacle , she claims she did get him to admit something or another .
4 . Her first mistake was to think anyone in the audience knew who she is .
5 . 24 hours earlier , Stephen Johnson , in a keynote in which he got co-billing — and deserves it as he ’s a best - selling author and tech entrepreneur — nevertheless played the role of interviewer in his conversation with Henry Jenkins .
In other words , everyone did care about what he might have to say , but he adroitly played the role of appreciative and curious interviewer .
And what resulted was a near perfect session .
6 . On - stage interviews are not where you try out the ambush , embarrassing or rude questioning techniques .
It ’s not where you bounce around from flirtatious first - date questions to Mike Wallace showing up at your front door questions .
7 . When you are conducting an interview on stage — just like on air with a microphone — you do n’t keep saying “ uh - huh ” and “ yeah ” all through the answers .
Close your mouth and let the interviewee finish an answer before making any sound that will be picked up by the microphone .
8 . I am writing this suggestion for myself as much as for today ’s interviewer or anyone else :
No one cares about how clever , witty or knowledgeable you are if that wit and knowledge drags a question out for over 20 seconds .
( I may be wrong with the length , but you get the idea . )
9 . Listen to the answers .
Listen .
Shut up .
Listen .
Then and only then can you ask the next question .
10 .
When you ’ve got thousands of smart people in the audience , shut up and let them ask the questions .
11 . If you bomb in front of 2,000 people and 1,500 of them have blogs and Twitter accounts , do n’t try to convince them that you did n’t bomb .
12 . Bombing in front of 2,000 people is , in the big scheme of things , nothing .
Embrace it .
Learn from it .
Be glad that people now know who you are and how to spell your name .

Nuclear Fueled Explosion Reported In US Midwest
By : Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers ( Traducción al Español abajo )
Reports from 3rd Army Headquarters of the Russian Space Command , located in Solnechnogorsk ( Moscow oblast ) , are reporting today that a ‘ nuclear fueled ’ explosion has occurred in the United States region of Illinois after the downing of an American B - 52 Bomber by , presumed , other elements of the US Air Force operating in that region .
So powerful was the explosion reported from this downed American Nuclear Bomber that Western propaganda media sources are reporting the effects of a 5.2 to 5.4 magnitude earthquake in that region , but to which the most accurate description of a nuclear type blast was reported by the Bloomberg News Service and who stated in their article : " You could hear a roaring sound and the whole motel shook , waking up the guests , '' Vibha Ambelal , manager of the Super 8 Motel in Mount Carmel , Illinois , near the epicenter , said in a telephone interview . "
These reports further state that this was the second attempt by a US B - 52 Nuclear Bomber to penetrate the North American Command Air Defenses surrounding the dissident United States Scott Air Force Base , located in Illinois , from which these aircraft seeking to bomb Iranian atomic facilities are based .
On Tuesday , April 15th , American citizens to the Indiana region immediately east of Illinois reported numerous ‘ booms ’ and ‘ flashes ’ in their night skies which some attributed to fireball meteorites crashing into the atmosphere , but which the United States Air Force reported was caused by F - 16 jet fighters ‘ sonic booms ’ and their use of ‘ military flares ’ .
These reports , however , state that this April 15th incident turned back the first abortive attempt by dissident American Forces to secret their plundered nuclear weapons out of that country for their intended use against Iran .
The ‘ trigger ’ to these latest desperate attempts to embroil the World in Total War arose from the US Defense Secretaries ordering of a full accounting of all American Nuclear Weapons on March 28th after the discovery of that an unspecified number of them were ‘ missing ’ .
The first attempt to use these ‘ missing ’ nuclear weapons against Iran we had previously reported on in our April 5th report titled " US Nuclear B - 1 Bomber On Iran ‘ Attack Run ’ Shot Down " and which occurred in the Middle Eastern Nation of Qatar .
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman further report that the American War Leaders were warned this past week by the British Prime Minister , Gordon Brown , and by Pope Benedict XVI , both of whom traveled to the United States this week , against the attempts by the US to escalate their conflicts into another World War , but which by these latest events these War Leaders appear not to have listened to .
As we have previously reported , the United States believes it has no option other than Total World War as their economy continues imploding while at the same time fuel prices are rising to catastrophic levels and more food riots are being reported the World over , all of which when combined signal the collapse of the American Empire on a scale not seen in since the collapse of the former Soviet Union on June 12 , 1990 .
It remains , without doubt , that the people living within the United States will not be allowed to know the full evidence of these events , and their imminent destruction , except by the means of dissident sources of information such as ours .
But , and most strangely , the New York Times , and a publication not known for the reporting of dissident news , appears to have changed its course with its April 6th article titled " Duck and Cover : It ’s the New Survivalism " , and which said :
" THE traditional face of survivalism is that of a shaggy loner in camouflage , holed up in a cabin in the wilderness and surrounded by cases of canned goods and ammunition .
It is not that of Barton M. Biggs , the former chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley .
Yet in Mr. Biggs ’s new book , “ Wealth , War and Wisdom , ” he says people should “ assume the possibility of a breakdown of the civilized infrastructure . ”
“ Your safe haven must be self - sufficient and capable of growing some kind of food , ” Mr. Biggs writes .
“ It should be well - stocked with seed , fertilizer , canned food , wine , medicine , clothes , etc. Think Swiss Family Robinson .
Even in America and Europe there could be moments of riot and rebellion when law and order temporarily completely breaks down . ”
Survivalism , it seems , is not just for survivalists anymore . "
This advice by the New York Times that the time has begun for Americans to begin their preparations for survival echo those of the giant US Banking concern Wells Fargo , that Britain ’s Guardian News Service has recently reported warned these people : " Scott Anderson , chief economist at Wells Fargo , is equally pessimistic , describing the bullish views of some market players as " bordering on delusional " , but which as their life savings continue to disappear they continue not to heed .
For the final outcome of these events we , perhaps , will have little warning , but , and surely anyone with open eyes can see , the storm clouds gathering on the horizon .

SE REPORTA EXPLOSION POR CAUSA NUCLEAR EN EL MEDIO -OESTE DE ESTADOS UNIDOS
Por : Sorcha Faal y como lo informa a sus suscriptores occidentales .
Informes procedentes del Cuartel General del Tercer Ejército del Comando Ruso Espacial , que se ubica en Solnechnogorsk ( región de Moscú ) señalan que el día de hoy ocurrió una explosión “ provocada Nuclearmente ” en la región del estado Estadounidense de Illinois , después de derribar a un bombardero B - 52 por , se presume , otros elementos de la Fuerza Aérea que operan en esa región .
Fue tan poderosa la explosión reportada de este bombardero nuclear derribado que las fuentes occidentales de propaganda están indicando los efectos de un terremoto con magnitud 5.2 a 5.4 pero que no es más que una descripción muy precisa de una explosión de tipo nuclear informada por el servicio noticioso Bloomberg : “ Se podía escuchar un sonido estrepitoso y casi todo el motel se sacudió , despertando a los huéspedes ” dijo Vibha Ambelal , Gerente del Motel Super 8 en Mount Carmel , Illinois , en una entrevista telefónica .
Estos informes detallan que este fue el segundo intento del bombardero nuclear Estadounidense B - 52 por penetrar las Defensas Aéreas del Comando de América del Norte que rodean a la disidente base Scott de la Fuerza Aérea Estadounidense , ubicada en Illinois , en la que tienen su base las aeronaves que están buscando bombardear las instalaciones atómicas Iraníes .
El martes 15 de abril , los ciudadanos Estadounidenses de la región de Indiana justo al este de Illinois , reportaron numerosos “ truenos ” y “ relámpagos ” en sus cielos nocturnos que algunos atribuyeron a meteoritos que se incendiaron al hacer contacto con la atmósfera , pero la Fuerza Aérea Estadounidense informó que fueron causados por “ truenos sónicos ” de aviones de combates F - 16 y el uso de sus “ señales luminosas militares ” .
Estos informes señalan que este incidente del 15 de abril rechazó el primer intento abortivo por parte de las Fuerzas Estadounidenses disidentes por ocultar sus armas nucleares saqueadas y transportarlas fuera del país con el fin de usarlas contra Irán .
El “ disparador ” de estos recientes y desesperados intentos para envolver al mundo en una Guerra Total surgió del Secretario de la Defensa de los Estados Unidos al ordenar un recuento total de todas las armas nucleares Estadounidenses el 28 de marzo después de que se descubrió que una cantidad no especificada de ellas estaba “ faltante ” .
El primer intento para utilizar estas armas nucleares “ faltantes ” en contra de Irán , lo reportamos en nuestro informe del 15 de abril titulado “ Derribado Bombardero Nuclear B - 1 Estadounidense en ‘ Corrida de Ataque ’ sobre Irán “ y que sucedió en el país de Qatar en el Medio Oriente .
El vocero del Ministerio Ruso del Exterior detalla que los líderes guerreros Estadounidenses fueron advertidos la semana pasada por el Primer Ministro Británico , Gordon Brown , y por el Papa Benedicto XVI , quienes viajaron a los Estados Unidos esta semana , contra los intentos por parte de los Estados Unidos para escalar sus conflictos hacia otra guerra mundial , pero todo parece indicar que esos jefes guerreros no han escuchado esos llamados .
Como ya lo habíamos referido , los Estados Unidos creen que no existe otra opción que la de la Guerra Total Mundial para que su economía continúe haciendo implosión mientras que al mismo tiempo los precios de los combustibles siguen elevándose a niveles catastróficos y suceden más disturbios por alimentos en varias partes del mundo , todo esto combinado señala el colapso del Imperio Americano en una escala no vista desde el colapso de la ex Unión Soviética el 12 de junio de 1990 .
Significa , sin duda alguna , que al pueblo que vive dentro del territorio de los Estados Unidos no le será permitido conocer la evidencia total de estos sucesos y su inminente destrucción , excepto por medio de las fuentes disidentes de información como la nuestra .
Pero , lo que más extrañeza ha causado es que el The New York Times , una publicación conocida no precisamente por difundir noticias disidentes , parece haber cambiado su curso con su artículo del 16 de abril , titulado “ Agáchate y Cúbrete : Es el Nuevo Supervivencialismo ” y que dice :
“ El tradicional rostro de un supervivencialista es un greñudo solitario en ropa de camuflaje , metido en una cabaña en despoblado y rodeado por cajas de alimentos enlatados y municiones .
" La cara tradicional del supervivencialista es la de un rudo greñudo solitario en ropa de camuflaje , metido en una cabaña en despoblado y rodeado de cajas de alimentos enlatados y municiones .
No es la del Barton M. Biggs , ex jefe estratega global de Morgan Stanely .
Aún así , en el nuevo libro del Sr. Bigg , " Riqueza , Guerra y Prudencia " dice que el pueblo debe " asumir la posibilidad de un colapso de la
infraestructura civilizada " .
" Su refugio seguro debe ser auto - suficiente y tener la capacidad de cultivar algún tipo de alimento " escribe el Sr. Briggs .
" Debe estar muy bien abastecido de semillas , fertilizante , alimento enlatado , vino , medicina ,
ropa , etc. - Como la Familia Robinson de Suiza .
Hasta en América y Europa podrían haber momentos de disturbios y rebelión cuando la ley y el orden , temporalmente , se colapsen por completo " .
Este aviso por parte del
The New York Times de que ha comenzado el tiempo para los Estadounidenses de comenzar sus preparativos para su supervivencia , hace eco a los del interés de la banca gigante Estadounidense , la Wells Fargo , que el servicio noticioso de la Gran Bretaña ha informado recientemente que advirtió a este pueblo : “ Scott Anderson , jefe economista de la Wells Fargo , está igualmente pesimista , describiendo las visiones intimidatorias de algunos jugadores del mercado como “ rayando en lo alucinante ” pero mientras los ahorros de toda su vida continúan desapareciendo y siguen sin escuchar ” .
Para el resultado final de esos sucesos nosotros , tal vez , no tengamos mucho que advertir , pero , y con toda seguridad cualquiera que tenga los ojos abiertos podrá ver , las nubes de tormenta que se están acumulando en el horizonte .

SEIU set to endorse Obama
Two labor sources tell Politico that the giant Service Employees International Union , which has been neutral through the primary , is on the verge of throwing its support to Sen. Barack Obama .
" It 's done , " said one person close to the union .
SEIU spokeswoman Stephanie Mueller confirmed that union leaders are set to discuss a potential endorsement today .
" Our board is going to be talking this evening , " she said .
" This will be a topic of their conversation . "
An endorsement will be particularly important in beefing up his organization in Texas , where the union has a major presence among Latinos .
( The Wisconsin SEIU has already endorsed Obama , and his Chicago allies are active there . )
Many SEIU leaders had backed Edwards before he dropped out , but giant New York - and Chicago - based locals blocked an endorsement .
Now , with Chicago pushing hard for Obama and joined by much of the rest of the union 's national organization , insiders said a tipping point appears to have been reached .
A formal endorsement would come after tonight 's call , when local organizations submit their written votes by email .
Jerry Morrison , a spokesman for the SEIU Illinois State Council , said he expected the union to make an announcement imminently , though he would not confirm an Obama endorsement .
" There ’ll be some information tomorrow morning at the latest , " he said .
Camp Hill Mayor Lou Thieblemont switched his lifelong Republican registration this week so he can vote for Democratic Sen. Barack Obama in Pennsylvania 's April 22 primary .
" I 'm sick and tired of the politics of fear in this country .
He 's the only one who does n't do that , " Thieblemont said of Obama .
" He 's the only candidate who 's said he'd talk to our enemies and try to get some common ground . "
A retired airline pilot , Thieblemont , 62 , said he does n't believe the Bush administration 's claims that the United States is safer now .
" We 're all alone in the world .
We have basically lost all our friends in the world with comments like ' bring it on . ' "
Florida Set To Approve Christianity - Promoting License Plate Posted by Pile ( 9083 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
Florida lawmakers may approve a new license that includes a cross and the words " I Believe . "
Even though Florida now has more than 100 specialized license tags , the Republican - controlled Legislature may soon add one more : a colorful license plate that features the words '' I Believe ' ' set among a resplendent sunrise and the image of a cross in front of stained - glass window .
Florida already has tags that feature manatees , the Challenger space shuttle , panthers , and football teams .
In 1999 , lawmakers approved a controversial '' Choose Life ' ' tag that was seen by some critics as promoting a religious anti-abortion message and was initially challenged in the courts .
Republicans now think it 's time to give something to motorists who care about their faith , not their favorite football team .
'' They may not be into the manatee , they may not be into Challenger , '' Bullard said .
`` That segment , which is a large segment of the population , can now get a tag that they like and can express their beliefs . ''
Sen .
Mike Fasano , a New Port Richey Republican who is sponsoring a measure that would create four different plates -- including the ' ' I Believe ' ' tag as well as a lighthouse tag and a ' ' In God We Trust ' ' plate -- said he saw no problem with letting motorists decide if they want to pay the extra $ 25 to buy a special tag .
'' That 's that the option of every driver who owns a vehicle , '' Fasano said .
`` They can decide if they want to have a license plate with a cross in front of a stained - glass window .
It 's not different from choosing a Choose Life license plate or a manatee license pate or a Florida State University or University of Florida license plate . ''
Howard Simon , executive director of the ACLU of Florida , said the possibility of a state - sanctioned tag with a cross should prompt to Florida lawmakers to rethink the whole '' crazy ' ' system of license plates .
' Maybe at this point the Legislature should begin rethinking whether a message on a state - manufactured plate , whether ` I support panthers ' or ' I 'm a Christian , ' might be better on a bumper sticker , '' Simon said .
Those who propose a specialty license tag in Florida must pay a $ 60,000 fee and conduct a survey that would show that people want to buy the tag .
The organization backing the ' ' I Believe ' ' license plate turned in a survey that state officials have questioned .
The bills now moving in the House and Senate , however , would require organizers to resubmit a new survey before the state will start selling the tags .
The extra money earned from the sale of the ' ' I Believe ' ' license plate would go to an Orlando based nonprofit called Faith in Teaching that says on its website that money from the plates would be used for grants to '' continue faith - based education for the youth of Florida . ''
The group did not return a call seeking comment .
Simon , however , questioned the idea of having the state collect money that could wind up in the hands of churches .
' ' I do n't think the state should be a collection agency , '' Simon said .

Can
I have equal rights ?
I want a plate that says " I do n't believe in fairy tales . "
Maybe it can have a picture of my " god , " the flying spaghetti monster I AM SURE YOU CAN GMADUCK

I live in Indiana and Indiana offers a license plate that reads :
In God We Trust .
This is a great license plate cause I took digital pictures of these hypocrites as they went speeding pass me on the highway at 20 mph over the speed limit .
Laws , what laws ?
Christians are assholes and you can prove it by watching them break the law on the highway and as they pull out in front of you , and give you the finger as they read your peace bumper sticker .
Worship Satan No Longer ?
Welcome Atheist !

Sam Stein at the Huffington Post has the quotes , the video and the headline : " Shocking McCain Quotes Unearthed " to suggest that he was skeptical of the idea , but the transcript of the interview , given in 2005 , is more equivocal :
Here :
MATTHEWS :
As a policy suggestion , is it something that we all want the world to know we`re eventually coming home and we might as well argue about when or ...
MCCAIN : Sure we`re going to come home .
But the fact is that the key to it is not when the troops come home .
It is when we stop reading -- today , Shuster just reported four brave young Marines were killed .
It is the casualties that creates the discontent amongst Americans .
We`ve been in Bosnia for , what , 10 , 12 , years , Kosovo for 10 years , South Korea for 50 years .
Americans aren`t upset about that .
But we have got to get the casualty rate down .
And that`s the transfer of well - trained and well - equipped Iraqis to handle the security situation .
Followed by this paragraph , parts of which are included in the YouTube video that the Huffington Post obtained from a Democrat :
MATTHEWS : Would you be happy -- we`ve been there to help get them democracy started .
But would you be happy with that being the home of a U.S. garrison , like Guantanamo or Germany all those years , where we have 50,000 troops permanently stationed in that country ?
MCCAIN : No .
I would hope that we could bring them all home .
I would hope that we would probably leave some military advisers , as we have in other countries , to help them with their training and equipment and that kind of stuff .
( CROSSTALK )
MATTHEWS : But you`ve heard the ideological argument to keep U.S. forces in the Middle East .
I`ve heard it from the hawks .
They say , keep United States military presence in the Middle East , like we have with the 7th Fleet in Asia .
We have the German -- the North Korean -- the South Korean component .
Do you think we could get along without it ?
MCCAIN : I not only think we could get along without it , but I think one of our big problems has been the fact that many Iraqis resent American military presence .
And I don`t pretend to know exactly Iraqi public opinion .
But as soon as we can reduce our visibility as much as possible , the better I think it is going to be .
One can question the wisdom of what McCain 's proposing , but the full context of the interview he gave in 2005 suggests that he modeled a long - term US commitment to Iraq on South Korea , albeit with a big difference : a major corps would not necessarily have to embed itself in the country .
Soldiers , euphamized as " military advisers , " would maintain a presence .
But McCain has never said that he favors keeping combat troops in Iraq for an indefinite period of time .
Major questions remain : what constitutes an appropriate level of casualties ?
How will the US know when Iraq is stable enough for us to begin withdrawing troops ?
What will McCain 's " military advisers " do ?
If Iraq erupts into chaos after troops leave , will the US retrench ?

Secret U.S. Plan for Military Future In Iraq
Seumas Milne – the Guardian .
Guardian News and Media Limited 2008
Document outlines powers but sets no time limit on troop presence
A confidential draft agreement covering the future of US forces in Iraq , passed to the Guardian , shows that provision is being made for an open - ended military presence in the country .
The draft strategic framework agreement between the US and Iraqi governments , dated March 7 and marked “ secret ” and “ sensitive ” , is intended to replace the existing UN mandate and authorizes the US to “ conduct military operations in Iraq and to detain individuals when necessary for imperative reasons of security ” without time limit .
The authorisation is described as “ temporary ” and the agreement says the US “ does not desire permanent bases or a permanent military presence in Iraq ” .
But the absence of a time limit or restrictions on the US and other coalition forces – including the British – in the country means it is likely to be strongly opposed in Iraq and the US .
Iraqi critics point out that the agreement contains no limits on numbers of US forces , the weapons they are able to deploy , their legal status or powers over Iraqi citizens , going far beyond long - term US security agreements with other countries .
The agreement is intended to govern the status of the US military and other members of the multinational force .
Following recent clashes between Iraqi troops and Moqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi army in Basra , and threats by the Iraqi government to ban his supporters from regional elections in the autumn , anti-occupation Sadrists and Sunni parties are expected to mount strong opposition in parliament to the agreement , which the US wants to see finalized by the end of July .
The UN mandate expires at the end of the year .
One well - placed Iraqi Sunni political source said yesterday : “ The feeling in Baghdad is that this agreement is going to be rejected in its current form , particularly after the events of the last couple of weeks .
The government is more or less happy with it as it is , but parliament is a different matter . ”
It is also likely to prove controversial in Washington , where it has been criticized by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , who has accused the administration of seeking to tie the hands of the next president by committing to Iraq ’s protection by US forces .
The defence secretary , Robert Gates , argued in February that the planned agreement would be similar to dozens of “ status of forces ” pacts the US has around the world and would not commit it to defend Iraq .
But Democratic Congress members , including Senator Edward Kennedy , a senior member of the armed services committee , have said it goes well beyond other such agreements and amounts to a treaty , which has to be ratified by the Senate under the constitution .
Administration officials have conceded that if the agreement were to include security guarantees to Iraq , it would have to go before Congress .
But the leaked draft only states that it is “ in the mutual interest of the United States and Iraq that Iraq maintain its sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence and that external threats to Iraq be deterred .
Accordingly , the US and Iraq are to consult immediately whenever the territorial integrity or political independence of Iraq is threatened . ”
Significantly – given the tension between the US and Iran , and the latter ’s close relations with the Iraqi administration ’s Shia parties – the draft agreement specifies that the “ US does not seek to use Iraq territory as a platform for offensive operations against other states ” .
General David Petraeus , US commander in Iraq , is to face questioning from all three presidential candidates on Capitol Hill today when he reports to the Senate on his surge strategy , which increased US forces in Iraq by about 30,000 last year .
Both Clinton and Democratic rival Barack Obama are committed to beginning troop withdrawals from Iraq .
Republican senator John McCain has pledged to maintain troop levels until the country is secure .

WASN ’T 2008 supposed to be the year of shareholder victory on the executive compensation front ?
After all , tighter disclosure rules kicked in last year , and — the theory went — once companies had to shine a spotlight on their compensation practices , they were bound to make them better .
Politicians , never loath to acknowledge the national mood — particularly in an election year — held several hearings about excessive pay .
But signs of sweeping change remain few .
Once again , many — perhaps most — companies filled their proxies with a blizzard of words and numbers that did more to obscure their processes than to illuminate them .
And most irksome of all , true links between pay and performance remained scarce .
Shareholders were mad about excessive compensation last year , when the economy was booming .
This year , governance experts say , they are livid .
“ They are furious about the dichotomy of experiences — their shares fall , yet C.E.O. pay still rises , ” said Paul Hodgson , a senior research associate at the Corporate Library , a governance research group .
The compensation research firm Equilar recently compiled data about chief executive pay at 200 companies that filed their proxies by March 28 and had revenues of at least $ 6.5 billion .
And the data illustrates Mr. Hodgson ’s point .
It shows that average compensation for chief executives who had held the job at least two years rose 5 percent in 2007 , to $ 11.2 million ( If new C.E.O. ’s are counted , that number is $ 11.7 million ) .
Even though performance - based bonuses were down last year , the value and prevalence of discretionary bonuses — ones not linked to performance — were up .
A result is that C.E.O. ’s who have held their jobs for two years received an average total bonus payout of $ 2.8 million , up 1.1 percent from 2006 .
For those who remember , he was the young boy who gets the girl in the film Love Actually .
For those who do n't , Thomas Sangster may yet become a household name .
The sixth - former from south London , the Guardian can reveal , has been chosen by Steven Spielberg to be his Tintin for a three - movie adaptation of the boy reporter 's adventures .
The trilogy is likely to give the 17 - year - old the same profile as Daniel Radcliffe , aka Harry Potter , or Elijah Wood , who shot to international stardom as Frodo Baggins in the Lord of the Rings series .
More than 200 m copies of Hergé's Tintin books have been sold around the world ; fans tend to be devoted , if not obsessed by the character , his faithful dog Snowy and his perpetually frustrated friend Captain Haddock , an endearing drunk .
Spielberg has been working with Peter Jackson , director of The Lord of the Rings and King Kong , on how to bring Tintin to life .
Now the production has taken another significant step with the casting of Sangster , alongside Andy Serkis , who played Gollum in the adaptation of Tolkien 's books , as Captain Haddock .
Both actors spent a week in Los Angeles before Easter running through scenes for Spielberg and Jackson ; work begins in earnest in September , with a view to releasing the first film in 2010 .
Sangster admitted to the Guardian that he had not read Tintin until a few days ago .
" But I 've always loved the cartoons .
I never saw the books because I was never that big on reading .
When I was really young I watched some episodes and loved it .
" You can really escape into this fantasy world ... I love cars and aeroplanes and stuff , any car or any aeroplane or any gun that was ever used in Tintin would always be real , an exact copy of it so if it was a car it would be a Citroen and if it was a gun it would be a Luger .
" Tintin is like a super boy scout .
He knows how to fly these things .
He knows how to drive these things .
It 's just like common sense : he jumps in and goes , he does n't need to think about any safety , he just goes where he pleases .
For such a small kid he 's very good at beating people up and , being a cartoon , nowadays you know , there 's all that ' we can't be violent ' .
" Tintin would hit people over the head with bottles and shoot people .
He probably would n't kill them but he'd shoot them in the shoulder .
He was cool . "
Many people will recognise Sangster as Liam Neeson 's son in Richard Curtis 's Love Actually or the oldest child in the care of Emma Thompson 's Nanny McPhee , but his CV includes roles of varying sizes in 13 films .
He is also the voice of Ferb in the Disney Channel 's cartoon series Phineas and Ferb and has been on TV in programmes including Doctor Who and Stig of the Dump .
A child of theatrical parents - his dad Mark is currently starring as the mad hyena in The Lion King - Sangster is soon to undertake A - levels in art and media studies .
He works part - time at a local garage when he's not at school or , as he is at the moment , rehearsing for the latest Jane Campion movie .
Sangster 's agent originally sent a tape to Spielberg as part of an audition for a mini-series of Stephen King 's The Talisman , which never got off the ground .
Spielberg saw the tape and realised he had found his Tintin .
All the regular characters are expected to be in the new movies , including the oafish detectives Thomson and Thompson and the virtually deaf Professor Cuthbert Calculus .
But it is not yet known which of the 23 Tintin stories will be filmed .
And while Spielberg will direct one and Jackson one , it is still not known who will direct the third .
They will be filmed back to back in the US and New Zealand , using the latest 3D technology , which is regarded within the industry as the next frontier of moviemaking .
Spielberg said recently : " We want Tintin 's adventures to have the reality of a live action film and yet Peter and I felt that shooting them in a traditional live action format would simply not honour the distinctive look of the characters and world that Hergé created .
" The idea is that the films will look neither like cartoons nor like computer - generated animation .
We 're making them look photo - realistic , the fibres of their clothing , the pores of their skin and each individual hair .
They look exactly like real people - but real Hergé people . "
Tintin has become a worldwide industry , controlled by the Hergé Foundation , with limited edition vinyl toys proving particularly lucrative .
The TV animated series of Tintin produced in the early 1990s has proved the most popular screen version of Tintin , while a stage version by British director Rufus Norris at the Barbican in 2005 transferred to the West Wnd and toured .
Hergé , who died in 1983 , was briefly the subject of a race row last year when the Commission for Racial Equality said Tintin in the Congo , written in 1930 , should not be sold in Britain .
Hergé admitted during his lifetime that the Congo book and Tintin in the Land of the Soviets , both with unsubtle racial stereotyping , were " youthful sins " .
As you might already know , the Ruby interpreter you ’re ( probably ) using ( the one at ruby - lang.org ) know as MRI , for Matz Ruby Interpreter , is written in C .
The VM is entirely written in C and most of the standard libraries too .
So it seems that the way to make code run faster is really to dive into C .
Now I hear you yell with your ears all red , eyes full of blood and a big vein pumping on your forehead :
But it will be unmaintainable !
If everything seems under control , you ’re not going fast enough
– Mario Andretti
The hard part is that the C API of MRI lacks documentation .
You either have to search through the mailinglist , look at other people ’s code or try to guess from Ruby ’s code .
I recently ported a bit of code from Ruby to C and here are a couple of Ruby to C mapping that might help you .
If you ’ve never written or looked at a Ruby extension before , I suggestion reading Peter Cooper excellent and very simple tutorial on how to set things up .
Objects are VALUEs
my_var = nil this_is_true = true some_fixnum = 1 VALUE my_var = Qnil ; VALUE this_is_true = Qtrue ; VALUE some_fixnum = INT2FIX ( 1 ) ;
Strings
string = " hi " VALUE string = rb_str_new2 ( " hi " ) ; /*
Ruby string to C string */ char *s = RSTRING_PTR ( str ) ; int len = RSTRING_LEN ( str ) ;
Object to C struct
In C you ’ll probably want to store your data in a struct .
Ruby provide some things to wrap a struct inside a Ruby object .
Also , since Ruby is not aware of the stuff created in the C world we have to be pretty explicit about everything .
module MyModule class MyClass def close @ closed = true end end end In C /*
This is called by Ruby GC when the object is freed * so free all resources used here .
We hook it up * in the Data_Wrap_Struct call down there .
*/ void my_obj_free(my_struct_t *s ) { free ( s ) ; } /* Called by Ruby then and instance of your class is created * hooked by rb_define_alloc_func .
*/ VALUE my_obj_all oc ( VALUE klass ) { my_struct_t *s = ALLOC_N ( my_struct_t , 1 ) ; /*
This stores the struct inside the Ruby object , so you * can get the struct back on each method call .
*/ return Data_Wrap_Struct ( klass , NULL , my_obj_free , s ) ; } /*
The actual MyClass #close method , first argument is the * instance object .
It 's hook into our class by the rb_define_method * call in Init_ */ VALUE my_obj_clo se ( VALUE self ) { my_struct_t *s ; /*
This is where we get the struct back from the Ruby object */ Data_Get_Struct ( self , my_struct_t , s ) ; s-> closed = 1 ; } /* Init_ * is magically called by Ruby to bootstrap your extension , * it 's like a main function if you will .
*/ void Init_name_of_your_extension ( ) { VALUE mMyModule = rb_define_module ( " MyModule " ) ; VALUE cMyClass = rb_define_class_under( mMyModule , " MyClass " , rb_cObject ) ; rb_define_alloc_func(cMyClass , my_obj_alloc ) ; rb_define_method( cMyClass , " close " , my_obj_close , 0 ) ; } Calling methods
obj. method_name result = begin obj. method_name ( arg ) rescue # … end rb_funcall ( obj , rb_intern ( " method_name " ) , 0 ) ; /* if an error is raised , result will be set to Qundef */ VALUE result = rb_funcall_rescue ( obj , rb_intern ( " method_name " ) , 1 , arg ) ;
Blocks
my_ary .
each do | i | puts i end VALUE i_ea ch ( VALUE elem , VALUE * obj ) { /* elem is the yielded object and obj is a pointer to obj down there v */ printf ( " %d
" , FIX2INT ( elem ) ) ; return Qnil ; } rb_iterate ( rb_each , my_ary , i_each , ( VALUE ) obj ) ;
Error handling
raise ArgumentError , " ... " rb_raise ( rb_eArgError , " ... " ) ; /*
To raise an error corresponding to the one in errno */ rb_sys_fail ( " oops " ) ;
Garbage Collection
When creating Ruby objects in the C world , Ruby is not aware of the scope of each , it ’s impossible to track when a variable is used and when it ’s not , so it ’s impossible for the garbage collector to know when do leave or sweep objects .
If you create a long live object , that will persist for several method calls you have to tell Ruby ’s garbage collector when it ’s in use and when you ’re finished with it .
If you do n’t , Ruby GC will free your variable in the worst possible time , ending up with unthinkable tragedies around the world , leaving you homeless and poor for all eternity .
Research funded by the Wellcome Trust suggests that many children diagnosed with severe language disorders in the 1980s and 1990s would today be diagnosed as having autism .
The research supports the theory that the rise in the number of cases of autism may be related to changes in how it is diagnosed .
Professor Dorothy Bishop , a Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellow at the University of Oxford , led a study which revisited 38 adults , aged between 15 - 31 , who had been diagnosed with having developmental language disorders as children rather than being autistic .
Professor Bishop and colleagues looked at whether they now met current diagnostic criteria for autistic spectrum disorders , either through reports of their childhood behaviour or on the basis of their current behaviour .
The results are published this month in the journal Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology ( 1 ) .
Developmental language disorders , which include specific language impairment , are diagnosed when a child has unusual difficulty in his or her grasp of the spoken language , despite normal development in other areas .
This may range from a child who has very limited ability to produce or understand spoken sentences , to one who does speak in long and complex utterances , but nevertheless has problem communicating effectively because of problems in conveying a point or grasping what others mean .
Autistic spectrum disorders , which include autism and Asperger syndrome , are developmental disorders affecting how a person communicates with and relates to other people and how they make sense of the world around them .
Participants in the study were drawn from a pool of children who had participated in a series of studies of developmental language disorder conducted during the period 1986 to 2003 and about whose conditions detailed information was known .
All attended special schools or classes for children with language impairments , and would have been diagnosed by educational psychologists , paediatricians or speech therapists as having developmental language disorders and none had previously been diagnosed as autistic .
However , when reassessed by Professor Bishop and colleagues using current criteria , around a quarter were identified as having autistic spectrum disorder .
In recent years , the criteria for diagnosing developmental language disorders and autism have changed .
This has coincided with a marked rise in the rates of diagnosis of autism .
According to the Special Needs and Autism Project ( 2 ) , the figure until the 1990s was widely accepted as being about 5 people per 10,000 ; even using the narrowest definition of autism , this rose to almost 40 in 10,000 by 2006
There are two main hypotheses to explain this rise : the " autism epidemic " hypothesis and the " diagnostic substitution " hypothesis .
Whilst the former says that the rise is genuine , the latter maintains that the true prevalence of the disorder is constant but that changes in diagnostic criteria mean that more children are being diagnosed as autistic .
The latter theory is supported by a UK study ( 3 ) using the General Practice Research Database , which found that the rise in autism was mirrored by a decline in frequency of language disorders , and now by Professor Bishop 's study .
" Our study shows pretty direct evidence to support the theory that changes in diagnosis may contribute towards the rise in autism , " says Professor Bishop .
" These were children that people were saying were not autistic in the 1980s , but when we talk to their parents now about what they were like as children , it 's clear that they would be classified as autistic now .
" Criteria for diagnosing autism were much more stringent in the 1980s than nowadays and a child would n't be classed as autistic unless he or she was very severe .
Now , children are being identified who have more subtle characteristics and who could in the past easily have been missed . "
However , Professor Bishop cautions against using the results to suggest that the prevalence of autism is not genuinely rising .
" We can't say that genuine cases of autism are not on the increase as the numbers in our study are very small , " she says .
" However , this is the only study to date where direct evidence has been found of people who would have had a different diagnosis today than they were given fifteen or twenty years ago . "

A different path to genius
To be a gifted scientist or artist , a touch of autism may help .
Traditionally , people with autism were deemed to have low intelligence , significant learning disabilities , and a rigid insistence on sameness .
Yet many original thinkers and driving forces in our culture , including Isaac Newton , Lewis Carroll , Einstein , Marie Curie , Mozart , Picasso , van Gogh and US President Thomas Jefferson are suspected of having symptoms of Asperger 's syndrome , the high functioning end of autism spectrum disorder .
More recently , people have speculated about whether high achievers like Bill Gates and many of NASA 's workforce have Asperger 's syndrome .
Some public figures are even outing themselves as living with Asperger 's , like the author Helen Darville / Demidenko / Dale .
So how is it that a disorder that includes problems with social interaction , communication and emotional interpretation result in such groundbreaking achievements ?
^ to top
Seeing things differently
For years , autistic people with astonishing artistic , mathematical or technical ability but limited abilities in other areas were referred to as ' idiot savants ' , though the prefix has now been dropped .
Around 10 per cent of people with autism show remarkable skills where an early inclination ( towards music , numbers or some other interest ) is honed to an exceptional edge by years of dedication .
Nobel prize - calibre geniuses often have certain core autistic features at their heart , says Professor Allan Snyder , director of Sydney University 's Centre for the Mind .
These features include preoccupation with detail , obsessive interests and difficulties in understanding another person 's perspective .
" The normal mind is good at recognising the gist of something , but poor at recalling the details , " says Snyder .
" We tend to see the world through the filter of what we know - we see a whole , rather than the parts .
This is a real bottleneck to creativity because we can't look at the world afresh . "
By contrast , living with autism is like being in an unfamiliar country .
" The autistic mind is literal and tends to see the parts rather than the whole , that is to see the elements without meaning , intuition or automatic judgement , " he says .
People with autism spectrum disorders lack the ability to synthesise pieces of information because of an impairment in the process of concept formation .
However , they do see the parts denied to normal conscious awareness .
They then build up a logical pattern based on these parts .
Professor Snyder explains that when a person without ASD sees a radical new sports car model , even though it is quite different to the station wagon in the driveway , they intuitively recognise what they are seeing is a car .
But someone with ASD sees the parts : wheels , doors , seats , windscreen , position of the engine etc and then has to mentally assemble those components to form what we know as a car . "
" The [ non-autistic ] mind can make unexpected connections between seemingly disparate systems and can invent entirely new systems based on those connections , " Snyder continues , " rather than finding novelty within an existing system . "
What is autism spectrum disorder ?
ASD covers a huge panorama of issues from the relatively mild Asperger 's syndrome to people with a severe disability .
Approximately 1 in 160 live births in Australia have ASD , which is four times more likely to affect boys than girls .
Severe autism is characterised by intellectual impairment and the inability to speak or communicate at all .
At the other end of the spectrum , those with Asperger 's syndrome have the normal range of intellectual capacity but their condition impairs their ability to socialise and communicate with others , both verbally and non-verbally , and gives them an all - absorbing interest in specific topics .
There may be a genetic basis for the condition , with generations of some families having a history of similar symptoms , or a specific chromosomal abnormality such as Fragile X syndrome .
Research also indicates that exposure to pesticides during pregnancy may also be a factor .

Challenging creativitiy
The fact that genius can fall within the autistic spectrum challenges our deepest notions of creativity .
" Are there two different routes to creativity - normal and autistic ? " asks Snyder .
The unique way someone with Asperger 's syndrome sees the world means that even though they may be able to perform a task with savant - like abilities , such as play a complex piece of music after hearing it once , they are not necessarily creative .
UK - based autism expert Simon Baron - Cohen argues this is because creativity is strongly linked with imagination , which he says is very limited in people with autism and Asperger 's syndrome .
Baron - Cohen 's work used standardised tests to show that children with ASD respond less creatively than control groups when asked to imagine what certain shapes might represent .
Instead of imagining what the shapes could be , they produced responses that were ' real ' inanimate things that the shapes closely resembled .
This means someone with autistic spectrum disorder may not necessarily discover a new mathematical theorem , or render a revealing interpretation of a piece of music .
And just like the rest of the population , not all people with Asperger 's syndrome are geniuses .
Those that do have exceptional abilities tend to become high achievers through hard work and determination .

Perseverance pays off
A combination of their ability to focus on details , recognise patterns others do not and an inability to see the big picture ( as recognised by those with a normal mind ) means people with ASD can often come up with solutions to problems others overlook .
In the right work context this approach can lead to great discoveries , especially when combined with dedication to the task , unswayed by others ' opinions , and a desire to log long lonely hours in the lab or in front of a computer .
According to psychologist and autism specialist Dr Tony Attwood , from Griffith University , people with Asperger 's are solitary by preference , and their total dedication to solving a problem means they can pursue it when others would have given up , distracted by the need to socialise .
" They usually have a strong desire to seek knowledge , truth and perfection with a different set of priorities than would be expected with other people , " he says .
" They also perceive situations and sensory experiences differently , and their overriding priority may be to solve a problem rather than satisfy the social or emotional needs of others . "
He says the other key to understanding the difference between an autistic mind and a normal one is that someone not affected by autism thinks in terms of language and conversation because that is the dominant part of the brain .
But a person with autism uses other parts of their brain that have grown to equal or overshadow the communications area , causing a fundamental difference in how information is processed .
" They may see numbers as shapes , " he explains .
" It 's widely known that Einstein 's theory of relativity , for example , was based on visualisation .
He thought , visualised , analysed , then formed a novel solution . "

The brilliant ones
We will never really know if Newton , Einstein , Mozart or van Gogh had Asperger 's syndrome but it would be " interesting to analyse the profiles of past Nobel prize winners , " says Attwood .
There has n't been a lot of research into the personalities of intellectually gifted scientists and artists , but the few studies that have been done show they are often intense , restless , strong - willed , and sensitive to light and sound - all qualities of Asperger 's syndrome .
In addition , they often question the status quo , resist direction , have long attention spans , and undergo periods of intense work and effort .
As children , they like to organise things , and are often perceived by others as being a bit ' different ' .
Hans Asperger , the German doctor who discovered the eponymous syndrome believed that " for success in science or art , a dash of autism is essential .
The essential ingredient may be an ability to turn away from the everyday world , from the simply practical and to rethink a subject with originality so as to create in new untrodden ways with all abilities canalised into the one specialty . "
And indeed , Michael Fitzgerald , professor of psychiatry at Dublin 's Trinity College , argues that many leading figures in the fields of science , politics and the arts have achieved success because they had autistic spectrum disorder , believing that there is a relationship ( genetic or otherwise ) between autism and genius .
It seems there are many different paths to genius .

Five of the de-miners were killed on Sunday in Jowzjan province , which the BBC's Alastair Leithead in Kabul says is normally peaceful .
Two more employees were killed on Monday in Kunduz province .
Burning oil
The attack on the fuel tankers took place at about 2000 local time on Sunday .
Local officials said two explosions were heard in an area where more than 100 fuel lorries had been parked for the night , waiting to cross the border and deliver fuel to US forces in Afghanistan .
As drivers tried to evacuate the area and escape the flames one truck carrying oil exploded and crowds were showered with burning oil .
Local officials said more than 70 had been injured and were taken to hospitals on both sides of the border .
Locals said 50 shops were also destroyed .
Our correspondent says there have been a number of incidents like this in the past few weeks , all thought to have been sabotage and blamed on insurgents as they were attacking vehicles connected with international forces in Afghanistan .
' Hundreds of bullets '
In the incident in Jowzjan province , a group of mine clearance workers were attacked by four men on two motorbikes in the district of Fayzabad while on their way back to their base camp in the district of Oqacah .
Five de-miners were killed and seven others travelling in the truck which was attacked were badly injured .
Farib Elmi , the Deputy Director of the Afghan Technical Consultants group , who they worked for , said hundreds of bullets were fired from AK47's and heavy machine guns in the ambush which lasted some minutes .
" The area is safe according to our information and there have been no incidents like this before .
This is the first case we have seen , " Mr Elmi said .
He said he did not know who might have been responsible .
This part of Afghanistan is thought to be an area where the Taleban have little influence .
Farid Homayoun of the Halo Trust , the biggest de-mining group in Afghanistan , condemned the attack and appealed to all parties to respect de-miners who he said were " very neutral across political and ethnic groups " .
" Killing innocent de-miners is not going to achieve anything and is working against the quarter of the population that are affected by land mines , " Mr Homayoun said .
On Monday , gunmen in Kunduz province opened fire on a car carrying employees of Mine Detection and Dog Centre , the NGO said .
One of the de-miners and the driver were killed .
A Taleban spokesman ( Zabihollah Mojahed ) condemned the killings : he said the Taleban never attacked mine clearance workers .
The US economy , a $ 15 trillion giant which makes up 25 % of the world economy , is in trouble , and could drag down world growth .
The US central bank has cut interest rates aggressively and the US Congress is planning an economic stimulus package to prevent a recession .
ECONOMIC GROWTH
In the past few years the US economy has been growing strongly .
But recent troubles in the housing and credit markets have hit the economy hard , with growth slowing sharply at the end of 2007 .
Economic forecasts suggest that the US growth in 2008 could be cut by half to about 1.5 % .
INFLATION
The US economy is also facing significant inflationary pressures because of record oil prices which have pushed up the price of petrol and heating oil .
While the Fed does not have an explicit inflation target , inflation above 2 % is normally enough to set off the danger signals .
However , core inflation has been more contained , and asset prices like housing and stocks have been falling .
UNEMPLOYMENT
So far the economic slowdown has not led to a big rise in unemployment , but job growth has slowed to a crawl .
Firms often wait until they have a clearer picture of the economy before laying off workers .
But unemployment is higher than it was at the end of the last boom in the l990s .
FED RATE CUTS
The US central bank , the Federal Reserve , has aggressively cut rates in 2008 to ward off a recession .
And it has said that it could make further " timely " interventions as there are still " downside risks " to growth .
But some analysts worry that if the Fed continues to cut rates , it could lead to another asset bubble in the future .
BUDGET DEFICIT
The Bush administration and the US Congress have moved quickly to agree a $ 150 bn temporary stimulus package to help boost economic growth .
The large US budget deficit limits their room for manoeuvre .
The package will double the size of the US deficit which was slowly improving .
In the longer term , costs will rise as more people claim social security and Medicare payments as the Baby Boomer generation reaches retirement .
FALLING DOLLAR
Another problem for the US economy has been the fall in the value of the dollar , which has dropped sharply against the euro , the currency used by the major EU economies .
The huge US trade deficit , and lower US interest rates , have made the dollar less attractive to investors .
The weaker dollar will hurt countries which depend on exports to the US , because their goods will become more expensive , and could boost US inflation .

What are these ?
and was shopping in the grocery section of the local Wal - Mart a couple of days after I ’d moved in , when a woman came up to me and asked me whether I was a Reds fan ( I was wearing a Cubs cap – yes , I ’m the longsuffering sort , I suppose – and the designs of the C’s for the Cubs and Reds are clearly different , but she was looking for any opening to strike up a conversation , as you ’ll soon note ) .
I said no , and that I had recently moved from Illinois .
We introduced ourselves to each other ( her name is Sondra ) , and then she asked me whether I ’d be interested in making some extra money either full or part - time .
When I heard that , an alarm bell went off in my head ( thanks in part to the horror stories I ’ve read here ) , but I thought there was no harm in hearing her sales pitch later on , so we exchanged phone numbers and went our separate ways .
The following evening , she called me to sell me on Primerica .
I did n’t want to commit to anything – even though she would have preferred that I do so – so I told her I would think about her offer to come to an initial meeting at the local PFS office the following Tuesday , then hung up .
I then went into ‘ snoop mode ’ via Google , and had my worst suspicions confirmed .
PFS is an MLM that has , like other MLM ’s , left a trail of tears in its wake .
PFS tells you that via their simple interest plan , you ’ll pay off your mortgage and other debts earlier , and pay less along the way .
What they do n’t tell you is that you will actually end up paying just as much , if not more , through their plan , and that if your financial situation ever changes and you want to restructure your plan ( or if you ever miss a payment to PFS ) , you ’re screwed , as your payments then go way up .
In short , PFS gets their hooks into a lot of low - income people who have made poor financial decisions and are looking for a way out .
After finding all of this out , I called Sondra back and got voice mail – my message was ‘ Thanks , but no thanks . ’
She was good enough not to call back to try to pressure me any further .
I ’ve been very busy the past few months , so maybe I ’ve missed the PFS horror stories on this forum .
Maybe some of you have Primerica stories to share .
In any event , I ’m glad that this forum exists , as it ’s helped me to hone my BS radar . …

How to listen to Today Lord Hailsham 's diaries reveal a previously unknown plot to kidnap the Prime Minister , Sir Alec Douglas - Home .
14 April 2008
A plot by left - wing students to kidnap Prime Minister Alec Douglas - Home has been revealed for the first time in the coded diaries of former Lord Chancellor , Lord Hailsham .
The unpublished papers , some written in a cryptic shorthand cracked by off - duty cryptanalysts at GCHQ , were given to the University of Cambridge ’s Churchill Archives Centre .
Perhaps the most astonishing revelation in his diaries is of a massive security breach in April 1964 which nearly resulted in the kidnap of Prime Minister Alec Douglas - Home .
Unguarded overnight at Potterton House , Home found himself alone with the kidnappers but coolly talked them into abandoning the plot .
Characteristically , he agreed to suppress the story to save the career of his bodyguard and it remained unpublished to this point .
The source is Home himself .
Hailsham ’s diary entry for January 9 , 1977 , notes how Home related the tale to he and other members of a shooting party at Birkhill , a country house near Cupar in Fife .
Lord Hailsham 's diary entry
It reads :
“ An odd story of the 1964 election never published .
Alec ( then Prime Minister ) was staying with John and Priscilla Tweedsmuir - who had no room for Alec ’s private bodyguard .
He went to the nearest town ( Aberdeen ? ) and John & Priscilla left Alec for a time alone in the house .
Knock at the door .
Door answered by PM in person .
Deputation of left - wing students from Aberdeen University .
Said they were going to kidnap Alec .
He : “ I suppose you realise if you do the Conservatives will win the election by 200 or 300 . ”
He asked and received permission to pack a few things & was given 10 mins grace .
After that they were offered and accepted beer .
John & Priscilla returned and the kidnap project abandoned .
The bodyguard swore Alec to secrecy as his job would have been in peril . ”

WASHINGTON 
The Bush administration violated federal law last year when it restricted states ’ ability to provide health insurance to children of middle - income families , and its new policy is therefore unenforceable , lawyers from the Government Accountability Office said Friday .
The ruling strengthens the hand of at least 22 states , including New York and New Jersey , that already provide such coverage or want to do so .
And it significantly reduces the chance that the new policy can be put into effect before President Bush leaves office in nine months .
At issue is the future of the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program , financed jointly by the federal government and the states .
Congress last year twice passed bills to expand the popular program , and Mr. Bush vetoed both .
State officials of both parties say the policy , set forth in a letter to state health officials on Aug. 17 , has stymied their efforts to cover more children at a time when the number of uninsured is rising and more families are experiencing economic hardship .

There comes a point in time where we want to improve our website ’s interface or provide a captivating experience that our users will remember .
We have three main options ( from hardest to easiest ) : write the scripts ourselves , use a JavaScript framework such as jQuery or mootools ( which will make coding easier ) , use a pre-made script that works with existing JavaScript frameworks or that the author has developed from scratch .
This article ’s for the individuals who chooses to make things a bit easier and those who do n’t want to re-invent the wheel .
Here ’s a collection of 10 powerful –yet easy - to - implement — JavaScript effects to supplement your web page ’s interface .
These were picked using a “ bang for your buck ” methodology ; meaning that these effects were chosen specifically because they provide high - impact effects with very little effort in installing and using them .
Author ’s note :
Title of this article , by request , was changed to reflect the content featured in this list .
I apologize for the confusion this may have caused , and better quality control will be implemented in subsequent articles .
1 ) GreyBox
GreyBox allows you to launch other websites in a modal window ( like a pop - up window , but it does n’t open another browser ) .
This is great for when you ’re linking to multiple websites and do n’t want the user to navigate away from your web page or to open another browser window that might be blocked by the user ’s browser .
Using GreyBox is easy and involves a 3 - step process outlined in the web page .
Here ’s some key pages regarding GreyBox : Download page , Documentation , Examples , Installation , and Advanced Usage ( for the more experienced JavaScript ’ers , check this page out for tips on how you can extend the library ’s functionality ) .
instant.js effect dynamically adds a Polaroid - like effect to your images ( it tilts it and adds a border with a drop shadow ) , simulating this popular image technique without having to use a digital - image editing application such as Photoshop .
This can be utilized for when you ’re applying this popular visual technique on multiple images and you do n’t want to manually edit the pictures yourself ( you can probably batch process , but that ’s really only effective for simple actions such as resizing images , cropping uniformly , etc. ) .
3 ) mooTable
mooTable allows you the ability to provide sorting of table data ( without a page refresh ) by utilizing the DOM instead of requesting the data again , sorted another way .
Implementation is simple , and configuring the sorting of tables is a breeze .
This library needs the mootools framework , which you can download here .
You can also find a forum post on the mootools boards by the author of mooTable , with feedback from other mootools developers .
4 ) FancyForm
FancyFormreplaces boring form controls such as radio buttons and check boxes , with fancier ones .
The basic implementation is a two - step process : ( 1 ) include JavaScript files on the web page , and ( 2 ) assign your form controls the class = " checked " or class =" unchecked " for checkboxes and class = " selected " and class =" unselected " for radio buttons .
Very unobtrusive JavaScript .
This script needs mootools as well ( and was developed for version 1.1 ) .
5 ) image menu
image menu , developed by phatfusion , is a spiffy horizontal menu that expands when you hover over menu items ( such as images ) .
You can use this for displaying a montage of images that are each partly hidden , but that the user can reveal fully by hovering over it .
This script needs mootools as well ( and was developed for version 1.1 )
6 ) AmberJack : Site Tour Creator
Here ’s a lightweight JavaScript library that allows you to create a scripted website tour , allowing users to visit key web pages in real - time with a small description box on each page .
This allows users to take a tour of the various sections of a website , without them having to view a static demo created in flash or some other method .
Extra bonus , you can download various “ skins ” or even create your own , to match the look and feel of your website .
Here ’s the skins gallery so you may see if they have a theme that does n’t clash with your website .
7 ) ImageFlow
Inspired by iPod ’s “ coverflow ” , ImageFlow is a simple effect that displays a collection of images that the user can scroll there using a scroll bar at the bottom of the image set .
Advanced developers can probably modify the slider to spruce it up a bit more .
When the user clicks on an image , it re-directs them to another web page with the image displayed , so an excellent idea would be to use this in conjunction with a modal box script to open the image instead .
Update : Just now , the author of ImageFlow emailed me announcing ImageFlow version 0.9 .
Check it out here ( it fixes the issue of the image opening another browser window when clicked , and it works with Lightbox compatibility ) .
Thanks for the update Finn !
8 ) ShadowBox.js Media viewer
ShadowBox is “ a cross - browser , cross-platform , cleanly - coded and fully - documented media viewer application written entirely in JavaScript ” ( wow that ’s a mouthful , is n’t it ? ) .
What distinguishes shadowbox from the plethora of other modal boxes out there like Lightbox 2 , is that it supports other file types besides images , such as a flash videos , embedded youtube videos , Apple.com Trailers , and web pages ( a log - in page for example , that saves the user a trip to another page just to log on ) .
Worthwhile script to test and play around with .
9 ) TJPzoom 3 – image magnifier
TJPzoom allows you to zoom in on particular sections of a high - resolution image .
Holding down the mouse button and dragging up or down , can decrease or increase the zooming of the image magnifier tool .
One way of utilizing TJPzoom is to scale high - resolution pictures down to fit a web page , and then allow the users to zoom into parts of the image using the magnifier tool .
10 ) mootools Tips
mootools
Tips is part of the mootools framework that allows you to provide a highly configurable way of showing tool tips to the user ; when the user hovers over a link or image , additional information about the element appears on the screen .
Some options that you can tweak are the : CSS styles ( to make it look different from the default black background and white text ) , transition speed , style of how the tool tip appears on - screen , and how long you want the tool tip be displayed .
This requires the mootools framework .
From Philadelphia to Pittsburgh , Democrats voiced surprise and then anger over comments that Senator Hillary Clinton made at a private fund raiser that were caught on tape .
Surprise because the media has largely blacked out coverage of the comments ; anger because of their nature .
The Huffington Post published those comments and the clip of the audio sound bite on Friday .
At the event last February , Clinton told those in the audience , " We have been less successful in caucuses because it brings out the activist base of the Democratic Party .
MoveOn did n't even want us to go into Afghanistan .
I mean , that 's what we 're dealing with .
And you know they turn out in great numbers .
And they are very driven by their view of our positions , and it 's primarily national security and foreign policy that drives them .
I do n't agree with them .
They know I do n't agree with them .
So they flood into these caucuses and dominate them and really intimidate people who actually show up to support me . "
Although the left had flagged numerous warning signs , the release of the tape provided , for the first time , an unadulterated glimpse at Clinton ’s feelings for the “ activist base of the Democratic Party . ”
The truth is : many people do n’t know that Clinton disagrees with the “ activist base of the Democratic Party . ”
In fact , Clinton has largely defined herself in contrast to George Bush , and she opened her campaign with a pledge to listen .
“ I ’m not just starting a campaign … I ’m beginning a conversation ; with you , with America , because we ALL need to be part of the discussion if we ’re going to be part of the solution .
Let ’s talk about how to bring the right end to the war in Iraq and restore respect for America around the world .
Let ’s talk about how to make us energy independent and free our dependence on foreign oil . ”
As an activist in the base of the Democratic Party , I ’m pretty enthusiastic about this candidate .
She wants to end the war — or at least it sounds that way — and make America energy independent !
Clinton for president !
She goes on , “ You know , after six years of George Bush , it is time to renew the promise of America . ”
Therefore , she says , “ Let ’s talk , let ’s chat , let ’s start a dialogue about your ideas and mine , because the conversation in Washington has been just a little one - sided lately . ”
Exactly !
They are n’t listening to the “ activist base of the Democratic Party !!!! ”
Maybe you ’ve heard its message : “ Get us out of this disastrous war !! ! ”
No ?
Well it ’s not for a lack of trying .
So , let ’s vote for another candidate who does n’t agree with the activist base of the Democratic Party .
Let ’s have that “ one - sided ” dialogue for another four years .
So we know that Clinton does n’t agree with the “ activist base of the Democratic Party , ” so then , who does she agree with ?
Activism is what defines the Democratic Party .
We ’ve opposed this war early , if not from the beginning .
We ’ve signed petitions and called our representatives , and donated to political campaigns , and volunteered around elections , and attended protests and bought hybrid cars and switched to organic foods .
Democrats are activists .
Hillary Clinton means that she agrees with the 27 Democrats who vote Republican periodically .
She agrees with James Carville or Chris Matthews or any of the so - called “ Democratic strategists ” who turn up on Fox News and bash the Democratic Party .
In over three dozen conversations with folks in Pennsylvania , a clear consensus emerged .
Only one of the registered Democrats supported Clinton ’s opinion of the “ activist base , ” and he seemed too intoxicated for a public appearance on these pages .
Nobody wants a citation .
Linda Smith , a letter carrier in Philadelphia , said she was still undecided about who she would vote for .
She opposes the war and says that she is angry when somebody puts her into a category for her opposition to the war .
In reference to Clinton ’s comments , Smith said , “ It does n’t bother me , but it upsets me . ”
April Davis , a nurse in Philadelphia , said she is tired of feeling like Washington does n’t care about popular opposition to the war in Iraq and does n’t want another four years of it .
Arlene Roberts , an office manager , felt the same way , and took issue with the “ activist base ” label .
“ Everybody has a right to their own opinion , ” Roberts said , “ and just because they oppose the war does n’t mean they should be categorized into a lump of people . ”
Asked about her feelings toward Clinton , in light of Clinton ’s remarks , Roberts said , “ It really shows me what type of person she is .
She says what she needs to say to the crowd she ’s speaking to . ”
Roberts was also concerned that the story is receiving no attention from the same mainstream media that attacked Obama for an entire week over a couple of words .
Annelle Davidson , a stay - at - home mom from Pittsburgh , said she felt Clinton should n’t even be running as a Democrat .
“ There ’s too many soldiers dying over there , ” she said of the Iraq War , frustrated that it continues .
“ The president is supposed to represent the will of the people and he ’s not listening . ”
Lavera Brown lives in Pittsburgh , and she ’s retired .
“ I ’m uncomfortable with someone who would push away that many people , ” Brown said .
She felt that the activist base of the Democratic Party was in large part responsible for many of the advances in civil rights over the last 50 years .
As for the media blackout of the story Brown said , “ I ’m always for equal coverage , and I do n’t know why they ignored that quote , but I think it ’s wrong . ”
In contrast to the controversy over Obama ’s statements at a fund raiser in San Francisco , which the books of Geoffrey Nunberg and Thomas Frank have largely validated , and the media had to dry spin to arrive at an interpretation of elitism , Clinton ’s comments clearly articulate a world view that ’s shockingly out of sync with the persona she has presented to voters and 90 percent of the Democratic Party .
The blackout is not a result of a saintly conversion in the corporate mass media in response to the protests against the manipulation and “ gotcha ” tactics in the ABC debate .
In fact , the New York Times , though toned down , is still arguing the Obama - as - elite case .

September 's deal came after months of talks led by South Africa 's Thabo Mbeki Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has agreed to join a unity government with President Robert Mugabe .
The move ends months of political stalemate as the two sides squabbled over the details of a power - sharing deal agreed last September .
It comes as Zimbabwe deals with Africa 's worst cholera epidemic in 15 years and thousands face hunger , and follows the collapse of the currency .
What has been agreed ?
Mr Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) has agreed to join the unity government .
He is due to be sworn in as prime minister on 11 February under a timetable proposed by the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , which has been mediating on the issue .
The two sides are setting up a joint committee to monitor the power - sharing agreement .
The move requires a leap of faith by the MDC which has no trust in President Mugabe , but it was the only realistic option short of abandoning the idea of a unity government , the BBC's Peter Biles says .
Mr Tsvangirai said the party would formally put its " outstanding issues " to SADC before the swearing - in ceremony .
What was in the September 2008 deal ?
Mr Tsvangirai becomes prime minister and heads a new council of ministers , while Mr Mugabe continues to chair cabinet meetings .
Control of the security forces was one of the key questions during the negotiations , as the MDC accused them of leading attacks on their supporters ahead of last June 's election .
Zimbabwe deal : Key points Zanu - PF has control of the ministries of defence and state security , so the MDC wanted home affairs , which runs the police .
Mr Mugabe at first refused , but in the end agreed to have one minister from each side .
Mr Mugabe also gave his party other key cabinet posts , but reportedly agreed to let the MDC have the finance portfolio .
The MDC had wanted Mr Mugabe to step down and a transitional authority set up to organise new , internationally supervised elections , which it thinks it would win .
How important is the deal ?
The idea is for both sides to work together to rebuild the country , shattered by political violence and economic meltdown .
Donors have said they are ready to put money into Zimbabwe , as long as the MDC has a real say in government .
But it may be difficult for the bitter enemies to work together .
At the signing ceremony in September , both men were relatively conciliatory , but relations then worsened .
One MDC MP points out that most of the party 's new ministers have been " brutalized " in recent years - the MDC says on the orders of Zanu - PF ministers , with whom they are now supposed to work .
Until now , Mr Mugabe has normally referred to Mr Tsvangirai as a " traitor " or a " Western puppet " - accusing him of working for the former colonial power , Britain .
What would have happened without a deal ?
Mr Mugabe could well have formed a government on his own .
But this would not have helped the dire situation in Zimbabwe , as international donors and business will not put money in while Mr Mugabe remains in sole charge .
Zimbabwe was once one of the most diversified countries in Africa , but is now in ruins .
Many Zimbabweans struggle to eke out a living
This week , the acting finance minister agreed to allow Zimbabweans to conduct business in currencies other than the Zimbabwe dollar , in a bid to stem runaway inflation .
The inflation rate of 231,000,000 % means that prices change by the hour , making it almost impossible for businesses to make any plans .
Many have collapsed .
Public sector employees have been refusing to work because they say their salaries are worthless .
This has had a profound effect on the cholera epidemic that is sweeping the country .
The World Health Organization says the number of people infected is now more than 60,000 , a figure they had called their " worst case scenario " .
More than 3,000 people have died from the disease .
There are shortages of many goods , and it is predicted that half the population will need food aid by the end of the year .
Another key question that still has to be addressed is land .
President Mugabe has overseen the seizure of most of Zimbabwe 's white - owned land since 2000 .
The white farmers will no doubt be hoping they can get their land back , but many of the farms have been given to allies of Mr Mugabe , who will be reluctant to let go of them .
Why did they agree to talk ?
Both sides came under heavy international pressure to find a solution to Zimbabwe 's crisis .
Furthermore , the economic collapse made Mr Mugabe and his allies realise that something had to change .
Mr Mugabe and his Zanu - PF control the security forces , which were accused of organising a campaign of violence against the opposition .
The MDC had been warned that it could be " wiped out " if it refused to talk .
Many of its newly - elected MPs and councillors had fled their homes , after being attacked by Zanu - PF militias .
The final push came when the African Union and United Nations agreed to help former South African President Thabo Mbeki with the mediation effort .
The MDC had accused Mr Mbeki of being too soft on Mr Mugabe but agreed to take part in talks after the AU and UN joined the process .
What happened in last year 's election ?
In the first round in March , Mr Tsvangirai gained more votes than Mr Mugabe .
But election officials say neither candidate gained the 50 % needed for victory , so a run-off was held in June .
Ahead of this , there were numerous , credible reports of systematic attacks against MDC activists .
About 200 were killed , 5,000 abducted and 200,000 forced from their homes , the opposition said .
Zanu - PF said the scale of the violence was exaggerated and blamed much of it on the MDC .
Mr Mugabe said " only God " could remove him from power .
This led Mr Tsvangirai to pull out of the run-off .
He said he wanted to save the lives of his supporters and that if Mr Mugabe would not accept defeat , there was no point in taking part in a sham election .
There were also parliamentary elections in March , in which the MDC won a majority .
But the presidency is a far more powerful institution .

I think I ’ve discovered the secret of the long standing conflict between IT workers and management .
Which is to say , one of my commenters ( RobMoir ) articulated it and I ’m totally stealing his concept .
It comes down to the same mentality as religion vs. science .
A true believer in religion does n’t need proof , faith is enough for them .
In fact , a lack of faith and a desire to see empirical truth is seen as a severe failing of character by the faithful .
Conversely , a follower of science finds it difficult to conceive of how someone could simply not want to undertsand something .
The very act of surrendering to a higher power rather continuing the quest for knowledge is incomprehensible to the follower of science .
And that ’s where the gap in managing IT projects seems to be .
Managers all too often seem to operate on principle of religious faith rather than responding to any objective reality .
The project plan becomes holy scripture .
Or worse still , management exhorts the team to operate on faith alone .
“ If we all work together , we can meet the delivery date . ”
Reality be damned .
A good IT worker treats a project more like science and asks pertinent questions .
What exactly will happen ?
How will we make it happen ?
Who specifically has the skills to make it happen ?
What course of action will we follow when the unexpected inevitably happens ?
Mind you , if you want to see an IT worker get religious , start up on their pet operating system / programming language / development methodology / technology platform and / or gaming system .
There ’s nothing quite as fierce as a technology based holy war .
For an illustration I ’ll provide another slightly dramatised discussion based on a very real experience from my ( thankfully distant ) past .
A bit of context first : I ’m a Business Analyst ( BA ) but there are often two sorts of BAs .
One is based with a business unit and represents their interests .
This person usually writes a Business Requirements document .
The other is an IT based BA who looks at things from a systems basis .
This person is often called a Systems Analyst or Technical Analyst and writes a Functional Specification .
In my time , I have been both .
Sometimes on the same job .
In the following example , I was a Systems Analyst .
The BA from the business group was presenting their requirements document and wanted us ( the IT group ) to sign off .
This was the first time we has seen requirements from them .
And quite frankly , they were shit .
The best bits were ambiguous to the point of being useless and it was full of straight out errors .
The BA ’s starting point was that me signing off their document was a foregone conclusion .
My starting point was that this was a review meeting .
If the document did n’t pass review it was going back for more work .
When we reached the critical point of “ No , I ’m not signing off on this piece of shit you call a requirements document , ” the following discussion too place ( translations provided for people who do n’t understand polite business speak ) .
BA : But this meeting was to get a sign off .
( Translation :
It ’s inconceivable that you could doubt the Holy Scripture . )
ME : This meeting was to review the document , I ca n’t sign it of in its current state .
( Translation : I need proof , not blind faith . )
BA : But the project plan says we have to have this signed off today !
( Translation : The Divine Word from on high tell me it is so – I dare not question . )
ME : Then you should have had review sessions before today so we could have given you the feedback you needed to have it ready for signoff .
( Translation :
We sign off requirements when they ’re right .
We do n’t sign off steaming piles of camel turn simply because an arbitrary date has been reached . )
BA : But to meet the schedule this has to be signed off today .
We ’re delivering it on schedule but you have to sign it off .
( Translation :
The schedule said I had to produce a document by today .
I produced a document .
What could possibly be wrong ? )
ME : We can only sign off on the requirements when they ’re right , not when they schedule says they should be signed off .
( Translation : Was I not clear about the steaming camel turd ? )
BA : Well , could you do a “ conditional ” signoff and we ’ll make a note of your issues ?
( Translation :
If you ’re stupid enough to put your name to this you ’ll never see me again – it ’s your problem from then on . )
ME : You ’ve got my feedback , that ’s all that ’s coming out of this meeting .
There ’s no way I can sign off on these requirements .
Take the feedback to your manager and if he has any issues he can take it up with my manager because I ’m under strict instructions to not sign off anything until it ’s ready to be signed off no matter what the schedule says .
( Translation :
We ’re onto your little games .
Now get the fuck out of my face or I ’ll jam that worthless document down your throat until you choke . )
Surprisingly enough , I did not extend my contract at that place .
The job market was very strong at the time and life is far too short to put up with that sort of insanity - inducing dysfunction .
Mind you , it did form the basis of my forthcoming thesis “ Project Management Failure – an archetypal example of how to fuck things up completely . ”
Looking to honor the forty - third President of the United States of America , George W. Bush , the recently formed Presidential Memorial Commission of San Francisco is looking to change the name of the Oceanside Wastewater Treatment Facility .
It seems the group would like to rename the SF Zoo adjacent facility to the " George W Bush Sewage Plant . "
Genius .
The local grassroots movement , helmed by " Wayne Pickering , " is proposing an ordinance initiative for the November 2008 San Francisco ballot in order to get the poop / pee / vomit plant 's title changed .
Why ?
To honor our current leader of the free world with an " appropriate and enduring legacy , for no other president in modern American history has accomplished so much in such a short time .
We think this is an excellent idea .
Would you like to help out with this effort ?
Help collect signatures ?
Host meetings or social gatherings ?
Then , join the effort by visiting Presidentialmemorial.org .
So far , there are only six members , which we find inexcusable .
Together we can make a difference and setup a constant reminder of what was , arguably , the worst administration in the history of our glorious country .
God bless America and God bless the Presidential Memorial Commission of San Francisco .
Update : Read our interview with the chairman of the Presidential Memorial Commission of San Francisco here .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
More home owners than ever are losing the battle to make their monthly mortgage payments .
Over 900,000 households are in the foreclosure process , up 71 % from a year ago , according to a survey by the Mortgage Bankers Association .
That figure represents 2.04 % of all mortgages , the highest rate in the report 's quarterly , 36 - year history .
Another 381,000 households , or 0.83 % of borrowers , saw the foreclosure process started during the quarter , which was also a record .
Additionally , the number of mortgage borrowers who were over 30 days late on a payment in the last three months of 2007 is at its highest rate since 1985 .
" Boy , that was ugly , " said Jared Bernstein , an Economic Policy Institute economist of the data .
" It 's another reminder that anyone who thought we had hit bottom was wrong .
This was a huge bubble , and when a bubble of this magnitude breaks , it creates a huge mess , " he said . "
It could take a lot longer for the correction to work through the system . "
One reason it may take so long is that there seems to be no end in sight for falling home prices .
" Declining prices are clearly the driving factor behind foreclosures , but the reasons and magnitude of the declines differ from state to state , " said Doug Duncan , MBA 's Chief Economist said in a prepared statement .
The foreclosure rates for prime and subprime adjustable rate mortgages both more than doubled compared with a year ago , from 0.41 % for prime ARMs to 1.06 % and from 2.70 % for subprime ARMs to 5.29 % .
But it was subprime ARMs that contributed most heavily to the nation 's soaring foreclosure rates .
Many of these loans come with low introductory rates that reset higher , often to unaffordable levels , in two or three years .
Although they represent only 7 % of all outstanding mortgage loans , they accounted for 42 % of foreclosure starts during the quarter .
Delinquencies stood at 5.82 % of outstanding mortgages , up from 5.59 % during the three months ended September 30 , 2007 , according to the MBA .
In the last quarter of 2006 , the rate was 4.95 % .
" In states like Ohio and Michigan , declines in the demand for homes due to job losses and out - migration have left those looking to sell their homes with fewer potential buyers , particularly with the much tighter credit restrictions borrowers now face , " said Duncan .
" In states like California , Florida , Nevada and Arizona , overbuilding of new homes created a surplus that will take some time to work through . "
California and Florida are the states hardest hit by foreclosures .
They accounted for 30 % of all foreclosure starts in the United States last quarter , despite representing only 21 % of the mortgage market .
Florida 's foreclosure start rate more than tripled during the last three months of the year compared with a year ago , and they more than doubled in California .
Both states still have a sizable over - supply of inventory , according to Duncan , due to over - building during the speculative boom that lasted through mid-2006 .
That will continue to depress home prices and add to mortgage delinquencies in those states .
" We expect to see home price declines to last there through the end of 2008 , " he said , " after the rest of the country is in recovery . "
As prices plummet -- already some California and Florida areas have seen price drops of 25 % or more , according to Duncan -- defaults will soar .
And falling prices and growing foreclosures create a vicious cycle ; the more prices fall the less likely it is that borrowers can use home equity to refinance into more affordable loans , which leads to more defaults .
And as foreclosures rise housing inventory increases , further depressing prices .
At the same time , these trends have lead to a contraction the construction industry , hurting overall U.S. economic activity and increasing the chances that the economy will fall into recession .
In 1972 , after graduating from New York 's Queens College , I took the New York State teaching exam .
My degrees were in Theater and Speech Communications so I took the exam to teach speech .
It was a particularly difficult test since it combined both art and science .
The surprisingly good news - after five years of " thespianing , " partying and cramming , I passed the written and oral exams .
The embarrassingly bad news - I failed MY APPLICATION !
My downfall was one simple question :
Have you ever used drugs ?
The application had separate boxes for a simple YES and a simple NO .
I simply checked YES !!
You see , having gone to school during the drug crazed 60s and 70s , I was convinced my assessors would n’t believe my “ No ” since my wild - hippy - artist - look defined me .
Thus I did as any young idealist would – I told the truth – well , the partial truth .
I admitted to smoking marijuana , and left it at that .
My assessment team was NOT pleased !
The reward for my honesty was a series of urine tests and a follow - up oral exam , during which I was ultimately forced to lie .
I committed to living completely drug free for the rest of my natural life .
Though I was n’t given a psychological exam , it was apparent my interrogators associated my drug use with my stability and capability to do my job .
Some may feel they overreacted .
I surely did at the time .
But considering the importance of the job I was seeking , my interrogators wanted assurance .
Today I understand that my behavior , my clarity , my rationality , and even my honesty , were factored into my worthiness for the job .
Rightfully so .
Teaching is enormously important .
It grants power to one over others .
The proper handling of that power requires psychological and emotional health .
Several years ago I witnessed an adult school principal verbally assault a student before a large crowd .
On other occasions I witnessed that very same principal verbally assault her staff .
She was vindictive , vituperative and irrational - yet she ruled over a very large school .
Eventually that principal was fired – but it took a dozen years and the tireless efforts of faculty and other staff before she was removed .
As far as I know , there is no psychological test for teachers or for school administrators , although there clearly ought to be .
Had there been pre-screening for emotional fitness , this incompetent principal may never have gotten her job .
There are areas of employment that mandate mental health pre-screenings .
The police and military come to mind .
Both require maturity , responsibility , and rationality for the job .
Of course , even with pre-screening , some who are unfit still make it through .
Nonetheless , considering the potential for harm to others by those who hold those jobs , it 's better to screen before .
This week the medical records were released for Presidential candidate , John McCain .
The information was a long time coming .
Immediately upon its release , a select group of reporters and medical practitioners were granted access to its contents for a prohibitively short time .
They garnered information on McCain 's heart , his cholesterol , his melanoma , arthritis , mobility , prostate , polyps , and his oddly disparate heights - 5 ' 6 " and 5 ' 9 . "
You can choose which one to believe .
From all the reports , the 72 year old Senator is in good enough health to lead .
But for any clear thinking voter , the physical health of this candidate , though crucial , pales in importance to his mental health , which in the case of untreated , undiagnosed illness poses a greater threat to us all .
Though it 's ludicrous to elect a candidate who can't physically perform the job , it 's worse to elect a candidate who can't rationally perform the job .
Note this CNN video with Chief Medical Correspondent , Dr. Sanjay Gupta , describing the effects of depression on President Calvin Coolidge after the death of his beloved son , and staff observations of the sullenness of Richard Nixon leading up to his resignation .
We can see how the mental health of a President can directly affect his performance :
In the United States , the singular test for a Presidential candidate 's mental and emotional capacity is the Presidential campaign .
The determination of the mental health of the candidate is left up to the electorate to decide , employing as its principal assessments the candidate and the campaign .
In other words , the emotional and psychological competence of the world 's most powerful " leader " is decided by a lay electorate , culled from practiced readings of the words of others , drilled responses , rehearsed mannerisms , selective pandering , and myriad other theatrics his / her image makers connive .
It 's an assessment of a performer who 's been groomed to play a part , which explains why TV news so often runs intros like " Who 's the REAL Hillary ?
Who 's the REAL Obama ? and Who 's the REAL McCain ?
Even the media sees the theatrics of the campaign .
On Thursday morning ( May 23rd ) , CNN 's Newsroom anchor , Don Lemon , was speaking with Dr. Connie Mariano , former White House physician for President Clinton and both Presidents Bush .
They were discussing the release of John McCain 's health records , when Lemon alluded to the state of McCain 's mental health pertaining to his Prisoner Of War experience .
Here 's that exchange :
Lemon :
And the other concern here that , you know , prisoner of war .
He [ McCain ] has gone through a lot .
Mental health -- in the records , what can you tell us about that and what do you know about that ?
Dr. Mariano was uncomfortable discussing McCain 's mental health regarding his Prisoner Of War history .
Instead she deferred to his campaign , offering her understanding that the Presidential campaign is the true test of McCain 's mental health .
The theatrics were of course swept away .
Mariano :
You know , I have not seen his prisoner of war records .
I think what people need to look at is how is he at this current time .
You know , I think the biggest test in terms of mental status is really the campaign in and of itself .
When they 're on the road , they 're doing 18 - hour days .
They 're constantly answering questions .
You members of the press are hammering them for questions , trying to catch them , whether or not they are astute enough to listen to the questions and answer it correctly .
So that 's a tremendous mental status test , if anything , is to survive the presidential campaign , and then ultimately to go to the convention .
How are they in terms of their speaking ?
Are there any lapses of memory ?
And then how well do they think on their feet ?
I think that 's a very good test as to how they 're operating mentally .
I agree with Dr. Mariano that the rigors of the campaign do test the clarity of expression and physical stamina of the candidate , however , much that the candidate says and does is the result of careful preparation .
The candidate is a character - a creation - whose prmary job is to be convincing in the role .
The rigors of campaigning can demonstrate acuity , but its theatrics can detract from an honest portrayal of the person .
In 2004 , psychoanalyst Dr. Justin Frank published " Bush On The Couch " - a profile of George W. Bush that took two years to complete .
Dr. Frank is unusually brave amongst his peers .
The following video , also with CNN's Dr. Gupta , speaks to the apprehension of mental health experts to speak publicly on candidates , with the exception of Dr. Frank .
In " Bush On The Couch , " Dr. Frank concludes that George W. Bush exhibits signs of megalomania , sadism , and an inability to show real compassion ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_on_the_Couch).
From my own lay perspective , after observing Bush for more than 8 years ( factoring in the campaign of 1999 ) , Dr. Frank is entirely right .
Whether or not these traits would have appeared in a pre-screening psychological profile , I have no idea .
But considering the current state of our union under George Bush 's reckless command , a preemptive pre-screening would have been well worth the time .
According to Dr. Frank :
“ Part of the reason for the book [ " Bush On The Couch " ] is also to get the general public to start thinking about the psychology of the people they elect to do the most important job you can have in public life - and we do n’t know anything about these people .
It ’s all packaged .
That applies to all the candidates . "
Many supporters of George W. Bush have apparently never observed or acknowledged his megalomania , sadism , immaturity , aggression , recklessness , quick temper , bravado , short attention span , sarcasm , compulsivity , jitteriness , darting eyes , and more .
However , tens , if not hundreds of millions have .
Such traits are more the manifestations of mental illness than of physical illness .
It 's these very manifestations of mental incapacity that have brought this nation to its knees .
Surely , a psychological pre-screening by stellar non-partisan professionals , or an acceptable pre-screening tool , or a combination of both , could have identified George W. Bush as mentally unsuitable for his job .
Former President Jimmy Carter recognized the need to formally assess the medical health of a sitting President to determine if s/he has the capacity for the job .
According to Jeremy Hsu of LiveScience.com
" He [ Carter ] pushed for the creation of a " nonpartisan group " of physicians to help decide when a president 's illness affects his judgement .
In 1993 , Carter published a speech in the Journal of the American Medical Association that led to the formation of the Working Group on Presidential Disability , consisting of scholars and physicians . "
As is often the case with uncomfortable issues in Washington DC , President Carter 's " Working Group " evaporated into the ether and remains there today .
Still , it 's good to see a legitimate attempt to monitor the capability of the President .
Here 's a further example of the possible incapacitation of a sitting President in another clip with CNN's Dr. Gupta .
This video features staffers of former President Reagan discussing his performance on the job :
Harkening back to my original premise requiring psychological pre-screening of candidates - the fact is , mental health history and current mental health status are as important , if not more so , than medical history and current medical status .
Inconceivably , candidates for the Presidency are not legally bound to release their medical or mental health records .
However , due to public pressure and " abiding " ( more like begrudging ) moral responsibility , the records are usually revealed - though sometimes with a caveat as in the case of John McCain , who granted selected reporters just 3 hours to view more than 1100 pages of data .
The bottom line - to the depths of my being , I believe George W. Bush is mentally unfit to hold office .
I have a similar opinion of John McCain .
I 'm also becoming increasingly concerned about Hillary , although to a decidedly lesser degree .
My lay observation of Obama , however , is as emotionally steady - which is refreshing and reassuring to me .
( Yes , I know you will call me biased ) .
Dr. Frank 's " Bush On The Couch " did n't publish until George W. Bush was his second term .
I sincerely hope that if valid mental health assessments are n't instituted , as they should be , for candidates and elected officials , then mental health professionals driven by conscience , will overrule their mandate of silence and speak out in an unbiased way .
They need to intercede during the campaign - not after the inauguration - to prevent a similar catastrophic rule .
When warning flags are present , they need to be waved !
Dr. Frank defines his particular field of Applied Psychoanalysis as " learning everything possible about a person ’s life and applying everything you know about psychology to that person . "
With the number of years John McCain has been public , there 's certainly room for that here .
Mental health pre-screening is not intended to characterize or discredit a candidate 's ideology , opinion , or stance .
It 's intended to rule out significant illness that would impede the capacity to do the job .
I , personally , would like to see all candidates for public office assessed for mental health , as well as those who presently hold office .
And teachers and administrators , too !

A new computer modeling study led by CU - Boulder scientists Brian Toon , left , and Michael Mills , right , indicates a limited nuclear weapons exchange in the Middle East would create a near - global ozone hole , impacting human and ecosystem health for a decade or more .

A limited nuclear weapons exchange between Pakistan and India using their current arsenals could create a near - global ozone hole , triggering human health problems and wreaking environmental havoc for at least a decade , according to a study led by the University of Colorado at Boulder .
The computer - modeling study showed a nuclear war between the two countries involving 50 Hiroshima - sized nuclear devices on each side would cause massive urban fires and loft as much as 5 million metric tons of soot about 50 miles into the stratosphere , said CU - Boulder Research Associate Michael Mills , chief study author .
The soot would absorb enough solar radiation to heat surrounding gases , setting in motion a series of chemical reactions that would break down the stratospheric ozone layer protecting Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation , said Mills .
“ We would see a dramatic drop in ozone levels that would persist for many years , ” said Mills of CU - Boulder ’s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics .
“ At mid- latitudes the ozone decrease would be up to 40 percent , which could have huge effects on human health and on terrestrial , aquatic and marine ecosystems . ”
A paper on the subject , titled “ Massive Global Ozone Loss Predicted Following A Regional Nuclear Conflict , ” appeared the week of April 7 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Co-authors on the study include CU - Boulder Professor Brian Toon , UCLA Professor Richard Turco and National Center for Atmospheric Research scientists Douglas Kinnison and Rolando Garcia .
According to the computer simulations , fires ignited in large cities by nuclear explosions would send several million metric tons of soot into the upper stratosphere , which would be heated by massive smoke injections .
Higher temperatures would accelerate catalytic reaction cycles in the stratosphere , particularly reactions of nitrogen oxide gases known collectively as NOx that destroy ozone , Mills said .
In addition to ozone losses of 25 percent to 40 percent at mid-latitudes , the models show a 50 percent to 70 percent ozone loss at northern high latitudes , said Mills .
“ The models show this magnitude of ozone loss would persist for five years , and we would see substantial losses continuing for at least another five years , ” he said .
The ozone losses predicted in the study are much larger than losses estimated in previous “ nuclear winter ” and “ ultraviolet spring ” scenario calculations following nuclear conflicts , said Toon , chair of CU - Boulder ’s oceanic and atmospheric sciences department .
A 1985 National Research Council Report predicted a global nuclear exchange involving thousands of megatons of explosions , rather than the 1.5 megatons assumed in the PNAS study , would deplete only 17 percent of the Northern Hemisphere ’s stratospheric ozone , which would recover by half in three years .
“ The missing piece back then was that the models at the time could not account for the rise of the smoke plume and consequent heating of the stratosphere , ” said Toon .
“ The big surprise is that this study demonstrates that a small - scale , regional nuclear conflict is capable of triggering ozone losses even larger than losses that were predicted following a full - scale nuclear war . ”
Human health ailments like cataracts and skin cancer , as well as damage to plants , animals and ecosystems at mid-latitudes would likely rise sharply as ozone levels decreased and allowed more harmful UV light to reach Earth , according to the PNAS study .
“ By adopting the Montreal Protocol in 1987 , society demonstrated it was unwilling to tolerate a small percentage of ozone loss because of serious health risks , ” said Toon .
“ But ozone loss from a limited nuclear exchange would be more than an order of magnitude larger than ozone loss from the release of gases like CFCs . ”
UV radiation has been shown to be particularly damaging to inhabitants of aquatic ecosystems , including amphibians , shrimp , fish and phytoplankton , said Mills .
“ Most organisms can do little to avoid UV exposure , so one of the big unanswered questions is how the biota would respond to these big UV increases triggered by a nuclear exchange . ”
The team used a cluster of computer processors at LASP to run three separate 10 - year simulations -- each more than 300 hours long -- linking the urban fire nuclear scenario to climate and atmospheric chemistry processes .
The team coupled NCAR ’s Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model 3 with the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres developed by CU - Boulder and NASA Ames .
Two 2006 studies led by Toon and involving UCLA and Rutgers University showed that such a small - scale regional nuclear war could produce as many fatalities as all of World War II and disrupt global climate for a decade or more .
Of the eight nations known to possess nuclear weapons , even those with the smallest nuclear arsenals , like Pakistan and India , are believed to have 50 or more Hiroshima - sized weapons .
In addition , about 40 countries possess enough plutonium , uranium or a combination of both to construct substantial nuclear arsenals , said Toon .
A nuclear exchange involving 100 15 - kiloton , Hiroshima - type weapons is only 0.03 percent of the total explosive power of the world ’s nuclear arsenal , he said .
“ We hope other research groups repeat our calculations and undertake their own scientific studies on this issue , ” said Toon .
“ The world has become a far more dangerous place when the actions of two countries on the other side of the world could have such a drastic impact on the planet . ”
The study was funded by CU - Boulder .

How to stupidise people
What makes people stupid in " educated " societies ?
We suggest a few factors ...
On this page :
 Either / Or controversies >
 Multi-valued orientation >
 Meta-territorial >
 Dead - level abstracting >
 Politics and advertising >
 Useless Definitions >
 Circular reasoning >
 Connotations & weak inferences >
 Verbal autointoxication >
 Emoturbation >
 Media example of Either / Or controversy >
Either / Or controversies
" Controversy equalizes fools and wise men and the fools know it . "
( Oliver Wendell Holmes )
Fools thrive when controversies arise over false dichotomies .
In other words , when multiple - choice issues get reduced to " either / or " questions .
For example :
" What can be done about Evil Dictator X ? " ( Multiple choice )
" It 's either military action or nothing " ( Either / or )
Reducing multi-valued issues to two - valued ( either / or , yes / no , right / wrong , etc ) controversies has the effect of stimulating territorial ( " us " vs " them " ) instincts and emotional identification with a " side " .
At this point most people begin to look stupidised .
Multi-valued orientation
If someone says : " you wo n't find truth in the media " , you might feel tempted to agree or disagree outright ( two - valued orientation ) .
An arguably more intelligent approach involves a multi-valued rating of the statement .
Say between 0 % and 100 % , depending on the percentage of media content judged as untruthful .
For example : " I 'd say that statement was correct in 20 % of cases " .
Many people seem so conditioned to see issues in territorial ( two - valued ) terms , that any other approach looks like a threat to them .
A multi-valued approach to international problems thus seems " soft " or " appeasing " ( " bad " traits which favour the side of " evil " ) .
Any criticism of a fundamentalist 's " good versus evil " dogma will seem ( to the fundalmentalist ) like the Devil 's work .
Dead - level abstracting
We can't communicate well without a degree of abstracting / generalising .
However , a type of generalising known as " dead - level abstracting " ( so named by Wendell Johnson ) can have a stupidising effect .
This happens when you get stuck at one level of abstraction .
The following statement ( taken from a UK alt - media site ) seems a good example :
" institutionalised media corruption means that power is freed to manipulate the public to suit whatever cynical ends it chooses .
This is the secret of elite control in an ostensibly ' democratic ' society . "
This consists of nothing but high - level abstractions .
It boils down to : " Media corruption means control of the public " .
The words " elite " , " power " , etc , add nothing specific .
Stupidisation occurs when people read into such statements anything but high - level abstraction .
( Note that such statements seem written in such a way as to make them appear more specific / factual ) .
At the other end of the spectrum one finds simple reports of sensory perceptions  the lowest level of verbal abstracting .
For example , gossip containing reports of what somebody said :
" She said I should mind my own business .
I said you 're one to talk .
She said at least I 'm being honest .
I said are you calling me a liar you dirty bitch "
It takes a higher level of abstracting than this to conclude : " So we exchanged insults and got nowhere  it was a waste of time " .
Constantly mixing high and low levels of abstraction prevents IQs from plummeting .
Politics and advertising
Politicians use " high " dead - level abstracting to avoid specific criticisms and to stifle probing debate .
For example :
" I make no excuse for our tough stance in the struggle to protect our nation 's way of life from those who would threaten it " .
( The words " tough " and " struggle " do n't sound abstract .
But what , in this context , beyond highly abstract judgements , could they denote ? )
Advertisers use dead - level abstracting to associate nothing but abstract qualities to brand names ( eg : " Abbey  because life 's complicated enough " ) .
The brand names connote abstract qualities ; the ads often denote nothing factual / specific about the products being sold .
Experience " Coke : the real thing " , not fizzy water with added sugar and chemicals .
( " The real thing " does n't sound abstract .
Do n't expect high - level abstractions to sound abstract ) .
[ Click here for examples of media generalisations ]
Useless Definitions
The person who wrote " the secret of elite control " ( see above ) might argue that a brief definition of " elite " would clarify his meaning .
But definitions operate at levels of abstraction at least as high as the terms they define .
A dictionary definition of " dog " says : " carnivorous quadruped " .
A bigger dictionary might add " of canine genus " .
Look up " canine " , and you get " dog " .
Definitions do n't help much to clarify high - level abstractions .
Whenever you suspect someone of stupidising you with words ( intentionally or not ) , demand specific examples , names / dates , reports of sensory data , verifiable facts  lower - level abstractions .
Then , if necessary , demand definitions  to see if the specifics fit ( by definition ) the abstractions .
Circular reasoning
" High " dead - level abstracting often entails circular logic .
Here 's an example ( from a UK alt - media forum ) :
" Although the Guardian is ostensibly a truth - loving newspaper , the reality is that it continually suppresses truth , as it's essentially part of power , whose main function is truth - suppression " .
Circular reasoning provides nothing but self - confirming abstractions : " X suppresses truth because it 's part of Y , which suppresses truth " .
And how do we know that X is part of Y ?
" Er because X suppresses truth " .
( Some good examples of circular reasoning in classical economic theory are given in an extract from The Tyranny of Words by Stuart Chase ) .
Connotations & weak inferences
The term " conspiracy theory " does n't denote crackpot theories .
It merely has the connotation of " crackpot " to those who infer that only crackpots have theories about conspiracies .
We can take the connotations / inferences further .
George Bush theorised about a secret plot between Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein .
Some might call that a " conspiracy theory " ( a theory about a conspiracy ) .
But since the media assures us that Bush is no crackpot , we can infer that what took place between Osama and Saddam was no " conspiracy " ( it was merely a " plot to attack America "  not half as wacko a claim , you see ) .
See how far you can get with connotations , inferences and circular reasoning ?
You can spin out whole newspaper columns  even books  just by building one inference on top of another .
And if you cleverly add in some " high " dead - level abstracting , nobody can refute you with verifiable facts  because your claims operate at a level of abstraction above mere facts .
Welcome to the rewarding world of stupidising PR , political speech - writing and media punditry .
Verbal autointoxication
Mix together the ingredients described on this page , and you get a stupidising cocktail  convoluted verbal virtual realities resting on little that resembles verifiable fact .
Such cocktails often carry the label " news " .
For example , a report by the BBC 's political editor , Andrew Marr , on the official " ending " of the Iraq war ( when the statue of Saddam toppled , in April 2003 ) .
Notice that Marr's " report " contains few ( if any ) verifiable facts  it consists almost entirely of connotations , weak inferences , speculations , two - valued ( eg right / wrong ) controversy and dead - level abstracting :
" [ At Downing Street ] the main mood is of unbridled relief it draws a line under what , before the war , had been a period of  well , a faint air of pointlessness , almost , was hanging over Downing Street .
There were all these slightly tawdry arguments and scandals .
That is now history .
" Mr Blair is well aware that all his critics out there in the party and beyond are n't going to thank him ( because they 're only human ) for being right when they 've been wrong .
And he knows that there might be trouble ahead , as I said .
But I think this is very , very important for him .
It gives him a new freedom and a new self - confidence .
" He confronted many critics .
I do n't think anybody , after this , is going to be able to say of Tony Blair that he 's somebody who is driven by the drift of public opinion or focus groups or opinion polls .
He took all of those on .
He said that they would be able to take Baghdad without a bloodbath , and that in the end the Iraqis would be celebrating .
And on both of those points he has been proved conclusively right .
And it would be entirely ungracious , even for his critics , not to acknowledge that tonight he stands as a larger man and a stronger prime minister as a result . "
( Andrew Marr , BBC1 10 pm news , April 9 , 2003 )
Emoturbation
Watch the news coverage after any big disaster to see shameless , full - frontal emoturbating .
It 's a good idea to carefully distinguish the understandable emotions of victims from those of the professional ( and amateur ) emoturbators .
There seems to be a spectrum from sympathy and empathy to neurotic wallowing and calculated Blair - style acting .
Usual message conveyed : " Something must be done  not in proportion to the relatively small risk of the tragedy reoccurring any time soon  but in proportion to the truly momentous scale of my emotional arousal " .
Media example of Either / Or controversy
The US media watchdog , FAIR , noted the media 's either / or presentation on the issue of going to war following 9/11 :
" ... it 's likely that many people asked to choose whether or not to go to war had never seen an alternative to war articulated in a mainstream outlet . "

New polling suggests Clinton ’s involvement in battle between his wife and Obama has significantly tarnished the former president ’s image .
Bill 's image damaged by campaign role
Bill Clinton ’s reentry into the political arena appears to have come at some cost to his legacy .
New polling now suggests that Clinton ’s involvement in the Democratic nomination battle between his wife , Hillary Rodham Clinton , and Barack Obama , has significantly tarnished the former president ’s image .
A Wall Street Journal / NBC
News poll released Thursday found that more Americans view Bill Clinton negatively than positively , 45 to 42 percent .
It marked the first time since January 2002 that a plurality of Americans disapproved of the former president .
One month earlier , The Gallup Poll found that nearly as many Americans had an unfavorable as favorable view of Bill Clinton — for the first time in nearly five years .

Presidential historians said Clinton ’s return to partisan politics made it likely that public perception of the former president would suffer .
" There is a certain historical glow that surrounds a president as some of his historical battles become more distant .
Clinton getting back in the mud again makes him a much more partisan figure , ” said Allan Lichtman , a presidential historian at American University .
" And it ’s not like it ’s been an acclaimed experience for him . "
After leaving the White House in January 2001 amidst controversy surrounding his last - minute pardons , Clinton reconstituted his public persona with a return to the world stage .
He traveled to Gujarat , India , after a devastating earthquake , and in later years barnstormed Africa as an advocate for lower AIDS drug prices .
He also began hosting an annual pre-United Nations General Assembly meeting for world leaders and tycoons .
America came to know a newer , less self - centered Clinton , an energetic statesman working to better the world .
Public opinion polls showed about six in ten Americans held a positive view of the former president , reminiscent of the apex of his support in the White House .
His return to elected politics changed all that .
In New Hampshire , he referred to Obama ’s early opposition to the Iraq war as the “ biggest fairy tale I 've ever seen , ” a remark that would come to be seen by many as an attempt to belittle Obama .
He later accused Obama ’s staff of voter suppression in Nevada — a sensitive charge in Democratic circles .
Clinton ’s low point came in South Carolina , where he drew criticism for comparing Obama ’s candidacy to Jesse Jackson , a remark widely viewed as an attempt to pigeonhole Obama as a candidate who appeals largely to black voters .
Clinton also took on a much more adversarial role with the media , a posture unseen since his years in the White House .
By Super Tuesday , the former president himself had become part of the story .
In the key competitive state of Missouri , 28 percent of Democratic primary voters had a negative view of Clinton , double the amount as in New Hampshire just weeks earlier .
" This guy ’s chronic lack of focus , lack of self discipline , and his tendency to make politics a short run political game his bottom line , these characteristics led him to make moves that were counterproductive both to his reputation and his post - presidential rating and damage his wife ’s campaign , ” said Princeton University presidential historian Fred Greenstein .
The public was reminded of the undisciplined president who “ is very good at shooting himself in the foot , ” Greenstein added .
Since it became clear that the former president was doing as much harm as good , Clinton has taken on a much lower profile role , campaigning in small markets away from the crush of the national media .
Still , his earlier comments continue to haunt his wife ’s campaign .
Last week , at a forum of more than 200 black community newspaper publishers , Hillary Clinton apologized for her husband ’s remark comparing Obama to Jackson .
“ I am sorry if anyone was offended , ” she said .
“ Certainly since New Hampshire and then South Carolina and then a little bit beyond , what that will do for legacy is , it takes the rose colored glasses off , particularly for historians , ” said Kent Germany , a presidential historian at the University of South Carolina .
“ Historians now have this bit to say : ‘ here ’s the real pattern of the Clinton life . ’
Maybe he ’s not as brilliant a calculator as we had thought previously .
Maybe he ’s good in the moment and sometimes it does n’t work out . ”
But if Clinton has indeed seriously injured his public standing , a presidential victory by his wife might go a long way toward reversing the damage .
“ It would help his legacy enormously , nothing in politics succeeds like success , ” said American University ’s Lichtman .
“ And that would be just absolutely extraordinary considering the gamble he ’s taken . ”

« Ville vært i live i dag hvis hun ikke hadde gått til scientologene » SV - toppen Olav Gunnar Ballos datter Kaja ble bare 20 år .
- Alt tyder på at scientologisekta har spilt en direkte rolle for at Kaja valgte å ta sitt eget liv , mener stortingsrepresentant Inga Marte Thorkildsen .
Hun møtte Kaja Bordevich Ballo første gang da hun var med faren Olav Gunnar Ballo på Stortinget .
Seinere gikk Thorkildsen på samme dansekurs som henne .
- Jeg tror Kaja ville vært i live i dag hvis hun ikke hadde gått til scientologene , mener Henrik Møinichen ( 19 ) , en nær venn og studiekompis av Kaja .
Han så henne for siste gang om morgenen den samme dagen hun tok sitt eget liv .
Begge velger å snakke med Dagbladet i samforståelse med Olav Gunnar Ballo .
Han og Kajas mor er også innforstått med at Dagbladet omtaler saken .
- Jeg opplever det som for tidlig og for nært til å snakke om det som skjedde , sier Ballo til Dagbladet .
Han er nå tilbake på jobb som SVs medlem i helse - og omsorgskomiteen og Odelstingets visepresident .
200 spørsmål
Forrige onsdag informerte han SVs stortingsgruppe om datterens dødsfall og hva som lå bak .
To dager etter holdt familien minnestunden etter begravelsen i Stortingets kjellerstue .
Fredag 28 . mars fulgte Kaja 9 til 11 - forelesningen på Universitetet i Nice sammen med Henrik .
Så dro hun for å handle .
- Hun oppførte seg slik hun pleier , sier Henrik Møinichen som også bor på samme studenthjem som Kaja .
FIKK SJOKKBUDSKAPET : Helse - og omsorgspolitiker Olav Gunnar Ballo ( SV ) er visepresident i Odelstinget og lege fra Finnmarks - kommunen Alta. 28 . mars i år tok datteren Kaja sitt eget liv .
- Jeg opplever det som for tidlig og for nært til å snakke om det som skjedde , sier Ballo til Dagbladet .

Like ved studenthjemmet ligger « Leglise de scientologie - Mission de Nice » hvor scientologikirken reklamerer med stresstester .
Der gikk hun inn dørene , trolig i ett - tida , og tok den såkalte Oxford - testen som stiller 200 spørsmål , blant annet : Leser du togtabeller , veivisere eller leksikon bare for fornøyelsens skyld ?
Er stemmen din monoton i stedet for varierende ?
Dette er den samme testen scientologisekter over hele verden har brukt i alle år for å rekruttere medlemmer .
Psykologer har advart mot dem i like lang tid .
Ut ifra svarene forteller scientologene hvordan du ligger an på en skala fra pluss hundre til minus hundre for en rekke tilstander , blant annet pålitelighet og ansvarlighet .
Kaja fikk minus hundre på den ene og ble erklært ustabil .
I tillegg var hun øyensynlig kraftig deprimert , uansvarlig , hyperkritisk og manglet harmoni .
La igjen lapp
Den unge studenten gikk hjem .
Et par timer seinere hoppet Kaja ut fra vinduet sitt i fjerde etasje på studenthjemmet .
I en pose i leiligheten sammen med den nykjøpte buksa lå skjemaet med de nedslående konklusjonene og en lapp hvor hun ba om unnskyldning for at hun ikke klarte noen ting .
- Konklusjonen var at hun var ute av stand til å gjøre noe med livet sitt .
Det er så langt fra sannheten du kan komme .
Hun har virkelig klart å endre livet sitt som det står enorm respekt av .
Hun hadde en drøss med venner , var utrolig oppegående og intelligent , forteller Inga Marte Thorkildsen .
Da Kaja var 13 år , ble hun innlagt ved Universitetssykehuset i Tromsø på grunn av alvorlige spiseforstyrrelser .
Året etter , høsten 2002 , hadde hun flyttet til Oslo sammen med faren .
Hun ble da innlagt på barnemedisinsk senter på Ullevål universitetssykehus for samme lidelse .
I januar 2003 ble hun skrevet ut .
Helsepolitikeren Ballo , i forståelse med Kaja , fortalte åpent om familiens erfaring for å få økt oppmerksomhet og mer ressurser til behandlingen av andre i samme situasjon .
De siste åra har hun vært helt frisk .
- Da jeg traff henne første gang , var hun veldig syk .
Da jeg møtte henne igjen for et par år siden på dansetimene , kjente jeg henne ikke igjen .
Hun var utrolig utadvendt og frisk jente som var fornøyd med livet og stolt av seg selv .
En oppreist , glad og kul dame , sier Thorkildsen .
Snakket om framtida
Studievennen Henrik ble kjent med henne i tredje klasse på Oslo katedralskole .
Etter gymnaset dro de sammen til Universitetet i Nice i fjor høst .
- Hun var godt likt av alle og hadde det fint med studiene og alt .
Jeg så ikke noen tegn på at noe slikt kunne skje .
Vi snakket masse om framtida , helt inntil siste stund .
Derfor kom det som et stort sjokk på oss at hun tok sitt eget liv , forteller Henrik Møinichen .
Under begravelsen forrige fredag fortalte sokneprest Grete Hauge en fullsatt Grefsen kirke om omstendighetene rundt Kajas dødsfall .
Sjokk og vantro
- Kaja var innom Scientologikirken og tok en test kort tid før hun døde samme dag , bekrefter Hauge overfor Dagbladet .
Nærmere fem hundre deltok i begravelsen , blant annet finansminister Kristin Halvorsen og KrF-leder Dagfinn Høybråten .
- Vi fikk se bilder fra hele Kaias liv , snakke med venner , familie og lærere .
Alle var i sjokk fordi de oppfattet Kaja så livsglad og frisk .
Ingen forsto hvordan det kunne skje , sier Inga Marte Thorkildsen .
- Tror du møtet med scientologene hadde en direkte innvirkning på hennes tragiske valg ?
- Jeg vet ikke det fulle og hele bildet , men alt tyder på at scientologisekta har spilt en direkte rolle for at Kaja valgte å ta sitt eget liv .
Hun må ha blitt fullstendig knust av testen .
Jeg tenker at en del av disse ekstreme grupperingene går målrettet på folk som de ser er sårbare .
De tolker svarene med verst tenkelige resultat og strekker så ut ei hånd og sier de kan hjelpe deg .
Motivet er å rekruttere og tjene penger , sier Thorkildsen .
Olav Gunnar Ballo har engasjert advokat Stein Serradj som følger politietterforskningen i den franske middelhavsbyen .
- Politiet etterforsker omstendighetene rundt dødsfallet , blant annet om hvorvidt besøket hos scientologene var en medvirkende årsak .
Vi avventer resultatet av de første undersøkelsene før vi bestemmer hvordan vi går videre med saken .
Det kan bli aktuelt å saksøke scientologkirken , sier Serradj til Dagbladet .
Bare en tilfeldighet ?
Dagbladet ringte i går ettermiddag scientologikirken i Nice .
- Vi leste om saken i lokalavisa og kjenner til at hun var her .
Hun kom for å få hjelp til å takle stress og tok testen , bekrefter Caroline .
Hun vil ikke oppgi etternavnet , men sier hun er sjefen i « kirken » .
- Hvordan reagerer du på påstander om at dere er direkte ansvarlig for at hun tok sitt eget liv ?
- Hvordan kan noen si noe slikt ?
Mellom to og tre tusen mennesker tar disse testene hver dag over hele verden .
Aldri har noen tatt sitt eget liv på grunn av dem .
- Mener du det bare er en tilfeldighet at hun tok sitt eget liv bare timer etter å ha fått de nedslående resultatene ?
- Ja , det er en tragisk tilfeldighet , sier Caroline .
Hun benekter at politiet har stilt dem noen spørsmål .
Testet og slaktet
Scientologenes såkalte personlighetstest har gjennom tidene fått massiv kritikk , men de mener kritikerne vet altfor lite .
Den kontroversielle personlighetstesten Oxford Capacity Analysis ( OCA ) er for mange det første møtet med Scientologikirken .
Med 200 spørsmål satser scientologene på å trekke til seg nye medlemmer .
Kritikerne hevder scientologene uansett hva testresultatet ditt er , vil prøve å presse deg til å ta diverse kurs å forbedre deg .
Det er blant annet slik kirken tjener penger .
Dårlig uansett
Psykologer , journalister og mange andre har av nysgjerrighet latt seg teste og erfart at testresultatet uansett blir negativt .
Kritikerne påstår OCA - testen med vilje er lagt opp slik at den som tester seg sitter igjen nedslått og bekymret .
En journalist fra avisa Daily Express forteller at etter at testresultatene hennes var analysert , hadde hun mest lyst til å krype sammen som en ball og aldri mer gå ut .
- Tilsynelatende var jeg deprimert , ustabil , overkritisk , kranglete og tilbaketrukket , sa avisjournalisten etterpå .
200 spørsmål
Testen består av 200 spørsmål som kan bli besvart med « ja » , « nei » , eller « kanskje » .
Et computerprogram blir deretter brukt til å plotte resultatene på en såkalt personlighetsprofil - graf .
Testeren blir karakterisert som annet stabil , glad , behersket , aktiv , aggressiv og ansvarlig .
Skalaen spenner fra +100 til - 100 .
Scientologene mener dette er en profesjonell test som bruker 200 nøye utvalgte spørsmål for å komme til bunns i din personlighet .
Testen viser dine sterke sider - slik at du kan utnytte dette - og problemområdene dine , « de tingene som blokkerer for ditt sanne potensial og lykke i livet » , ifølge scientologikirkens internasjonale hjemmeside .
Informasjonssekretær Matthias Fosse i Scientologikirken
Oslo har tidligere uttalt til Dagbladet at personer som kritiserer dem som regel vet altfor lite .
- Kritikerne snakker bevisst ikke om det positive vi gjør .
Dagbladet lyktes ikke i å få kontakt med Fosse i går kveld .
Uetisk og farlig
Kritikerne mener standarden på evalueringen av personlighetstesten er forkastelig .
Den svenske psykologiprofessoren Gudmund Smith ved universitet i Lund konkluderte i 1981 at testen ikke var til å stole på , og etter hans syn uetisk .
Lund - professoren slaktet spørsmålene fordi han mente de var åpenbart ledende , uklart formulert og tvetydige .
Smiths vurdering ble gjort på oppdrag av den lokale påtalemyndigheten som på den tida etterforsket en lokalavdeling av Narconon , som har utspring i Scientologikirken .
Den australske psykologforeningen er blant dem som har stemplet OCA - testen som « regelrett farlig » .
Det er ikke grunnlag for å trekke de konklusjonene som blir gjort , mente foreningen .
Deres britiske kolleger gikk allerede i 1970 enda lenger i å slakte metoden og beskrive den som skadelig .
Ingen anerkjent psykolog vil akseptere et opplegg som går ut på å hente inn folk fra gata , gi dem en personlighetstest og deretter gi tilbakemeldingen « utilstrekkelig » , « uakseptabel » eller med « sterkt behov for umiddelbar oppfølging » , hevdet den britiske psykologforeningen .
WASHINGTON  Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. sought Friday to assure the finance ministers and central bankers of the world ’s wealthiest countries that the American economic picture could improve later this year and that the administration was doing all it could to hasten the recovery .
But Mr. Paulson , speaking at a news conference Friday evening after meeting with the ministers during the day , suggested that the slump had yet to run its course and that “ the risks are to the downside . ”
He said the ministers generally supported the actions the administration and the Federal Reserve had taken in recent months , including the lowering of interest rates , the Fed ’s intervention to prevent the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and the $ 150 billion package to stimulate the economy enacted earlier this year .
“ I explained that we ’re watching this very closely , ” Mr. Paulson said , adding that the housing bubble of the last several years had been “ unsustainable ” and that the decline in housing prices was “ not pleasant ” but “ what needs to happen ” for recovery to take place .
The Gears of My Childhood
Before I was two years old I had developed an intense involvement with automobiles .
The names of car parts made up a very substantial portion of my vocabulary : I was particularly proud of knowing about the parts of the transmission system , the gearbox , and most especially the differential .
It was , of course , many years later before I understood how gears work ; but once I did , playing with gears became a favorite pastime .
I loved rotating circular objects against one another in gearlike motions and , naturally , my first " erector set " project was a crude gear system .
I became adept at turning wheels in my head and at making chains of cause and effect : " This one turns this way so that must turn that way so . . . " I found particular pleasure in such systems as the differential gear , which does not follow a simple linear chain of causality since the motion in the transmission shaft can be distributed in many different ways to the two wheels depending on what resistance they encounter .
I remember quite vividly my excitement at discovering that a system could be lawful and completely comprehensible without being rigidly deterministic .
I believe that working with differentials did more for my mathematical development than anything I was taught in elementary school .
Gears , serving as models , carried many otherwise abstract ideas into my head .
I clearly remember two examples from school math .
I saw multiplication tables as gears , and my first brush with equations in two variables ( e.g. , 3 x + 4y = 10 ) immediately evoked the differential .
By the time I had made a mental gear model of the relation between x and y , figuring how many teeth each gear needed , the equation had become a comfortable friend .
Many years later when I read Piaget this incident served me as a model for his notion of assimilation , except I was immediately struck by the fact that his discussion does not do full justice to his own idea .
He talks almost entirely about cognitive aspects of assimilation .
But there is also an affective component .
Assimilating equations to gears certainly is a powerful way to bring old knowledge to bear on a new object .
But it does more as well .
I am sure that such assimilations helped to endow mathematics , for me , with a positive affective tone that can be traced back to my infantile experiences with cars .
I believe Piaget really agrees .
As I came to know him personally I understood that his neglect of the affective comes more from a modest sense that little is known about it than from an arrogant sense of its irrelevance .
But let me return to my childhood .
One day I was surprised to discover that some adults --- even most adults --- did not understand or even care about the magic of the gears .
I no longer think much about gears , but I have never turned away from the questions that started with that discovery :
How could what was so simple for me be incomprehensible to other people ?
My proud father suggested " being clever " as an explanation .
But I was painfully aware that some people who could not understand the differential could easily do things I found much more difficult .
Slowly I began to formulate what I still consider the fundamental fact about learning : Anything is easy if you can assimilate it to your collection of models .
If you can't , anything can be painfully difficult .
Here too I was developing a way of thinking that would be resonant with Piaget's .
The understanding of learning must be genetic .
It must refer to the genesis of knowledge .
What an individual can learn , and how he learns it , depends on what models he has available .
This raises , recursively , the question of how he learned these models .
Thus the " laws of learning " must be about how intellectual structures grow out of one another and about how , in the process , they acquire both logical and emotional form .
This book is an exercise in an applied genetic epistemology expanded beyond Piaget 's cognitive emphasis to include a concern with the affective .
It develops a new perspective for education research focused on creating the conditions under which intellectual models will take root .
For the last two decades this is what I have been trying to do .
And in doing so I find myself frequently reminded of several aspects of my encounter with the differential gear .
First , I remember that no one told me to learn about differential gears .
Second , I remember that there was feeling , love , as well as understanding in my relationship with gears .
Third , I remember that my first encounter with them was in my second year .
If any " scientific " educational psychologist had tried to " measure " the effects of this encounter , he would probably have failed .
It had profound consequences but , I conjecture , only very many years later .
A " pre- and post - " test at age two would have missed them .
Piaget 's work gave me a new framework for looking at the gears of my childhood .
The gear can be used to illustrate many powerful " advanced " mathematical ideas , such as groups or relative motion .
But it does more than this .
As well as connecting with the formal knowledge of mathematics , it also connects with the " body knowledge , " the sensorimotor schemata of a child .
You can be the gear , you can understand how it turns by projecting yourself into its place and turning with it .
It is this double relationship --- both abstract and sensory --- that gives the gear the power to carry powerful mathematics into the mind .
In a terminology I shall develop in later chapters , the gear acts here as a transitional object .
A modern - day Montessori might propose , if convinced by my story , to create a gear set for children .
Thus every child might have the experience I had .
But to hope for this would be to miss the essence of the story .
I fell in love with the gears .
This is something that cannot be reduced to purely " cognitive " terms .
Something very personal happened , and one cannot assume that it would be repeated for other children in exactly the same form .
My thesis could be summarized as : What the gears cannot do the computer might .
The computer is the Proteus of machines .
Its essence is its universality , its power to simulate .
Because it can take on a thousand forms and can serve a thousand functions , it can appeal to a thousand tastes .
This book is the result of my own attempts over the past decade to turn computers into instruments flexible enough so that many children can each create for themselves something like what the gears were for me .

Brent Christner , LSU professor of biological sciences , in partnership with colleagues in Montana and France , recently found evidence that rain - making bacteria are widely distributed in the atmosphere .
These biological particles could factor heavily into the precipitation cycle , affecting climate , agricultural productivity and even global warming .
Christner ’s team examined precipitation from global locations and demonstrated that the most active ice nuclei – a substrate that enhances the formation of ice – are biological in origin .
This is important because the formation of ice in clouds is required for snow and most rainfall .
Dust and soot particles can serve as ice nuclei , but biological ice nuclei are capable of catalyzing freezing at much warmer temperatures .
If present in clouds , biological ice nuclei may affect the processes that trigger precipitation .
Cells of ice nucleating bacteria ( green dots ) entrapped in ice crystals .

The concept of rain - making bacteria is n’t far - fetched .
Cloud seeding with silver iodide or dry ice has been done for more than 60 years .
Many ski resorts use a commercially available freeze - dried preparation of ice - nucleating bacteria to make snow when the temperature is just a few degrees below freezing .
“ My colleague David Sands from Montana State University proposed the concept of ‘ bioprecipitation ’ over 25 years ago and few scientists took it seriously , but evidence is beginning to accumulate that supports this idea , ” said Christner .
But , what makes this research more complicated is that most known ice - nucleating bacteria are plant pathogens .
These pathogens , which are basically germs , can cause freezing injury in plants , resulting in devastating economic effects on agricultural crop yields .
“ As is often the case with bacterial pathogens , other phases of their life cycle are frequently ignored because of the focused interest in their role in plant or animal health , ” said Christner .
“ Transport through the atmosphere is a very efficient dissemination strategy , so the ability of a pathogen to affect its precipitation from the atmosphere would be advantageous in finding new hosts . ”
It is possible that the atmosphere represents one facet of the infection cycle , whereby the bacteria infects a plant , multiplies , is aerosolized into the atmosphere and then delivered to a new plant through atmospheric precipitation .
“ The role that biological particles play in atmospheric processes has been largely overlooked .
However , we have found biological ice nuclei in precipitation samples from Antarctica to Louisiana – they ’re ubiquitous .
Our results provide an impetus for atmospheric scientists to start thinking about the role these particles play in precipitation , ” said Christner .
“ This work is truly multi- disciplinary , bridging the disciplines of ecology , microbiology , plant pathology and climatology .
It represents a completely new avenue of research and clearly demonstrates that we are just beginning to understand the intricate interplay between the planet ’s climate and biosphere . ”
Dammit , when is Congress or heaven forbid , a presidential candidate going to get serious about this ?
People on both sides of the isle are fuming about these handouts to the people who have created this recession .
Of course nobody wants to trigger major bank failures but for goodness sakes , we keep giving and are not seeing any signs of cutbacks from Wall Street .
A lot of the taxpayer money is going right back in to help them finance their bonus system and when these people wrap up the year , bonuses will be as high or higher than last year .
It ’s the American public who will be financing those bonuses and guess what they get in return ?
A swift kick in the ass , loss of a job or house and a new demand for tax cuts .
The time to negotiate with this bunch is not two years from now , but now .
Wall Street never hesitates to demand “ what ’s in it for me ? ” and this is exactly what we ought to be asking from them today .
It also makes me wonder why we only see nastiness between Democrats running for President instead of that same aggression against Wall Street and the damned GOP who started this .
How could anyone possibly have faith in a Democratic candidate who can only attack a fellow Democrat and not the owners of this ?
Wall Street borrowing is up 200 % in three weeks and you would never know it by the pathetic doddling in Washington .
It looks like the Democrats are ready to let yet another key issue slip through their fingers .
Magiera said the whole performance was staged Tenor Luciano Pavarotti was miming during his last performance at the winter Olympics in Turin in 2006 .
Conductor Leone Magiera has revealed the singer 's rendition of Nessun Dorma was pre-recorded , as a live performance would have been " too dangerous " .
Pavarotti , who died in September , was already suffering pain months before being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer .
Magiera said : " The orchestra pretended to play , I pretended to conduct and Luciano pretended to sing . "
He added : " It came off beautifully , no one was aware of the technical tricks . "
The revelation came in Magiera 's new book Pavarotti Visto Da Vicino ( Pavarotti Seen From Close Up ) , which was published last month .
Exhausted
He said Pavarotti - with whom he worked for many years - recorded the famous aria from Puccini's Turandot in a studio in his home town of Modena , and the orchestra pre-recorded its part separately .
" His voice was nearly intact , " Magiera recalled in the book .
" He found the strength to repeat it until he was completely satisfied .
Then , he fell back on his wheelchair and closed his eyes , exhausted . "
Terri Robson , Pavarotti's former manager , said the decision to lip - synch was made because of the cold during the outdoor evening event .
Robson said the tenor 's voice was " in great shape ... but because of the extreme late - night temperature in Turin in February , for both him and the orchestra , it was decided that the only way to make it work was for him to pre-record . "
Pavarotti was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the summer of 2006 as he was preparing to leave New York to resume a farewell tour .
He underwent surgery in early July , and his remaining 2006 concerts were cancelled .
Earlier that year he had postponed five dates in June because of what was described as complications from back surgery .

Microsoft 's special Valentine 's Day edition of the Zune ( Red Zune 80 ) is apparently more popular than the company expected .
The Zune Originals creation that was announced just three weeks ago has already been through one announced product delay , but now it looks like Valentine 's Day will come and go with most customers feeling unrequited love .
Today we 've heard from readers who say that Microsoft is mending broken hearts with some TLZ : tender loving Zunage .
Microsoft is e-mailing customers who are on the cusp of not receiving their special Zune orders on time , saying that while they are trying their best to get orders out in time , they might not make it .
Maybe your Valentine wo n't mind , however , because Microsoft says that they are refunding customer 's money , too .

Introduction
After a long break I picked up the Erlang book again and my appetite for writing some erlang code was soon kindled .
A small Python component I produced at work seemed like a good candidate for my ( sequential ) erlang exercises .
It is a fairly simple component that removes user / password data embedded in URLs .
Just so you know where I am coming from :
my main / favourite programming language is Python
my exercises are mainly about sequential , non-distributed and non-telecoms - related problems whereas erlang ’s main strength and appeal lies in the area of parallel / distributed telecoms / networking systems
I have played with erlang a little bit before ( ring benchmark , XML parsing ) and liked it in general although IMHO it lacks severely when it comes to the availability and quality of standard library components .
Now that my particular set of preconceptions is clear and in the open , let ’s look at the stuff below 🙂
File processing with erlang ’s regexp module
The initial implementation of the URL filter in erlang used its regexp library .
1 - module ( regex ) .
2 - export ( [ main / 1 ] ) . 3 4 isalphanum ( C ) when C > 47 , C < 58 ; C > 64 , C < 91 ; C > 96 , C < 123 -> true ; 5 isalphanum ( _ ) -> false .
6 7 %% Generate a temporary file name of length N 8 genname ( 0 , L ) -> L ; 9 genname( N , L ) -> 10 R = random : uniform ( 123 ) , 11 case isalphanum ( R ) of 12 true -> genname ( N - 1 , [ R|L ] ) ; 13 false -> genname ( N , L ) 14 end .
15 16 %% Returns a randomly generated temporary file path where the basename is 17 % % of length N 18 mktemppath ( Prefix , N ) -> Prefix ++ " / " ++ genname ( N , [ ] ) .
19
Please note how I had to implement functionality absent from the standard library above .
20 % % Removes passwords embedded in URLs from a log file .
21 scrub_file ( Tmpdir , F ) -> 22 % % make a temporary directory if it does not exist yet .
23 case file : make _ dir ( Tmpdir ) of 24 ok -> ok ; 25 {error , eexist} -> ok ; 26 _ -> exit ( {error , failed_to_make_tmpdir} ) 27 end , 28 29 % %
Move the original file out of the way .
30 T = mktemppath ( Tmpdir , 16 ) , 31 case file : rename ( F , T ) of 32 ok -> ok ; 33 _ -> exit ( {error , failed_to_move_file} ) 34 end , 35 36 % % Now open it for reading .
37 { _ , In} = file : open ( [ T ] , read ) , 38 % % Open the original path for writing .
39 { _ , Out} = file : open ( [ F ] , write ) , 40 41 % % Call the function that will scrub the lines .
42 scrub_lines ( In , Out ) , 43 44 % %
Close the file handles and return the path to the original file .
45 file : close ( Out ) , 46 file : close ( In ) , 47 T . 48
The code that scrubs the URLs is below , the scrub_lines ( ) function is tail recursive .
49 %%
This is where the log file is actually read linewise and where 50 % % the scrubbing function is invoked for lines that contain URLs.
51 scrub_lines ( In , Out ) -> 52 L = io : get _ line ( In , '' ) , 53 case L of 54 eof -> ok ; 55 _ -> 56 % %
Does the line contain URLs ?
57 case string : str ( L , " :// " ) of 58 0 -> io : format ( Out , " ~s " , [ L ] ) ; 59 _ -> 60 case regexp : gsub ( L , " ://[^ : ]+:[ ^@ ] +@ " , " :// " ) of 61 {ok , S , _ } -> io : format ( Out , " ~s " , [ S ] ) ; 62 {R , S , _ } -> io : format ( " Failed : { ~p , ~p } " , [ R, S ] ) 63 end 64 end , 65 % % Continue with next line .
66 scrub_lines ( In , Out ) 67 end .
68 69 % % Main function . 70 main ( [ A ] ) -> 71 { A1, A2,A3} = now ( ) , 72 random : seed ( A1 , A2 , A3 ) , 73 74 %%
A single argument ( the name of the file to be scrubbed ) is expected .
75 F = atom_to_list ( A ) , 76 T = scrub_file ( " tmp " , F ) , 77 78 %%
The scrubbed file content will be written to a new file that 's 79 % % in the place of the original file .
Where was the latter moved to ?
80 io : format ( " ~ s~n " , [ T ] ) , 81 82 init : stop ( ) .
The cursory benchmarks performed ( on log files of varying size ) using the python and the erlang code confirmed other people ’s experiences with erlang ’s regex performance ( but see also this interesting “ rebuttal ” ) .
Log file size Python times Erlang times 1 MB 0m0.230s 0m1.896s 10 MB 0m1.510s 0m8.766s 100 MB
0m14.793s 1m17.662s 1 GB 2m55.012s 13m54.588s
The do - it - yourself construction
Curious to learn whether the performance can be improved by abstaining from regular expressions I came up with an alternative implementation that does not use regexp .
As you can see below the do - it - yourself construction is indeed performing slightly better at the expense of being very specialized and requiring 60 % more code .
Log file size Python times Erlang regexp Erlang do - it - yourself 1 MB 0m0.230s 0m1.896s 0m1.969s 10 MB 0m1.510s 0m8.766s 0m8.459s 100 MB
0m14.793s 1m17.662s 1m12.448s 1 GB 2m55.012s 13m54.588s 13m3.360s
In conclusion
Every couple of months or so I develop a euphoria towards erlang which is consistently dampened by using the language to tackle problems for which the language admittedly was not designed in first place .
I guess most people start using a language for simple programming exercises first as opposed to building something like a Jabber / XMPP instant messaging server straightaway .
I hate to repeat myself but improving the standard library ( by adding common functionality and making sure it performs decently ) would do a lot to attract fresh talent to the erlang community and I hear that a certain rate of influx of “ fresh blood ” is a necessary prerequisite for success .
Ah , and no , you were not supposed to grok the sentence above unless you read it three times 🙂
By Mark O’Neill
A university professor who is dying of cancer and whose “ Last Lecture ” became a viral sensation on YouTube is now seeing that lecture become number one on online bestseller lists .
Randy Pausch , a computer - science professor from Carnegie Mellon University , is dying from pancreatic cancer and at the time of his lecture last year , he was expected to live for only a few months .
But ironically enough , he is still alive today , having had the immense strength and fortitude to fight the illness .
He was invited to Carnegie Mellon last year to give a “ last lecture ” .
Other people have done this and for them , it was a hypothetical exercise .
For Professor Pausch however , with time rapidly running out , it was definately not hypothetical .
He gave the best line ever which cracked up the audience : “ I ’ve experienced a deathbed conversion : I bought a Macintosh ! ”
His lecture is all about perserverence and not giving up .
It was a moving speech and it was taped for his very young kids so they can watch their dad when they are older and when he ’s not around anymore .
At the end , a birthday cake was rolled out for his wife , whose birthday was the previous day .
At this point , I lost it completely and I was bawling my eyes out .
And now he has turned the whole lecture into a book called “ The Last Lecture “ .
He ’s appeared on Oprah ( of course ) and he ’s now a superstar .
And here is the lecture that started it all :
WEED .
We need only one syllable to differentiate friend from foe in our gardens .
Yet the word seems inadequate for a new generation of weeds -- plants that we find beautiful or delicious when we cultivate them but that have escaped into the wild to potentially catastrophic effect .
No single source tells the story of the shifting definition quite so methodically as “ Weeds of California and Other Western States . ”
When UC Davis weed scientist Joseph M. DiTomaso published the two volumes in 2007 , they included more than 700 specimens , just about every plant that has stung , inconvenienced or merely displeased people this side of the Rockies .
There in the 1,800 - plus - page rogues ’ gallery , many of our classiest nursery salads and ornamentals have rap sheets .
Nasturtiums , weeds ?
Ice plant ?
A weed ?
The longer one spends with the new directory , the clearer the modern message about weeds becomes .
The emphasis is no longer on what wild plants are doing to our gardens but what our gardens are doing to the wild .
For lack of a better term , this new class of super weed is called an “ invasive . ”
Grammarians , cringe and get over it .
“ Invasive ” has become a noun .
It ’s for the lovely and luminous green shrub tamarisk , aka saltcedar , now sucking the Colorado River dry .
It ’s for Arundo donax , or giant reed , the bamboo - like hedging plant now clogging Southern California waterways and destroying vital wetland wildlife habitat .
It ’s for the English and Algerian ivy slowly suffocating our pine forests , the blue - gum eucalyptus whose resinous limbs add explosive fuel to fire zones , and the ice plant choking sand dunes where native plovers can no longer nest .
Advertisement
If it sounds grim , it is , but nobody ’s blaming us .
The nursery trade unleashed many of these plants before it or we knew better .
Pampas grass now lining much of the Pacific Coast Highway is a perfect example , DiTomaso says .
Introduced by a Santa Barbara nursery in 1848 , it seemed containable .
When commercial production began in 1874 , the plants were propagated by dividing them at the root , and only females were selected for their superior plumes .
“ To simplify the process , they turned to seeds and planted the seeds and sold plants as tufts before they flowered , so they did not know if they were males or females , ” DiTomaso says .
“ Males got out in the environment and boom , within about 15 years , the plant became an invasive problem .
We actually had the solution , but we did n’t stick with it . ”
According to Drew Ready , program manager for the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers Watershed Council , pampas grass is now one of the worst offenders , destroying vital bird and marine habitat in Southern California ’s most sensitive wetlands .
Yikes .
We just liked the wavy plumes .

The surprising thing is that the runaway fancies causing problems in the garden -- say , the passion vine that becomes 300 vines -- are not necessarily the most wanted of invasives , at least here in California .
( Passion vine is a nightmare in Hawaii . )
Some of the most common garden weeds of the Los Angeles area , many of them lawn grasses , could n’t cope in the wild .
Rather , we enable them by frequent tillage and chronic overwatering .
But where water - hungry and shade - loving garden plants do escape into the wild , the consequences are devastating , according to Christy Brigham , a restoration ecologist working in the Santa Monica Mountains for the National Park Service .
“ It ’s so dry here , those creek habitats are hugely important , ” she says .
“ So , for instance , hummingbird sage is a beautiful native that would grow in cool wet areas , especially in Solstice Canyon .
Instead , those areas are full of periwinkle and nasturtiums .
“ In Solstice Canyon , we ’re trying to reintroduce steelhead trout .
They need a native plant community to generate the insects to feed the trout .
Instead , right now they have periwinkle and nasturtiums . ”

Brigham ’s eyes do not light up at the sight of fountain grass fluttering in the breeze along our roads .
“ It offers wildlife none of the forage of the native sunflowers that it displaces , ” she says .
“ What ’s more , it ’s not particularly good at stabilizing slopes . ”
If you have a stand that you wish would invade your garden but that has refused , do not doubt the invasive nature of the species .
There are two types of fountain grass , or Pennisetum setaceum , commonly found around Los Angeles .
One , ‘ Rubrum , ’ is sterile .
The other is anything but , and to judge by the number of runaways choking Southern California coasts and grasslands , even nurseries are not rigorous about which is which .
Rather than stand back and let the state ’s exquisite native plants give way to a hodgepodge of escaped ornamentals with little or no wildlife value , the Bay Area nonprofit Sustainable Conservation began pulling together concerned parties four years ago to look at the options .

Representatives from the UC Davis Arboretum , Nature Conservancy , California Farm Bureau , California Native Plant Society , Huntington Botanical Gardens , California Department of Food and Agriculture and California Assn. of Nurseries and Garden Centers gathered around a table , and soon an umbrella group was formed called PlantRight .
As a first step , PlantRight enlisted master gardeners to scour nurseries to see which invasives were being sold , then began asking the stores and growers to work with them to get the offenders off the shelves in sensitive regions .
THE benefit of this , DiTomaso says , is that regional solutions are crucial .
Although ice plants are destructive in a coastal dune setting , they ’re a water - wise and fire - resistant ground cover for inland gardens .
So a surgical approach to targeting the offenders was needed .
Nicholas Staddon , director of new plant introductions for Monrovia Growers , agrees .
Monrovia was one of the first backers of PlantRight , and although his company still grows and sells invasives , he says , it ’s working hard and in earnest to keep them off store shelves in sensitive areas .
Give nurseries terms they can work with and they ’ll buy in , adds Terri Kempton , PlantRight manager for Sustainable Conservation .

Now the group is focusing on big - box stores .
Lowe ’s confirms that it is beginning the exhaustive and complicated process of inventorying its stock , pulling offending plants and retraining its growers .
Skeptics need only point out the nasturtium seeds for sale in just about every garden center in Southern California , and PlantRight can seem toothless and wishful .
Still , a start is a start , and as a start , PlantRight is exceptionally well organized .
A newly revamped website , www.plantright.org, allows gardeners to click on their region and look for local solutions .
The beauty of having botanists and skilled gardeners behind the effort is that consumers are not in for a scolding .
For every “ do n’t , ” there are two or more “ do’s . ”
Giant reed is discouraged , but clumping bamboo and New Zealand flax are recommended .
Fountain grass is discouraged , but blue oat grass , deer grass and sedges are offered as alternatives .
What Kempton likes about the program is that it gives gardeners a chance to do the right thing while doing the fun thing : buying interesting new plants .

Once the nursery trade wakes up to the commercial potential of selling those new plants , more stores might begin weeding their shelves in earnest .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - U.S. immigration officials denied author Sebastian Horsley entrance to the United States on Wednesday on the grounds of “ moral turpitude ” , Horsley told Reuters on Thursday .
An undated image of the cover of Sebastian Horseley 's " Dandy in the Underworld " , released to Reuters on March 20 , 2008 .
REUTERS /HarperCollins / Handout
Tired from his return trip to London and eight hours of detention with U.S. customs officials , the 45 - year - old artist and author of the lurid autobiography of drug addiction and sex “ Dandy in the Underworld ” , admitted that his flamboyant dress and top hat may have caught the attention of U.S. officials .
“ I was wearing my dandy uniform , but the customs officials were wearing uniforms too and I did n’t object to them , ” he said .
Horsley was stopped by immigration officials at New York ’s Newark airport after flying in from London to promote his book , which the author calls a “ moral book ” .
“ They said I was suffering from moral turpitude , ” Horsley said .
“ I was very surprised .
I ’m feeling quite well .
I ’ve never drunk turpentine in my life . ”
Horsley claims to have slept with more than 1,000 prostitutes , worked as a male escort , been in and out of rehab to treat drug addiction and staged a self - crucifixion in the Philippines in 2000 .
“ He is very honest about his life .
That is who Sebastian is , ” said Seale Ballenger , spokesman for HarperCollins Publishers .
Ballenger said a party in New York that was meant to be the U.S. launch for the book , ended up being a rally for support to bring the author back to the United States .
Horsley said that after several hours of questioning in which customs officials asked him whether he used drugs , had solicited prostitutes or been convicted of any crimes , he was put on a plane back to London .
“ God bless America , land of the free , but sadly not the home of the depraved , ” he said .
No one from the New York office of United States Customs and Border Protection was immediately available to comment .
The New York Times quoted a customs spokeswoman , Lucille Cirillo , as saying she could not comment on individual cases .
But in an e-mail to the newspaper she explained that under a waiver program that allows British citizens to enter the United States without a visa , “ travellers who have been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude ( which includes controlled - substance violations ) or admit to previously having a drug addiction are not admissible . ”
Publisher Carrie Kania , from the HarperCollins ’ unit Harper Perennial that published the book in the United States , said she found it hard to understand why Horsley would be denied entrance into the United States for “ his notoriety . ”
“ It is unfortunate that his voice , in person , is being stifled , ” she said in a statement .
“ Sebastian has written a cautionary tale of a life lived vividly ... an unapologetic , honest , funny and torturous book .
Sebastian ’s memoir is about choice , some conventional , some unconventional . ”
Horsley ’s memoir was published last September in Britain with reviewers calling it both amusing and revolting .
French designers have created an " iconic language " to help doctors properly prescribe medications based on road sign designs .
The researchers translated the boring text on common ailments and treatments from drug monographs into a series of cartoons that , when combined with simple operators , allow your doctor , literate or not , to correctly dole out the meds .
The work , published in the open- access journal BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making , is available to all , including the dictionary and reference manual ( pdf ) .
Amazingly , the researchers reported that within seven hours of training on the system , a test group of doctors answered hypothetical questions about drug treatments correctly more often using the icons than the text .
And they answered almost twice as quickly when they used the images .
Some icons describe a state of being ( elderly , female ) , others a disease ( malaria ) , and still more treatments ( anti- fungal drug ) .
Simple arrows placed between the icons allow you to put together simple sentences like this :
Read : if an elderly patient presents with impotence , then prescribe erectile dysfunction drugs .
But , this is the Internet , and you do n't need or want seven hours of training .
What you need is a Reddit widget that allows you to play with , rename , and create stories out of these icons yourself .
After the jump , there 's a selection of twenty - five pictographs we clipped from the researchers ' dictionary with the real definitions attached .
Remix and post as you see fit .
You can download each icon above individually and create your own iconographic drug treatment recommendations .
Make sure to include its translation into text , too .

Everyone remembers ICQ , the first widely - used instant messaging application that 's all but dead in most of the world now .
The Israeli software company that developed the suite before it was purchased by AOL has just partnered with a big Israeli pharmacy company called CTS to release this ICQ toothpaste , which our tipster claims will " help P2P communication ( person to person ) while reducing bad breath . "
Weird , yet really really cool .
On a related note , I 've got a low six - digit ICQ number .
How long is yours ?

MOORESTOWN , NJ — A South Jersey police officer , in jail after being accused of molesting three children , was charged yesterday with four counts of animal cruelty for having sex with barnyard animals , authorities said .
Patrolman Robert Melia , 38 , was suspended last week by the Moorestown Police department after authorities raided his Moorestown home and seized a computer and pornographic materials .
The animal cruelty charges were filed after an examination of the seized materials , authorities said .
An investigation is continuing .
Police said they were investigating four incidents involving cows .
Melia and Pemberton filmmaker Heather Lewis , 32 , were charged April 13 with the sexual assaults of three girls at Melia ’s house .
The assaults occured on multiple occasions during the last five years , said a spokesman for the Burlington County Prosecutor ’s office said .
Melia is being held on $ 510,000 bail at the Burlington County Jail in Mount Holly .
Lewis , who is charged with aggravated sexual assault and criminal sexual contact , is being held on $ 300,000 bail at the Women ’s Detention Center in Pemberton .

The gap between what Americans import and export unexpectedly widened in February as domestic demand rose for automobiles and fell back for crude oil .
The trade deficit grew 5.7 percent , to $ 62.3 billion , its highest reading since November and the second consecutive month of increases .
The estimate for January was revised up to $ 59 billion from $ 58.2 billion , the Commerce Department said on Thursday .
The increase came as a surprise to economists who had expected the economic downturn to suppress domestic demand for foreign goods .
Instead , import sales jumped 3.1 percent , the biggest gain in almost a year , to $ 213.7 billion from a revised $ 207.3 billion in January .
Americans bought up more foreign motor vehicles , pharmaceutical products and computer equipment in February .
The appetite for foreign goods even outpaced the first decline in oil imports in nearly a year .
Foreign petroleum sales dipped 1.6 percent in February , though the figure will probably climb back in March , when the price of crude oil reached a record high .
The USS Cole is n’t engaged in a sightseeing tour of the Eastern Mediterranean : its sudden deployment just “ over the horizon ” near Lebanon  in tandem with two other warships  is a clear sign that the Americans are preparing for something big .
That ’s what the Arab world seems to believe , anyway , if you listen to al - Jazeera and the chatter coming from other Arab news outlets .
The Saudis , the Kuwaitis , and the government of Bahrain have all warned their citizens to get out of Lebanon , pronto .
What ’s curious , however , is that , while it ’s big news in the Arab world , this “ visit ” by a guided - missile destroyer and accompanying flotilla has received scant attention in the U.S. news media .
What ’s going on ?
Well , it depends on what U.S. government spokesman is speaking on what day : “ I would not specifically relate this to any kind of events in Lebanon or any place else , ” said State Department spokesman Tom Casey on Friday .
However , according to White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe , it is “ a show of support for regional stability . ”
Responding to the accusations of Hezbollah , the Muslim resistance organization that sits in the Lebanese parliament , that this amounts to interference in Lebanon ’s internal political affairs , Johndroe averred : “ I would express some of our own concerns with Hezbollah ’s actions . ”
These actions consist of opposing the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora , which has locked the opposition out of all governmental decisions , and essentially defending the country against the Israelis during the 30 - Day War .
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Michael Mullen , was a bit blunter , responding to the question of whether the Cole was showing the flag off the Lebanese coast in order to influence the outcome of elections scheduled for March 11 : “ To say it is absolutely tied would be incorrect , although certainly we are aware elections are due there at some point in time . ”
Those elections have already been postponed on no less than 15 occasions , and no one is betting that they ’ll come off this time  although that is certainly the result desired by the U.S. Department of State .
The idea is that the poll will strengthen the Siniora government and lay Hezbollah low , but this latest move  a provocation , really  is almost guaranteed to have the opposite effect .
So much so that Siniora was forced to distance himself from the Americans , denying that the ships were in Lebanon ’s territorial waters and declaring that his government did “ not ask anyone to send warships . ”
Everyone knows which government asked Washington for the warships : the same one that is now slaughtering children in Gaza and has threatened the besieged city with an Arab holocaust , the government whose deputy defense minister recently warned that the response to continued rocket attacks would be a Palestinian “ shoah . ”
The Palestinians , he brayed on state radio , are “ bringing upon themselves a greater shoah because we will use all our strength in every way we deem appropriate , whether in air strikes or on the ground . ”
The Lobby ‘s line is that the whole thing is a misunderstanding based on a mistranslation .
National Review‘s Tom Gross espies a radical difference between “ a shoah ” and “ the Shoah . ”
“ It is like confusing a ‘ white house ’ with ‘ The White House , ' ” he writes  and furthermore , this was no innocent mistake .
The whole brouhaha , in his considered opinion , is evidence of an anti-Semitic conspiracy by major American news organizations .
Such an interpretation can only succeed , however , if we wear the special blinders that the Lobby would have us don , which blank out the context in which this rhetoric is being uttered .
The use of the word “ shoah ” against the backdrop of a major military operation in Gaza  one that seems to be escalating in ferocity  amounts to the very real threat of genocide .
Any alternative explanation seems on the same factual and moral plane as garden - variety Holocaust denial .
If , God forbid , the Israelis ever carry out their deputy defense minister ’s threat , these folks will morph into little David Irvings , busily spinning out heavily footnoted disquisitions on why it never happened .
Gaza , however , is just one prong in the U.S. - Israeli “ surge . ”
The main immediate target is Syria , not Gaza or Lebanon  and , standing behind them , Iran .
The Americans and their Israeli allies have tried every sort of provocation to stir the Lebanese pot and lure the Syrians back into Lebanon , where a proxy war is brewing .
With the Americans supplying cover by sea and air , the IDF may get revenge for its ignominious defeat in the 30 - Day War by taking out Hezbollah once and for all , and then hitting Damascus  or so the most optimistic scenario would have it .
The USS Cole and accompanying warships are not merely making a strong gesture ; they have also effectively blockaded the Lebanese coast and will surely be intercepting any arms coming from Turkey or elsewhere , readying the battleground for the Israeli incursion .
The first stages of the coming conflict with Iran will be fought as a proxy war in Lebanon against Hezbollah and Syria , as anticipated in this space on at least one occasion .
In terms of predictive ability , however , my prognosis was hardly Nostradamus - like .
After all , the Israelis and their American sympathizers long ago set down in writing , and in plain English , the plan to do just what they are now doing .
One need only consult “ A Clean Break : A New Strategy for Securing the Realm , ” written in 1996 by an influential group of future Bush administration officials as advice for then - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , to make sense of recent U.S. - Israeli war moves .
While “ A Clean Break ” famously laid out a strategic rationale for deposing Saddam Hussein , it also offered a blueprint for “ securing the northern border ” that parallels what is happening and has been happening since the launching of the 30 - Day War :
“ Syria challenges Israel on Lebanese soil .
An effective approach , and one with which Americans can sympathize , would be if Israel seized the strategic initiative along its northern borders by engaging Hizballah , Syria , and Iran , as the principal agents of aggression in Lebanon , including by : [ 1 ] paralleling Syria ’s behavior by establishing the precedent that Syrian territory is not immune to attacks emanating from Lebanon by Israeli proxy forces , [ 2 ] striking Syrian military targets in Lebanon , and should that prove insufficient , striking at select targets in Syria proper . ”
That ’s what ’s on the agenda of the radical Likud wing of the Israeli ruling elite , as represented in America as well as in Israel .
The dogs of war are straining at the leash .
The War Party has never been shy about proclaiming its intentions .
If only its ostensible opponents were half as bold .
Yet we hear nothing  nothing  from either Barack Obama ( or Hillary “ Bring Them Home ” Clinton ) about the most significant and ominous American military mobilization since U.S. warships engaged in a massive show of force off the Iranian coast around this time last year .
Of course , we do n’t have to ask John McCain where he stands on this deployment : he ’s for it .
What the sudden outbreak of a major war in the Middle East will do for McCain ’s presidential prospects  currently rather dim  is a factor that is undoubtedly being considered by this White House .
Both Obama and Clinton have been mum on the Gaza shoah , and the coming storm in Lebanon seems not to have fazed them .
Clinton can be relied on to keep her mouth shut , what with her support from the hawkish wing of the party .
What we do know about Obama is that he , like Hillary , supported the Israeli invasion of Lebanon , albeit not with a degree of enthusiasm sufficient to impress the Lobby .
However , if that invasion was okay , then why not the Gaza sweep ?
And why not invade Lebanon again ?
According to the logic of Obama ’s past positions , one would expect him to hop aboard the “ Clean Break ” express and ride it all the way to World War III ( or is that IV ? ) .
But I guess we wo n’t know until war breaks out and he gets that 3 a.m. call  from his campaign manager .
None of this is inevitable , of course .
We do n’t have to wind up in a proxy war with Iran in the Levant , a conflict that could escalate until the entire region is aflame .
Public pressure on Congress to hold hearings regarding the looming Lebanon intervention , including an inquiry into U.S. covert meddling in Lebanon ’s internal politics , would focus attention on the issue .
We also need to pressure the candidates to at least issue statements on this rapidly developing situation .
I suppose we ’ll have to wait until the media declares this an official “ crisis , ” but by that time the shooting will have already started  far too late to do anything about it .
Which suits Obama and Clinton just fine  and , ultimately , serves McCain best of all .
The very best thing about Barack Obama / No , not that .
Or that or that or that .
It 's that other thing , deeper , crazier , intuitive
Nope , it 's not what you might think .
The best thing about Barack Obama has almost nothing to do with him as a person or as a leader or even as Oh My God The First Black President Who Could Really Change Everything I Mean Wow .
It 's not even the wondrous oratory power or the charisma or the sweet sense of deeper change overlaid with all kinds of sparkly utopian futuriffic goodness .
There is , I think , something more .
Something richer .
And it 's rather startling .
See , I 've read the profiles and the liberal fawnings and the intelligent analysis , the attempted takedowns and the right - wing smears , all the valiant attempts to dig up something dirty or problematic or frightening about Obama and his family , his past , his middle name , his beliefs and his pastor and his favorite flavor of ice cream — attempts that , rather amusingly , have all failed .
I 've read , too , the glut of wonderment , how Obama is this generation 's JFK , how he makes Hillary Clinton 's brand of retro cronyist politics feel like the equivalent of rubbing salt on a paper cut .
He is , they say , that once - in - a - lifetime candidate , a fantastically rare mix of intelligence , consistency , inspiration , hope , charisma , humanity , articulation , and an almost shocking lack of manipulation and sheen ( well , relatively speaking ) , all packaged in a strikingly handsome unit in whose closet apparently live almost no skeletons at all .
I also nodded in agreement when snark - master Jon Stewart appeared slightly stunned and taken aback and very nearly jokeless as he pointed out , following Obama 's remarkable speech on race in America , that at long last , here was a top - tier politician who dared to speak to us like we were adults .
It was n't just refreshing ; after seven - plus years of humiliating , monosyllabic dumb - guy Bushisms , it was downright jarring .
And I even enjoyed the overall assessment that the fact that Obama is untested and inexperienced in the higher and more dire realms of government is actually a good thing , just the kind of wild card we crave and need , given how he shows absolutely zero signs that he'd screw it up , not to mention how the last thing anyone really wants is more of the same old - school , inbred crap we 've had for decades .
Still , this was n't what riveted me the most about Obama , still not what 's most fascinating about this moment in political history .
It was still something more .
Initially I thought the most impressive aspect of Obama 's run was , well , how the guy made it this far at all .
That someone of his caliber and obvious intelligence could survive what has become a truly caustic , brutal political system and still emerge into the international spotlight as , well , not deeply f—ed - up and insane , not possessing that creepy demonic gleam shared by so many politicos ( hi , Sen. McCain ! ) that suggests they 've had souls eaten whole by the same scabrous trolls of greed and war and corruption that birthed two Bushes and gave Bill Clinton that nearly intolerable aura of ego and slickness .
See , I 've long believed that , if nearly eight years of the World 's Worst President has taught us anything , it's that the American political system has moved well beyond merely deeply flawed and broken and sad , and is now wholly rotted , ruined from the inside out , a true moral wasteland barely suitable even for cockroaches and leeches and Rick Santorum .
I thought George W. Bush had actually managed to do the impossible : make an already defective system truly unbearable , turning something already gray and murky to turgid and pathetic , toxic to all decent human life .
And I 'm happy to report that the fact that Obama exists at this stage of the game is proving me very wrong indeed .
But I 'll even take it a step further .
Because the greatest thing about Obama is n't really about Obama at all , per se .
It 's actually about , well , us .
This is the great revelation :
We still got it .
The collective unconscious , the deep sense of inner wisdom , that intuitive knowing that borders on a kind of mystical proficiency , where millions of people can actually look beyond rhetoric and media spin and merely feel the presence of something great in the room ?
Yep , still there .
Who knew ?
See , this is what I hear most from relatives and readers and friends and newborn activists who were never activists before : Obama speaks to the intuition .
It 's about the sixth sense .
It 's not just what he says or how he behaves in the debates or the policy wonking or the " Change " banners or any of the typical , tangible factors — although those have proven to be remarkably positive , too .
It 's this : People feel it .
They hear an Obama speech or read the articles or talk to like - minded folk , and they squint their eyes and weigh everything and then dismiss all that surface crap and get that look on their face that says , you know what ?
This guy gets it .
He feels right .
It 's not a trick of light .
It 's not complete bulls — .
It 's not the usual spin and manipulation and fakery .
There is actual meat on this bone .
What a thing .
Of course , I 've plenty of readers who are die - hard cynics and jaded anarchists who say :
What the f— is wrong with you ?
Ca n't you see it 's just another vicious ploy ?
All candidates at this level are essentially the same , interchangeable , all abhorrent simply by default because when you reach that stage of the game there is simply no way to avoid deep corruption and rampant lies .
They tell me that even just to write a column like this is akin to merely washing the windows in your little pod in " The Matrix . "
Sure , the world may seem shinier , but you 're still just buying into the same old revolting corporate / military machine .
After all , once the vipers of big money and big oil and military spending and corporate cronyism get their fangs sunk in , it 's pretty much " game over " for any candidate 's remaining integrity .
Has Mr. Perfect Obama spoken out against the insidious Patriot Act or taken on the absurd farm subsidies or talked up issues of global warming ?
No he has not .
As nice and smart as he may be , strip away all the fawning and the oratory tricks and give him a year in office and boom , just another corrupted , compromised former visionary .
Right ?
Whatever .
I 'm not buying it .
At least , not yet .
For the moment , I trust the collective intuition .
I trust the shockingly widespread sense , not merely of hope and change , but of collective wisdom swimming though the air like an electrical surge between every smart , creative person on the planet right now , a bolt of energy that says :
Hey , we 're still together .
We still got it .
Smart , intuitive people are still a force .
There is life in the revolution yet .
And Obama ?
He gets it , too .
Hell , he may have kindled it anew , all by himself .
Either way , it 's back .
And it 's powerful .
And that , to me , is the most hopeful thing of all .

One of the dismal hallmarks of the Bush administration ’s conduct of the war on terror has been its obsession with avoiding outside scrutiny of its actions , including by the federal courts .
In particular , it has attacked habeas corpus , the guarantee that prisoners can challenge their confinement before a judge .
The administration is doing so again in an important Supreme Court case concerning the habeas rights of American citizens held abroad .
The justices should rule that the detainees have a right to review by a United States court .
The two plaintiffs in the case , which was argued in March , are American civilians in Iraq .
Shawqi Ahmad Omar and Mohammad Munaf are being held at an Army - run detention center in Baghdad , for transfer to the Iraqis on criminal charges .
Mr. Munaf ’s conviction on kidnapping charges was overturned , but he may face further charges .
Mr. Omar was captured by the American military at his home in Baghdad , and was accused of harboring insurgent fighters .
Both men claim to be innocent .
Human rights groups warn that they could face torture if they are transferred to Iraqi custody .
Mr. Omar and Mr. Munaf are asking a federal court to review their confinement .
Just four years ago , the Supreme Court upheld the habeas rights of an American citizen , Yaser Hamdi , who was captured by the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan in 2001 , and then imprisoned in Navy brigs in the United States .
The Hamdi decision should settle this case .
To get around this recent precedent , the administration claims that the men are beyond the reach of American courts because the troops holding them are part of a multinational force authorized by the United Nations .
The administration is relying on a Supreme Court ruling from 1948 , Hirota v. MacArthur , that rejected habeas corpus petitions from Japanese prisoners who were being held in Japan under the authority of the Allied Supreme Commander there , Gen. Douglas MacArthur .

It is unfortunate that the Supreme Court , in its ruling this week that U.S. currency is unfair to the blind , did not make the next logical step and declare it unfair to everyone who buys gasoline .
In their search for explanations as to why oil has surged past $ 130 per barrel , Washington , Wall Street , and the financial media are as clueless as cavemen after a freak summer snow storm .
Despite the head scratching , the blame game is nevertheless in full force .
Speculators and big oil companies are being trotted out as scapegoats , and increased margin requirements and taxes on windfall profits and futures trading have been mentioned as appropriate sanctions .
It should be clear that this is pure farce , and that no one understands what is actually happening .
The reality is that after years of reckless consumption and dollar debasement , Americans are now being priced out of markets over which they formerly held unchallenged title .
As more affluent foreigners consume more of the resources and products they previously supplied to us , Americans are being forced to cut back .
The rising dollar - based price of gasoline is simply an illustration of this global trend .
Poorly concealed behind contrived government statistics , the signs of America �s falling standard of living are everywhere ; all one has to do is look .
We are unloading SUVs for less desirable compacts , and are paying more to fly on crowded planes ( where we pay to check luggage and dine only on what we bring onboard ) .
We drink our lattes at McDonalds or not at all , and we increasingly forego dining out , trips to the mall , and vacations , just so we can scrape together enough to fill our gas tanks and kitchen pantries , pay taxes and insurance , or make credit card , mortgage or car payments .
The collective belt tightening is simply the down payment on the Government�s massive bailout of Wall Street investment banks and mortgage lenders .
As the Fed creates money to buy bad mortgages and other shaky securities held by banks and brokerage firms , the value of the savings and wages of everyone on Main Street will continue to fall .
As a result , the costs of products previously taken for granted have begun to bite .
The various housing bills and stimulus packages now passing through Congress will add significantly to the staggering final price tag .
In the end , the �free lunch � currently being dished out by Washington will be the most expensive meal ever served .
The cost will be borne by ordinary Americans citizens every time they open their wallets .
Four dollar gasoline is just the beginning .
For all the talk of increased global demand , few seem to understand from where it actually comes .
The surge in global demand is both a function of the increased purchasing power of foreign currencies and the fact that foreigners are choosing to spend more of their incomes themselves .
In other words Greenspan�s famous �global savings glut� is turning into a global consumption binge , with Americans unable to crash the party .
This trend will only get worse as the dollar - denominated price of just about everything that is either imported , or capable of being exported , goes through the roof .
We can look for scapegoats all we want but the simply fact is Americans are going to have to get used to a much lower standard of living .
Those who have been putting all the food on our tables are finally pulling up chairs themselves .

For the new institution , the king has hired the state - owned oil giant Saudi Aramco to build the campus .
Credit ... Bryan Denton for The New York Times
Festivities at the construction site on Sunday for 1,500 dignitaries included a laser light show and a mockup of the planned campus that filled an entire room .
The king laid a crystal cornerstone into a stainless steel shaft on wheels .
Cranes tore out mangroves and pounded the swampland with 20 - ton blocks into a surface firm enough to build the campus on .
Inside a tent , the king , his honor guard wearing flowing robes and curved daggers , and an array of Aramco officials in suits took to a shiny stage lighted with green and blue neon tubing , like an MTV awards show .
Mist from dry ice shrouded the stage , music blared in surround sound , and holographic projections served as a backdrop to some of the speeches .
From a laconic monarch known for his austerity , the pomp , along with a rare speech by the king himself , was intended to send a strong signal , according to the team charged with building and staffing the new campus within two years .
The king is lavishing the institution not only with money , but also with his full political endorsement , intended to stave off internal challenges from conservatives and to win over foreign scholars who doubt that academic freedom can thrive here .
The new project is giving hope to Saudi scholars who until the king ’s push to reform education in the last few years have endured stagnant research budgets and continue to face extensive government red tape .
“ Because Aramco is founding the university , I believe it will have freedom , ” said Abdulmalik A. Aljinaidi , dean of the research and consultation institute at King Abdulaziz University , Jidda ’s biggest , with more than 40,000 students .
“ For Kaust to succeed , it will have to be free of all the restrictions and bureaucracy we face as a public university . ”

You may think it a strange statement at first — but there is little to no doubt that the next war will pay for itself .
It is just as true that the present unlawful , undeclared wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will pay for themselves .
War pays !
That ’s one reason it ’s so damned popular .
The question is not whether wars pay for themselves .
The bills of war get paid —
All of the bills plus Interest and Penalties .
In fact , the initial cost is only part of the picture .
You can bet those who make it their profession to make big money on big wars will continue to get paid very well .
In fact , we have a surplus of " patriotic " contractors in our own country who would give their right arm [ not literally of course ] to get the next big juicy contract to build and rebuild and rebuild the same infrastructure in Iraq .
They seem to salivate over such things .
Business is slow at home in their native land .
I doubt very much that they can be disturbed by ethical nuances .
And who can blame them ?
They did n’t start the war .
Their clients , customers and cronies did .
Hopefully they will make enough to keep up their commitments for political contributions .
The long - term profits of war are Not Unintended Consequences !
If you make gunpowder , what sort of human activity increases your bottom line more than any other ?
Certainly not target practice in a nation that is questioning the wisdom of the Second Amendment .
What about Cruise Missiles ?
Bombers ?
Bombs ?
Bullets ?
Battleships ?
Tanks ?
Prosthetic Limbs ?
Body Bags ?
Coffins ?
Memorials ?
Graveyards ?
Medals ?
The list goes on .
It is precious little consolation to consider economy of scale regarding the manufacture of prosthetic limbs .
But they are getting better .
Americans have bought the Party line that says war is good for the economy or that WWII got us out of the Great Depression .
If you want to understand what is going on you should read The Broken Window by Frédéric Bastiat until you grasp the truth that prosperity is not created or sustained by fomenting chaos and destruction .
It does n’t work on the macro level or the micro level .
Just try destroying all your own stuff and see how quickly you get rich .
War is the government sending our young people to run around other peoples ’ neighborhoods breaking all their windows .
The Vandals and their cousins the Visigoths were more candid about their intentions .
But they were Barbarians .
Our Window Breakers are " making the world safe for democracy . "
If Democracy were so good one would think it would be cheaper to promote .
Maybe there are some really good top - secret reasons for this war ?
Please do n’t make me laugh by calling me a " conspiracy nut / theorist . "
Does it make any difference to you if you are murdered by a conspiracy or a consensus ?
Very bad people get together and make very bad plans to do very bad things .
Many of these plans are unlawful .
Some are public .
Some are secret .
Some of them are very profitable .
Some may even involve good intensions .
Some result in wars between nations .
The cognomen " conspiracy nut " is totally ragged by now .
It is as profound as saying " only good people make good plans . "
The etymology of the word " conspiracy " speaks of " breathing together . "
Criminals in and out of government make plans together all the time .
Get over it !
Politicians do lots of heavy breathing together .
And the reality is a thousand times worse than the conjured image you just experienced .
In War Is A Racket , Major General Smedley D. Butler , USMC Retired , made some very serious and fully documented allegations .
Even though he had received two [ 2 ]
Congressional Medals of Honor , and diverse other decorations , he still did n’t completely lose his critical thinking skills — as often seems to be the case with retired generals .
But " Old Gimlet Eye " got too close to his men and caught the disease of Empathy .
After WWI he began to investigate and carefully trace the money trail .
His investigation eventually took him to veteran ’s hospitals where he witnessed first hand the shattered bodies and minds of thousands of war veterans .
General Butler shared their grief .
He did n’t just give them some pretty medals .
He also became keenly aware of the disgraceful way the government acted toward them once they had served their purpose .
Many felt they had been used up and discarded as refuse .
Later the true " compassion " of the government was displayed again in its reaction to the Bonus Army .
But we treat our veterans much better now right ?
Sure we do — what ’s left of them .
I once asked a talk show host who was interviewing me :
Do you know why we have Veteran ’s Hospitals ?
She said , " Why is that ? "
I answered , " Because you ca n’t kill everybody in the war ! "
This is not to take anything away from those who are sincerely dedicated to easing the suffering of returning troops — only to point out that there are those among us who are willing to betray them more than once .
Recently a friend of mine with PTSD was qualified to receive disability payments after all his years of suffering since the Vietnam " police action . "
The high - ranking military doctors who interviewed him said they could n’t believe he had made it until now without committing suicide or going on a killing spree [ like so many others in their files ] .
He had been decorated for a Rambo - like episode where he escaped and returned to kill his captors while rescuing his comrades .
In addition he had no idea of how many more Vietnamese he had dispatched during that tour of duty .
There can be a heavy price to pay when you wake up from your delusions .
His entire life has been ruined and wasted .
How many more of these wretched souls will slip through the cracks to become ticking time bombs that our military hospitals will only be able to treat after something horrific and very preventable happens — and only if they are still alive ?
In chapter three , Who Makes The Profits , you will see some familiar names among the companies who made money from the blood of WWI .
Is that an unreasonable indictment to say they made money from blood ?
Read the chapter carefully and consider Butler ’s careful documentation of the differential between pre-war and wartime profit margins for many of the major war profiteer companies .
WWI certainly paid for itself in their minds .
Some of those companies are still raking in dividends .
General Butler on secret profits for the bankers :
And let us not forget the bankers who financed the great war .
If anyone had the cream of the profits it was the bankers .
Being partnerships rather than incorporated organizations , they do not have to report to stockholders .
And their profits were as secret as they were immense .
How the bankers made their millions and their billions I do not know , because those little secrets never become public — even before a Senate investigatory body .
Banking is such an exquisite craft .
You can make money by lending money that costs you little to nothing , collecting interest from both sides .
Then after the war you can side with the victor to extract more usury from the loser .
Later you can forgive a small part of the remaining debt so you can look like Mr. Nice Guy .
Then you repeat the process for as many wars as you can help stir up .
And let ’s not forget all the " growth " you can stimulate by funding reconstruction during the brief and tenuous peace .
Please !
Tell me once again that I am a conspiracy nut !
I would love to wake up from this macabre dream .
I ’m sure General Butler must have felt that way too .
And what of a grieving parent when they discover that wars are usually planned and carried out for profits and power with little to no consideration of principles or patriotism ?
If our hearts truly go out to them we should be redoubling our efforts to find ways to break the cycle .
The account above of a friend of mine has been challenged by a researcher of the period .
Therefore I have checked two on - line lists he provided regarding Vietnam Veterans ’ stories and claims .
My friend ’s name does not appear on either the list of known frauds or the list of documented heroes .
His story was included to highlight the ineffective treatment of our veterans and the willingness of our government to use them as cannon fodder and then neglect or ignore them .
Documentation of the noted events may not be possible because of privacy issues .
I would not hesitate to withdraw the segment if it is proves to be inaccurate .
General Butler ’s Unquestioned Indictment of the Military Industrial Complex is probably adequate proof for anyone who wishes to substantiate the main focus of the article .
The best we can do for our military personnel is Not to send them to unlawful , unconstitutional wars .

Magnetic confinement fusion could be a safe , environmentally friendly way to provide a substantial part of the world ’s energy needs in the 21st century but before that can happen science needs to understand the complex behavior of hot collisionless plasmas ( ion gases ) in strong magnetic fields .
Such plasmas are subject to temperature and density gradient driven microturbulence which leads to particle and heat losses and tends to keep the plasma from reaching a " burning " state .
Simulations are necessary if we are to understand and control plasma microturbulence but , because fusion plasmas are virtually collisionless , a three - dimensional ( i.e. , in space ) fluid description must , in principle , be abandoned , in favor of a six - dimensional ( i.e. , in phase space ) kinetic one .
Interior view of the fusion experiment ASDEX - Upgrade during a plasma discharge together with two contour plots from gyrokinetic simulations , demonstrating turbulent behavior .
Fortunately , several processes on very small spatio - temporal scales – such as the gyrating motion of the particles around magnetic field lines – can be removed , analytically , from the basic equations , thus making the problem five - dimensional .
This reduces the computational requirements by many orders of magnitude , without sacrificing accuracy .
This approach is called gyrokinetics , which gave the present project its name .
The GYROKINETICS project was carried out in 2006 and 2007 by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics at Garching , Germany , and the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale of Lausanne , in Switzerland using DEISA ’s resources under the DECI and the JRA3 frameworks .
This gyrokinetic simulation approach to plasma turbulence is expected to help improve the performance of magnetic confinement fusion devices .
The research group were able to show that certain small - scale turbulent processes can make substantial contributions to the overall heat transport carried by the plasma electrons .
It turned out , that there is often a scale separation between ion and electron thermal transport .
While the former is usually carried more or less exclusively by long wavelength fluctuations , a substantial proportion of the latter can be carried by much smaller scales .
These findings represent an important new insight into the physics of turbulent transport in magnetized plasmas , and will have important implications for future full - torus simulations of large fusion devices , such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ITER .
Charles Dunstone certainly has an eye for publicity .
The head of Carphone Warehouse ( and of its " free " broadband service TalkTalk ) last week threw back the request from the BPI , which represents the music industry , that TalkTalk begin implementing the " three strikes and you 're out " policy .
This is the policy mooted to tackle people who download ( well , perhaps upload too ; or upload only ; it 's not clear ) copyrighted material they do n't own .
That 's not surprising .
The request from the BPI warns of " injunctions " if internet service providers ( ISPs ) do n't implement the policy within two weeks , but the concept is still hopelessly unclear .
Who will pay if a high - powered barrister finds his or her connection cut off due , say , to something a passing hacker using their open Wi-Fi or a security hole in their machine has allowed ?
Will it be the ISP or the BPI in the dock ?
Dunstone wants to avoid that ; he 'll let the BPI and the file - sharer slug it out , as they have been doing .
Threats from the music business cut little ice with him .
As a source close to TalkTalk noted to me last week , gazing at the BPI 's letter , the ISP business is bigger than the music business in this country .
Mad as hell
And anyway , ISPs have rather more pressing matters on their hands .
Their problem is n't people doing illegal stuff .
It 's the ones doing absolutely legal things — specifically , watching BBC programmes on the broadcaster 's iPlayer .
This is pouring red ink all over their accounts , and they 're mad as hell about it .
What 's happening is this : people are going directly to the iPlayer page and watching programmes .
They 're not using the peer - to - peer version ; too much hassle , and it uses up too much processing power .
Here are the latest figures , covering the first month of operation .
ISPs noticed the difference at once .
PlusNet blogged about the fact that by late February , iPlayer traffic was already making up 5 % of its network traffic .
That 's one outlet .
The reason why this scares ISPs is that most of them get their connectivity via BT 's IPStream product , where they pay per gigabyte consumed .
Streaming sites consume a lot more data than " normal " sites .
Which means iPlayer whacks them hard in the streaming pocket .
PlusNet estimated that it pushes up streaming costs from £ 17,200 per month to £ 51,700 per month — an increase from 6.1p / user to 18.3p /user .
In other words , the cost per user trebled in the first month of the service .
Blocked pipe
And did your broadband bill go up ?
Nope .
Telco 2.0 commented that the iPlayer " blows up " the standard ISP model .
IPStream comes with 155 - megabit pipes .
Watching iPlayer consumes about 500 kilobits per second .
Get just 300 people watching iPlayer at once on an ISP and that 's its IPStream pipe filled — and forget about anyone else .
What to do ?
Some of the ISPs have suggested that the BBC might like to , you know , contribute to their neighbourhood fat pipe security watch ; because it would be an awful thing if something , well , happened to the data coming over on port 1935 ( used for iPlayer data ) .
The BBC's Ashley Highfield , head of future media and technology , last week riposted that ISPs should put their own houses in order , suggesting that " unlimited broadband " should mean just that , not " slowed down when you approach a limit " and that the use of " up to " should be banned in ads .
He also offered to name and shame ISPs that tried to charge content providers .
" If ISPs start charging content providers , the customer will not know which content will work well over their chosen ISP , and what content may have been throttled for non-payment of a levy . "
Sauce for the goose
Which is fair enough .
( Perhaps the ISPs might respond that if Highfield feels like telling them what to do , they 've got some suggestions about fewer repeats and reality shows . )
But there 's a definite sense of what 's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander .
ISPs are in one breath telling one content provider that they 're just the conduit down which the data passes , so they do n't want to get involved if the content provider thinks the data passing is bad .
But on the other , the ISPs are annoyed by all this data coming from another content provider , and want it to contribute something to their costs .
They can't both be right .
I wonder which argument ISPs will deploy in the long run : working with the BPI , or paying for new 155 - megabit lines from BT ?
Neither will come cheap .
As I was browsing some of the news on CNN , I came across a video that had the title : Foreclosure Family Camps
Out , so I had to see what that was all about .
I was curious to see where the blame was going to be placed , and what the details of the story were .
We hear a lot about the subprime mess , real estate prices plummeting , and irresponsible buyers , each of which play a key role in the big picture .
But for this family who is now living out of a camper , who would you put at fault ?
Let ’s look at the details from the story .
The Couple ’s Story
To better understand the circumstances around this foreclosure , let ’s take a look at some of the details from the story :
2,700 square foot house in Las Vegas , Nevada .
Dual incomes .
Home price of $ 265,000 .
Purchased with no money down , interest - only loan .
Home value doubled in just a few years providing a lot of equity .
The First Mistake
Looking at the information above , this represents a large number typical families , but what is wrong with this picture already ?
I ’m sure most of you recognize the real problem is that the purchase was made with no money down , and with an interest - only loan .
We know this is a problem , but from the reaction of the woman in the video , she knew that this was too good to be true as well .
She says , “ We can get this for $ 265,000 with no money down ?
Oh my God ! ”
So , if you ’re shocked at being able to purchase a home valued at over a quarter - million dollars without putting a single dollar down , yet go through with the sale anyway , that is the borrower ’s mistake .
On the other hand , banks should n’t have been offering these loans to begin with , so that also scores a point for the lender as well .
I ’d score this round of mistakes a 1 - 1 tie between the lender and borrower .
Both parties were greedy .
Second Mistake
So far , this has played out like many other home purchases .
People with steady incomes are looking for the “ house of their dreams ” , and seek out a home in the rapidly growing real estate market .
They are shocked to find out that they can purchase a lot of house without even saving a penny for it , so they go through with the deal .
As long as they earn decent income , they are living the American Dream .
Then , tragedy strikes .
Someone loses their job , thus losing a stream of income .
Suddenly , bills become harder to pay , and some will inevitably be late , including the mortgage payment .
For most people , what happens when you ’re faced with a sudden emergency like a job loss ?
Hopefully , you are able to turn to your emergency savings that can help you keep up while you try to find another suitable job .
In this case , this couple went straight to the equity in their home .
Of course , when the real estate market is allowing your home to double in value in a short amount of time , why not ?
People see this as free money because they purchased real estate as an investment .
Unfortunately , you ’re only taking on more debt just to pay off other debts .
This is almost always a losing battle .
It does n’t disclose how much equity they took out , but it said that the home equity loan or line of credit increased their monthly payments by 57 % .
Given the sharp increase , I ’m guessing they did n’t just take out a couple thousand to get them by until they found another job .
They probably took out tens of thousands of dollars , but I wo n’t speculate .
In this round , I have to give a point to the borrowers for failing to plan appropriately for an emergency .
Of course the bank is going to accommodate someone who has built up over $ 200,000 in equity in their home , and for all the bank knew , she was going to be getting another job and they would be able to continue to make payments .
The Nail in the Coffin
To make matters worse , when they tried to sell the home in a now depressed market and could n’t , they took out another $ 35,000 loan to help pay the mortgage .
Since they already tapped into the equity in their home , and now had to seek additional debt to pay the mortgage , they took out another loan .
It said that their new monthly mortgage payment with the home equity loan was just under $ 1,200 / month .
So , how long was this going on ?
If you borrowed $ 35,000 , that could theoretically pay the mortgage and equity loan for 29 months ( barring any changes in the loan or moving beyond the interest only period ) .
Of course , you ’d also be making monthly payments on the $ 35,000 , but you could still assume that this influx of money could keep their mortgage current for at least 12 - 18 months .
Again , there are no time frames or interest rates being paid given , but the circumstances are pointing to a lot of bad decisions on behalf of the borrowers .
With the money borrowed , and still having one steady stream of income , this borrowed money should have been able to bridge the gap until the woman could find some source of income .
They Blame the Lenders
This couple blames the lenders , and who would n’t in this type of situation .
They go on to say that the loan documents are confusing and hard to understand , which is true .
There is no doubt that understanding every little thing in the mortgage paperwork is extremely confusing for the buyers , and the lenders can make unfavorable loans look quite good .
So , the lender is certainly not getting off the hook for promoting an unsuitable mortgage to people who do n’t fully understand it .
Is There More to the Story ?
While there are certainly parts of this story that can put some of the blame on each party , I think there is a lot more to this kind of story than meets the eye .
This story did n’t mention what their incomes were , but given the fact that they had to take out another loan because they could n’t afford the $ 1,200 / month even after taking out home equity leads me to believe that there were some other significant monthly expenses in play .
Were they making payments on that camper while still in the house ?
What were their car payments like ?
Did they have other debts ?
Did they have any retirement funds to tap into , or were they saving for retirement at all ?
We know they did n’t have money for a down payment or sufficient emergency funds , so I ’m guessing that even with dual incomes , they were living pretty close to paycheck to paycheck as it was .
What do You Think ?
So , I ’ll leave this up for discussion .
What do you think about a scenario like this one ?
I feel that there is certainly some blame to go around , and with the facts provided and some basic assumptions from these facts , these people probably should n’t have purchased a home in that price range anyway .
Sure , the lender probably should n’t have been offering this easy money to people who probably could n’t afford it , but even so , this foreclosure was ultimately a result of job loss .
Job loss is , and has been the number one reason for foreclosure for decades –well before these more exotic loans were being sold .
So to me , it looks like a complicated case of a lack of planning , lack of common sense , and greed ( on both sides ) .

I almost feel bad about all those hit jobs written on Michael Brown , the former Federal Emergency Management Agency director charged with messing up the Hurricane Katrina cleanup .
That 's because he asked and I — and many other reporters — have clicked " confirm " to be a Facebook friend .
Fact is , his is an interesting comeback story , and his Facebook page , which you have to sign up for to see , tells it .
He 's a long way from President Bush 's disaster plaudit , " Brownie , you 're doin ' a heckuva job , " but he remembers it well , dubbing it his least favorite quote .
He follows that up with this advice : " Do n't always believe what you read .
Ask me instead . "
Apparently , many are .
He had about 85 friends two weeks ago , and with some active marketing , he 's nearly topped 225 .
He 's now associated with five firms , including his own , and many touch on disaster planning and mistakes , both of which he says he knows about .
Duh .
For example , he chairs Cotton USA , a disaster recovery firm , and is a VP at the disaster - training firm Resilient .
As we 've seen , there 's at least a small , devoted following out there keeping the venerable Super 8 format alive , and it now looks like they 'll soon have another tool at their disposal , with the retro- minded folks at Gakken set to release their new Super 8 projector kit .
While it 's practicality may be in question for serious Super 8 enthusiasts , they will at least get a bit of an understanding of how things work by piecing it together themselves , not to mention a mild workout by hand - cranking the film through the projector .
It 's not all old school , however , with Gakken turning to white LEDs to light up your masterworks .
If that 's got your interest piqued , you 'll apparently be able to get your hands on one of these in Japan next month for ¥ 8,000 , or about $ 80 . [ Via Gadget Lab
Iran and the United States have been engaged in secret " back channel " discussions for the past five years on Iran 's nuclear programme and the broader relationship between the two sworn enemies , The Independent can reveal .
One of the participants , former senior US diplomat Thomas Pickering , explained that a group of former American diplomats and experts had been meeting with Iranian academics and policy advisers " in a lot of different places , although not in the US or Iran " .
" Some of the Iranians were connected to official institutions inside Iran , " he said in a telephone interview from Washington .
The group was organised by the UN Association of the USA , a pro-UN organisation .
Its work was facilitated by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , a government - funded think - tank chaired by the former chief UN weapons inspector for Iraq , Rolf Ekeus .

While the nuclear issue was " prominent " , Mr Pickering said , " we discussed what 's going on domestically in both countries and wide - ranging issues " affecting the US - Iran relationship .
Although none of the group members was from the US or Iranian governments , he said that " each side kept their officials informed " .
The Bush administration " did not discourage us , " he added .
Mr Pickering declined to go into greater detail for fear of jeopardising future meetings of the group of about a dozen Americans and Iranians , although the number of participants varies .
Back - channel talks have often provided crucial impetus in solving the world 's most intractable disputes .
They usually only become public in case of agreement , as seen with Northern Ireland and the Oslo accords on the Middle East , or failure , as in the case of an Israeli - Syrian informal channel .
The revelation about the existence of an Iran - US back channel coincides with the recent publication by three of its American members , including Mr Pickering , of proposals aimed at overcoming the deadlock between Iran and the West over Tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
The initiative addresses the crunch issue of Iran 's right to enrich uranium on its own soil while providing guarantees that the nuclear fuel will not be diverted for military purposes .
Mr Pickering spoke of a " rather positive " reaction to the plan , which provides for an international consortium to jointly manage and run uranium enrichment on Iranian soil .
However , the Bush administration has not responded , and remains wedded to its current policy of sanctions aimed at forcing Iran to halt uranium enrichment in line with UN demands , while offering the opportunity to enrich uranium outside the country through a Russian consortium .
A Foreign Office spokesman said Britain was " aware " of the proposals but did not have an official response .
The Iranian government , according to Mr Pickering , has let it be known that " they would not respond unless it was offered officially " .
In arms - control circles the plan has gained traction " because he 's so respected , " said George Perkovich of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , referring to Mr Pickering , who is a former US undersecretary of state .
The initiative , co-signed by the UNA - USA president William Luers , a former diplomat , and Jim Walsh , a nuclear expert from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , was first aired at the end of February in The New York Review of Books where it has generated further discussion .
Mr Pickering says that he and his colleagues decided to act now because US policy was " stuck " , in the light of Iran 's refusal to bow to the UN demand to halt uranium enrichment , despite the imposition of economic sanctions .
Prospects for face - to - face US - Iran talks are therefore blocked , he says , arguing that the case is urgent because Iran is continuing to install centrifuges at its main enrichment plant in Natanz .

But other experts point out that with the 3,000 centrifuges at Natanz spinning at only 20 percent of capacity because of technical problems , there is time for the West to play a waiting game .
James Acton , a nuclear specialist at King 's College London Department of War Studies , said the challenge would be to prevent Iran obtaining a clandestine route to a nuclear weapon thanks to the technical know - how that would be obtained from foreign partners .
Mr Pickering said : " It can be feasible if governments wish to make it so , technically and financially .
But it will take a lot of negotiation . "
Some analysts pointed out that a breakthrough was unlikely so long as George Bush was in the White House and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad holds the presidency of Iran , where elections are scheduled for next year .
" Why would Iran go for it now ?
They feel like they 've won , there are not enough sanctions , and there is no threat of war , " said Mr Perkovich .
Calling Iran 's bluff ?
The Luers - Pickering - Walsh initiative gives Iran the opportunity to prove that its nuclear intentions are peaceful by yielding to the Iranians ' key demand for a uranium enrichment programme on Iranian soil .
The enrichment activities would take place under the supervision of a jointly managed international consortium .
The plan is the most detailed of its kind since 2005 .
Conditions to be negotiated with Iran would include :
*a UN Security Council resolution authorising the arrangement and specifying that if Iran breaks the agreement , member states would be authorised to take punitive action ;
* Iran would be barred from producing highly enriched uranium , which is weapons grade fuel , or reprocessed plutonium , which can be an alternative route to producing a bomb ;
* Iran would implement the stringent inspection measures in the Additional Protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty ;
* Iran would commit itself to building only " safe " light - water reactors .

Why would a scientist talk 11 other scientists into eating tadpoles ?
To answer a scientific mystery , of course ; and also because he could .
The incident resulted in a 1971 study called On the Comparative Palatability of Some Dry-Season Tadpoles from Costa Rica .
Tadpoles come in a wild variety of patterns and colours .
Most blend in with their surroundings .
But some have gaudy patterns or bright colours or both .
The question was :
Why do n't predators wolf down all of these fetchingly packaged snacks ?
How can they not have gone extinct ?
The leading theory said that the eye - catching tadpoles must taste terrible to predators , so yucky as to be spurned .
But it was , as they say , " just a theory " - until Richard Wassersug , of the University of California , Berkeley , put it to the test .
He did this in Costa Rica , where tadpole species are numerous , and beer to wash them down with is cheap .
Wassersug decided to use substitutes for the natural predators of the tadpole .
He used cheap substitutes .
He used graduate students .
And he made them follow strict procedures .
In his words :
" The tasters were asked to rate the palatability of each tadpole 's skin , tail and body on a 1 - to - 5 scale : 1 tastes good ; 2 no taste ; 3 , only slightly disagreeable ; 4 , moderately disagreeable ; and 5 , very strongly disagreeable .
They were also asked to make comments about the taste as they went along and to note the most and least palatable tadpole at the end of the experiment .
The standardised tasting procedure included several steps .
A tadpole was rinsed in fresh water .
The taster placed the tadpole in his or her mouth , and held it for 10 - 20 seconds without biting into it .
Then the taster bit into the tail , breaking the skin , and chewed lightly for 10 - 20 seconds .
For the last 10 - 20 seconds the taster bit firmly and fully into the body of the tadpole .
The participants were directed not to swallow the tadpoles but to spit them out and to rinse their mouths out at least twice with fresh water before proceeding to the next tadpole . "
The results of the experiment were sparklingly clear .
One species of tadpole , Bufalo marinus , was rated the most distasteful by six of the nine tasters , who described it as being " bitter " .
Several species were found to taste almost good .
Generally , the tasters found the bodies to be less palatable than the skin , but more palatable than the tails .
On the whole , the results supported Wassersug 's thesis that the more conspicuous the tadpole , the less palatable it is likely to be .
Twenty - nine years later , he was awarded an Ig Nobel prize in the field of biology .
Now a professor of biology at Dalhousie University in Halifax , Nova Scotia , Richard Wassersug is a recognised authority on amphibian physiology and medicine .
But , as happens to a few great scientists , a most unexpected , most unhappy event gave his life - and his research - a spectacular turn .
Details next week , in this space .

Okay , so we 've done some digging into the RIAA 's lawsuit against Jeffery Howell , in which the industry is claiming that ripped MP3s are " unauthorized copies , " and it turns out that Jeffery is n't actually being sued for ripping CDs , like the Washington Post and several other sources have reported , but for plain old illegal downloading .
As we 're all unfortunately aware , that 's pretty standard stuff ; the big change from previous downloading cases is the RIAA 's newfound aggressiveness in calling MP3s ripped from legally owned CDs " unauthorized copies " -- something it 's been doing quietly for a while , but now it looks like the gloves are off .
While there 's a pretty good argument for the legality of ripping under the market factor of fair use , it 's never actually been ruled as such by a judge -- so paradoxically , the RIAA might be shooting itself in the foot here , because a judge would n't ever rule on it unless they argue that it 's illegal .
Looks like someone may end up being too clever for their own good , eh ?

THE QUESTION
Where can I celebrate Thai new year ?
Songkran , or Thai new year , is celebrated on April 13 - 15 every year .
Traditionally , perfumed water is poured on to hands in a purifying ritual .
Of course , here at Nibbles we 're pure enough already , but we 'll be getting in to the spirit of things all the same .
You do n't need to jet off to Bangkok to join in - we 've found the best events taking place around the country .
In London , Mango
Tree is really going to town , with a five - day spectacular celebrating regional Thailand .
The festivities kick off on April 9 , with a special menu ( £ 20 a head ) , plus music , folklore and dancing .
There is also a new year menu on offer at the Blue Elephant , though prices are quite steep : starters cost around £ 9 and mains climb as high as £ 24 .
Elsewhere , the Sangthai restaurant in York is offering a celebratory set menu from April 15 - 20 , and - notably - a separate menu for vegetarians ( both £ 28 ) .
The Thai Grand in Loughborough is celebrating on one day only , April 14 , with live music and traditional dancing .
In Hampshire , the Zen Garden restaurant at Senspa , Careys Manor House , is hosting a Taste of Thailand night , also on April 14 .
It features massage and cookery demonstrations , dinner , bucks fizz and dancing , all for £ 37.50 .
Finally , the Tongdam restaurant in Somerset is offering special menus for a full week , starting on April 7 .
If you really want to celebrate in style , book a place on the Harrods / Nahm Thai cookery course , taking place this Saturday ( April 5 ) .
The day involves a private tour of the Harrods food hall with Nahm 's executive chef , a hands - on cookery lesson in the Nahm kitchen and a sumptuous Thai banquet .
The course costs £ 155 ; call 020 7893 8155 for more information .
For a slightly more affordable Nahm experience , book a table on April 12 or 13 to sample the new year menu .
At £ 55 a head , it 's the most expensive in town - but it 's probably the best .
Alternatively , whip up a Thai feast at home .
We like Yotam Ottolenghi 's modern take on a Thai green curry ; Allegra McEvedy 's Thai salad ; and Terry Tan 's easy Thai dishes .
As it 's a special occasion , give the beer a miss and try a German riesling - its sweetness works well with the spicy flavours .
IN SEASON
Wild garlic ( aka ransoms )
Catch these pungent young leaves while you can - they do n't hang around for long .
Hugh Fearnley - Whittingstall recommends a whole host of uses for them here , from simple dips to scrumptious soups and wild welsh rarebit .
Check out the seasonal recipes over at Why Organic , too - this month there 's a great wild garlic pesto .

On The Tacit Process of ( Scientific ) Discovery
In a recent coffee break , a discussion broke out about the naming of things in science .
For instance , you have the Boltzman constant , Shannon entropy and the Golgi appartus .
Then there are the bizarro names given to classic thought experiments such as Maxwell 's demon , the Einstein - Podolsky - Rosen paradox and Schrodinger 's cat .
Someone remarked that people do n't seem to name things anymore .
Except that they still do .
In my field , I can think of some recent namings such as the Karplus coupling , the Levinthal paradox , the Ramachandran plot and the Connolly surface .
Coining new names is easy , and one might be tempted to think that new names just adds to the cess - pool of new jargon , which is very deep indeed .
But the use of jargon is not necessarily bad .
It 's just that so very names actually pass into useful common usage .
This only happens if the new name encapsulates a complicated idea , and the idea is useful , and the new term pops , then communication amongst professionals is enhanced .
Still the coining of names brings up an interesting question : why do we decide that a person shall be forever conjoined with an idea ?
Naming a idea after a person is perhaps the highest honor we can give to a fellow scientist for discovering that idea in the first place .
It suggests not only that the scientist did in fact discover it , but the discovery is one of consequence .
Still the debate over who discovered what , may seem like an armchair debate , but there are often major consequences .
Like any kind of competition , there are no prizes for coming second .
Publication of a new experiment often prevents the publication of similar experiments coming after .
And grants and research money flow through the doorway of a good publication record .
Life - long shit fights have been fought over the originality of scientific ideas .
The classic example is Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz fighting over the mantle of the inventor of calculus .
Newton was known to have made up pseudonyms to pen articles attacking Leibniz in various scientific journals .
In that particular butting of heads , the entire scientific communities of Germany and England were enlisted to fling shit at the other side over a period of decades .
The problem with the attribution of originality is that discovery can be plausibly broken into 4 different persons .
There is 1 ) the person who brainstormed the initial idea , 2 ) the person who got a working prototype of the idea , and 3 ) the person who got the prototype to do something useful and 4 ) the person who polished the idea into a useful tool that everybody can and would want to use .
Or for lack of better words : brainstorm , prototype , utility , ubiquity .
Until an idea or method reaches ubiquity , it 's not really considered significant enough to warrant a special name .
The have many cases of the history of science of interesting but useless discoveries .
Do n't believe me ?
Just peruse the number of articles in the literature with 1 citation or less .
Now , when one person takes an idea from brainstorming all the way to ubiquity , there 's no question about who discovered the idea .
The problem is when different people partake in the process .
Take brainstorming .
The classic example of the brainstorm is the idea of parity violation for the weak interaction , the interaction that was postulated to hold a electron to a positron in order to make a neutron .
This was needed to explain the commonplace disintegration of neutrons to protons that is observed in many radioactive materials .
The parity violation of the weak interaction was traditionally attributed to the theorists Lee and Yang .
However , the story of the discovery of the parity violation of the weak interaction goes that in a particular conference in the 60's , which Lee and Yang attended , there was a lively discussion the nature of the weak interaction .
During the first night , Richard Feynman and his room - mate Martin Block continued the discussion when Block blurted out , " maybe parity is not conserved " .
Feynman pooh - poohed this idea , but suddenly stopped and realized that this could be one of those ideas that seem so stupid it just be right .
The next day , Feynman brought this up .
Lee and Yang who had been working on the weak interaction , slowly came to the conclusion that there was merit to the idea and after careful study of the literature , realized that no one had actually tested parity violation in the weak force , even though it had been done many times for electro - magnetism and the strong force .
So they wrote up a famous analysis of the parity violation , with a proposed experiment .
Their friend ,
Wu , one of a handful of influential female physicists broke off her honeymoon to run the experiment .
And thus , the physics community found that one of their fundamental symmetries of nature was violated .
Who then discovered parity violation ?
Block clearly had the original idea , Feynman conveyed it , and Lee and Yang developed a prototype of the idea .
It was then Wu who actually got it working as an experiment .
Only after it was experimentally proved , was this hailed as one of the great moments of physics .
Block , Feynman , Lee , Yang and Wu all partook in the childbirth of the idea .
But due to the stature that Lee and Yang already had in beta - decay studies , their part in the drama propelled them to a Nobel Prize .
A more interesting case is the discovery of the positron .
When Paul Adrien Dirac first discovered the relativistic equation of the electron , he realized that it entailed the possibility of a particle just like an electron but with a positive charge .
Since no one had observed anything like that before , Dirac conjectured that this was really a shrouded description of a proton , even though a proton was many times heavier than an electron .
Indeed the belief in the non-existence of a positron was so strong , Dirac explained the positive particle as a " hole " in an unseen sea of virtual electrons .
Many years later , Carl Anderson was credited with the actual discovery of the positron when he photographed in his bubble chamber the tracks of a particle that had a positive charge but the mass of an electron , as deduced by the curvature of the track in a known magnetic field .
However , before Anderson , similar particles had also been observed in cloud chambers that measure tracks from cosmic rays except no one knew exactly what they were .
Nevertheless , without Dirac 's equation , no - one would have the framework to understand how positrons fit in to the scheme of things .
Dirac was allegedly quite upset to find out that an actual positron was discovered because he had hoped his equation also described protons , the other important constituent of a normal atom .
This was a case where Dirac had discovered everything about the positron except believing that it exists .
An example close to home is the concept of the funnel in the energy landscape of a protein .
The idea of a funnel energy landscape is that there are many conformations of a protein at high energy but at progressively lower energies , there are fewer conformations .
Thus an unfolded protein naturally falls into the lowest conformations .
The idea of the energy funnel solves the infamous Levinthal paradox that had plagued protein theorists for 2 decades .
Although the actual term " funnel " was coined by Peter Wolynes , my former boss , Ken Dill , wrote an earlier paper that demonstrated this very idea using 2 dimensional lattice models but he did not use the term ' funnel ' in the paper .
History shows that the term ' funnel ' stuck .
Still , Ken always cites his paper for the definition of ' funnel ' whereas Peter cites his paper for the first coinage of the term .
Depending on who you to talk , someone different discovered the energy " funnel " concept of protein folding .
The thing is , in research , good ideas are a dime a dozen .
I learnt this the hard way .
In gradschool and the various postdocs I 've had , when I 'd have a idea for a new idea and tried to pitch to my boss , more often than not , they 'd try to shoot it down .
They 'd look for flaws or sometimes veto it with their hard - earned intuition .
They were pathologically opposed to shiny new ideas .
I used to think that it was because they were old fuddy - duddies , grown foggy and conservative by the grinding process of tenure .
But I now realize they were resistant for a very good reason .
This was because in reality , new ideas are cheap .
In the course of supervising generations of students and postdocs , they must have been pitched thousands of seemingly clever ideas that came to naught .
It was thus experience that taught them to be skeptical of novel ideas .
What I 've found that presenting new ideas to the boss is a multi-stage process .
The first step is to propose the idea and watch it get shot down .
Then , in my spare time , I 'd actually develop a prototype .
A prototype is kind of messy and poorly articulated of the original idea .
I 'd plead for the potential of the idea but chances are the boss would be a little more intrigued with the prototype but overall dismissive .
But with a prototype , I could then finally apply it to a real system .
I 've learnt best to keep my mouth shut until I could bring the boss some actual results applied to a real system .
Then we'd talk about it and reach some kind of wall and I 'd disappear again .
Wash , rinse , recycle .
The tipping point would come when my boss would burst into my office and tell me how he'd figure out something crucial that had been missing in my explanation .
Of course , that would be the very thing I 'd tried to say at the very beginning , but it would be boorish of me to mention it now .
The trouble has always been that communicating a mal - formed idea is not a very effective process .
But you can't really clarify an idea without actually building a prototype .
What is really happening is that in the to - and - fro between me and my boss , we had developed a mini-language to talk about the original spark of an idea .
Only when we had a shared language through building a prototype is the idea actually communicated .
Indeed , what had happened here is but a mini recapitulation of the stages of discovery – brainstorm , prototype , application and ubiquity – writ small in the interaction between two people .
Application is generating results from which one can think about the idea .
Ubiquity is when we both get it .
In the end though , ubiquity is the real test of a scientific discovery .
Only discoveries that are useful to a large number of people are significant discoveries .
I have no shame in using the word useful in the selling of the science I make .
The test of a good article is how many people want to collaborate with you after finding out about it .
A little advice that was floated my way from a previous supervisor was that to earn your stripes from postdoc to professor , you 've got to find a niche that you , and only you , can do .
As a young investigator , it would be suicide to dive straight into an area where you 're competing with the big boys , at least at the beginning of your career .
Indeed selling the science well can also make reputations .
The physicist Freeman Dyson made his career by carving the rosetta stone between the competing formulations of quantum electro - dynamics of those two giants of postwar physics Richard Feynman , Julian Schwinger and Sin-itiro Tomonaga .
These formulations were remarkably different .
On the one hand , you have the famously child - like strokes of Feynman diagrams , on the other hand , you have the crushing weight of equations in Schwinger 's papers , one of which had the reputation of containing the most number of equations in a Physical Review article for many years .
Although Dyson himself admitted that he was not the driving force behind quantum electro - dynamics , he produced a cogent description of electro - dynamics that normal physicists could could use , and his efforts were both appreciated and honored .
Making new discoveries is not simply a matter of serendipidity .
Luck falls on the prepared mind .
A salty piece of advice comes from the great computer scientist Richard Hamming who noted that the really great scientists were lucky many times over .
If you want to be great and receive the blessings of chance when they fall , you have to be ready to receive it .
How you ask ?
Simple , says Hamming , you must always been thinking about the great problems , regardless of whether you can solve them right now or not ( Quick : what are the top ten problems in your field ? ) .
If you cultivate brilliant collaborators , and learn to listen , then it is inevitable that you will bump into someone who has the idea to crack the insoluble , much as Wu did when she came upon Lee and Yang 's paper about the parity violation in the weak interaction .
At that moment , you must rush to the quick , drop everything else , and chase that insight to the bitter end .
You may even have to cut your honeymoon short .

New York : Cop Beats Meter Maid , Crowd Applauds
New York City , New York police officer greeted with applause for beating up a meter maid who gave his girlfriend a ticket .
A crowd in New York City , New York expressed support for an off - duty police officer who took his anger out on a meter maid on April 16 .
New York Police Department Officer Eladro Mata got into an argument with meter maid Eric Celemi , 29 , after Celemi ticketed Mata 's girlfriend for double - parking on Webster Avenue in the Bronx .
" I had been writing tickets and people standing on the street were applauding when I got arrested , " Celemi told the New York Daily News .
Mata displayed his badge and began shoving Celemi when he refused to withdraw the ticket .
Celemi held his ground and Mata allegedly threw a few punches at Celemi , who required three stitches in his left ear .
A NYPD lieutenant called to the scene ordered Celemi to be arrested and taken in handcuffs to the local precinct , pleasing those who had gathered to watch .
Although Mata has been suspended , NYPD has ignored Celemi 's requests to press charges against the officer .

Internet Group Anonymous Declares " War on Scientology "
By Chan Enterprises
Dated : Jan 21 , 2008
" Anonymous " are fighting the Church of Scientology and the Religious Technology Center .
CLEARWATER , Florida - Anonymous announced their intention to combat the activities of the Church of Scientology on Monday .
A spokesperson said that the group 's goals include bringing an end to the financial exploitation of Church members and protecting the right to free speech , a right which they claim was consistently violated by the Church of Scientology in pursuit of its opponents .
This announcement came as a response to attempts by the Church to keep secret an internal video meant to be viewed only by Scientologists , featuring actor Tom Cruise .
Despite their efforts , the movie was leaked and rapidly spread across the Internet .
The video caused much controversy , and members of Anonymous posted a message to several of their websites proclaiming war against Scientology .
Soon after , Anonymous struck at the church ; they blocked access to its website , made prank calls , organized protests , distributed anti-Church pamphlets and information , and extracted secret files from the Church of Scientology and its parent company , the Religious Technology Center .
Anonymous ' members cited several reasons for their actions against the Church of Scientology : many have stressed the alleged human rights violations under the auspices of the Church .
Others accused the Church of fraud due to its costly ceremonies , while some merely sought the entertainment they refer to as " lulz , " a corruption of the Internet slang " LOL , " or " laugh out loud . "
Most members , however , were concerned with the threat to free speech that the Church posed .
This was most evident in the recent attacks on websites such as Digg and YouTube , where the Church filtered anti-Scientology comments and replaced their content with the text " [ This comment is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Church of Scientology International ] . "
" The so - called Church of Scientology actively misused copyright and trademark law in pursuit of its own agenda , " one Anonymous commented .
" They attempted not only to subvert free speech , but to recklessly pervert justice to silence those who spoke out against them . "
The Church of Scientology 's legal struggle with its online detractors began in 1994 with the Usenet group " alt.religion.scientology " , a community which spoke out against the Church .
Legal representatives from the Church confronted them specifically over the use of Scientology in their name , citing trademark infringement and misrepresentation .
This led to numerous lawsuits , and the group was shut down .
The Church of Scientology later found itself in several further conflicts on the Internet , including some with popular websites such as Google and Slashdot , as well as an alleged " war " with users of the website YTMND.com .
The members of Anonymous do not plan to end their attacks on the Church of Scientology .
Instead , they will continue until the Church of Scientology reacts , at which point they will change strategy .
Their main goal is to render the church powerless , and so the war could be one of attrition .
Science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard founded the Church in 1953 .
In the 55 years since its inception , the Church has faced allegations of being a commercial enterprise that harasses its critics , exploits its members , and neglects adults in its care .
Scientology has also faced criticism over the cost required to progress through its " auditing " system , with the total bill for completing the course estimated at $ 365,000 - $ 380,000 .

As reported earlier this morning , the attack on Church of Scientology by hacker alliance Anonymous has been verified ... by a press release from Anonymous !
The press release — complete with contact information — was posted on free internet press release service PR Log early yesterday morning .
It reads as follows
The press release is rapidly making its way into the internet via such models as StumbleUpon , Digg , Reddit , BoingBoing , and MetaFilter .
Stay tuned !

The Democratic Party ’s strategy for the general election is clearly to transfer ownership of the war in Iraq from President George W. Bush to Republican presidential nominee John McCain .
Today , the Democratic National Committee released a new web ad titled Bush / McCain : Lockstep .
The 60 second ad features McCain following right along with the Bush administration ’s talking points on the war in Iraq .
Take a look for yourself :
Advertisements
It is a standard political tactic to try and attach the unpopular polices of a current administration to that party ’s presidential candidate , regardless of whether that candidate was actually a part of the administration .
John McCain was not a part of the Bush administration , but has made the Democrats ’ job easy , by serving as the top Senate parrot of the administration ’s Iraq policy .
I do n’t think there is a candidate in recent history who has so willingly embraced an unpopular policy the way McCain has with Iraq .
McCain has now left himself with only one option .
In order to win the presidency , he must convince the 2/3 of America that disagrees with him that Iraq was not only the right thing to do , but that we are now winning , and must continue the fight .
The Democrats have n’t had to transfer ownership of the war to John McCain .
He has happily done it himself .
McCain ’s stance on the war is was what won him the Republican nomination over the other liberal Republicans but it is this same stance that will likely cost him the presidency , no matter who the Democratic nominee is .
As those performing attacks against corporate IT assets become more professional we ’re going to start seeing more of the following types of attacks :
Bribery
Extortion
Blackmail
Think about who ’s increasingly behind the information security attacks these days , and think of how they could more effectively attack an organization given large amounts of money and their willingness to engage in standard , physical crime .
The Problem
How hard is it to find out who works in IT in a large organization ?
How difficult would it be to make contact with someone who can disable or modify the anti-malware systems at one of these fortune 500 companies ?
And what would happen if someone with an Eastern European accent offered Bob , the mediocre ( but dangerously knowledgeable ) IT guy , the following sorts of propositions :
I ’ll give you $ 50,000 cash to drop this piece of malware on your network .
It ’s undetectable by all of your malware detection and will remain so because this is the only place we ’re going to use it .
It will give us information we can use to silently extort your company ’s C - level execs , and nobody will ever know how we got the information .
They ’re millionaires anyway .
Think about it — all your debt instantly gone — plus a new home theater system that ’ll be the envy of the neighborhood .
… and if / when Bob says no …
You ’ll take the money and be happy or me and my meth - selling buddies will start getting real cozy with your wife , and we might accidentally burn down your house , too , or hurt your daughter .
Do n’t bother calling the police ; we ’re an international crime syndicate and that will just annoy us .
Trust me , take the money and everything will go smooth .
How about a new car ?
Then there ’s the blackmail angle if they ’re willing to do some research and / or some setups .
The point is that all they need is to get an internal employee to drop some of their highly specialized and virtually undetectable malware onto the internal LAN .
In short , the game is to overcome the internal employee ’s fear of being caught using either fear or greed .
And that ’s precisely what this new type of traditional , organized criminal player is good at .
They ’re already into the classical elements , e.g. drugs , guns , violence and prostitution , so leveraging those resources to reap profits in the cyber world seems more inevitable than far - fetched .
This is n’t just movie plot stuff ; there really are very organized criminal groups , with millions of dollars of backing , getting into the business of pulling the IT jewels out of top U.S. companies .
And when they start figuring out that shmuck - boy the IT guy is the thing standing between them and a multi-billion dollar company ’s most sensitive information — the games will begin .
In fact , I ’m willing to bet they ’ve already started .
The Information Security Response
There are predictable ways that we in information security will react :
Increasing the types of background checks required to get into IT .
Debts and overall life stability will be increasingly scrutinized , much in the same way it is for those with clearances in the intelligence community .
In fact , clearances may become a new standard for certain IT shops .
Separation of duties , least privilege , and auditing will start to get taken far more seriously by everyone .
Everyone from the companies themselves to the groups that are auditing them are going to be looking very hard at how to limit the damage individual employees are able to do if they were to go bad .
Additional outsourcing of sensitive roles due to the specialized requirements of IT in the future .
If clearances are needed , as well as training in how to deal with these types of threats , that ’s just going to be that much more reason for companies to outsource the whole operation to external experts .
Additional professionalization of IT due to the newer , more stringent requirements .
More requirements for college and / or certification plus the initial and ongoing background checks will raise the bar for entry into the field .
This will further exacerbate any existing IT labor issues and complicate the discussion of using foreign - born workers .
So , is this movie - plot fiction or a real possibility ?

Innviet ny opera med sex på taket Så kom politiet ...
( Dagbladet.no ) : Den nye Operaen i Bjørvika ble innviet på flere måter denne helga .
Etter at rakettene stilnet og NRKs store direktesending gikk av lufta , fant to unge turtelduer ut at det var behov for flere markeringer av hovedstadens nye praktbygg .
Se bildeserie fra fyrverkeri-åpningen .
Den nattlige innvielsen , en skikk like gammel som menneskeheten selv , fant sted på taket av operabygget .
Men den gikk ikke ubemerket hen .
Ble ikke bøtelagt
Det hele er notert i Oslo politidistrikts logg for helga .
Paret ble « overrasket mens de holdt på midt i hyrdestunden » og politipatruljen formante paret om å fortsette et annet sted .
Dette sa de to seg enige i og politiet fant ingen grunn til å bøtelegge de to .
- Operaen er ny offentlig grunn , og det er spennende å se hvordan den vil bli brukt .
På spøk hadde vi på forhånd spekulert i om noen ville prøve å bli først ute med å ha sex på operataket , sier informasjonskonsulent Maria Børja i Den norske Opera .
FLATT TAK : Taket er flere steder flatt nok til å sette fra seg en sjampanjeflaske uten at den velter .
Vis mer
Frykter ikke ny folkesport
- Når det faktisk skjedde , gjorde det det heldigvis etter at sperringene var tatt ned og alle de prominente gjestene på åpningsgallaen hadde dratt , sier hun .
Operaen frykter ikke at det blir noen ny folkesport å ha seg på det hvite marmortaket , som er tilgjengelig for alle via en gangbru fra Bispegata .
- Det er jo forholdsvis enkelt å oppdage , fordi det synes så godt .
Hendelsen natt til søndag ble jo også fanget opp av politiets overvåkingskameraer , slik at de kunne reagere , sier Børja .

The advent of DSL and cable modems gave rise to a slew of popular web services , produced multibillion dollar companies and reshaped consumers ' daily lives – all with relatively wimpy " broadband " connections that top out at a mere 3 to 6 megabits per second ( Mbps ) .
Now two of the largest ISPs in the United States are hoping to kick off yet another broadband renaissance , this time with home connections that promise to reach 50 - 100 Mbps , enabling a slew of high - definition content , better - quality video - sharing sites and even 3 - D video .
Call it Broadband 2.0 .
Experts say this increased bandwidth – when it becomes widely available – will have a profound effect on everything from our social interactions on the web to the way we consume media .
" The YouTube philosophy is really the primary motivator here , " says Connie Chang - Hasnain , a professor of electrical engineering at the University of California at Berkeley and expert in broadband communications .
" Even grandmas post things on YouTube .
But , right now , the resolution is terrible and there are some very predefined limits due to bandwidth . "
All of that will change with 50 Mbps download speeds , she said , and by simply improving the sound and video quality of video streaming sites , you can dramatically change how a society learns , teaches and communicates .
" Basically , people are going to do a lot of the things they normally do today , but in a better , more satisfying , way , " says Crick Waters , co-founder of Ribbit , a Silicon Valley company that sells an internet - based telephony platform .
Waters says that first and foremost , we can expect everything to go high - definition :
We 'll download HD movies from Netflix , upload HD content to YouTube , and watch more sophisticated HD content on our televisions .
The added bandwidth may even spur development of extra goodies , like stereoscopic 3 - D video and high - fidelity audio .
" Believe me , the minute someone puts the pipes out there , people will find a way to use them , " Waters says .
While the technologies they use differ , Comcast and Verizon have both started offering ultra - high - bandwidth services to select customers that are as much as 25 times faster than today 's average broadband speed of 4.8 Mbps , according to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation .
Comcast 's new " extreme high - speed internet service " uses the latest version of cable modem technology , while Verizon 's FiOS service delivers the internet to your home via optical fibers .
Both services are currently available only in relatively limited geographic areas .
Earlier this month , Comcast started offering a service to some Minneapolis / St .
Paul residents that features download speeds of 50 Mbps for a hefty $ 150 a month .
During his CES keynote in January , Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said his company plans to expand this new service in 20 percent of the area it serves by the end of the year , as well as offer speeds in excess of 100 Mbps in two years .
Verizon 's FiOS has a yearlong head start on Comcast 's service , and Verizon currently offers it in parts of 17 states .
Verizon said it will offer its fiber - to - the - home services to more than 18 million people – half of the geographic area it now serves – by 2010 .
Obstacles remain for both companies .
Deploying the services widely will take time – and lots of money .
And even if the companies sink their capital into second - generation broadband networks , there 's the risk that customers wo n't pony up for them unless there is compelling content to go along with that bandwidth .
" If you put a 60 Mbps service out there , people are also going to want to have services associated with it .
Yet no one is going to create those services unless the 60 Mbps is there , " Water says .
That hesitation may not last long , because consumers always find ways to use up whatever bandwidth is available – and then some – says Rudolf van der Berg , the author of a recent study on the future of fiber networks ( .pdf ) .
Van der Berg predicts that the average household will need 50 Mbps download speeds ( and 10 - 50 Mbps upload speeds ) between 2010 and 2020 .
And even that might not be enough : " Every new advance … has enabled new services over the available bandwidth , " he says .
In the end , the more bandwidth that becomes available to customers , the easier it becomes to develop new content offerings .
For example , Verizon suggests that its services might enable companies to offer not just HD programming , but multiple views of sporting events , wide - angle views comparable to an Imax experience , and ultra-large screens ( beyond 100 inches ) .
Eventually , the company suggests , we 'll clamor for Super HD ( 2160 vertical lines ) and Ultra HD ( 4320 vertical lines ) television broadcasts , which could require as much as 256- 480 Mbps of bandwidth .
In other words , whatever bandwidth you 've got now is never going to be enough .
Broadband 3.0 , anyone ?
The reminder is among hundreds of documents released by the Commons Tony and Cherie Blair were threatened with the bailiffs over an unpaid bill at their constituency home , expenses documents released by the Commons show .
The Blairs got a reminder notice from Northumbrian Water in November 2005 , addressed to " Mr C L Blair " for £ 147 .
" Your account may be transferred to a debt recovery agency ... We appreciate that you may be experiencing some financial difficulties , " it said .
Details of expenses claimed by 14 MPs have been released after an FOI battle .
The claims and receipts , which run to more than 400 pages , were handed out earlier by the Commons authorities .
They include money spent by senior politicians on running their second homes .
Details in two separate receipts from 2003 show the then prime minister Mr Blair spent more than £ 10,000 on refurbishing the kitchen at Myrobella - his constituency home in County Durham .
' Adverse coverage '
Items included tiling and £ 1,000 on fitting a mantel shelf to the Aga oven .
The Blairs also spent £ 515 on a new dishwasher for Myrobella .
The documents include a 2004 letter from Lloyds bank about the Blairs new interest - only £ 297,000 mortgage on Myrobella and a letter from the Commons authority agreeing to pay the monthly interest bill .
Much of the Additional Cost Allowance went on repairing constituency homes - one invoice from 2005 shows Gordon Brown spent £ 4,471 on renovating his kitchen .
It 's clear that this allowance pays for far more than just a base in London - MPs use it to fund a lifestyle far more comfortable than their constituents enjoy
Matthew Elliott
Taxpayers Alliance
Analysis :
What we now know Send us your comments Peter Mandelson , then MP for Hartlepool , spent £ 2,981 on repairs to his constituency home , a receipt from 2003 shows .
Receipts also show he spent £ 100 a month on newspapers and £ 75 a month on gardening .
Between 2001 and 2003 , Margaret Beckett spent £ 12,170.67 on repairs - but in February 2006 she had her claim for gardening expenses partially rejected - £ 600 for plants and pergola disallowed .
Other expenditure revealed by the documents includes : Stevenage MP Barbara Follett , the wife of millionaire novelist Ken Follett , claimed more than £ 1,600 for window cleaning at her London home , with the cleaners visiting on 18 occasions at £ 94 - a- time during 2003 - 04 .
Mark Oaten , the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman who quit over a sex scandal , claimed £ 145 for a new bed and £ 99 for a mattress in January 2006 .
John Prescott claimed nearly £ 1,000 for gas and electricity costs for his constituency home in 2005 / 06 and spent £ 6,707 on repairs to his home .
Mr Brown 's claims include a Sky TV subscription and television licence , utility and council tax bills and charges for service , insurance and ground rent on an unspecified property .
Barring one small claim for a telephone bill , David Cameron 's expenses seem to consist only of claims for mortgage interest on his second home .
The documents also reveal Mr Prescott approached the Commons Department of Finance and Administration for guidance after press stories in 2005 over his decision to treat his grace - and - favour flat in Whitehall 's Admiralty House as his main residence , while claiming on council tax and other bills for his constituency home in Hull .
The practice , followed by many government ministers who enjoy free accommodation in London , has been repeatedly questioned on the grounds that the MPs involved do not have to meet the expenses of a second home .
But Mr Prescott was reassured in a phone conversation that it did not breach Commons rules , according to a handwritten note by an official .
Matthew Elliott , chief executive of the TaxPayers '
Alliance , said : " It 's clear that this allowance pays for far more than just a base in London - MPs use it to fund a lifestyle far more comfortable than their constituents enjoy . "
Home addresses MPs ' expenses are published every year under nine main headings - including the additional costs allowance ( ACA ) to cover the costs of running a second home .
But for most only the total claimed is published , rather than a detailed breakdown showing what items had been claimed for .
Freedom of Information campaigners argued that the limited nature of checks on claims , many of which did not require a receipt , meant the system was open to abuse and an Information Tribunal agreed it was " deeply unsatisfactory " .
Last week the High Court backed the tribunal 's ruling that details should be published and on Monday the Commons gave up its legal fight .
A detailed breakdown of the expenses of all MPs dating back to 2004 - likely to run to more than a million items - is due to be released in the autumn and in future the information will be released on a quarterly basis .
Home addresses will be published unless there is a specific concern about individual security - angering some MPs .
There are three addresses which have been blanked out in the material released earlier .
The Commons was allowed to do this only in the case of a specific security threat to the individuals involved .
The addresses blanked out are those of Gordon Brown 's flat in Westminster , Margaret Beckett 's constituency home in Derby , and the central London flat of Labour 's Alan and Ann Keen - but their other address in Brentford is revealed .
As well as the Keens ' other address , the documentation discloses home addresses at the time for Tony Blair , David Cameron , John Prescott , Mark Oaten , Sir Menzies Campbell , George Osborne and William Hague .
The 14 MPs and former MPs whose detailed expense claims were revealed in the three separate FOI requests were : Gordon Brown , Tony Blair , David Cameron , Sir Menzies Campbell , George Osborne , John Prescott , Margaret Beckett , William Hague , Mark Oaten , Peter Mandelson , Barbara Follett , Alan Keen , Ann Keen and John Wilkinson .

What are these ?
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Intel Corp INTC.O is rolling out five new Atom microprocessors and a collection of chips designed for portable gadgets that access the Internet and for other uses , as the world 's largest chipmaker uses its marketing muscle to help create a new market .
Intel 's
Atom processor wafer is seen with the eye of a needle in an image courtesy of the company .
REUTERS / Intel / Handout
The low - power , tiny Atom chips will come in speeds of up to 1.86 gigahertz and Intel says that speed , plus other technologies designed into the chip , make it the fastest processor that consumes 3 watts of electricity or less .
The recently named Atom family of processors is part of Intel ’s effort to have chips designed with Intel Architecture -- the fundamental blueprint of its semiconductors -- in myriad computing devices -- from what it calls mobile Internet devices , or MIDs , all the way up to high - performance computers .
Intel is making the announcements at its Intel Developer Forum conference on Wednesday in Shanghai , the company said .
“ Global Internet growth continues unabated , ” said Anand Chandrasekher , who runs Intel ’s Ultra Mobility Group .
“ The best Internet experience is still on the PC , but users want to carry that experience with them . ”
That is where the Atom and Centrino Atom , come in .
The Centrino Atom also includes a single - chip with integrated graphics called Intel System Controller Hub that allows for PC - like capabilities and long battery life for devices that fit in a user ’s pocket .
“ Intel is really pumping this category , ” said Roger Kay , an analyst with market research firm Endpoint Technologies Associates .
“ That said , mobile Internet is here .
For them this is really a great potential business . ”
Intel said that the features of the Atom processor -- the “ brains ” of an electronic device -- and its system controller hub would help device makers create a range of MIDs with differing functions and designs .
Chandrasekher said major device makers are already planning to adopt Atom , with more than 20 manufacturers coming out with products using the processor .
As far as MIDs , those will start shipping in May , he said .
He said Intel expects about 30 percent of those MIDs to have both WiFi -- short range high - speed wireless Internet access -- and WiMax -- longer - range high - speed access designed into them .
MID device makers include Asus , Fujitsu , Lenovo , NEC , Panasonic , Samsung , Sharp and Toshiba , among others , and prices will probably average about $ 500 , with some priced higher than that or lower , depending on the functions , Chandrasekher said in a telephone briefing ahead of his keynote speech at the IDF in Shanghai .
The small size of the Atom processor -- the die of the chip is less than 25 square millimeters , or about a 10th of the low - cost Celeron desktop and notebook PC chip -- also lets Intel target the embedded market .
Embedded chips are used in devices such as portable cash registers , robotics for industrial manufacturing , kiosks , patient monitoring and car “ infotainment ” systems .
The economics of the diminutive chip are appealing , Kay said , noting Intel gets nearly 2,700 Atom processors from a single dinner - plate - size silicon wafer .
He estimates Intel could yield about $ 30,000 per wafer with a gross margin of around 50 percent , not far off the gross margin of its mainstream PC chips .
He put Intel ’s approximate cost - per-chip for Atom at about $ 11 .
“ If you start looking at that number , then the profitability of one of these things sold at $ 45 , or even $ 160 , they ’re fantastically profitable , ” Kay said .
Still , do not expect the MID and this new market to take off right out of the gate .
“ The world often divides half way between the reality on the ground and where Intel would like it to go , ” Kay added .
“ It ’ll likely go a little more slowly than Intel would like . ”
Life on the most northerly inhabited island in Britain can be very tough indeed .
On Unst the winters are harsh , and the winds brutal and relentless , regularly sweeping across the treeless landscape at more than 100mph .
But Unst is the island chosen by a retired couple from Wiltshire to build one of the world 's greenest houses - a " zero carbon " home powered entirely by the wind and the sun .
It sits on the same latitude as southern Greenland , but will soon boast lemon trees , grapevines and green pepper plants in its greenhouse , an electric car powered by the wind , and floors heated by drawing warmth from the air .
The three - bedroom home designed by Michael and Dorothy Rea , near the shoreline of a secluded bay , has become a test bed for living " off - grid " : generating all their power from renewable sources , growing most of their food at home , and running a car without a petrol station .
Their home - built for just over £ 210,000 from an off - the - shelf timber framed house - has quietly become famous .
The Scottish executive in Edinburgh is using it as a benchmark for new sustainable house - building rules ; officials in the prime minister 's office watch its progress and Chinese officials are studying its innovative technologies for a new 5,000 - home eco-town in Guangzhou , in southern China .
Last year , the Reas learned that their website - zerocarbonhouse.com - was the fourth most popular site worldwide on Google .
Michael Rea is often up at 5 am answering emails from PhD students , green activists and even Canadian senators .
The Reas believe their home is the first of its kind .
" If we can do this here , anyone can do it anywhere , " said Dorothy , a former headteacher .
" It 's just an ordinary house .
It could be in Edinburgh ; it could be in Chigwell . "
" It 's definitely significant , " said Duncan Price , a director of one of the world 's largest green energy consultancies , ESD , and an advisor to the Reas .
" What 's very special is they 're trying to address the carbon impact of their whole lifestyle .
It 's a microcosm of how the world would be in a carbon - constrained future . "
It is one of several pioneering off - grid projects in remote areas of Scotland , where communities such as the islanders on Eigg in the inner Hebrides and another living on Scoraig , a remote peninsula near Ullapool in north - west Scotland , have developed their own independent green power sources .
Around 80 people living on Scoraig , which is only accessible by boat or with a five - mile trek overland , power their homes and businesses chiefly using small hand - made wind turbines designed by local resident Hugh Piggott , a guru of self - sufficient off - grid living .
Solar panels and diesel generators supplement the turbines .
In February , the islanders of Eigg , just south of Skye , switched on the UK 's first independent " green grid " .
It provides power to all the 45 homes and 20 businesses by combining electricity from wind turbines , solar panels and two small hydro- electric dams into a single supply .
For the first time , islanders can run fridges , electric kettles , satellite TVs and computers without using unreliable oil - powered generators .
Forced by their isolation to become self - sufficient , many observers believe these communities prove that micro-generation and home energy schemes are viable UK - wide .
Nick Rosen , author of How to Live Off - Grid , a handbook on off - grid communities , said : " It does n't mean we should all live like Scoraig but we should be fostering communities like it all over the place .
It increases the self - reliance of our society overall , in the event of sudden energy price hikes , the Russians cut off the gas or strikes in the oil industry . "
The Reas are not naive about the severity of Shetland 's weather or the scale of the challenge .
They erected the timber frame for their new home during a gale in November 2006 ; the strongest gusts threw heavy roof sections through the air , smashing one to the ground .
Shetland , the Reas note wryly , has the strongest and most reliable winds of any inhabited part of the world , closely followed by the Falkland islands .
But then they have striking views over a south - facing bay across to the low - slung , mottled green islands of Uyea , Fetlar and Yell .
In midsummer , the temperature can hit 30C and the sun never sets .
" I could foresee the time when energy would be very , very expensive , " Michael Rea said .
" But at first what we were doing was viewed as the black arts , but we were n't cranks .
We were ordinary people . "
Although they describe their home as normal , it will use advanced low - carbon technologies , many of which are being fitted this summer .
With help from Dundee University and Duchy College in Cornwall , they are building a greenhouse which uses hydroponics where their vegetables , fruit and herbs will be grown in a liquid with specially controlled lighting to create artificial " seasons " .
The University of Delaware is refitting a Toyota Yaris car with an electric engine .
Dogged and single - minded , Michael Rea has cajoled builders , banks and even the window firm Velux into sponsoring the project .
Eventually , the house will be lit by very low energy LED lights , the greenhouse will use electricity from its own wind turbine and the chief source of heating will be a heat pump which draws warmth from the air into an under - floor system .
" I have been waiting 24 years for this house to be built , " said Dorothy , 65 .
" But it 's just a standard house , an honest house , nothing fancy .
It 's a serious project in renewable design and energy efficiency , an experiment in joined - up technology , but it 's also a house we intend to grow old in . "
Explainer : How heat is harnessed
The house is very heavily insulated and its under - floor heating uses warmth drawn from the outside air and stored in a giant " water battery " .
Heat inside the house is captured by a ventilation system and reused .
Rainwater is harvested for toilets and the washing machine .
Large windows capture warmth from the sun .
Power for dishwasher , cooker , toaster , fridge , computers and lights comes from a wind turbine , which charges fuel cells able to store power for four days .
The house 's LED lights will use the same power as one 100W bulb .
The greenhouse will have its own wind turbine .
Plants will grow in high - nutrient hydroponic liquids , with special LED lights to create artificial seasons and daylight .
A converted battery - powered Toyota Yaris will be charged from the fuel cells .
THE COLBERT BUMP … .
Is it really true that congressional candidates who appear on Stephen Colbert ’s show do better than candidates who do n’t ?
Or is it merely truthy ?
Henry Farrell summarizes the surprising researchy answer from actual political scientist James Fowler :
Democratic candidates who appear on the Report receive a statistically significant “ Colbert bump ” in campaign donations , raising 44 % more money in a 30 - day period after appearing on the show .
However , there is no evidence of a similar boost for Republicans .
These results constitute the first scientific evidence of Stephen Colbert ’s influence on political campaigns .
Indeed .
Fowler explains his methodology here :
To evaluate absolute differences between Colbert candidates and others I use a Wilcoxon signed rank test .
This test is non-parametric , which is a super - cool term that means I do n’t assume that a histogram of the data produces a nice , “ normal ” bell shape .
In fact , I know the data does n’t look that way — it looks more like a skateboard ramp , starting high near zero and curving down sharply to become flat .
For percentage differences , I use a related non-parametric ( so cool ) test called the Mann Whitney U. I ’m sure Stephen will be pleased that there is a “ man ” in his statistical test ( though what kind of a man calls himself ‘ Whitney ’ ? ) .
And of course there are graphs .
What kind of scientificy research would it be if it did n’t have graphs ?

PALO ALTO , California ( Reuters ) -
For the second time this week , a senior Federal Reserve official conceded the United States economy could slip into recession , but suggested the central bank should wait to see if more rate cuts are needed .
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke gathers his papers as he waits to testify in front of the Senate Banking Committee on Capitol Hill , April 3 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jim Bourg
“ The economy has all but stalled and could contract over the first half of the year , ” San Francisco Federal Reserve President Janet Yellen , who is not a voter on the policy - setting committee in 2008 , said on Thursday .
“ Current indicators suggest that , starting in the fourth quarter , the economy , at best , slowed to a crawl , ” she said , adding later that the Fed is still battling a “ negative feedback loop ” of tight credit conditions , falling house prices and low consumer confidence .
Yellen ’s remarks , in a speech to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research , echoed those from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke during testimony to a Congressional Joint Economic Committee on Wednesday .
“ Recession is possible , ” Bernanke said .
“ There ’s a chance that for the first half as a whole , there might be a slight contraction . ”
But , like Bernanke , Yellen declined to point the way toward additional interest rate cuts to pull the economy out of its malaise .
Instead , she forecast a minor pickup in growth in the second half on the back of rate cuts already in the pipeline , and “ timely ” fiscal stimulus checks -- even though the drag from falling house prices will linger into 2009 .
Yellen told reporters that she was “ very uncertain ” on the outlook for interest rates , especially over the next few Fed policy meetings .
WAGE - PRICE SPIRAL
Earlier on Thursday , Bernanke said the full benefit of the Fed ’s series of rate cuts has not yet been felt , given the lag between the Fed ’s actions and their impact on the economy that may reduce the need for many more rate moves ahead .
“ Further actions will have to depend on how the economy evolves , and we are looking of course at both sides of our mandate , growth and inflation , ” Bernanke told a U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing on the rescue of troubled investment bank Bear Stearns .
Yellen said the Fed is mindful of heading off any chance of a 1970s - style wage - price spiral by cutting rates too far at a time energy and food prices are stubbornly high .
“ ACCOMMODATIVE ”
There is a risk that “ our attempts to deal with problems in the real economy could lead to higher inflation expectations and an erosion of our credibility , ” she said .
U.S. headline consumer inflation was 4 percent in February year - on - year .
The Fed has slashed its benchmark lending rate by 3 percentage points since mid-September , to 2.25 percent .
The funds rate is now “ accommodative , ” at a real , or inflation - adjusted , level of zero or slightly above zero , Yellen said .
Some
Fed watchers expect stiff opposition from inflation hawks to pushing the funds rate to a negative real level given the threat of inflation .
In March , Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher and Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser voted against the Fed ’s aggressive 75 basis point rate cut .
Bernanke also stressed on Thursday that the Fed was uncomfortable with the current high levels of inflation , while arguing that these pressures should abate in the months ahead .
“ The primary reason for the high inflation is rapid increases in the price of globally traded commodities , including crude oil and food , ” he said .
Speaking in New York on Thursday , Federal Reserve Board Governor Frederic Mishkin said troubles in financial markets should not prompt the Fed to let down its guard against inflation .
Mishkin conceded in a speech to the Princeton Club that struggling credit markets have become a major drag on U.S. economic growth .
“ This financial disruption has a very contractionary effect , ” he said .

Saving gas is really about saving money — so it ’s not necessarily a smart move to sell whatever you ’re driving now ( even if it ’s a big SUV ) in order to buy a more “ efficient ” car .
You could lose a pile of money on your old vehicle — especially if it ’s still pretty new and so still in the steepest part of its depreciation curve , which lasts from the day you drive it home from the dealer until it ’s about five years old .
And if you ’re spending thousands — maybe tens of thousands — on a new car , it does n’t necessarily matter how good it is on gas .
Money spent is money spent — on $ 4 per gallon fuel or a $ 25,000 “ economical ” car .
So , what can you do to ease the pinch a little ?
You might be surprised .
And the good news is it probably wo n’t cost you anything — yet could save you a bunch .
1 ) Smooth And Steady Driving
What burns the most gas is getting your vehicle moving , not keeping it moving .
So the longer you can maintain forward momentum without coming to a complete stop , the less fuel you will consume .
For example , try to anticipate red - green traffic lights cycles — and keep your vehicle moving just fast enough that you get to the next red just as it ’s about to go green .
Let it coast gradually , using its own momentum ; then pick up speed again as traffic ahead begins to move forward .
Try to accelerate — and decelerate — gradually and smoothly .
The main thing is to try to avoid having to come to a complete stop whenever it ’s possible to do so while still maintaining decent speed and not being obnoxious to other drivers .
In city - suburban traffic , this is very doable .
It ’s also kind of relaxing , actually .
And not only will you save a surprising amount of gas , you ’ll notice your brakes and tires last longer , too .
2 ) Taking Advantage Of The “ Sweet Spot ”
Your car ’s sweet spot — the speed at which it is most fuel - efficient — is approximately 45 - 60 mph .
This just happens to coincide with the speed limit on many secondary roads .
By choosing a more roundabout route , you can enjoy the scenery as well as up your MPG .
Traffic congestion has also reduced the average rush hour speeds on highways in and around major population hubs — making it feasible to drive more slowly than the fastest - moving traffic without being a pain in the neck to your fellow motorists .
Just be sure to keep right — and yield to faster moving traffic .
3 ) Making Yourself Slippery
Not in the political sense ; the aerodynamic one .
The less your vehicle has to fight its way through a wall of air , the lower its fuel consumption will be .
If you drive a pick - up truck , for example , you can swap out the tailgate for a mesh net that holds cargo just as effectively — but allows the air that would otherwise be pushing against the raised tailgate to slip right on by .
If you have a car , keep the windows rolled up — and use your air conditioner .
It is more energy efficient than keeping the windows open at highway speeds — which creates drag , which forces your engine to burn more fuel than it otherwise would need to .
Even with the AC on .
And if you have a vehicle with roof racks that can be easily removed , consider removing them — especially if you rarely use them anyhow .
The less clutter on your car ’s exterior , the more efficient its shape will be – and the less fuel it will consume .
4 ) Getting Into Overdrive
Perhaps the single best improvement , efficiency - wise , of the past 25 years is the overdrive transmission .
Simply put , in top gear , an overdrive transmission reduces the engine speed ( RPMs ) that would otherwise be necessary to maintain that speed .
A modern car with an overdrive transmission can truck along at 65 mph with its engine barely turning over a fast idle ( under 2,000 RPMs ) while an otherwise similar car from the 1970s without an overdrive would have its engine spinning 800 - 1,000 RPMs faster at the same road speed — and burning up a lot more gas .
You can make the most of overdrive by using it as much as possible — without lugging the engine , of course .
Most modern cars can be shifted into OD at around 40 mph on a level road — and have enough available power to maintain that speed without having to downshift .
With a manual - equipped car you can do this for yourself , of course .
But it ’s also possible to encourage an automatic to shift up into OD at around 40 - 45 mph by simply easing back on the gas — at which point the transmission should slide into overdrive .
( You can tell this has happened by watching your tachometer and noting the RPM drop . )
If you have an automatic - equipped car with a “ sport ” setting , only use it when you want to have fun .
Otherwise , you ’ll be wasting gas as the “ sport ” setting typically causes the transmission to hold gears longer before upshifting and may even lock out overdrive completely .
5 ) Add Some Air
By now you have probably heard about the importance of not driving on under - inflated tires .
Fuel economy can drop by as much as 5 - 10 percent if you do .
Well , another way to save even more gas is to inflate your tires to the maximum recommended pressure listed on the sidewall — which may be a couple of PSI higher than the “ normal ” pressure listed in your owner ’s manual .
This will decrease rolling resistance — so your car will get going ( and stay going ) more easily and with less fuel consumption .
The same trick is used by some hybrid vehicles and other ultra-efficiency cars to wring out the best - possible mileage .
The downside is you ’ll notice the ride quality may suffer — and your tires might not last as long as they used to .
But if you can eke an extra couple of MPGs out of your car , the savings could make the trade - off worth it .

Federal renewable energy tax credits , Congress ’ favorite subject to debate but do little about , has once again been brought to the Senate floor .
But because the amendment still has no funding mechanism suitable for pay - go rules , I would argue it stands little [ social_buttons ] chance of passage .
Pay - go compels new spending and tax law changes to not add to the federal deficit , or if they do , they must create some sort of offset somewhere else in the budget [ read more about pay - go ] .
In a wonky twist that would alter the clean energy incentive structure in this country rather significantly , Senators Alexander ( R - TN ) and Kyl ( R - AZ ) offered an amendment ( S. Amdt 4429 ) that would extend the production tax credit for two years ( instead of one ) for wind , geothermal , biomass , landfill gas , small hydro , and wave and tidal power .
But the provision would also cut the production tax credit for wind in half and spread the funding out more evenly across technologies .
“ I would argue that wind is over - subsidized , ” said Alexander .
“ Wind is a proven technology … and this amendment would focus on emerging baseload technologies . ”
The amendments are being considered as part of a housing and foreclosure package and they are completely unrelated to the House ’s Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act ( H.R. 3221 ) , which would have rolled back tax breaks for oil companies in order to pay for the renewable tax incentives .
The tax package last fell short of passage in the Senate in February – by a margin of one vote .

Former Vice President Al Gore is about to launch a major advertising campaign to raise awareness of global warming and will appear on 60 Minutes this Sunday to promote it .
In a brief teaser for the interview aired by CBS , Leslie Stahl says to Gore , " There 's still a lot of skepticism about whether global warming is man-made . "
" I do n't think there 's a lot , " Gore replies .
" You 're talking about Dick Cheney ? "
" I think those people are in such a tiny , tiny minority now with their point of view , " Gore continues .
" They 're almost like the ones who still believe that the Moon landing was staged in a movie lot in Arizona and those who believe the world is flat . "
Following the clip , Stahl explained to CBS that Gore 's objective in his ad campaign is to heighten the sense of urgency about global warming by featuring pairs of " people who do n't agree anything but this " -- such as Al Sharpton and Pat Robertson , or Newt Gingrich and Nancy Pelosi -- sitting side by side to discuss the issue .
Stahl also emphasized that her overall impression of Gore was " how relaxed he is ... and really how happy he is . "

" That 's the third one I 've seen today , " our new friend points out , " What 's going on ? "
I explain that we 're doctors of journalism heading out to Reno / Fernley Raceway to wring out the GT - R with the rest of the hacks .
" That thing is so over - hyped .
Let 's see what it can do . "
With only a few seconds to calibrate my moral compass , he begins counting down .
" Three , two , one , GO ! "
He takes off with a minimum of wheel spin and I lay into the throttle about a half second too late .
The GT - R bogs slightly off the line ( no time for launch control ) and then rockets towards the horizon in chase .
My lame launch put us about ten feet off the Z06's bumper , and with the throttle pegged to the floor , the rear - mounted , dual - clutch gear box runs through the ratios in full automatic mode .
Our necks are jolted back at each shift and we can feel our spines forming a valley in the suede - covered buckets .
You know the stats ; you can do the math .
The Z06 is around 3,100 pounds and comes packing 505 hp .
The GT- R is down 25 horsepower and is almost 700 pounds heavier .
But in defiance of the laws of physics , the distance between us never changes .
And it continues down our imaginary quarter - mile before we brake simultaneously and make a quick left into a row of homes to talk shop and take a few photos .
" The guys on the ' Vette forum are n't going to believe this , " Rich says as he snaps away on his disposable camera .
" It 's way faster than I would 've thought .
" This same scenario will be played out in a hundred different cities at a hundred different traffic lights when customers finally begin taking delivery of the 2,000 Nissan GT - Rs bound for the U.S. this summer .
After years of speculation , spy shots rumors , lies and nail - biting anticipation , the GT - R is finally here , and make no mistake , it 's epic .
We started our trek outside Incline Village on the northern side of Lake Tahoe and made our way through the sparsely populated towns that dot the Nevada landscape .
The mixture of minimalist urban areas , mind - numbing desert expanses and undulating roads provided us with just enough time to get acquainted with the GT - R's road - going civility and techy toys before we arrived at the track .
First impression : " This thing is chunky . "
You can deride the GT - R's styling if you must -- and it certainly is n't pretty -- but it 's purposeful .
Nissan spent two years in the wind tunnel refining the GT - R's shape to achieve a Cd of .27 .
Every crease , bulge and kink is there for an explicit purpose .
The " aero - blades " on the fenders optimize airflow around the tires and the front fascia , vents and C - pillar work in concert with the underbody diffuser and spoiler to provide maximum down force at speed .
But the GT - R's shape proves the old adage that beauty is n't skin deep .
The 3.8 - liter twin - turbocharged V6 is , in Nissan 's own words , a tour de force .
Making 480 hp at 6,400 RPM and 430 lb.- ft. of torque between 3,200 and 5,200 RPM , the engine works double duty – pure efficiency and utter insanity .
The VR38DETT is hand built by a single technician in a climate - controlled clean room after the bores are plasma - sprayed to reduce friction and increase cooling .
The symmetrically independent intake and exhaust plumbing is shortened for efficiency and the dual IHI turbos are practically married to the exhaust ports on the head .
And with a thermostatically controlled oil cooling system , complete with a scavenger pump maintaining oil pressure to the turbos , no amount of lateral Gs will keep the slippery stuff from getting where it needs to be .
All that , and it still gets a ULEV rating .
As impressive as the engine is , the transmission , chassis and all - wheel - drive system left us in awe .
As you 're already aware , Nissan developed its first dual - clutch gearbox for use in the GT -R , with six speeds available through either the steering wheel - mounted paddle shifters or automatically controlled by the computer ( shifts take place in .2 - seconds when in " R " mode ) .
The engine sends power to a carbon fiber driveshaft and on to the rear - mounted gearbox , while another steel driveshaft is mounted to the right ( underneath the passenger side ) and can send up to 50 - percent of the torque to the front wheels when the ATTESA E -TS all - wheel - drive computer senses a loss of grip .
The system has more sensors than the FCC , with one keeping track of steering angle , another monitoring lateral and transverse acceleration , plus systems that keep tabs on speed , tire slip , road surface and yaw rate , and then dolling out power as it sees fit .
Otherwise , 100 - percent of the power is delivered to the rear – exactly as God intended .
We were surprised that Nissan did n't employ a traditional torque tube to house the main drive shaft and mate the engine to the transmission .
According to the Nissan crew , the motor and tranny mounts , along with the cross members , are so stiff that utilizing a torque tube would have upset the balance of the vehicle when powering out of corners .
Once Hal deems a wheel , or wheels , worthy of motivation , power is sent to 20 - inch rollers , sized 9.5 - inches wide up front and 10.5 - inches in the rear .
Nissan tapped its long - time partner , Rays Engineering , to supply the hoops , and made it a point to include bead knurling on the inside of the wheels to prevent the tires from shifting under high cornering loads – something that was apparently a problem while testing at the Nurburgring .
The nitrogen - filled , Bridgestone run-flats we used on our drive are the same tires found on the Premium model , but Dunlops are standard and Nissan will be offering Blizzaks if you decide to test out the Snow setting on the ATTESA system .
As with the engine and transmission , the suspension is another masterpiece of modern automotive engineering .
The GT-R is suspended by independent double - wishbones in the front and a multi- link rear setup , and uses a model - specific version of Bilstein 's DampTronic system ( similar to that used on Porsches ) that provides even more information for the computer to sort out when pushing the GT -R to the limits .
The interior , like the exterior , is form following function .
The thrones are incredibly comfortable and provide some serious bolstering , although we noticed that the driver seat might be a bit wider than the passenger seat .
The rear seats certainly looked nice , but the absolutely laughable rear legroom prevented us from even considering spending time out back .
With our right foot on the brake , we pressed the red start / stop button mounted on the center console , heard a barely audible whine under the unenthusiastic hum of the V6 and then slotted the gear selector into drive .
All the controls -- the paddle shifters , steering wheel - mounted switches , climate dials and in - car computer buttons -- are clearly marked and easy to read .
Overall , the switchgear has a crisp feel , but you never forget that you 're still in a Nissan .
Some of the plastics are n't top- shelf , and the HVAC knobs lack any kind of tactility , but most of the materials were better than expected and the leather inserts on the dash , doors and center console did their best to elevate the rest of the interior .
But honestly , we just do n't care .
Bigger things are on the horizon and we 're still an hour away from the track .
Our first sampling of the GT - R's prodigious thrust came a few minutes before our showdown with the Z06 .
A line of cars strung along by an octogenarian in a PT Cruiser going 15 mph under the speed limit threatened to separate us from the rest of the GT - R parade .
We grabbed the paddle shifter once , twice and then a third time , confirmed the number " 3 " on the dash - mounted gear display and then squeezed the throttle .
The revs were already on boil by the time we blew past the first car in the convoy ; then the second , the third , the fourth , gear change , the sixth and then grandpa was a speck in our rear - view mirror .
The whole maneuver lasted all of seven seconds , and at no point did we feel like the GT - R was breaking a sweat .
On the other hand , we temporarily lost the will to breathe .
It was the kind of visceral immediacy we 've only experienced in a handful of vehicles that cost twice as much and come equipped with far more drama .
The weighting of the steering wheel was one of the first things that struck us .
It 's heavy , but not daunting , and it matches the bulky feeling the GT - R conveys through the seat .
It feels planted and composed on the road -- more grand - tourer than apex assassin .
And then we hit the first set of curves and our preconceptions vanished .
The GT - R still felt heavy , but hardly ponderous .
The steering was precise and immediate , and it was obvious that there was plenty of power in reserve as we climbed through the hills .
Our pace quickened , our confidence grew and then as quickly as that superb bit of tarmac began , it ended and we were back on the highway enjoying a suspension on the firm side of bearable .
When we finally arrived at Reno / Fernley , about 20 minutes late after our aforementioned indiscretion , the track reps were already giving their presentation .
After making sure we understood the layout and would n't test the limits of their liability insurance , we were out on the track getting the lay of the land .
The course was technical , with a couple of chicanes , a few low - speed turns , off - camber corners and several high - speed sweepers that would cause any car to lose its composure unless driver inputs were smooth and consistent .
During our first three - lap stint , we took it relatively easy , braking early , accelerating smoothly and generally taking our time as we tried to find the line .
By the second go -' round , our pace had increased , our confidence had grown and it was obvious that we were about to screw the proverbial pooch .
And we did .
With the Race mode engaged on the dampers and transmission , we barreled down the back straight , eventually hitting fourth gear and braking woefully late for a quick left and right .
The GT - R scrubbed off as much speed as it could with two wheels barely contacting the tarmac and then we laid into the throttle , hoping to power out of the bend .
Understeer .
Loads of it .
With the wheel almost locked to the right , we slid 15 feet towards the curbing on our left .
A quick lift off the throttle , a correction on the wheel and we were back on line heading into the steep banking of turn seven .
We pulled off into the pits to reassess everything we held dear about the advanced electronics and their role with our ham fists at the wheel .
We had to learn from the best , so we walked over to the only red GT - R in attendance , sat down in the passenger 's seat and introduced ourselves to Steve Millen .
If you do n't know Steve Millen , look it up .
In short , the man 's a racing and tuning legend and knows as much about Nissan as Mr. K himself .
" You ready ? "
Millen asks as I double - check the strap on my helmet .
" Definitely , " I reply , as the corner worker gives us a wave onto the track .
Millen lays into the long pedal and sets up for the first slight right .
He almost clips the apex cone and then heads up the hill into turn two with the right tires inches away from the desert sands that surround the track .
He lifts , down shifts and chucks the wheel to the left , countersteering slightly while applying judicious amounts of throttle .
We rocket out of the corner and up into the chicane at the top of the hill .
A quick yank to the left , then the right and he's back on the power grabbing one gear after another as we eat up the back straight and head into the bends that eluded me minutes earlier .
The massive Brembos are applied within an inch of their life and the only thing stopping my heart from landing on the dashboard is the seat belt across my chest .
He flicks the wheel left , gives it a touch of gas , and then yanks the wheel right and powers out , tracking smoothly to the curbing .
It 's obvious now .
The GT -R must be manhandled .
After two more laps with Mr. M , I get back behind the wheel with my newfound knowledge and give it another go .
This time , it all clicks .
My lines are cleaner , my brake points are well defined and my steering inputs are much sharper , but hardly as smooth .
For a vehicle on the high side of two tons , the GT - R is eminently chuckable .
Come into a corner , brake late , yank the wheel in the desired direction , start feeding in the throttle and then boot it – let the electronics sort out the rest .
It 's a revelatory machine and there 's nothing on the road that can even come close for the money .
And that may have been the biggest revelation .
The Nissan GT - R maxes out the bang - for - the - buck quotient like no other vehicle , but does so in a way that will only appeal to a select group of drivers .
Whereas the similarly priced Z06 is the culmination of decades of refining the traditional FR arrangement , the GT - R takes everything Nissan knows about physics and speed and condenses it into a cohesive package that changes your very perception about what 's possible behind the wheel .
It wo n't bend the space - time continuum , but it comes closer than anything before it .
And like the Skyline GT - Rs of yore , it has the potential to revolutionize everything we as drivers hold dear .

On a large scale , the Milky Way is considered to be a vast cold region punctured with isolated hot clouds and star clusters .
While much of this space is cold and empty , researchers have recently discovered the phenomenon of funneling hot plasma .
Flowing plasma may funnel from one region to another through empty space , connecting otherwise isolated clouds and clusters throughout the galaxy .
Researcher Manuel Güdel at the Paul Scherrer Institut in Switzerland and colleagues from Switzerland , France and the US have recently observed the plasma flow phenomenon for the first time in the Orion Nebula .
Based on images taken with an x-ray satellite called the XMM - Newton , the researchers observed the existence of a million - degree plasma flowing from the nebula into the adjacent interstellar medium , and then into the neighboring superbubble Eridanus .
“ Although there has been a theoretical model that predicted hot gas bubbles blown by just one massive star , such has not been detected until we found confirmation in the Orion Nebula , ” Güdel told PhysOrg.com .
“ We did n't look for it - we actually found this diffuse emission by chance while looking at the many stellar x-ray point sources in the field .
As previous researchers have not reported diffuse x-ray emission from such star - forming regions but were rather arguing against its presence , we were indeed surprised to find such prominent emission across large regions of the nebula . ”
The Orion Nebula hosts several thousand young stars ( less than a few million years old ) , and almost every one of these stars vigorously emits x-rays .
The satellite ’s cameras observed the x-ray stars , but it also picked up a separate , fainter emission in the extended parts of the nebula .
Upon investigating the spectrum of this emission , the scientists discovered that the energy indicated a million - degree plasma .
A dense veil of neutral gas probably hid the hot plasma from previous observations , such as those by the Chandra X - ray Observatory , which did n’t detect a thing .
Not only did the researchers discover a new phenomenon , but they think they know what causes the super - hot , large - scale plasma .
As the scientists explain , the energy required to heat such a monstrous gas is “ severe . ”
The young stars in the Orion Nebula do n’t seem capable of hosting such a hot , energetic structure .
But the researchers think that sufficient energy could come from the high velocity winds emitted by stars in a dense region in the nebula called the Trapezium – a small group of massive stars that is almost solely responsible for the optical light we see from the Orion Nebula .
The winds from the Trapezium stars colliding with the surrounding gas could generate enough kinetic energy to create shock waves that can heat up the gas to millions of degrees .
In most cases , such a hot plasma would stay confined in its cavity , contained by gases and dust that do n’t mix with the plasma .
But in this case , the plasma and the surrounding cooler gas have very similar pressures , and this near - pressure equilibrium makes it possible for the plasma to leak out of its cavity and into cool interstellar space .
Flowing at a velocity of a few tens of kilometers per second , it likely heads toward the nearby Eridanus superbubble , replenishing this vast interstellar region with hot gas .
The discovery of the pervading plasma in Orion is unusual because such a large - scale plasma was previously thought to require large groups of massive stars for its energy source , which are n’t found in the Orion Nebula .
If hot plasma can occur in a region with a small number of massive stars , the phenomenon might be more common in the galaxy than astronomers previously thought .
“ Hot gas has been seen in some extremely massive star - formation regions , and some of this gas might have been produced by supernova explosions , ” said Güdel .
“ However , the Orion Nebula is the first region of its ( more modest ) kind that shows this phenomenon , and there is no supernova that can account for it .
Such more modest regions of star formation are naturally more frequent in the galaxy than the more extreme cases .
Therefore , we believe that plasma outflows from star - forming regions are widespread . ”
As the researchers learn more about the possibilities that can occur in our galaxy , they also better understand the early history of our Sun and our Solar System , and maybe others like it .
“ The hot gas and the X - rays that it emits interact with the cool , molecular environment in which stars form , ” said Güdel .
“ It may influence the environment of stars – for example , circumstellar accretion disks in which planets form – by contributing to the ionization of those disks .
Such effects need further study , though . ”

A telescopic camera in orbit around Mars caught a view of NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander suspended from its parachute during the lander 's successful arrival at Mars Sunday evening , May 25 .
The image from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) on NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter marks the first time ever one spacecraft has photographed another one in the act of landing on Mars .
Meanwhile , scientists pored over initial images from Phoenix , the first ever taken from the surface of Mars ' polar regions .
Phoenix returned information that it was in good health after its first night on Mars , and the Phoenix team sent the spacecraft its to - do list for the day .
" We can see cracks in the troughs that make us think the ice is still modifying the surface , " said Phoenix Principal Investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona , Tucson .
" We see fresh cracks .
Cracks can't be old .
They would fill in .
" Camera pointing for the image from HiRISE used navigational information about Phoenix updated on landing day .
The camera team and Phoenix team would not know until the image was sent to Earth whether it had actually caught Phoenix .
" We saw a few other bright spots in the image first , but when we saw the parachute and the lander with the cords connecting them , there was no question , " said HiRISE Principal Investigator Alfred McEwen , also of the University of Arizona .
" I 'm floored .
I 'm absolutely floored , " said Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
A team analyzing what can be learned from the Phoenix descent through the Martian atmosphere will use the image to reconstruct events .
HiRISE usually points downward .
For this image , the pointing was at 62 degrees , nearly two - thirds of the way from straight down to horizontal .
To tilt the camera , the whole orbiter must tilt .
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was already pointed toward the expected descent path of Phoenix to record radio transmissions from Phoenix .
McEwen said , " We 've never taken an image at such an oblique angle before .
" Monday 's tasks for Phoenix include checkouts of some instruments and systems , plus additional imaging of the lander 's surroundings .
The Phoenix mission is led by Smith at the University of Arizona with project management at JPL and development partnership at Lockheed Martin , Denver .
International contributions come from the Canadian Space Agency ; the University of Neuchatel , Switzerland ; the universities of Copenhagen and Aarhus , Denmark ; Max Planck Institute , Germany ; and the Finnish Meteorological Institute .

The Matrix may be the future of virtual reality , but researchers say the Grid is the future of collaborative problem - solving .
More than 400 scientists gathered at the Global Grid Forum this week to discuss what may be the Internet 's next evolutionary step .
Though distributed computing evokes associations with populist initiatives like SETI@home , where individuals donate their spare computing power to worthy projects , the Grid will link PCs to each other and the scientific community like never before .
The Grid will not only enable sharing of documents and MP3 files , but also connect PCs with sensors , telescopes and tidal - wave simulators .
IBM 's Brian Carpenter suggested " computing will become a utility just like any other utility . "
Carpenter said , " The Grid will open up ... storage and transaction power in the same way that the Web opened up content . "
And just as the Internet connects various public and private networks , Cisco Systems ' Bob Aiken said , " you 're going to have multiple grids , multiple sets of middleware that people are going to choose from to satisfy their applications . "
As conference moderator Walter Hoogland suggested , " The World Wide Web gave us a taste , but the Grid gives a vision of an ICT ( Information and Communication Technology ) - enabled world . "
Though the task of standardizing everything from system templates to the definitions of various resources is a mammoth one , the GGF can look to the early days of the Web for guidance .
The Grid that organizers are building is a new kind of Internet , only this time with the creators having a better knowledge of where the bottlenecks and teething problems will be .
The general consensus at the event was that although technical issues abound , the thorniest issues will involve social and political dimensions , for example how to facilitate sharing between strangers where there is no history of trust .
Amsterdam seemed a logical choice for the first Global Grid Forum because not only is it the world 's most densely cabled city , it was also home to the Internet Engineering Task Force 's first international gathering in 1993 .
The IETF has served as a model for many of the GGF 's activities : protocols , policy issues , and exchanging experiences .
The Grid Forum , a U.S. - based organization combined with eGrid - the European Grid Forum , and Asian counterparts to create the Global Grid Forum ( GGF ) in November , 2000 .
The Global Grid Forum organizers said grid communities in the United States and Europe will now run in synch .
The Grid evolved from the early desire to connect supercomputers into " metacomputers " that could be remotely controlled .
The word " grid " was borrowed from the electricity grid , to imply that any compatible device could be plugged in anywhere on the Grid and be guaranteed a certain level of resources , regardless of where those resources might come from .
Scientific communities at the conference discussed what the compatibility standards should be , and how extensive the protocols need to be .
As the number of connected devices runs from the thousands into the millions , the policy issues become exponentially more complex .
So far , only draft consensus has been reached on most topics , but participants say these are the early days .
As with the Web , the initial impetus for a grid came from the scientific community , specifically high - energy physics , which needed extra resources to manage and analyze the huge amounts of data being collected .
The most nettlesome issues for industry are security and accounting .
But unlike the Web , which had security measures tacked on as an afterthought , the Grid is being designed from the ground up as a secure system .
Conference participants debated what types of services ( known in distributed computing circles as resource units ) provided through the Grid will be charged for .
And how will the administrative authority be centralized ?
Corporations have been slow to cotton to this new technology 's potential , but the suits are in evidence at this year 's Grid event .
As GGF chairman Charlie Catlett noted , " This is the first time I 've seen this many ties at a Grid forum . "
In addition to IBM , firms such as Boeing , Philips and Unilever are already taking baby steps toward the Grid .
Though commercial needs tend to be more transaction - focused than those of scientific pursuits , most of the technical requirements are common .
Furthermore , both science and industry participants say they require a level of reliability that 's not offered by current peer - to - peer initiatives : Downloading from Napster , for example , can take seconds or minutes , or might not work at all .
Garnering commercial interest is critical to the Grid 's future .
Cisco's Aiken explained that " if grids are really going to take off and become the major impetus for the next level of evolution in the Internet , we have to have something that allows ( them ) to easily transfer to industry . "
Other potential Grid components include creating a virtual observatory , and doctors performing simulations of blood flows .
While some of these applications have existed for years , the Grid will make them routine rather than exceptional .
The California Institute of Technology 's Paul Messina said that by sharing computing resources , " you get more science from the same investment . "
Ian Foster of the University of Chicago said that Web precursor Arpanet was initially intended to be a distributed computing network that would share CPU - intensive tasks but instead wound up giving birth to e-mail and FTP .
The Grid may give birth to a global file - swapping network or a members - only citadel for moneyed institutions .
But just as no one ten years ago would have conceived of Napster – not to mention AmIHotOrNot.com – the future of the Grid is unknown .
An associated DataGrid conference continues until Friday , focusing on a project in which resources from Pan-European research institutions will analyze data generated by a new particle collider being built at Swiss particle - physics lab CERN .

No one has ever died from inflation directly , yet it constitutes a serious threat to our existence .
By ' inflation ' I mean a policy of increasing the money supply , the root cause of the booms that inevitably go bust .
Using this traditional idea of inflation -- which , it should be mentioned , is regarded as contrived by most economists today -- in what sense can it be considered so dangerous ?
Especially when a simple perusal of the facts suggests otherwise .
Consider the political landscape .
Can you name a country whose government or government - friendly central bank does n't inflate its currency ?
I can't .
A central bank that did n't inflate the money supply would n't be doing its job .
Central bankers talk about price stability and fostering maximum employment , but they exist to prop up the big commercial banks and the government , and they do that by printing money ( shorthand for ' open market ' purchases ) .
As far as I know , every country on earth is exposed to inflationist policies , and not one -- not even Germany in the 1920s , Hungary in the 1940s , or Bolivia in the 1980s , as examples where inflation hit the stratosphere -- has perished because of inflation .
Even in Zimbabwe , where the government has worked overtime to destroy their currency , people are surviving .
They 're even trying to hold an election .
Most people regard elections as the hallmark of civilization .
In addition , there is almost universal agreement among economists that some inflation is necessary for a smooth - running economy .
If the experts are correct , the implication of their position is obvious : if anything , the lack of inflation is a threat to our survival .
Even Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman , who became the spokesperson for free markets in spite of interventionist policy recommendations , thought people should not be free to choose about inflation .
For decades , Friedman thought it would be a good idea if the Fed set up a rule about how much to inflate , then followed that rule faithfully , though late in life he apparently backed away from this view .
And though Lord Keynes has lost some of his luster since the stagflation days of the 1970s , he 's still a popular icon among policymakers .
You could comb the economics departments of the finest universities , knock on the door of any think tank , scour the blogs , talk to any politician , and only rarely trip over a renegade who condemns inflation altogether .
Most of them seem to view inflation as they would a vitamin supplement : essential to good health , as long as you do n't overdo it .
Ben Bernanke co-authored a book called Inflation Targeting in which he said that ' low , stable inflation is monetary policy 's primary long - run goal . ' [ p .
4 ] Ben Bernanke taught himself calculus as a teenager , scored 1590 out of 1600 on the SAT , graduated summa cum laude from Harvard , earned his Ph.D. from MIT , taught at Stanford , chaired the economics department at Princeton .
Ben Bernanke is now head of the most powerful central bank in the history of the world .
Ben Bernanke , a family man and one of the smartest men alive -- truly -- believes in the beneficial effects of the U.S. government 's printing press .
What possible evidence could exist to suggest that inflation is a threat to our survival ?
Ideas shape the world
The most popular idea in the world is freedom : ' the power to act or speak or think without externally imposed restraints . '
But if this is true , how come it keeps slipping away ?
In a word , government .
The more government there is , the less freedom we have .
And government grows best when it engages in war .
As many writers have noted , World War I was a watershed event in the 20th Century .
The blunders and delusions of the warring governments had to be paid for , and prior to the assassination that provoked the outbreak of war in 1914 , all the governments were managing what they called the gold standard . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
It is no coincidence that with the exception of the U.S. , which entered the war late , they all abandoned this standard when they decided to settle their differences in battle .
The alternative would 've been to raise taxes to an intolerable level .
Politicians were well aware that support for the war would fade fast , even with their propaganda machines running at redline , if people knew how much it was costing them .
Better for their war plans to suspend gold redemption and run the printing presses .
Consider for a moment what the governments did n't do .
They did n't say to their central banks or treasuries , ' Go dig up tons more gold .
We 're going to war , and we 'll need the money to pay for it . '
It sounds ludicrous because everyone knows it could n't be done .
Gold is too hard to find and extract .
Government has no use for a money that 's scarce : it limits its reach .
It limits its reach by limiting its ability to inflate . [ 3 ]
Not even the horrendous level of casualties turned the public against the war .
They were told the enemy was a threat to civilization and had to be wiped out at all costs , and the civilians believed that the privations they endured , including higher taxes , was the price they were paying .
Most people did n't understand the printing press effect .
After the war , with their currencies badly debased , governments adopted gold standards made of straw , and thus it was easy to scapegoat gold when the Depression arrived .
After the breakdown of subsequent international monetary agreements , the world today is on competing fiat standards , with the gold standard regarded as a barbarous relic and the Fed growing stronger with each crisis it creates .
Where 's the lethal threat of inflation ?
War requires massive funds , and the easiest way to get them is with the government 's printing press .
And therein lies inflation 's grave danger , as this exchange from The Flight of the Barbarous Relic suggests :
' What would that do for war if governments had to pay for it with taxes ? '
' Make it an endangered species . '
' So if you 're a government bent on war ' "
' Inflation is a sacred cow . '
If inflation is viewed solely as the systematic depreciation of our currency and the cause of financial crises , it might crush us financially but it would n't necessarily destroy our civilization .
But in its function as a stealth tax , especially as it helps government bankroll unnecessary wars in an age of nuclear and biological weapons , it stands as a threat to all human life .
' War is the health of the state , ' Randolph Bourne proclaimed in 1918 . [ 4 ]
Given inflation 's indispensable role in war and military build - up , we should also consider inflation the health of the state .

Mechanical ' skin ' reduces aeroplane drag
A new " skin " that changes shape at the push of a button could reduce the drag forces on aeroplanes or ships , making them faster and more fuel efficient , say US researchers .
Dr Othon Rediniotis and colleagues at Texas A and M University say the active coating can reduce the drag forces on an object in motion up to 40 % .
Dr Dennis Bushnell , chief scientist at the NASA Langley Research Center , who was not involved in the research , says such research is key to cutting airline costs .
" The portion of airline direct operating costs attributable to fuel has increased from some 15 % to 35 % , heading to 50 % - plus , " he says .
" Aircraft drag reduction is becoming , again , a serious research issue . "
As air or water flows over an object , it creates tiny pockets of turbulence that slow the object down .
Even the flattest surfaces , the creation of which is a traditional engineering goal , suffer spontaneous turbulence .
In recent years , designers have roughed things up , adding tiny , immobile riblets to skins .
The riblets break apart the random formation of turbulent pockets and create specific , controlled areas of turbulence that engineers can use to their advantage .
Passive riblets , which can be found in the full - body swimsuits worn by professional swimmers , use the same principle to reduce drag by 5 to 7 % .
Shape - shifting system
Rediniotis and colleagues have developed and tested an active shape - shifting system and found it can reduce drag up to 40 % .
The scientists created two 15 by 15 - centimetre patches of artificial skin and placed them in a wind tunnel at Virginia Tech , one patch on top of the tunnel , one on the bottom .
The patch on top served as the control , while the patch on the bottom was equipped with a tiny ' riblet ' mechanical system embedded under it .
Through a camshaft design , the ' riblets ' under the skin extend or retreat ever so slightly , by less than a millimetre , creating tiny waves that undulate down the material .
" They are travelling bumps and valleys , " says Rediniotis .
" A good analogy is a travelling ocean wave . "
NASA recently contacted Rediniotis and his colleagues about using their research to reduce drag on aircraft .
" We will study this option , along with many other options , over the next few years , " says Bushnell .
While it 's clear that an active skin reduces drag , saving energy , it also takes energy to activate the skin .
When the energy it takes to activate the skin is subtracted from the energy saved , the net energy savings only amount to about 7.5 % , says Bushnell .
" We probably can improve this , but there are also worrisome but not yet quantified systems penalties such as cost , weight , complexity , reliability and maintainability , " he says .
President Bush on Monday submitted a $ 3.1 - trillion budget for the next fiscal year that reflected his strategy for dealing with a costly war and a troubled economy : substantially boost military expenditures , rein in domestic spending -- including for Medicare -- and more than double the deficit .
The proposal set the stage for a long election - year struggle , drawing sharp criticism from the Democratic majority in Congress as well as a scattering of Republicans concerned about the president ’s habit of leaving large chunks of the spending out of his annual budget blueprint .
The proposal calls for making permanent Bush ’s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts , which have been widely criticized as skewed to the rich and which would begin expiring next year .
Doing so would cost Washington more than a half - trillion dollars in forgone revenue over the next five years and more than $ 2 trillion over the next decade , but the president has argued that they play an important role in stimulating economic growth .
The new budget would increase Pentagon spending by 8.1 % -- to $ 518.3 billion , plus add an additional $ 70 billion to fight terrorism .
By some measures , the combination is the 11th consecutive year of defense spending increases .

White House aides acknowledged that the new numbers do n’t reflect the full amount that will be needed to prosecute the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan over the next year .
The president has regularly handled the conflicts as emergency spending and therefore outside normal budget channels .
Even as he sought to increase military spending , Bush proposed to slow substantially the growth of entitlement programs such as Medicare by as much as $ 208 billion over five years and eliminating or reducing various education , training , highway and environmental programs to cut an additional $ 18 billion - plus next year .
Bush ’s plans for defense and Medicare drew criticism from both sides of the aisle in Congress .
Coming in an election year and being the first to break the $ 3 - trillion mark , the budget blueprint seemed destined to set off an extended battle .
Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) , the top GOP member on the Senate Budget Committee , said the latest Bush budget , which is the president ’s last , is disappointing because it “ does not accurately reflect ” expected war costs .

“ I am concerned that this proposal will make it too easy for Congress . . . to return to shadow budgeting and ignore costs we already know will occur , ” he said .
Gregg praised Bush , however , for attempting to curb the growth of Medicare .
But it was the proposed cutbacks for Medicare , the huge health insurance program for the elderly , and Medicaid , the state - federal health program for the poor , that drew the sharpest criticism from leading Democrats .
Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , called the proposed reductions “ dead on arrival with me and with most of the Congress . ”
White House budget director Jim Nussle acknowledged that the federal deficit will double from $ 162 billion in fiscal 2007 , which ended last September , to more than $ 400 billion in both fiscal 2008 and 2009 .
He attributed the increase entirely to the fiscal stimulus plan that Bush and House leaders have agreed on to help the economy .

The new budget portrays the deficit jump as temporary and shows Washington operating in the black for the first time in more than a decade by 2012 .
But independent analysts said that the administration ’s prediction of vanishing deficits is based on a series of overly optimistic assumptions , among them that Congress will drop its temporary relief from the alternative minimum tax .
That levy , originally created to assure that millionaires paid at least some income taxes , is increasingly biting upper - middle - class Americans .
The forecast of deficits ending by 2012 also assumed there will be no more war costs beyond the $ 70 billion in the new budget .
If , as seems likely , Congress continues AMT relief and war costs follow the least costly scenario advanced by the Congressional Budget Office , Congress ’ numbers - crunching arm , Washington will still be running deficits in 2012 and 2013 .
Advertisement
In addition to omitting what critics see as unavoidable future expenses , the administration seems to have based its deficit predictions on an unusually sunny economic forecast .
The White House estimates that the economy will grow at a 2.7 % rate this year , significantly faster than the CBO or many private forecasters predict .
According to the administration ’s own budget documents , that one - point difference could mean a $ 37.1 - billion addition to the deficit next fiscal year and more than a $ 250 - billion addition over the next five years .
When it came to the war , Pentagon officials insisted Monday that next year ’s costs cannot be known , at least until Army Gen. David H. Petraeus returns to Washington next month to give his recommendations about how to proceed in Iraq .
Independent military analysts said the final number could be two to three times the $ 70 billion that the administration is using as a place - holder .

“ If the violence in Iraq stays at its recently reduced levels -- or even declines -- that $ 70 billion should be about doubled to get through the entire year , ” said Winslow T. Wheeler , a frequent Pentagon budget critic with the nonpartisan Center for Defense Information .
“ If things fall apart in Iraq and continue to deteriorate in Afghanistan , as is very likely , that $ 70 billion should be about tripled . ”
A large portion of the $ 38.8 - billion budget increase sought for the Pentagon would go to building up land forces ravaged by the Iraq war .
A hefty chunk of the savings Bush is counting on to offset the Pentagon increase would come from Medicare and Medicaid .
But leading Democratic and Republican lawmakers greeted the proposed cuts as unacceptable .
“ Not viable , ” said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) .

The president did propose modest increases in certain healthcare programs , including health insurance for children of low - income working parents and the Food and Drug Administration ’s food safety office .
Industry and consumer advocates said the FDA boost would barely offset the combined effects of inflation and earlier cuts .
The budget also included a 7 % cut for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Medicare , which serves about 44 million seniors and disabled people , would be squeezed by $ 178 billion over five years , reducing its growth from an average of 7.2 % a year to 5 % a year .
At least $ 115 billion of the savings would come from reduced payments to hospitals , nursing homes , home health agencies and other institutions , according to initial calculations by a senior Democratic congressional aide .
“ The Medicare portion of the budget should be viewed as a stark warning , ” said Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt .
“ It ’s very clear to me that members of Congress do n’t want to deal with this , ” Leavitt said .
“ If they do n’t do it now , they ’re going to have to deal with it later . ”

But while hospitals and other providers in traditional Medicare would face the sharpest cuts under Bush ’s budget , critics said that private health insurance plans , which now constitute one of the fastest - growing parts of the program , were given only a light trim .
Over 10 years , the budget ’s proposed Medicare savings would grow to $ 556 billion .
The president also called for reductions totaling $ 17 billion over five years in Medicaid , a federal - state partnership that serves some 55 million people , including the poor and many elderly nursing home residents .
Over a 10 - year period , those reductions would save nearly $ 47 billion .
In an apparent overture to Congress , the president called for an increase of nearly $ 20 billion over five years in a program that offers health insurance to the children of the working poor .
That was a substantial increase over the $ 5 billion Bush offered last year during a battle with Congress .

A number of the proposals in the president ’s latest budget plan have been previously rejected by Congress , often on a bipartisan basis .
Bush , for example , again proposed no funding to state and local governments for jailing illegal immigrants convicted of crimes .
Congress last year provided $ 410 million for the program ; California receives about 40 % of the money .
The president ’s budget would reduce funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program by 22 % to $ 2 billion , according to Mark Wolfe , executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors ’ Assn .
For California , that would mean about a $ 12.7 - million cut from the nearly $ 90 million the state is due to receive this year .
Many Democratic analysts and even some Republicans said the proposal would make Americans less safe by cutting aid to local governments for law enforcement and domestic security programs , even as the budget for the Department of Homeland Security would increase overall .

The administration ’s proposal calls for $ 50.5 billion in department funding , up 6.8 % .
That includes $ 442.4 million to hire , train and equip 2,200 new Border Patrol agents .
But the budget would eliminate funding for some community - oriented policing programs and slash others , including local law enforcement assistance programs that would lose more than $ 1.1 billion in comparison to last year , according to the Senate Democratic Communications Center .
The Bush administration budget also would cut domestic security grants to state and local governments .

( CNN ) -- Australian tourist Michael Smith says he was eating lunch in a restaurant in Tibet 's capital , Lhasa , on Friday when he heard an explosion and saw smoke .
Video shot by an Australian tourist shows protesters in the streets of Lhasa , Tibet , last week .

As armored vehicles and trucks carrying Chinese soldiers rushed past , Smith started videotaping .
" We 're standing here in the middle of Lhasa and the place has just [ expletive ] exploded , " Smith narrated during the rioting .
Smith , who was traveling in Tibet when anti-Chinese rioting broke out Friday , returned home this week with dramatic video of the violence in the Tibetan capital , Lhasa , which aired on Australian TV on Wednesday .
Watch Smith 's video of chaos in streets »
Tibetan exile groups maintain at least 80 people were killed by Chinese security forces that day , but Chinese authorities insist they acted with restraint and killed no one .
Instead , China says 13 " innocent people " were killed , some brutally burned , by the Tibetan rioters .
No apparent deaths or injuries were seen on the video , which Smith shared with Australia 's ABC News , a CNN affiliate .
The video shows Tibetans smashing windows and setting fire to Chinese shops and cars , while people are heard cheering .
It also shows Chinese security forces , but no clashes between them and the rioters .
" It 's absolute mayhem on the streets , " Smith said .
Other video released of the rioting was broadcast by the Chinese government 's CCTV , and it did not include pictures of Chinese security forces .
Smith said as he made his way back to his hotel on Friday , he " met so many Tibetan people on the streets , so many young Tibetan boys just screaming for Tibet 's freedom . "
" We do n't have any freedoms , " one young Tibetan male shouted to Smith 's camera .
" The Tibetan people are going crazy , " Smith said .
See protests around the world over Tibet »
Many of the businesses targeted by the rioters were operated by Han Chinese , China 's largest ethnic group .
The Dalai Lama , Tibet 's spiritual leader , has blamed the violent protests on deep resentment fueled by Chinese treatment of Tibetans as " second - class citizens in their own land . "
Tibetan activists said an influx of Han Chinese from other provinces is threatening their ancient culture .
While many of these " Free Tibet " activists demand independence from China , the Dalai Lama said he wants only " genuine autonomy " so that Tibetans can preserve their heritage .

Meanwhile , China 's state - run Xinhua news agency reported Tuesday that more than 100 people surrendered themselves to police and admitted involvement in the clashes last week in Lhasa .
Tibet 's regional government said 105 people had turned themselves in to authorities by 11 p.m. Tuesday ( 1:15 p.m. ET ) , Xinhua said .
Authorities had urged those who participated in the protests to turn themselves in , offering them leniency if they did .
" Those who surrender and provide information on other lawbreakers will be exempt from punishment , " Xinhua quoted a police notice as saying .

Dalai Lama draws 50,000 to Seattle stadium
By Laura Myers
Sat Apr 12 , 7:27 PM ET
Tens of thousands of people packed a Seattle sports stadium on Saturday to hear the Dalai Lama , Tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , call for nonviolence and to make the 21st century a " century of dialogue . "
Drums played , American Indian chiefs wearing feathered head - dresses danced and organizers said about 51,000 people -- many of them families -- listened under sunny skies to the Dalai Lama speak about compassion .
Sitting in a red chair under a canopied stage on the stadium field , the robed leader made no reference to recent turmoil in Tibet nor to suggestions that world leaders should boycott the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games .
The Dalai Lama said on Friday he did not support a boycott of the Beijing Olympics .
He has rejected Chinese claims that he orchestrated deadly rioting across Tibet last month over a campaign for independence .
On Saturday , the official Xinhua Chinese news agency reported the arrests of nine Buddhist monks suspected of bombing a government building in Tibet .
Saturday 's mass gathering in Seattle was the largest of a five - day community event to promote compassion in every day life organized by the group Seeds of Compassion .
" I do n't expect to hear any political message .
I am not viewing this as a religious event , but it seems like a unique opportunity , " said small business owner Patrick Burningham , 42 , who was in the crowd .
A 1,000 - person cultural procession of people wearing Chinese , Japanese , African - American , Native American and other national dress kicked off the festivities to an accompaniment of more than 100 drummers .
In his wide - ranging , 45 - minute address , the Dalai Lama called for the elimination of nuclear weapons and spoke of the role of women in nurturing compassion .
He also discussed the need for nonviolence and said the 21st century should be a " century of dialogue . "
Student Derek Albietz , 21 , said he had always been interested in the Dalai Lama 's views .
" It is my first opportunity to see him in person .
I want to hear his thoughts on compassion and science and how to help the world , " Albietz said .

Ah , the poor DL was kidnapped as an infant , spirited off to be sequestered and reared by a bunch of old monks , then when he was scarcely more than a babe , he was kicked out of the mountain range which was the only home he had ever known .
And yet , though but a lad , and a stranger in a strange land , he got his lines straight and has been in vaudeville for better than fifty years now , and still wows the crowds in the larger towns and smaller cities .
And nobody know his real name is Isidore .

The Dali Lama is stuck with his lot in life .
As long as China continues to oppress Tibet , he ’s making money and the day they stop he ’s out of cash .
Luckily for him , they never will stop .

Why is it the ones that like to run their mouths about the Dali Llama and how much of a huckster he is , know the least about him and Buddhism in general ??
I am getting married to a full Tibetan and believe me , I am plugged into all things Tibetan .
Suffice to say the people spewing foolishness on this thread only betray their stunning ignorance of a man who has devoted his life to compassion and understanding .

Seth helped me develop a website , design a logo and have a presence on social media when we opened our store 4 years ago .
I was impressed by his fresh approach and great ideas .
He has been available to help us whenever needed since .
Seth did an amazing job creating our website landing page .
He was easy to work with , listened to our needs and turned the design around quickly .
We were up online before we knew it !
Once the website was up he has been very helpful with updates and changes as needed .
I ’d highly recommend him to build your site .
I have absolutely loved working with Seth .
He has taken my ideas and put them into action .
I am thankful for his partnership over the last 3 years .
We are taking to the trees to stop a huge development project , including a new highway , that would destroy mature forests , watersheds , rare caves , traditional indigenous sites and wildlife near Victoria , BC .
Bear Mountain is the name given to the place by the developers of Bear Mountain Resort and Properties .
The city of Langford named it Skirt Mountain , and the Songhees Nation name is Spaet , which means " bear . "
The following summary can be found on the excellent and well - researched website First Nations : Land Rights and Environmentalism in BC .
Until 2001 much of SPAET Mountain was classified as a " Forest Lands Reserve " ( Crown land owned by the public ) .
The behind - the - scenes sale of this land adds up to a form of political corruption .
Corporate profit from hastily planned development schemes in this area depend on a new road infrastructure financed by public funds such as the $ 30 million Bear Mountain Interchange on the Trans Canada Highway ( 1 ) .
To connect to it , two roads are being constructed : the Savory Road Connector and the Bear Mountain Parkway .
Both roads bisect forests buffering Goldstream Park , a much loved nature attraction , further diminishing its fragile and already endangered ecology .
The infrastructure for Bear Mountain Resort includes the Malahat Corridor , promoted as an alternative to Malahat Drive .
The new highway will carve SPAET Mountain in two and cross over Saanich Inlet , giving city commuters direct access to the new development scheme at Bamberton .
BC 's gung - ho Ministry of Transportation has partnered with Stantec , the engineering empire that paved over most of Edmonton , Alberta .
SPAET Mountain is being destroyed by a clandestine land grab .
In 2001 the BC government transfered 44 hectares of land to Western Forest Products for the giveaway price of $ 1.05 million .
Within six months the land was sold to the Bear Mountain Resort developer for the same price and zoning regulations were altered , courtesy of the local pro-business mayor .
The result is the cancer - like urban sprawl of golf courses , residential subdivisions , roads , hotels and strip malls .
All this can be easily observed by anyone using Google Earth satellite and mapping technology .
The corruption surrounding the SPAET Mountain land grab involves big business and elected officials eager to make a quick buck .
Community and environmental issues such as municipal water supply , pollution from golf courses and sewage , changes to the fragile watershed hydrology , public transport infrastructure , etc. have not been addressed .
Bears and other large wild animals have no place to go as their mountainside habitat disappears .
Bear Mountain Resort has already killed one resident " problem " bear and there are certainly other unreported instances .

by Adrian Ash " ... Might the scam work ?
Can the United States really settle its debt with devalued dollars , free of all historical fall - out ...? "
" WE CAN PAY ANYBODY by running a printing press , " said Thomas Gale Moore , one of Ronald Reagan 's economic advisors , when the United States became a net debtor to its foreign investors in 1986 .
" Frankly , it 's not clear to me how bad [ being a net debtor ] is , " he added .
And for the next two decades or so , owning fewer assets overseas than foreigners laid claim to inside the United States did n't seem so bad at all .
The long boom delivered by a steady inflow of foreign credit and cash delivered the greatest stock market gains ever enjoyed by US investors .
When they topped out , the party switched straight into real estate � adding more than one - third to America 's household wealth on the Federal Reserve 's metrics .
So what if non -US claims on that surging wealth rose faster still ?
Now the party 's over , inflating away the value of America 's debt will worked just as beautifully as it always before .
Right ?
" In my view , " says John H. Makin � a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute writing in the Wall Street Journal � " the least bad option [ in fixing the financial crisis ] is for the Federal Reserve to print money to help stabilize housing prices and financial markets . "
" America is a country that owes money , " agrees Philippa Malmgren , a former Bush advisor and now head of a risk consultancy in London .
" It is natural when you are a debtor that you lean in the direction of inflation , because it makes paying it back so much easier . "
The logic is simple : inflate the number of Dollars in issue , and you 'll shrink the real value of each outstanding Dollar you owe .
But if escaping your debts really could prove that easy , how come history is littered with the mischief that inflation causes instead ...?
Restoration England , 1668 Charles II � still playing his " divine right " as king some 20 years after Parliament cut off his father 's head � steps up the issue of new bonds .
Then called " stocks " , they let the King raise cash for yet another losing war against the Dutch .
Charles side - steps Parliamentary approval for these new debts , and starts selling stocks against the promise of future tax receipts ( the same wheeze adopted by governments worldwide today , of course ) .
Come 1671 , however , all the new money raised went straight to paying interest on the outstanding loans .
So Charles opted to default , wiping out 11 of London 's 14 biggest goldsmiths � those early banks who'd first lent the Crown money � and destroying his credit with England 's loyal subjects .
The upshot ?
The King strikes a secret deal with France , promising to stay out of its war against the Dutch in return for regular cash pay - offs .
But the deal � uncovered amid a rash of anti-Catholic panics in London � undermines all support for the Stuart royal family .
Fifteen years later , and with the English crown bankrupt once more , his brother James II is overthrown in a popular and ( pretty much ) bloodless coup .
He 's replaced by William of Orange ... head of the Dutch Republic !
Revolutionary America , 1775 Lacking a mandate to tax its population while fighting a war , the second Continental Congress authorizes the " limited " issue of paper money .
The new notes , known as Continentals , are backed by neither Gold nor silver , but by the expectation of future tax receipts .
Effectively acting as tradable bonds � but exchangeable for goods and services amongst the Patriots , rather than hard currency � the Continentals will only be redeemed when the Colonies win their independence from Great Britain .
But long before that happy day , they race towards zero , becoming progressively worth less as their supply increases .
During the first six months , the supply of Continentals goes from $ 2 million to $ 6 m .
By 1779 , the total supply reaches $ 242 m on one estimate � more than twenty times the volume of gold & silver money in circulation before the war began .
" A wagonload of currency will hardly purchase a wagonload of provisions , " complains George Washington .
In March 1780 , Congress announces a plan to redeem the Continentals at one - fortieth of their face value , effectively stuffing the American people and taxing the new citizenry more aggressively than George III ever did .
" So much for Congress 's honor , " notes Thomas E.Woods for Mises.org today .
But for once , at least , these un -backed and over - inflated notes do n't end with political or military defeat .
Other than for the Patriots ' cry for lower taxation , that is .
Weimar Germany , 1920 Besides losing 13 % of its territory and 10 % of its population under the Versailles Treaty after World War One , Germany also owes " reparations " to the Allied victors worth almost 37,000 tonnes of gold � around one - third of the world 's entire above - ground supplies at the time .
Expected to settle the final payment seven decades later , the German government opts instead to pay early by printing money .
The volume of Reichsnotes in issue rises 35 billion times over between 1918 and 1924 � and " the young and quick - witted did well , " as the German journalist Sebastian Haffner will record , fifteen years later .
Equity prices in Berlin rose some 2,772,164 % by the time a loaf of bread cost a wheel barrow - full of banknotes .
The value of those Reichsnotes , however , went the other way � sinking from 8.0 per US Dollar to 4.2 billion per Dollar .
The resulting chaos , now regularly blamed for the rise of Hitler during the Great Depression of the early 1930s , saw " wages paid twice a day and promptly and completely spent within the hour , " notes Glyn Davis in his History of Money .
" Large sections of society , including the middle classes , became impoverished ; food riots were common ; there was a complete flight from money , which had clearly become worthless to hold . "
A more honorable legacy , perhaps , was the inflation - fighting Bundesbank of the 1970s and ' 80s .
Staffed by bankers and academics who'd lived through both the Weimar inflation and its World War Two replay � which saw worthless coupons issued as money to Nazi citizens , Wehrmacht troops and even concentration camp victims � the West German central bank refused to devalue the Deutsche Mark alongside the Dollar , British Pound and French Franc by setting interest rates low .
The Bundesbank kept inflation far below the double - digit rates suffered by UK and US households as Gold Prices rose 20 times over against the Dollar .
It finally bit the bullet with the birth of the Euro in 1999 .
The new European Central Bank has since let slip its money - supply growth target of 4.5 % per year .
At last count , the supply of Euros was expanding by 10.3 % per year , just below 2007 's three - decade record for Europe monetary inflation .
The Global Banking Crisis , 2008 : " US money supply growth is running at a 47 - year high , " notes Bedlam Asset Management , " as the authorities seek to inflate away the debt bubble and prop up house prices .
" Clearly printing such huge amounts of money is not great for the exchange rate .
A weak Dollar has forced the hand of other central banks as they try and keep their currencies competitive with it . "
But might the scam work ?
Not if China , Japan and the big Dollar - holders of the Arab oil kingdoms can help it .
Will they really let their own currencies rise ... just so the United States stuffs them by paying its debts with devalued Dollars ?
Inflation , it 's claimed , eases the burden of settling your debts .
But for government and private debtors alike , that 's only true if your income rises faster than your on - going cost of expenditure .
Otherwise , you end up struggling to make ends meet today , only to leave yesterday 's debts for repayment tomorrow again .
Middle - class families and savers looking to get ahead of the game � both inside and outside the Federal Reserve 's fast - inflating currency zone � might want to consider Buying Gold as defense .
Because however this latest attempt to inflate away debt pans out in the long run , it 's sure to make history .
And history says � time and again � that solid Gold Bullion holds its value whenever man-made currencies are forced to lose value .

Saudi Woman Killed by Her Father for Chatting Online .
April . 02 , 2008 06:23 . lightee@donga.com .
A debate is rising over honor murder  following a case that belatedly revealed that a young Saudi Arabian woman was killed by her father for chatting on the Internet social network site , Facebook .
British daily Telegraph quoted Mondays Middle East news sites including al - Arabiya as saying ,  Social networking sites , like Facebook , are causing social strife in the Islamic nation and the incident is an example . 
According to the report by al - Arabiya , a Saudi woman was beaten and shot by her father after being caught while chatting with a man on Facebook .
This is a typical case of honor murder whereby a woman , discovered to associate with another man , is murdered by her family members as punishment for denigrating the honor of family . 
Punishable acts , once limited to offline relationships , such as having a kiss , sleeping together , and sharing a table , have now expanded to online relations .
The tragic incident , which had remained concealed for some time , was revealed to the media when Saudi preacher Ali al - Maliki began criticizing Facebook , claiming the network as a door to lust .
Maliki said ,  These days , young women and men are spending more on their mobile phones and the Internet than they do on food . "
He went on to argue that those sites that destroy Islamic culture should be shut down to stem social strife .
He sternly warned women frequenting Facebook to stop visiting the site .
Facebook is now estimated to have more than 30,000 users in Saudi Arabia .
A majority of them use nicknames and post drawings on their pages instead of photographs .
Because of this , some have dubbed this the  Faceless network .
Islam religious leaders blame social networking sites for becoming a hotbed for homosexuals and a place for obscene material .
Following Syrias lead , which banned access to Facebook last November , some Islamic countries have stepped up Internet censorship and are cracking down on those operating the sites .
Muslim women , however , are standing up against these harsh measures .
One female journalist said ,  The Internet is an outlet where women let out their pent - up emotions and an avenue where they can associate with youth around the world to learn diverse cultures .
She added ,  Though authorities ban access to Facebook , we will continue to visit similar social network sites . 

The two women that Mike Gross had ordered from Craigslist were running late , and he suspected they might not show , so he found two more in the back of Westword .
But the second duo's phone number led him right back to the first pair he'd called , one of whom proceeded to yell at him for the transgression .
Still , the women agreed to meet Gross in his room at the Staybridge Suites Hotel in Glendale .
" Hiiii there , " Tatiana said when she arrived , her partner , Mia , standing quietly by her side .
" How are you ? "
" How are you ? " replied Gross , the undercover john in this May 18 prostitution sting .
Info Glendale
" You look kinda scary , " Tatiana said , according to a recorded transcript .
" Please , " Gross said .
" I 've never had anybody call me up on the phone and yell at me before . "
" Well , yeah , that 's me .
I like to yell at people , " she said .
" Did I scare you ?
Come on . "
" I'm a little scared .
There 's two of you and one of me . "
" It 's okay .
We like to team up on guys .
It 's good to get abused every now and then .
Do n't you know that ?
Okay , I 'm going to check your room real quick — okay , security !
Security !
Just making sure you 're not Mr. Poliiiice Man . "
" Why , do I look like the police ? "
" Yes , you do , actually , to tell you the truth , " Tatiana said .
" Why ? "
" ' Cuz you do . "
" Why ?
' Cuz I 'm white ? "
Gross asked .
" You 've got that look in your eye . "
" Why , ' cuz I 'm that brown - haired white guy ? "
" You 've got that look , that asshole look in your eye .
I see you got condoms all over .
Why is that ?
Are you just excited , or do you think you 're going to use all these ?
No .
You 're only using one , so pick what color , " Tatiana said .
" You 're not that big , are you ? "
" Nope . "
" Yeah , we 'll rule those out , " she said .
" Nice try , though . "
" Sooooo ... "
Gross said .
" So it 's simple , " Tatiana said .
" We 'll start off with a massage .
Lay your butt down . "
Check out this slide show of mug shots from the Glendale sting , these transcripts of audio recorded during two busts , and a glossary of industry terms to guide the uninitiated through the world of prostitution .
According to the report Gross would later file , " Tatiana directed me to remove the towel that I was wearing and lay down on the bed for my massage .
Tatiana and Mia both began massaging my back , buttocks and legs . "
Later , Gross asked for his turn to massage them , and they took off their shirts and lay on the bed .
While he massaged them , the women talked about a porno playing on the TV .
" That is huge . "
" Oh , yeah . " [ Both laugh . ]
" She 's trying to deep - throat that motherfucker , huh ? "
" Uh , she can 't . "
" Wow , that 's huge . "
" Yeah . "
" Look , and she uses both hands . "
" It 's like a Chipotle burrito . "
The conversation continued until Gross asked when he would get to see the two women together .
" Soon soon soon , " Tatiana said .
" But first we 're gonna play with you . "
At this point , Lieutenant Gross of the Glendale Police Department would later write in his report , " both Tatiana and Mia grabbed my penis and Tatiana began placing a condom on my penis while Mia held it . "
The recording stops shortly after that , before other officers entered the room and arrested Tatiana and Mia .
They were among nine women and one man ( a female officer busted the man ) picked up as part of the operation , dubbed the " Father 's Day Special . "
The sting and the Glendale Police Department 's handling of it are now under investigation by the Arapahoe County District Attorney 's Office , although that office wo n't discuss specifics .
Gross began the operation with a sexy and petite Asian , who , for $ 300 an hour , offered the " Ultimate Girlfriend Experience , " according to police records .
Also that day , Gross called 21 - year - old " Honey , " who told him she could be his for $ 125 .
Gross said he was prepared to offer $ 150 .
Honey promised to make it worth his while .
According to Gross 's report , Honey arrived in the room and then asked for her " donation . "
After he paid , she disrobed and seated Gross on the bed , removed his towel and placed her hand on his penis .
Honey 's three rules were no kissing , always wear a condom , and no " Greek " ( anal sex ) .
He agreed and gave the arrest signal .
Gross also called on Marie , a Native American woman whose Craigslist resumé included full service , French , hand jobs , deep French kissing , " dinner at the Y " ( cunnilingus ) and the " girlfriend " or " porn star " experience .
According to his report , Marie removed his towel and reached for his penis , but he pulled back .
Gross ordered another tag team that evening , Heavenly and Dallas .
Having sex with them was like having sex with Liza Minnelli and Bette Midler — " not for everyone , but worth the ride " — according to a former customer who reviewed the duo on a hooker messenger board that Gross reviewed before the sting .
He also arranged a $ 200 date with a Chinese woman who spoke enough English to tell Gross that he could have sex with her only once .
" I then asked her , using hand signals , if she would perform oral sex on me , and she again nodded yes , " Gross wrote in his report , adding that she proceeded to " slap " his penis .
It all seemed a little over - the - top to Frank Moya , a defense attorney for one of the alleged prostitutes who read Gross 's report and thought that some of his actions before the arrests were inappropriate for a police investigation .
Moya believed he might be able to get his case thrown out on the basis of " outrageous government conduct , " and requested more police documents surrounding the sting .
But after Moya asked for information , he discovered that some of the notes from the investigation had been destroyed and that the original audiotape was missing .
" When you boil this thing down , what it amounts to is that Glendale police decide they do n't have enough crime in their city , so they hatch a plot to lure some people from out of town , people they hope are prostitutes , so they can bust them , " Moya says .
" Then at least one of the cops has sexual contact with a batch of them before arrests are made .
Finally , a couple of these officers decide to deep - six the evidence of the cop 's own sexcapade and call this standard operating procedure . "
Gross , who was recently promoted to captain and serves as the department spokesman , has been an undercover john before , including a role in a 2006 federal investigation .
Although he 's hesitant to talk about the Father 's Day Special because of the Arapahoe County investigation , he insists the sting was handled by the book .
" As soon as someone touches you [ on the genitals ] , then it 's done ; the operation for that person is over , " he says .
" It 's completely common .
Everybody does it — Arapahoe County , Denver , Aurora . "
Representatives of the Denver , Aurora and Lakewood police departments refused to comment on their guidelines concerning officer conduct in undercover prostitution stings , claiming the release of such information could compromise the safety of their officers and future investigations .
Glendale police chief Victor Ross wo n't outline specifics , either , but says , " It ca n't result in any sexual gratification ....
To go into an undercover operation and not take into consideration that someone 's genitalia may get touched is probably naive at best , and unsafe at worst .
It 's not standard protocol , but it 's kind of like saying , ' Is shooting someone standard ? '
It 's not standard , but it has to be accounted for , and there needs to be a plan of action if it does occur .
The plan is to give the bust signal as quick as you can and then get the other officers in there and document that it happened . "
But Ralph Rojas , a criminology professor at Metropolitan State College of Denver , calls an officer getting naked and having his genitalia touched " misconduct . "
" If you get undressed , that 's improper , and someone is sanctioning this , " he says .
" Somebody 's head is going to roll , because that 's not the way you conduct an operation .
Conversation is one thing , but when you get undressed and you have a woman touch you , that is something else , especially your genitals for the purpose of the sting operation . "
Records show that the Father 's Day Special prompted questions back at the Glendale police station as well .
Detective Cory Lambert was in charge of compiling the reports related to the sting .
While doing so , he came across three pages of notes taken by Detective Roy Martin , who had monitored the listening device during the sting .
Included in Martin 's notes , Lambert found the words " began oral stimulation . "
Later that day , according to Lambert 's report , Gross confronted Martin about the notation , asking him , " What the hell is this ' began oral stimulation ' ?
I 'm not going to get up on the stand and explain this . "
Gross did n't include the notation in his report , according to a signed statement he would later write for the Arapahoe County District Attorney 's Office .
In August , Roy Martin was promoted to sergeant , and Lambert took over Martin's one remaining drug case , which happened to stem from the Father 's Day Special :
One of the prostitutes had been found with 1.6 grams of methamphetamine .
Because the woman had struck a deal with police to become an informant in order to avoid prosecution , the Glendale Police Department was supposed to have forwarded the case to the South Metro Drug Task Force .
But the agency never received it , according to a statement by Lambert , who re-filed the case so that the woman would face charges .
In an affidavit he included with the refiled case , Lambert also discussed his disagreement with Gross over whether Martin 's notes , including the " began oral stimulation " notation , should have been included .
He wrote that Gross had told him the notes should n't be considered evidence , despite Lambert 's and another officer 's claim that they were .
" The hero in this story is Detective Lambert , " Moya says .
" It 's clear from review of these reports that he 's a policeman with integrity and balls the size of grapefruits .
Can you imagine this detective sitting across from two police officers who were his superiors , and in effect being told to hide evidence , and simply telling them straight up to their faces that he would n't ?
That 's courage , in my book . "
The Arapahoe County District Attorney 's Office asked Gross , Lambert and Martin each to file a supplemental report to address the issue of the missing notes .
In his supplemental report , Lambert wrote that Martin told him that Martin and Gross believed the audio recordings were not evidence , but were only made for " officer safety . "
( The recordings , which had been misfiled , were eventually found . )
Lambert also wrote that he asked Martin about the handwritten notes and that Martin said he did n't know what Gross was going to do with them .
" This is n't a felony case , it 's a misdemeanor , " Lambert quoted Gross as saying while he shook the three pages of notes .
" I do n't think we need these for evidence .
I do n't take my field notes from a traffic stop and put them into evidence . "
Gross then discarded the notes , according to his own sworn statement .
Gross and Martin wrote in their signed statements that they could n't explain the " began oral stimulation " notation , which was in the margin of the notes .
And neither officer could recall the specific instance that would have sparked the notation .
Both added that they were even uncertain as to which woman was in the room with Gross when Martin wrote it .
Gross also made the argument that notes from misdemeanors are n't filed .
" As placing these notes into evidence would be a break from our normal procedure , considering the offense and based on what other jurisdictions have told us regarding their handling of notes , " he wrote , " the three pieces of yellow paper containing Det.
Martin 's handwritten notes were discarded . "
Moya does n't believe the destruction of notes from a prostitution sting should be police procedure .
But the fiasco surely helped his client receive what he considers an " unusually generous " deal , a deferred prosecution , which means that the charges will disappear if she does n't break any laws for six months .
Two others received deferred judgments , two were issued warrants for failing to appear in court , two had their cases refiled in other courts , and the other three have hearings scheduled .
As for Moya 's complaint that the women were unnecessarily lured into Glendale and subjected to police misconduct , Chief Ross , who has 22 officers working for him ( nine of whom were involved in the May sting ) , says they look for girls who advertise that they work in Glendale or southeast Denver .
He also says that his officers know what they can and can't do in such a bust .
Prostitution in Glendale is " no better or no worse than any other community in the metro area , " he adds .
But a review of Westword ads from that week shows that none of the women refer to Glendale .
And a recent review of Craigslist ads also turned up no mention of Glendale .
" It 's not where they live ; it 's that you 're trying to get that act out of your area , and I 'm not naive enough to believe that one prostitution sting or two is going to rid the area of the world 's oldest profession , " Ross says .
The Arapahoe County District Attorney 's
Office wo n't say when its investigation would conclude , only that it will probably be soon .
White House blocked EPA studies , GAO reports GAO says studies of toxic chemicals repeatedly blocked
WASHINGTON - APRIL 02 : U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) questions witnesses during a hearing about the possible listing of the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act April 2 , 2008 in Washington , DC .
U.S. Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne was invited to testify but declined until he said he could provide more information regarding the listing of the polar bear as endangered .
According to conservation groups , polar bears are threatened because their habitat , sea ice , is shrinking from global warming .

A congressional watchdog agency has found that White House officials repeatedly intervened in the government 's scientific process for assessing the health risks of toxic chemicals , prompting Sen. Barbara Boxer to threaten giving Congress control of the program .
The Government Accountability Office reported Tuesday that the White House 's budget office , the Pentagon and other agencies had delayed or blocked efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency to list chemicals as carcinogens by requesting more research or more time to review the risks .
Boxer , D - Calif. , who is chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and requested the report , called the findings scandalous .
If EPA does not speed up its assessments of toxic chemicals , she warned that Congress might step in and start banning substances that threaten the public health .
" If we do n't see that happen , colleagues of mine are going to take matters into their own hands , " Boxer said .
A top EPA official , who was grilled at a hearing before Boxer 's committee Tuesday , responded that it was helpful to have more input from the White House and other agencies .
" Ultimately , at the end of the day , it 's EPA 's decision , " said James Gulliford , EPA 's assistant administrator for pesticides , prevention and toxic substances .
GAO officials also faulted the administration for setting new rules that keep secret any involvement by the White House or a federal agency in a decision about the risks of a chemical .
" In the risk assessment program , you do n't want anyone but the scientists involved , " John Stephenson , GAO 's chief investigator for environmental programs , told lawmakers .
The issue involves major changes the administration has made to an EPA program called " IRIS " - the Integrated Risk Information System - which allows the agency to determine safe levels of exposure to chemicals to protect the public health .
The program has been used to set limits on arsenic in drinking water and benzene in the air , and foreign nations and states like California often use the data for their regulations .
Influencing risk assessment
Since President Bush took office in 2001 , the White House has sought to take more control of a process that has long been led by EPA scientists , the report found .
The Office of Management and Budget , the Defense Department , the Energy Department and even NASA have taken steps to influence risk assessments that could affect those agencies or hurt U.S. industries , the report said .
For example , the EPA started a risk assessment of naphthalene , a chemical used in jet fuel , in 2002 , and agency scientists have been moving toward listing it as a likely human carcinogen .
But many military sites are contaminated with naphthalene , which could lead to major cleanup costs for the Pentagon .
So , White House budget officials slowed the process , repeatedly requesting more analysis .
Six years later , the risk assessment is back at the drafting stage .
" The series of delays has limited EPA 's ability to conduct its mission , " the GAO report concluded .
The study also found irregularities in the agency 's risk assessment of formaldehyde , a colorless gas used in plywood and many other household products , which the World Health Organization has listed as a known human carcinogen but EPA classifies only as a probable carcinogen .
In 2004 , the EPA 's Office of Air and Radiation decided to bypass the risk analysis of its own scientists and use data by an industry - funded group when it issued new rules for formaldehyde - even though EPA 's National Center for Environmental Assessment identified a number of problems with the group 's data .
A federal appellate court struck down the rules last year .
" It was fairly unprecedented , " testified Lynn Goldman , who was assistant EPA administrator for prevention , pesticides and toxic substances during the Clinton administration and is now an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University .
Only 4 approved
Stephenson , the GAO investigator , told lawmakers the risk assessments had slowed to a crawl because of the prolonged inter-agency review .
Out of 32 draft risk assessments prepared by the EPA over the last two years , only four were approved .
The program , Stephenson said , " is at serious risk of becoming obsolete . "
Public health advocates warned that the results are years - long delays in regulating harmful chemicals that scientists have linked to rising cancer rates in some groups .
Dr. Linda Giudice , a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UCSF , pointed to the growing evidence that a child exposed to chemicals in the womb is not only at higher risk of birth defects and learning disabilities , but also at risk of lower fertility , cancer , diabetes and cardiovascular disease as an adult .
Giudice noted that scientists are just now learning of the effects of some chemicals , such as bisphenol A , a compound found in baby bottles and other products .
Manufacturers of BPA insist it is safe , but it 's been linked to breast and prostate cancer , early puberty in females and behavior disorders in laboratory animals .
" There are many chemicals where we have no scientific data , " Giudice said .
" The absence of scientific data does not mean the chemical is safe . "
Senate Democrats have introduced a bill to ban children 's products with BPA , and California lawmakers are considering a similar bill .
San Francisco was the first jurisdiction in the world to outlaw BPA in kids ' products , but it repealed the ban in 2007 after a court fight with plastics manufacturers .
Boxer said the United States should consider shifting to the European Union 's new system , known as REACH , which requires all manufacturers seeking to sell their chemicals in Europe to register and prove the chemical will not hurt human health or the environment .
She said the program " puts the burden on the chemical industry , where it should be , to show that their chemicals are safe . "

As in other diodes , current flows easily from the p-side , or anode , to the n-side , or cathode , but not in the reverse direction .

Now , all they have to do is take out a robotic plane .
" The United States is deeply concerned by the shooting down of an unarmed Georgian UAV [ unmanned aerial vehicle ] , by a presumably Russian
MiG - 29 , over the Abkhazia region of Georgia , " State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said yesterday in a statement .
" Such incidents escalate tensions , contradict the spirit of the UN Friends process , and risk destabilizing the entire Caucasus .
We urge all parties to engage in serious discussions aimed at reaching a lasting political solution , including by engaging on the recent peace proposals made by the
Government of Georgia . "
We reiterate our unwavering support for Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity and are concerned by the presence of a MiG - 29
aircraft in Georgian airspace without Georgian authorization , and by the use of weapons from this aircraft in shooting down an unarmed
Georgian UAV .
We support UNOMIG [ United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia ] initiatives to enhance military transparency in the region , as well as its investigation of the shooting down of the Georgian UAV .
Meanwhile , the Russians are denying they had anything to do with anything to do with the shoot - down .

" Man looks in the abyss , there 's nothing staring back at him .
At that moment , man finds his character .
And that is what keeps him out of the abyss . " -- Lou Manheim , Wall Street
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Following a freaky week that rocked the roots of capitalism , Wall Street is bracing for what promises to be a hectic four - session set .
By now , you 're familiar with the sordid sequence of events that set the current stage .
Sub - prime credit concerns -- the same issues that Ben Bernanke and Hank Paulson assured us were contained a year ago -- have manifested into a full - fledged financial crisis .
In the process , the academic debate about whether or not we 're in a recession has shifted to concerns regarding the ability of our capital system to operate at all .
I attended an idea dinner in the Bear Stearns BSC , - 10.00 % executive boardroom Thursday night with several prominent hedge fund managers and senior executives from Bear Stearns credit division .
We spoke about the world at large , risks in the system , potential opportunities and the correlation of hedge fund strategies .
There seemed to be a general consensus that the massive move we 've been waiting for in Minyanville as a function of the disconnect between credit and equity is edging ever closer .
See related Minyanville article .
When a senior member of the Bear Stearns corporate credit team offered his view that we were in the fifth inning of the credit crunch , I found myself interjecting with a question .
" What do you make of the long bond action yesterday , " I began before realizing I was speaking out loud , " Following the $ 200 billion liquidity injection by the Federal Reserve , the two - handle rally screamed to me that another shoe is about to fall .
What are you hearing ? "
The candor of his response was refreshingly surprising .
" The story on the street is that there are major problems at Bear Stearns . "
When someone asked if the rumors were true , there was some nervous laughter before he shifted the course of the conversation .
I 've been hearing that chatter for some time .
Obviously , it had now found its way into the inner sanctum of Bear itself .
I offered further food for thought that large hedge funds , many of which have healthier balance sheets than the bulge - bracket banks , would eventually buy some of the battered brokers .
Those thoughts were met with raised eyebrows and incredulous stares .
Ironically , The Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend that Citadel Investment Group was eyeing Bear Stearns before J.P. Morgan Chase JPM , - 0.84 % scooped it up for two bucks a share .
The speed at which the confidence in and credibility of Bear Stearns deteriorated is astounding .
CEO Alan Schwartz said on Tuesday that the balance sheet , liquidity and solvency were n't issues for the venerable institution .
Three days later , in his words , the " rumors became reality . "
We often talk about social mood and risk appetites being key elements of our financial fate .
The Bear Stearns saga speaks to this point .
There are two potential scenarios battling for my mindshare as I digest the demise of Bear Stearns , Northern Rock , Carlyle Capital , Thornburg Mortgage and a multitude of smaller yet inextricably linked players .
The first is the frightening implications for our finance - based , debt - dependent globalized economy that is woven together by trillions of dollars of complex derivatives .
We 've spoken about this repeatedly -- from how we got here to the risks of moral hazard to our current crossroad -- and the proverbial rubber must now choose a road .
Read related column .
If the debt unwind is more pervasive than the tech bubble and real estate mania that preceded it -- as I believe it is -- the painful and prolonged comeuppance has a long way to go .
It 's not a pretty scenario nor is it one that I would like to see come to pass .
We must draw lines of distinction between optimism , faith and hope , however , as the latter has never been a viable investment vehicle .
The second scenario is one that would seemingly surprise most people .
Given how crowded the short side currently is in the credit space -- and it's that way for good reason -- the potential for a massive trading rally remains viable .
If credit players turn and try to cover at the same time , we could conceivably see a melt up in the equity space .
Throughout my career , " bid wanted " situations have always proven to be an excellent entry point on the long side .
We 've yet to see that in stocks -- nor have we seen the type of volatility spike that typically accompanies such conditions -- but we have seen it in the credit markets .
This past Friday , according to the Wall Street Journal , there were times when major dealers were unable to sell Treasurys .
The other potential upside catalyst , albeit one that is impossible to game and will take time to unfold , is the possibility that FASB 157 , the accounting rule designed to force banks to move Level III assets back on their balance sheets , caused financial institutions to over - compensate when they marked to market .
That 's likely a back half of the year story but the perception thereof could dramatically shift sentiment if and when that occurs .
See related Minyanville article .
Finally , perhaps the most ironic reason to be on the lookout for a rally is the doom and gloom around the street .
When Minyanville began monitoring the roadmap to ruin last spring , the markets were at all - time highs and we were branded Cassandras .
Now , you can't pick up a paper or turn on the tube without someone calling for the end of the world .
Without doubt , the level at which Bear Stearns was sold will create a process of price discovery as traders attempt to wrap their arms around what financial firms are worth .
That will clearly create near - term volatility and with it , tremendous two - sided risk .
If you were to ask me last year what it would take to become more constructive in this sector , however , I would have pointed to four primary points .
The first is time and price , both of which have come to pass .
The second is analyst recommendations , which have flipped from table - pounding buys to a litany of " sells " and " holds . "
The third is sentiment , which is now the mirror image of where we were .
Finally , I would have said that a high profile bankruptcy would be needed and Bear Stearns qualifies as such .
It 's important to remember that the Depression was an era rather than an event .
During that period , equities enjoyed rallies that littered hope amongst the despair .
I believe we 're in for a similarly sullen stretch , one that lasts a lot longer than most people think .
But that does n't mean we can't rally along the way .

Remember , nobody makes money in true bear markets .
Not even the bears .
Two leading Democrats , Jane Harman and Jay Rockefeller admitted that they knew that the CIA intended to destroy the tapes of interrogations of a leading al - Qaida figure , but never knew for sure that the destruction was carried out .
The startling news raises serious questions of acts of malfeasance by the Bush Administration and nonfeasance by Democratic members .
In his defense of this breathtaking decision to destroy evidence being sought in federal courts , Gen .
Hayden claimed :
“ The tapes posed a serious security risk , ” Hayden wrote .
“ Were they ever to leak , they would permit identification of your CIA colleagues who had served in the program , exposing them and their families to retaliation from al - Qaida and its sympathizers . ”
The important thing to remember is that in 2002 , many people were publicly discussing criminal charges for those who carried out the president ’s orders to torture suspects .
I testified in Congress about criminal acts that appear to have been ordered by the President and wrote about the fact that both illegal surveillance and torture are criminal offenses .
Indeed , Administration officials complained about such threats for its employees .
The decision appears to have been to destroy the evidence — despite the fact that the tapes were being sought by federal courts and would most certainly be sought in future proceedings in Congress and the courts .
These Democratic members appear to have had knowledge of both the official use of torture ( which is a crime ) and the stated intention to destroy evidence ( which is also a crime ) .
Yet , again , they remained totally silent and passive .
They remained silent and passive even while courts were lied to by the government in high - visibility cases .
They remained silent and passive even as a public debate swirled around these very issues . <
Moreover , if Democratic members knew , so did the President of this plan .
It now remains up to the untainted Democrats to act and demand answers from everyone , including their own party .
This is a matter that raises serious criminal allegations that run from officials engaged in torture to government lawyers engaged in false statements to a president who ordered the commission of an act defined as a war crime .
While the Democrats have struggled to protect the President from a confrontation on torture ( as with the Schumer and Feinstein vote on Mukasey ) , they will now need to protect themselves against their own constituents .

April 29 , 2008  -- Stephanie Ragusa flashes the same smile in all three mugshots , but there 's nothing charming about the middle - school teacher 's third arrest in six weeks for alleged sexual encounters with Florida teens .
Ragusa , 29 , was arrested Monday in Hillsborough County when investigators saw her leaving a 16 - year - old high school student 's house just before 1 p.m.
Authorities say Ragusa had continued having sex with the teen victim since her initial March 13 arrest for one relationship and her April 15 arrest for another .
Ragusa was in court today to face two felony counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor .
A judge ruled that she will be held without bond as the court begins to wade through more than 10 charges related to alleged sexual activity with minors .
Ragusa had no comment for local reporters as she was lead into the courtroom .
Attempts by ABC
News to reach her attorney , Robert Herce , were unsuccessful .
The teenager connected to Monday 's arrest was one of the two boys she had already been accused of having sex with , according to Debbie Carter , a spokeswoman for the Hillsborough County Sheriff 's Office .
Unclear was which of the two teens was involved in Monday 's incident .
Ragusa was originally arrested in mid-March and charged with five counts of lewd and lascivious battery for what sheriff 's deputies described to ABC News at the time as a consensual relationship with a 14 - year - old student .
That affair , according to the sheriff 's office , lasted from January through May 2007 , and included intercourse and oral sex .
Some of the alleged encounters took place in her apartment , others in her Lexus .
The boy in that case identified Ragusa as having a distinctive pair of tattoos on " either side of the groin area . "
A school resource officer first asked the boy about the rumors and then detectives investigated .
They had the boy call Ragusa under police direction and she " admitted to the interaction , " the sheriff 's office said at the time .
After the first arrest , a judge set Ragusa 's bond at $ 12,500 , which she posted after she spent a weekend in jail .
She made no public comment upon her release .
The Hillsborough County Sheriff 's Office said at the time of the arrest that they were investigating other possible victims .
" As the result of her first arrest , we seized her phone and through the phone records , found a second victim , " Carter said .
Authorities interviewed the second victim , who admitted to detectives that he had an ongoing relationship with Ragusa that began in February 2007 when he was a student of hers at Davidsen Middle School .
" She provided him with alcohol , she provided contraceptives , " Carter said , adding that he admitted to having sex with Ragusa more than 20 times during their yearlong affair that overlapped with the first victim 's relationship .
Like the first victim , the second teen was able to identify Ragusa in part through her tattoos .
Authorities arrested Ragusa for a second time on April 15 and charged her with lewd and lascivious conduct and two counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor , according to the sheriff 's office arrest report .
She was released on a $ 22,500 bond .
Detectives were following up with one of the two victims yesterday when they saw Ragusa leaving the victim 's residence and arrested her on the spot , charging her with two more counts of unlawful sex with a minor .
According to court documents cited by the Tampa Tribune , Ragusa continued to contact the student victim after her April 15 arrest and went to his house Monday to discuss the criminal case against her when the two went into a bedroom to have sex .
After the March arrest , school administrators in Hillsborough County put Ragusa on paid leave and letters were sent home to parents assuring the safety of their children and the quality of their educators .
It was revealed that Ragusa lied in her job application , failing to acknowledge a previous driving under the influence charge .
She was also reprimanded by the school district for using profanity in front of students and sent to anger management classes and then transferred from one school to another for " physically restraining " a female student who threatened to walk out of her classroom .
" I can't imagine any scenario where we would invite her back , " Linda Cobbe , Hillsborough County district spokesman , told ABC News .
" The principal at her current school was already planning on not offering her a job again . "
The Hillsborough County school district has earned a rather dubious reputation for female teachers engaging in sexual relationships with students , including the high - profile affair between Debra Lafave and a 14 - year - old .
Lafave is serving three years of house arrest and seven years ' probation after entering a guilty plea .

Well , BushCo . and his little helpers will never change .
As you know , Bush is trying to make an agreement with the Maliki government to keep our troops and the Black Water 's of Paul Bremerland active in Iraq after the 2002 UN resolution ends in December .
Separation of Powers and all that good jazz means little to Cheney or Bush who only care about executive power so they 're trying to forge a SOFA agreement without the consent of Congress .
Notice at the end of the clip he calls it a " standard SOFA . "
There is nothing " standard about the Iraq war , " my friends . "

Lindsey Graham , John McCain 's puppet does what he 's told ...
Instead , U.S. military intervention is authorized under the second prong of the 2002 resolution .
This authorizes the president to " enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq . "
This has allowed the Bush administration to satisfy American law by obtaining a series of resolutions authorizing the United States to serve as the head of the multinational force in Iraq .
But here 's the rub .
The most recent U.N. resolution expires on Dec. 31 , and the administration has announced that it will not seek one for 2009 .
Instead , it is now negotiating a bilateral agreement with the Iraqi government to replace the U.N. mandate .
Whatever this agreement contains , it will not fill the legal vacuum .
That 's because the administration is not planning to submit this new agreement to Congress for its explicit approval .
Since the Constitution gives the power to " declare war " to Congress , the president can't ignore the conditions imposed on him in 2002 without returning for a new grant of authority .
He cannot substitute the consent of the Iraqi government for the consent of the U.S. Congress .
Matthew sez :
But of course Bush ( and John McCain ! ) want a permanent American military presence in Iraq , but they know congress wo n't authorize such a presence .
Hence , the only solution available to them is to ignore the law and the constitution and just keep the troops .
Ackerman and Hathaway suggest merely continuing the U.N. resolution for another year , which will give the next president a legal basis for doing whatever he 's been granted a mandate to do ( since no matter who wins the troops can't be made to suddenly vanish in a puff of smoke in January ) .
But , obviously , for that to happen the administration would need to concede that it lacks the legal and constitutional authority to ignore congress and they 'll never do that .
Hillary Clinton did a good job of exposing this problem in her questions at the hearing also .
We would n't have believed it , either , but the WowWee Dragonfly is attracting some unusual attention -- owners are reporting their bots are being attacked by hawks .

WASHINGTON 
At the outset of the Iraq war , the Bush administration predicted that it would cost $ 50 billion to $ 60 billion to oust Saddam Hussein , restore order and install a new government .
Five years in , the Pentagon tags the cost of the Iraq war at roughly $ 600 billion and counting .
Joseph E. Stiglitz , a Nobel Prize - winning economist and critic of the war , pegs the long - term cost at more than $ 4 trillion .
The Congressional Budget Office and other analysts say that $ 1 trillion to $ 2 trillion is more realistic , depending on troop levels and on how long the American occupation continues .
Among economists and policymakers , the question of how to tally the cost of the war is a matter of hot dispute .
And the costs continue to climb .
Congressional Democrats fiercely criticize the White House over war expenditures .
But it is virtually certain that the Democrats will provide tens of billions more in a military spending bill next month .
Some Democrats are even arguing against attaching strings , like a deadline for withdrawal , saying the tactic will fail as it has in the past .
A private draft prepared by the Australian Institute of Criminology for the Attorney - General 's Department says that piracy stats are n't backed up by fact and that copyright holders " failed to explain " how they came up with financial loss figures .
The draft questions whether the techniques used by copyright holders ( record companies etc. ) to determine piracy statistics are valid and if the data they come up with is accurate .
The Business Software Association , an international software body , claimed that in the year 2005 piracy in Australia cost them $ 361 million .
The draft says these figures are “ unverified and epistemologically unreliable . ”
It even goes so far as to call some of the stats used by copyright holders “ absurd , ” and adds that “ of greatest concern is the potentially unqualified use of these statistics in courts of law . ”
According to the draft , the RIAA ’s Australian arm , the MIPI did not know how they calculated piracy stats , because the IPFI never told them .
Strange ?
Maybe that ’s just how things work with international organisations .
The reasoning behind the statements in the draft is that anti-piracy organisations calculate losses by counting each pirated good that is sold .
They are making the assumption that each person who buys a pirated CD , for example , would have bought an original one instead .
This can not be backed up , as many of those people might not have been able to buy , or might not have bought the original CD .
The draft concluded with a statement asking for statistics that cannot be verified to be withdrawn .
“ Either these statistics must be withdrawn or the purveyors of these statistics must supply valid and transparent substantiation . ”
The truth on the other hand : Why Most Artists Profit from Piracy !

The USS Cole was attacked by al - Qaeda in 2000
The deployment of the USS Cole is being seen as a warning to Syria which - along with Iran - backs the opposition .
The Western - backed government and the opposition have repeatedly failed to agree a deal to end political impasse .
A US official quoted by news agencies said the move was " a show of support for regional stability " .
" We are very concerned about the situation in Lebanon .
It has dragged on very long , " the unnamed senior US official told Reuters news agency .
A US defence official quoted by Reuters said the USS Cole , a guided - missile destroyer , had left Malta on Tuesday and was heading toward Lebanon .
He stressed that once in position , it would not be within visible range of Lebanon but " well over the horizon " .
The news agency said the official had indicated that the destroyer could be replaced by the USS Nassau , an amphibious assault ship , which is currently heading towards the Mediterranean .
The USS Cole was attacked in the port of Aden , Yemen , in October 2000 by water - borne al - Qaeda suicide bombers .
Seventeen US sailors were killed and the ship was badly damaged .
Postponed 15 times
Lebanon has not had a president since 24 November , when pro-Syrian Emile Lahoud left office .
Parliament has repeatedly failed to elect a successor amid an ongoing row over candidates .
The election was postponed once again this week , and is now due to take place on 11 March .
It was the 15th such delay .
There are fears that the political deadlock could lead to escalating sectarian violence .
Recent clashes between supporters of rival factions have further raised tensions and prompted several countries to advise their citizens against travelling to Lebanon .
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al - Faisal warned earlier this month that the country was " on the verge of civil war " .
The setting up of an international tribunal to try the assassins of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri is another source of tension .
Syria is widely blamed for the February 2005 car bomb attack that killed Hariri , but Damascus has denied any involvement .
Two months after the assassination , amid US - led international pressure , Syria withdrew its troops from Lebanon , ending a 29 - year occupation .
WASHINGTON  Federal drug regulators believe that a contaminant detected in a crucial blood thinner that has caused 81 deaths was added deliberately , something the Food and Drug Administration has only hinted at previously .
“ F.D.A. ’s working hypothesis is that this was intentional contamination , but this is not yet proven , ” Dr. Janet Woodcock , director of the Food and Drug Administration ’s drug center , told the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations in written testimony given Tuesday .
A third of the material in some batches of the thinner heparin were contaminants , “ and it does strain one ’s credulity to suggest that might have been done accidentally , ” Dr. Woodcock said .
Two weeks ago , Food and Drug Commissioner Andrew C. von Eschenbach told a Senate subcommittee that the contamination was done “ by virtue of economic fraud , ” but he quickly withdrew the remark , saying he had “ probably gone too far . ”
Obama - supporting union pres says Penn flap exposes ' credibility problem ' for Clinton Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday April 8 , 2008

Print This Email This Barack Obama 's campaign is going after rival Hillary Clinton for continuing to seek advice from her former chief strategist who met with representative of the Colombian government on behalf of a trade deal she opposes .
" I think she has a credibility problem , " Teamsters president James Hoffa said Tuesday on a conference call convened by the Obama team .
Hoffa said reports that Mark Penn , who has lost his title as Clinton 's cheif strategist but continues to advise her campaign , met with Colombian representatives about an upcoming free - trade deal between that country and the US undercut Clinton 's efforts to paint herself as an opponent to such deals .
Penn 's meeting has put Clinton in a sticky spot as Congress prepares to consider a free - trade pact with Columbia being pushed by President Bush .
Clinton has said she will vote against the deal , which Hoffa compared to the North American Free Trade Agreement signed into law by former President Bill Clinton .
Hoffa said NAFTA 's aftermath is " still devastating America , " and he said it is hypocritical for Clinton to continue seeking advice from Penn .
Penn met with the Colombian officials in his role as CEO of Burson - Marsteller Worldwide , his international lobbying firm , and not the Clinton campaign .
Nonetheless , he was removed as the campaign 's chief strategist after news of his meeting leaked out .
The Washington Post reports that Penn is still a Clinton adviser , participating in messaging meetings and helping her prepare for next week 's debate .
" The smartest thing she can do is jettison him , " Hoffa said .
Obama , who has been endorsed by the Teamsters and several other unions that are part of the Change to Win coalition , faced his own problems on trade issues before last month 's Ohio primary .
Austan Goolsbee , an Obama economic adviser , reportedly downplayed the Illinois senator 's criticisms of NAFTA in a meeting with Canadian officials .
Clinton 's advisers took every opportunity to exploit the flap in the days leading up to the vote in Ohio , which has been hit hard by a loss of manufacturing jobs in NAFTA 's wake .
Some observers said questions over Obama 's NAFTA position contributed to his loss in the state .
In an attempt to downplay the Penn fallout , Clinton tried to tie the issue back to Obama and accused him of not doing more to distance himself from his unpaid outside adviser .
Hoffa said there was " no comparison " between the two scenarios because Penn 's firm was paid to lobby on Colombia 's behalf while Goolsbee 's discussions with a Canadian official were much more informal and not as contradictory with Obama 's positions as was originally reported .
" It 's a big difference if it 's somebody on the payroll , " he said , " who does n't have enough sense to say " that meeting could be a conflict of interest .

The carry trade refers to the act of borrowing from countries with low interest rates , lending to countries with high interest rates , and profiting from the interest rate differential .
It is based on the hope that exchange rates will not move too much against you to wipe out the profit .
In other words , it is gambling that a condition known as uncovered interest parity will not hold .
In the past , this strategy has been a money - maker .
That is , uncovered interest parity is a plausible hypothesis that empirical studies usually reject .
One thing I learned at the conference is that ETFs now make this strategy easy for small retail investors to pursue .
The above chart is a simulated past performance from the ETF 's website .
It is similar to some of the results shown by the discussants at the conference .
Does the increased ease of the transaction mean that the market will become more efficient , so the strategy will no longer be profitable ?
Perhaps .

So I 'll end the shilling with this : to everyone who 's bought stuff from me .
Your support is really helping me and my wife through a lean period right now , and I 'm thrilled beyond words to have the chance to be a little tiny part of your holidays .

Prominent Shiite politicians deserted beleaguered Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim Jafari on Saturday and revealed that they had started looking for a less polarizing figure who could help overcome differences blocking the formation of a unity government .
Kurdish , Sunni Arab and secular blocs all have lined up against Jafari , but members of the governing Shiite bloc had stuck with him .
U.S. and Iraqi officials said last week that the White House also had sent a message to Iraqi officials asking that the prime minister be replaced .
Opposition to Jafari among Kurds and Sunni Arabs has been a main stumbling block to the formation of a new government since the Dec. 15 elections .
On Saturday , a senior U.S. military official said the resulting leadership vacuum had allowed sectarian violence to fester and spread .
“ What we want to see is the rule of law with the government in control and governing in Iraq , ” said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ It ’s tough when the government has not been stood up . ”

Violence has increased since the Feb. 22 bombing of an important Shiite mosque in Samarra , which unleashed a spate of reprisal attacks by Shiite militia forces against Sunni Arabs .
Shiite calls for the interim prime minister to resign came after the other blocs formally reiterated their opposition to his candidacy and Jafari made last - ditch efforts to convince them that he should remain .
The most damaging development for Jafari , a religious scholar with close ties to Iran , is the erosion of his support within the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq , or SCIRI , a dominant Shiite party .
A high - level strategist suggested Saturday that the party would be willing to withdraw its support for Jafari if it was unable to persuade the other ethnic and religious blocs to accept him .
“ If we find that the road is blocked and other alliances are insisting on him leaving , and we cannot form the national unity government , then we will do what we must to have an agreement between all the blocs for the sake of the political process , ” said Ridha Taqi .
“ We do n’t want to hinder the political process . ”

Hasan Shammari of Al Fadila al Islamiya , or the Islamic Virtue Party , said that stymied attempts to form a unity government and vigorous opposition by the Kurdish Alliance and the Sunni Arab bloc had moved the Shiite coalition to reexamine Jafari ’s bid .
SCIRI had its own candidate for prime minister , economist Adel Abdul Mehdi , Shammari said .
Mehdi was edged out by a single vote in an election within the Shiite alliance in February .
“ They think that Jafari is not suitable for the coming era , ” Shammari said , adding that his own party and some members of a third alliance group opposed Jafari .
Three other alliance members including the slate associated with firebrand Shiite cleric Muqtada Sadr expressed their continuing support for Jafari on Saturday .
The Shiite alliance holds 130 of the 275 seats in parliament .
But the members of the Cabinet must be approved by a two - thirds margin , so the Shiites need the support of other parties .

Jafari ’s hold on the prime minister ’s office has been tenuous since the close vote in February within the Shiite alliance .
Kurds , who hold the presidency , accuse Jafari of hoarding power and failing to restore Kurdish communities in Kirkuk and other northern cities subjected to “ ethnic cleansing ” under Saddam Hussein .
Sunni Arabs blame Jafari for allowing militias to assume control of police forces that have carried out waves of illegal arrests and death squad operations in Sunni Arab areas .
Taqi said U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad had delivered a “ personal message ” from President Bush to Abdelaziz Hakim , the Shiite alliance leader , last week , expressing his hope that Jafari would step down .
The ambassador asked that the president ’s message also be relayed to Jafari , Taqi said .
U.S. Embassy officials denied Taqi ’s account , but a U.S. official , speaking on condition of anonymity last week , confirmed it .
Shiite politicians have expressed anger at what they consider U.S. meddling in Iraqi politics .

A Western diplomat interviewed Saturday said that four Shiite political groups within the Shiite bloc , including SCIRI and Fadila , had given an ultimatum to Jafari : Gain the support of the Kurds , Sunni Arabs and secular parties within three days , or step aside .
“ They kind of had this deadline for Jafari , ” said the diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
The cracks in the fragile Shiite alliance have come at a crucial time .
Representatives of the four main political groups , including Kurds , Sunni Arabs and the secular national blocs , are putting the finishing touches on the formal structure of the government before making political appointments .
The office of President Jalal Talabani on Saturday announced the creation of a ministerial committee on national security , which will develop intelligence , military and police policies .

The U.S. military official suggested that the government crisis was hurting efforts to curtail militias and contributing to security woes and confusion on the streets .
He said a new government could at least formulate a clear - cut policy on the sectarian militias and what coalition forces could do to disarm them .
The political wrangling took place amid a backdrop of continuing violence Saturday .
U.S. military officials announced the death of a Marine in “ enemy action ” in the western province of Al Anbar but did not specify the type of attack or area where the incident had occurred .
Military officials said a U.S. helicopter had crashed south of Baghdad while on patrol .
It was unclear whether the chopper had been shot down , and military officials did not immediately provide information about its make or the fate of the crew .
An Iraqi army sergeant was killed in Baqubah in a firefight between Iraqi soldiers and insurgents who were attempting to steal a dump truck , U.S. military officials said .
The soldiers killed four insurgents , according to the U.S. military .
Insurgents killed five men on a road north of Baqubah while they were driving home from a friend ’s funeral .

The Federal Reserve on Sunday announced two initiatives designed to bolster market liquidity and promote orderly market functioning .
Liquid , well - functioning markets are essential for the promotion of economic growth .
First , the Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to authorize the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to create a lending facility to improve the ability of primary dealers to provide financing to participants in securitization markets .
This facility will be available for business on Monday , March 17 .
It will be in place for at least six months and may be extended as conditions warrant .
Credit extended to primary dealers under this facility may be collateralized by a broad range of investment - grade debt securities .
The interest rate charged on such credit will be the same as the primary credit rate , or discount rate , at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
Second , the Federal Reserve Board unanimously approved a request by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to decrease the primary credit rate from 3 - 1/ 2 percent to 3‑1/ 4 percent , effective immediately .
This step lowers the spread of the primary credit rate over the Federal Open Market Committee ’s target federal funds rate to 1/4 percentage point .
The Board also approved an increase in the maximum maturity of primary credit loans to 90 days from 30 days .
The Board also approved the financing arrangement announced by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and The Bear Stearns Companies Inc .

Frequently asked questions
Let me just say that I am highly resistant to conspiracy theories in general .
I think most of them are the product of too much time and abject stupidity .
That being said I also realize that there have been real events that would have fallen into that category , to a cynic like myself , if they had been proposed as conspiracy theories while they were being carried out .
So , I ’m skeptical overall but aware of the fact that some twisted stuff does actually get planned ( and executed ) from time to time .
And that brings me to the Council on Foreign Relations .
I recently wrote about why Ron Paul supporters should get behind Obama for a simple reason — foreign policy .
The idea was that McCain is batshit crazy , and that if you support Ron Paul you ’ll do what you have to in order to keep McCain out of office .
The first Digg comment on my article was very short , very cryptic , and led me to do some research ( dammit , I ’ve been socially engineered ! ) .
It was simply :
Obama = CFR
I started searching my dictionary of Internet acronyms , e.g. FTW , but could n’t come up with anything .
So I did what anyone else would do in that situation — I went to Google and Wikipedia .
The Organization
So here ’s some information about the group collected mostly from Wikipedia but also from other sources :
Wikipedia : The Council on Foreign Relations
The stated goal of the organization is , “ to “ find and nurture the next generation of foreign policy leaders . ”
Today it has about 4,300 members ( including five - year term members ) , which over its history have included senior serving politicians , more than a dozen current and former Secretaries of State , national security officers , bankers , lawyers , professors , CIA members and senior media figures .
The council is considered by many to be the most powerful agent of U.S. foreign policy outside of the state department ( weasel words acknowledged , citation needed ) .
Seven American presidents have addressed the Council , two while still in office – Bill Clinton and George W. Bush .
The organization has been accused ( WW ) of pushing for One World Government by those opposed to the loss of U.S. sovereignty .
They have an extensive list of corporate members .
Over 50 % of council meetings are held off the record in order to , according to their own site , “ … encourage frankness among participants who may be hesitant to express new or developing ideas if they feared that they would be publicized . ”
For the council meetings that are on record there is extensive transparency ; meetings are made available through transcripts , webcasts , video and audio stream .
So What ’s The Conspiracy ?
So the conspiracy theory is pretty simple here : the idea is that this group gets together the most powerful people in America and talks about how to go about creating a One World Government .

Is the CFR Really For Global Government ?
Again , some of that is genuinely scary but some of it could easily be taken in a number of ways and blown out of proportion .
Besides , the question at hand is whether or not the CFR specifically is into this whole one - world - government idea .
As it turns out , yes — they appear to be .
One of the videos linked above asks the viewers to go and read what the president of the CFR wrote about national sovereignty in a global world .
So I did .
Here ’s the link , followed by some rather scary excerpts .
Sovereignty and Globalisation | Richard N. Haass , President of the CFR
The near monopoly of power once enjoyed by sovereign entities is being eroded .
As a result , new mechanisms are needed for regional and global governance that include actors other than states .
This is not to argue that Microsoft , Amnesty International , or Goldman Sachs be given seats in the United Nations General Assembly , but it does mean including representatives of such organisations in regional and global deliberations when they have the capacity to affect whether and how regional and global challenges are met .
Moreover , states must be prepared to cede some sovereignty to world bodies if the international system is to function .
Globalisation thus implies that sovereignty is not only becoming weaker in reality , but that it needs to become weaker .
States would be wise to weaken sovereignty in order to protect themselves , because they cannot insulate themselves from what goes on elsewhere .
Sovereignty is no longer a sanctuary .
Necessity may also lead to reducing or even eliminating sovereignty when a government , whether from a lack of capacity or conscious policy , is unable to provide for the basic needs of its citizens .
This reflects not simply scruples , but a view that state failure and genocide can lead to destabilising refugee flows and create openings for terrorists to take root .
And people wonder where the whole CFR / One World Government conspiracy comes from .
If an author of a conspiracy theory novel were to write a manifesto in the voice of an evil mastermind , this is the kind of stuff they would produce , except this might be a bit over the top for fiction .
The author just said it may become necessary , in this new “ global ” world , to reduce ( or eliminate ) a country ’s sovereignty when it fails to take care of its people .
Is that what we did in Iraq ?
Does this Haass character realize that someone posted this on the Internet ?
Then he busts out with this gem :
The goal should be to redefine sovereignty for the era of globalisation , to find a balance between a world of fully sovereign states and an international system of either world government or anarchy .
So lets assume he does n’t want anarchy … ( admittedly just a wild guess )
The goal should be to redefine sovereignty for the era of globalisation , to find a balance between a world of fully sovereign states and an international system of world government .
Ok , new question — who thinks the CFR is secretly pursuing world government ?
Have we considered the possibility that they ’re not trying to keep it a secret ?
I mean , if it was supposed to be a covert plan why would they post an op - ed piece , written by their president , on the Internet ?
So yes , my finding after a few hours of research is that YES , the CFR — at least at some level — is for one world government .
But does this necessarily imply evil ?
My Thoughts on the Philosophy of One World Government
So here ’s where I ’ll switch things up on you guys a bit .
I do n’t think the notion , by itself , of a one world government is bad .
Star Trek had a one world government and they seemed quite happy ( and free ) .
Sure , it was fiction , but still .
In other words , just because there ’s a one world government does n’t mean we ’re all watched from the sky and can have our nervous system disabled if we pay our cable bill late .
Ca n’t this be done in a good way , given some more growing up on our part ?
Like 200 or 1000 years from now ?
I think so .
Definitely .
In fact , I think it ’s THE way to go .
Philosophically I feel that as we evolve as a people ( humans ) we ’ll have less need for borders and labels of “ us ” or “ them ” .
It ’ll just be “ we ” , and that ’s fine with me .
I think it ’s superior .
It ’ll go from what we have now to what Norway has , then to Star Trek , and then when we are really advanced we wo n’t need much government at all .
As an example , Obama and Jimmy Carter are members .
Do we really think they are for implanting RFID chips in everyone so that they can sit at the top , turn us all into slaves , and roll around in the money we make for them ?
I call bullshit .
Again , IF ( and I stress IF ) there is some faction of the CFR that is for this kind of elitist takeover of the world ( that feels weird to type ) , very few people in the CFR even know about it .
I ’d be willing to bet that most people who are for one world government — including those in the CFR — are envisioning the Star Trek version , not the evil empire version .
And if Obama and Carter subscribe to the idea they most certainly are in that category .
So that ’s one option — the big happy Star Trek Federation option .
The other option is the evil RFID / big - brother / monitor your thoughts and nuke your soul from orbit option .
Not pleasant — I think we all agree on that .
Unfortunately , that ’s the model of global government that has the best ( only ? ) chance of being put into place given our current situation .
And on a practical level , given our current situation , I think the best thing we can do as Americans who are also long - term global citizens , is to focus on America independently and ensure that it ’s strong going forward .
In other words , a broken America is no good for anyone .
I like my air travel analogy — if you lose cabin pressure you put YOUR mask on first , then you help others .
This is n’t a selfish act ; it ’s how to do the most good .
So the question really comes down to this : which model of one world government is the CFR pushing for ?
And ca n’t we as logical people accept that all members of the CFR are not necessarily ( and most likely are NOT ) for the evil - empire version ?
I think so .
Conclusion
So what can we take away from all of this ?
In my opinion , if you add everything up and throw in some logic and common sense , here ’s what we end up with :
There is most likely one or more elite organizations , no doubt made up of very wealthy , influential people who are doing what they can to make themselves more wealthy and more powerful — at the expense of the ignorant and underprivileged .
Perhaps some within the CFR believe in this , perhaps they do n’t .
There are also some organizations who believe in the “ Star Trek ” version of One World Government .
Fewer borders , central government , less war , happier people , etc , etc. Cultural evolution .
Progress .
I have very little doubt that many within the CFR have this vision in mind .
The question is how many have the other , evil version in mind instead ( if any ) .
And that ’s where I ’ll leave it .
I do know that I ’ll be paying much more attention to these different groups , especially the CFR .
I ’ll be watching for news about the North American Union , the North American Superhighway , the Amero , National ID , and all those types of programs .
It ’s interesting stuff , if nothing else .
On a side note , one thing all this does do for me is reframe the immigration debate .
Given the fact that Obama and Hillary are CFR members , perhaps their stance on “ the path to citizenship ” is just part of their shared vision of a unified North America ?
Maybe not , but it ’s a possibility .
Anyway , feel free to drop me an email or leave a comment below if you have any thoughts . :

Census of Marine Life - affiliated scientists , plumbing the secrets of a vast underwater mountain range south of New Zealand , captured the first images of a novel “ Brittlestar City ” established against daunting odds on the peak of a seamount – an underwater summit taller than the world ’s tallest building .
Its cramped starfish - like inhabitants , tens of millions living arm tip to arm tip , owe their success to the seamount ’s shape and to the swirling circumpolar current flowing over and around it at roughly four kilometers per hour .
It allows Brittlestar City ’s underwater denizens to capture passing food simply by raising their arms , and it sweeps away fish and other hovering would - be predators .
Discovery of this marine metropolis , announced today along with important new insights into seamount geology and physics , highlighted a month - long April expedition to survey the Macquarie Ridge aboard the Research Vessel Tangaroa of New Zealand ’s National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research , host of the Census of Marine Life seamount programme , CenSeam .
The voyage was largely funded by the New Zealand Foundation for Research , Science and Technology .

Formed at least 12.5 million years ago , Macquarie Ridge stretches 1,400 km south from New Zealand to just above the Antarctic Circle .
A multi-disciplinary scientific team from New Zealand and Australia extensively sampled this intriguing ecosystem deep beneath waves familiar to fishing trawlers but rarely reached by scientists .
Usually corals and sponges dominate seamount peaks , filtering food that arrives on the current .
Biologists aboard the Tangaroa believe Brittlestar City is the first dense aggregation of another filter feeder , the brittlestar , ever found atop a seamount , and they credit the summit ’s shape and extraordinary current circumstances there , 750 - meters above the ocean floor .
They photographed brown - black brittlestars numbering hundreds per square meter and estimate tens of millions of them populate the 100 square km flat top of the seamount .
Brittlestars are echinoderms , relatives to starfish , sea cucumbers , sea lilies , and sea urchins .
The two brittlestar species observed were tentatively identified via photographs sent from the ship to the Museum Victoria in Melbourne , Australia .
There , taxonomist Tim O’Hara determined that the smaller , densely packed brown - black brittlestar species , found living arm tip to arm tip on the sand and cobble substrate of the peak , were likely Ophiacantha otagoensis or Ophiacantha fidelis .
Larger orange - red species discovered down the seamount ’s flanks , filmed waving arms in the current to collect passing food , were likely Ophiacantha rosea .
“ We were excited to see such a huge assemblage of brittlestars on the Macquarie Ridge seamount .
Not only is it amazing to see a vast array of one type of organism but the implications of the find for our understanding of the relative uniqueness of seamount assemblages are potentially far - reaching . ” said ecologist Dr. Ashley Rowden of NIWA .

Piecing together the Brittlestar City ecosystem
The ship towed special sleds to collect seamount organisms .
Thousands of specimens of all kinds were gathered from eight seamounts in over 30 sled collections and now fill almost 1,600 vials , jars and bags , to be sent from NIWA to taxonomists in New Zealand , Australia and overseas .
Full identifications may take many years .
The eight biologists on board believe some species collected have never before been recorded in the region while some may be new to science .
A Deep Towed Imaging System ( DTIS ) vehicle , meanwhile , designed and constructed at NIWA by Peter Hill , was “ flown ” over the seafloor , snapping still photos and high definition video of the animals and their habitat .
DTIS captured over 20 hours of video and thousands of photos of a part of Earth never seen before by humankind .
An abundance of deepwater cardinal fishes ( Epigonus species ) was found sheltering below a rock ledge on the seamount .
In the lee of the rock , biologists believe , the fish could both conserve energy and access food .
Several Morid cods ( family Moridae ) were found in the folds of a large bubblegum coral ( nearly two meters high , and likely hundreds of years old ) .
These fish were also believed to be finding shelter from the current and perhaps benefiting in other ways from their close association with the coral .
Oceans worldwide contain an estimated 100,000 seamounts rising at least one km above the seabed ; fewer than 200 have been sampled in any detail .
Undersea mountains can be highly productive and biodiverse , sometimes host unique species and serve as feeding grounds for fishes , marine mammals and seabirds .
They also may serve as important way stations for marine migrations .
The scientists ’ work sheds light on factors underpinning seamount biodiversity , suggesting ways to improve their environmental management .
The odd shape and circumstances of Brittlestar City seamount
Tangaroa ’s acoustic “ multibeam ” technology mapped the sizes , shapes and depths of the Macquarie Ridge .
The Brittlestar City seamount displayed several geological faults affecting its shape and geomorphology .
The odd rectangular edge of its southern peak was formed by the intersection of two perpendicular faults .
Because the upper surface is relatively flat , experts believe it was once at sea level , or slightly submerged .
The flat topography suggests wave erosion occurred during the last ice age 18,000 years ago , when sea level was low .
Although the base of Brittlestar City seamount is 850 meters below surface , its peak is just 90 meters underwater .
Intrigued by the dynamics of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current as it passed over and through ridge gaps , physicists aboard the Tangaroa calculated its speed over the top of the seamount at a “ rattling ” 2 knots ( about 4 km per hour ) .
“ This current is estimated to be 110 to 150 times larger than all the water flowing in all the rivers of the world , ” says Dr. Mike Williams of NIWA .
“ In terms of the world ’s oceans , New Zealand sits right beside the motorway . ”
The Macquarie Ridge creates a strategic marine junction .
“ Understanding this current will shed light on how much water flows into the Pacific as opposed to continuing to circumnavigate Antarctica .
This is important for understanding , and ultimately predicting , the impact of potential changes in the current on climate throughout the Southwest Pacific . ”
Data was collected from nine strings of metering instruments , anchored a year earlier in two gaps or " choke points " in the Ridge , through which the current squeezes .
Experts were astonished to find the current had pushed the top instruments on some strings to a depth of one kilometer below the surface .
Scientists also took this ocean area ’s temperature and salinity readings for the first time since the 1960s , looking for climate - related changes , and obtained water samples to measure and compare levels of marine life nutrients .
April ’s Tangaroa voyage continues the recent collaboration of scientists in New Zealand ( NIWA , TePapa and other institutes ) and Australia ( CSIRO , Museum Victoria and other institutes ) to document invertebrate and fish life on seamounts that range between the two countries .
The Census of Marine Life CenSeam programme
Seamount biology research over the years has been uncoordinated , causing lost opportunities for collaborative studies , inefficient sampling that left major gaps , and data that ca n’t be compared across regions .
In Newport , Oregon , in 2003 , some 33 seamount scientists from 11 countries reviewed the state of knowledge on seamounts and agreed on three key themes that should guide world research :
1 ) What factors drive seamount community structure , diversity and endemism both at the scale of whole seamounts and individual habitats within seamounts ?
The diversity and rates of peculiarity of organisms inhabiting a seamount is often high but can vary considerably , even between seamounts close to each other .
CenSeam scientists are looking for factors that influence a seamount ’s biodiversity and community structure , e.g : depth , shape , size , location , isolation , surface productivity , hydrology , geological age , and substrate type .
The knowledge may lead to tools for modeling and predicting biodiversity levels on tens of thousands of unexplored seamounts .
It will also help answer questions such as how much of the ocean ’s biodiversity is contributed by seamounts ?
How significant are seamounts as incubators for new species ?
2 ) What processes cause differences between seamounts , and between seamount and non-seamount regions ?
CenSeam scientists also focus on the evolutionary biology of seamounts , including such questions as :
* Are seamount organisms genetically isolated ?
* To what degree do seamounts interact with surrounding deep habitats , both pelagic ( in the water column ) and benthic ( ocean floor ) ?
* What factors support the high biomass often observed on seamounts ?
3 ) How do fisheries impact seamounts ?
Many offshore fisheries are known to exploit seamounts , but information detailing where , how frequently and to what extent seamounts are fished , is lacking .
CenSeam research questions therefore include :
* How much have seamounts been impacted already ?
* How much do various fisheries depend on seamounts ?
* What is the likely impact of fishing activities on seamount communities ?
CenSeam officially joined the Census of Marine Life in February 2005 .
CenSeam ’s secretariat is hosted by NIWA in Wellington , New Zealand .
CenSeam , alongside the other Census of Marine Life programmes , will extend until 2010 and consists of three key phases .
In 2009 CenSeam will enter its final phase , which will concentrate on information integration and dissemination .
“ Seamount ecosystems are extremely valuable to the global environment .
They are also the target of offshore commercial fishing , and are of potential interest for seabed mining , ” says Dr. Rowden of NIWA .
“ The long term impacts of such commercial activities need to be quantified . ”

The recent conviction of Mormon polygamist leader Warren Steed Jeffs on two felony counts of rape as an accomplice is a huge public relations victory for Utah and Arizona authorities who have been under intense pressure to crack down on so - called " spiritual " marriages of underage girls .
But it is doubtful that the conviction of the leader of the nation 's largest polygamist sect  considered by his followers to be God 's prophet on Earth  will stop illegal marriages of children or stem polygamy .
That Jeffs is headed for prison will not even mean a new prophet will reign over the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .
Insiders say Jeffs ' second - in - command , Wendell Nielsen , is running day - to - day operations of the church but that Warren , reminiscent of top organized crime figures , will rule the FLDS from behind bars .
That includes deciding who will marry whom in the religion .
More than 50 years of government indifference toward widespread abuses within the FLDS has allowed the sect to grow from fewer than 400 people scratching out a living on the remote Arizona Strip in 1953 to an economic powerhouse with more than 10,000 members spread across the West .
The sheer size and wealth of the rapidly reproducing congregation , which accounts for only a quarter of the estimated number of polygamists in Arizona and Utah , have forced law enforcement to focus on the most notorious crimes while conceding that little will be done to stem a practice that violates the Arizona and Utah constitutions and has been found unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court .
Still , Jeffs ' high - profile arrest while on the FBI 's 10 Most Wanted List and subsequent conviction on felony charges  which could bring him life in prison  have focused the nation 's attention on abuses that have flourished for decades within the closed FLDS society .
Authorities hope the conviction will give hope to those trapped inside polygamist groups , that it will encourage more victims of child and spousal abuse to step forward .
Brock Belnap , county attorney of Washington County , Utah , hailed the victim in the Jeffs case , 21 - year - old Elissa Wall , as a courageous " pioneer " who challenged FLDS leaders and endured shunning by family and friends to bring Jeffs to justice .
" She stood and took the stand and withstood attacks on her credibility and reputation with honor and with dignity , " Belnap said .
Wall was only 14 when she was forced to marry her 19 - year - old first cousin in a fundamentalist ceremony performed by Warren Jeffs in April 2001 .
Wall left the FLDS in 2004 and filed a lawsuit in December 2005 against Jeffs and the church .
Her suit spurred Washington County prosecutors to file criminal charges against Jeffs in April 2006 .
Jeffs was arrested in August 2006 during a traffic stop on Interstate 15 northeast of Las Vegas and has been held in jail at Washington County 's Purgatory Correctional Facility .
Jeffs is scheduled to be sentenced November 20 and could then be transferred to Arizona , where he faces criminal charges in Mohave County .
Wall testified that she felt " trapped " and had to go forth with the arranged marriage and submit to unwanted sexual relations with her cousin to stay in the good graces of religious leaders who she believed controlled her spiritual destiny .
" I hope that all FLDS girls and women will understand that no matter what anyone may say , you are created equal , " Wall told a horde of reporters after the verdict .
" You do not have to surrender your rights or your spiritual sovereignty . "
Authorities argue that Jeffs ' conviction will make it clear to fundamentalist leaders that they will be dealt with harshly if they use religious indoctrination to convince young girls that their only hope of salvation is to marry into polygamous families .
" Let this verdict be a warning to anyone else who believes that forcing young girls to marry older men is acceptable and without consequence , " declared Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff moments after an eight - member jury returned the verdict on September 25 .
Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard concurred , stating that the " verdict sends a message that forcing girls under the legal age of consent to ' marry ' older men is not only unacceptable , it is illegal . "
Beyond the swaggering press releases and away from the glare of staged news conferences on the plaza outside Utah's Fifth District Court , where Judge James L. Shumate presided over the weeklong show trial , a far greater battle was being fought and quietly won by polygamy advocates .
As Jeffs , 51 , is facing five years to life in prison , the attorneys general in Utah and Arizona have announced they will not prosecute consenting adults for engaging in plural marriage .
" We are not going to go out there and persecute people for their beliefs , " Goddard declared .
The states ' capitulation to polygamy marks a monumental victory for fundamentalist Mormons who have steadfastly held to the practice as their central religious tenet since faithful men were first commanded to marry multiple wives in the 1830s by Mormon founder Joseph Smith .
At first glance , the concession may seem a practical approach for the states at a time when gay marriage and civil unions are increasingly becoming more accepted .
But the problems that occur within closed , polygamous societies go far beyond predatory sexual behavior , as New Times has revealed in articles about the culture dating back to 2003 ( see " Polygamy in Arizona " ) .
Left unchecked for half a century , the FLDS grew into a powerful theocracy that exerts immense control over all aspects of the social , political , economic , and cultural life of its followers .
Nearly all its members have been born into the patriarchal polygamous sect in which the Bill of Rights has been jettisoned and replaced with a doctrine of strict obedience to religious leaders .
The cost to governments of trying to dismantle the FLDS theocracy has been extraordinary .
Arizona and Utah have spent millions of dollars in the past three years attempting to regain secular control of town councils , police departments , schools , and private property seized by the FLDS in Hildale , Utah , and adjoining Colorado City , Arizona .
The effort has had mixed success , with polygamists still firmly in control of the town councils and the police force that the two towns share .
It is naive to believe that fundamentalist Mormon polygamists will suddenly give up what they believe is God 's command to enter into polygamous marriages with teenage girls just because Warren Jeffs has been convicted .
" They will just keep on doing the underage marriages , even though he 's been convicted , " says Benjamin Bistline , a former FLDS member and the author of a history of the fundamentalist Mormon polygamists .
Bistline , 72 , predicts " there may be less underage marriage in Colorado City because so many of the people have left and gone to the other places , but they will still do them in other places . "
Indeed , the FLDS operates compounds in places like rural Texas , western Canada , and Mexico , and experts believe that more and more residents of the Hildale - Colorado City community are moving to other areas to escape the crackdown by law enforcement .
So the problem of young girls being forced into sexual relationships with older men is not disappearing ; it is relocating .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the landmark Reynolds case in 1878 " that plural marriages shall not be allowed . "
Regarding George Reynolds ' argument that he should not be charged with bigamy in the Utah Territory after taking a second wife , the Supreme Court ruled that laws prohibiting polygamy cannot be ignored simply because polygamy is a religious belief .
To do so " would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land and , in effect , to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself , " the court ruled .
" Government could exist only in name under such circumstances . "
In recent years , polygamy has become the focus of a raging legal debate in the United States , with scholars sharply divided over whether it should be legalized or whether laws prohibiting it should remain on the books .
But the Reynolds decision remains in place .
The practical difficulties of enforcing prohibitions against polygamy , however , have pushed Arizona and Utah attorneys general to ignore Reynolds and the constitutions in their own states that also ban polygamy .
Instead , Terry Goddard and Mark Shurtleff have opted to focus on laws they can more easily prosecute rather than attack the institution of polygamy .
" We determined six or seven years ago that there was no way we could prosecute 10,000 polygamists and put the kids into foster care , " Shurtleff told the Reuters news agency last June .
" There 's no way that we have the money or the resources to do that . "
Even if the states wanted to arrest thousands of polygamists , history has shown it is extremely difficult to get plural wives to testify against their husbands .
Without victims , prosecutors say the cases would crumble .
Arizona and Utah have now retreated to a position of selective enforcement of the most dangerous crimes occurring within polygamous groups .
" Both states have decided to focus law enforcement efforts on crimes within the polygamous communities that involve child abuse , domestic violence , and fraud .
Laws regarding these issues will be strictly enforced , " the attorneys general said in joint statement .
The de facto decriminalization of polygamy will allow the FLDS to continue its rapid expansion , creating more fertile ground for an array of civil rights abuses , underage marriages being the most notorious .
Equally disturbing is the practice by the FLDS of driving young boys deemed spiritually unworthy from their homes to reduce competition for child brides .
Once considered one of the twin " relics of barbarism , " along with slavery , Mormon polygamy was targeted for eradication by the federal government beginning in the mid-1850s .
By the late 19th century , Congress had passed laws that jailed polygamists , prevented them from holding public office , and threatened to destroy the finances of the Mormon Church .
The government backed down on its polygamy jihad only after Mormon Church leaders renounced polygamy in 1890 .
The repudiation of polygamy angered many Mormon faithful , some of whom splintered from the Salt Lake City - based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints and continued to quietly practice what is known as The Principle .
Fundamentalist Mormons faced a century of legal attacks and recriminations from the mainstream church , which excommunicated members who engaged in polygamy .
Police raided fundamentalist enclaves , jailing religious leaders , in 1932 , 1944 , and 1953 .
Despite the hardships , the fundamentalists have been steadfast in their belief that polygamy must be practiced for believers to reach the highest realms of a heaven known as the celestial kingdom .
They have also insisted that the government has no right to stop the free exercise of sacred covenants including plural marriage  even if those involve minors .
Goddard and Shurtleff 's joint decision to ignore constitutional prohibitions means that the police raids and mass arrests of men accused of simply engaging in plural marriage are things of the past .
As long as underage girls are not coerced into cohabitation , the governments of Utah and Arizona will leave the polygamists alone .
Evidence and testimony presented during the trial show that law enforcement 's concession on polygamy leaves Jeffs and succeeding FLDS leaders wide latitude to continue to exert despotic control over thousands of people born into the sect .
Elissa Wall and her cousin , Allen Steed , explained in testimony how FLDS leaders psychologically manipulate sect members .
It was clear from what they told jurors that , no matter what happens to Warren Jeffs , the FLDS has no intention of moving away from polygamy .
Jeffs ' conviction will only strengthen the resolve of FLDS members to resist secular authorities , says Isaac Wyler , a former FLDS member who was excommunicated in 2004 .
" The first thing coming to their minds is , he 's being persecuted , " Wyler says .
" And that just makes him all the more the prophet . "
Utah 's criminal case against Warren Jeffs was two - pronged : First , the state had to prove that Allen Steed repeatedly raped Elissa Wall .
Second , it had to convince the jury that Jeffs was ultimately responsible because he forced Wall to marry Steed knowing that unwanted sexual relations would follow .
This task was made more difficult by the unusual circumstances surrounding the case .
At the time of the trial , Steed had not been charged with rape .
That is because , according to Wall 's testimony , she viewed her cousin as both the perpetrator of a crime and a victim of FLDS religious indoctrination .
Prosecutors did not call Steed , 26 , as a witness , relying instead on Wall 's compelling testimony to build their case .
Wall 's description of the days leading up to her arranged marriage and her first sexual encounters with her cousin in the spring and summer of 2001 paints a chilling portrait of life inside the FLDS .
In early April 2001 , Wall testified , she learned from her stepfather , late FLDS Bishop Fred Jessop , that three young women had been selected for marriage .
" It did not cross my mind that he was speaking about myself , " she said , although marriage was " something every girl in that society wants someday . "
A few days later , during another family meeting , Jessop put his arm around Wall and her mother and said church leaders had found a husband for 14 - year - old Elissa .
" I was shocked .
I was so young .
There were many girls older than myself who were eligible for marriage , " she testified .
The name of her husband , Jessop told her , would be revealed to her later .
On April 21 , 2001 , Wall learned that her husband was to be her first cousin , Allen Steed , 19 .
That night , Wall testified , she told Jessop : " Father , I know who I 'm going to marry .
I just want you to know I 'm not going to do it . "
Wall said she then called Warren Jeffs and demanded a meeting with his father , then FLDS Prophet Rulon Jeffs .
She testified that she asked Warren to tell Rulon that she did not want to marry Steed .
Warren Jeffs called back the next day saying he had arranged for Wall to immediately meet with Rulon .
Wall testified that she went to the prophet 's house in Hildale and kneeled next to Rulon and told him her objections .
" I felt like I was too young to get married . "
She asked him to " please at least find someone other than my cousin . "
Wall testified that the stroke - weakened , 90 - year - old prophet told her to " follow your heart . "
Wall testified that she was elated that Rulon Jeffs was listening to her objections .
But later that day , she testified that Warren Jeffs crushed her hope of getting out of the marriage .
" Your heart is in the wrong place , " she quoted Warren as telling her , indicating that she had to go forward with the marriage .
Wall said she again told Warren that she " was n't going to do it . "
But ,
Wall testified , she also knew she had no choice but to marry Steed .
" I felt trapped , " she told jurors , fearing that to refuse the arranged marriage would result in being kicked out of her home and shunned by family .
She also would be forfeiting her chance at marriage in the future , she believed , thus losing her only opportunity for eternal salvation .
FLDS doctrine requires a woman to be married to reach the celestial kingdom .
Wall testified that Warren Jeffs , who was considered to have equal authority to his father at the time ( Rulon Jeffs died in 2002 ) , " completely overlooked that this was something I did not want to do or was willing to do . "
Despite her objections , wedding preparations moved quickly forward , with her mother and sister spending most of the next two days preparing her dress .
As the gown was being fitted , Wall testified , " I kept thinking I was getting ready for death . "
On the morning of April 23 , 2001 , Wall told the jury , she was placed into a van with Steed and driven more than three hours to a remote hotel in Caliente , Nevada , where she and her cousin , along with two other couples , were to be married .
" I could n't believe I was in this situation , " she testified .
" I felt like I had no control over anything . "
Wall told jurors that Warren Jeffs performed the marriage ceremony , with Rulon Jeffs and Fred Jessop present .
" I really did n't comprehend what he was saying " during the ceremony , Wall said .
" I sat there with my head hanging . "
She said she remained silent when Warren Jeffs asked her to confirm her vow .
She said , " Warren looked at me and repeated " the vow while directing Wall 's mother to stand next to her .
" My mother just squoze my hand hard , and I said , ' I do . ' "
Warren , she testified , then directed the couple to kiss .
" I gave him a peck on the lips and dropped his hand , " she said .
Warren then put their hands back together and said , " Go forth and replenish the Earth and raise good priesthood children . "
At the time of her marriage , Wall had never dated a man , let alone kissed one .
She said she knew nothing about sex and did not know how babies were conceived .
But she knew that the command " go forth and replenish the Earth " meant she was to be the mother of Steed 's children .
Immediately after the ceremony , Wall said , she fled across a courtyard and locked herself in a bathroom , where she cried .
She said in court , " I could not believe I just got married . "
Wall testified that no sexual activity occurred on the wedding night .
" I was fully clothed under my nightgown , " she said .
Nor did any sexual relations occur on the four - day honeymoon to Phoenix , New Mexico , and Colorado .
Wall said she told Steed she " hated " him and did not want to be with him .
But that did not stop
Steed from attempting to initiate sex , Wall testified .
Steed ,
Wall said , was " touching me on my private parts " and that she was " terrified and horrified . "
Upon their return to Hildale a few days after the honeymoon , Wall told the jury , Steed exposed his genitals to her while they were sitting in a park one evening .
Wall said she ran away from Steed and retreated to her mother 's room inside Fred Jessop 's sprawling house  home to dozens of his wives and scores of children .
Wall said she went back to Steed 's room , which was next to her mother 's room , early the next morning .
Upon returning to her husband 's room , Wall said , Steed once again made sexual advances .
Wall said Steed told her this was what he was supposed to do .
" This is what married people do , " she quoted him as saying .
" Do n't you want to have a baby ? "
" Not with you , " Wall said she told Steed .
Wall said she left the bedroom and returned to her mother 's room , where she stayed for the next several nights .
When she finally returned to Steed 's bedroom , he again made unwanted sexual advances .
" It 's time for you to be a wife , " Wall said Steed told her .
" Please do n't do this , " Wall said she told Steed as he undressed her .
" He just ignored me , " she said .
Wall said she protested his actions , telling him , " I do n't know what you 're doing .
I 'm really uncomfortable with this , so please , stop . "
But , Wall testified , Steed persisted .
" I was sobbing .
And my whole entire body was just shaking because I was so , so scared .
I did n't say anything .
He just laid me on the bed and had sex . "
After he was done , Wall said , Steed " rolled over and went to sleep . "
She said she was overwhelmed with feelings that she had done something evil .
" I did n't understand why he had done what he had just done , " she told the jury .
She testified that she locked herself in the bathroom and swallowed two bottles of over - the - counter painkillers , intending to commit suicide .
" The only thing I wanted to do was just to die , " she testified .
Instead , she threw up the medicine and was faced with being the wife of a man she despised .
Within days after her initial sexual experience , she and Steed went to an FLDS enclave in British Columbia .
Wall said she told a sister living there that she " hated " Steed and " did n't want to be close to him . "
The unhappy couple returned to Hildale in June 2001 , and Wall arranged a private meeting with Warren Jeffs .
She testified that she told Jeffs that Steed was " touching me and doing things to me that I was just not fully comfortable [ with ] . "
She said she told Jeffs that she did not love Steed and did not see herself having a family with him .
" I begged him to please give me a release " from the marriage , she testified .
Instead ,
Wall said , Jeffs admonished her , telling her that " I needed to repent .
I was not living up to my vows .
I was not being obedient . "
She said Jeffs ordered her to " go home and give your self to Allen , who is your priesthood head , mind , body , and soul , and obey him without question . "
Wall testified that she did not use sexually explicit language in her discussions with Jeffs because such terms are never used in the FLDS culture .
After her meeting with Jeffs ,
Wall testified that she again told Steed , " I [ do n't ] see a future for us . "
But a few days later , Steed again had sex with her against her will , she testified .
Asked in court if she had a choice about having sex with Steed if he insisted , she said , " Absolutely not . "
She said the FLDS religion requires a woman to submit to her husband and religious leader :
" He was my priesthood head and husband . "
Elissa Wall 's riveting testimony left Warren Jeffs ' defense team with little choice but to put Allen Steed on the stand .
Jeffs ' best hope for acquittal would rest in the credibility of a devout follower with a 10th - grade education .
After Steed was read his Miranda rights warning him that his sworn testimony could be used against him legally , he blurted out a statement that revealed his unwavering loyalty to the prophet .
" I do n't believe Warren Jeffs has ever done anything wrong , " the truck driver stated without a question being posed by Jeffs ' lead defense attorney , Walter Budgen .
Steed testified that he knew Wall was " concerned " about the marriage but that he had no reservations .
Budgen moved Steed quickly through the marriage ceremony with no attempt to refute Wall 's testimony about her strong reluctance to be married .
Instead , Budgen focused on Steed 's enthusiastic reaction to the marriage .
" I was on cloud nine , " Steed testified , although he admitted that he was not " particularly " in love with his child bride .
Steed acknowledged that the marriage was " rough and rocky " at the beginning and that his attempts to initiate sexual contact with Wall were rebuked .
" I really did n't know how to make her like me , " Steed testified .
" I would write her letters and tell her I loved her . "
In one such letter , Steed misspelled Elissa 's first name , injecting a second " l . "
Steed testified that Wall told him she wanted to wait five years to have children .
In FLDS theology , the only reason for sexual relations is procreation .
Rather than backing off , Steed said he stepped up his sexual overtures by exposing himself to Wall one evening at the park .
" I tried to help her feel more familiar and move things along , " Steed explained to the jury .
Steed testified that Wall " was surprised " and that he " could tell " that he " had offended her . "
He said his young bride forgave him a few days later .
At this point in his testimony , Elissa Wall exited the courtroom leaving her notebook on the floor with the words " He Was Abusing Me " written in large letters .
Clearly worried about how the park exposure incident would affect the jury , Steed tried to put distance between the incident and the first time the couple had sexual intercourse .
Steed testified that a " month or so " after he had exposed himself , Wall initiated sexual relations with him one evening after he had returned from a long day at work .
" She rolled up next to me and asked me to scratch her back , " Steed testified .
" One thing led to the next , " he said , and the couple had consensual sex .
" I felt like she was ready to go forward , " Steed testified .
With sharply conflicting versions of the first sexual encounter , the credibility of Steed and Wall would be crucial in the jury 's deliberations .
Wall weathered a blistering cross-examination by defense attorney Tara Isaacson that attempted to portray her as a strong - willed opportunist hoping a criminal conviction against Jeffs would bolster her chances of collecting a large financial settlement in her pending lawsuit .
Steed , however , crumbled under incisive questioning from Utah Assistant Attorney General Craig L. Barlow .
" Allen contradicted himself several times on the stand , " jury foreman David Finch said after the verdict .
Barlow forced
Steed to recant the date of the first sexual encounter , moving it back to within days of his exposing himself to Wall in the park , instead of the " month or so " he had originally said under oath .
Barlow , chief of the Utah AG 's children 's justice division , also stripped away the veneer of FLDS righteousness surrounding sexual relationships .
Steed testified that after Wall initially told him she wanted to wait five years to have a baby , she reconsidered and told Steed she might be ready in as soon as a few months .
Barlow seized on the opening and suggested to Steed that rather than waiting five years to initiate sex to conceive a baby , Steed had chosen to have sex with his 14 - year - old cousin at the earliest possible date .
" Would n't you ? "
Steed quickly replied .
Steed 's cocky answer strongly suggested that his motivation for sex had little to do with FLDS spirituality and far more to do with raging teenage testosterone .
Barlow drove home the unspoken subtext with a curt rejoinder dripping with unmistakable disdain .
" I 'm not you , Mr. Steed . "
Barlow then exposed the lengths to which FLDS loyalists , like Steed , would go to keep their leader , Warren Jeffs , from going to prison .
Barlow played a tape recording of Warren Jeffs telling the story of how a former prophet had lied to authorities to get out of prison .
The prophet had said he would renounce polygamy , but , once out of jail , he continued the practice .
Jeffs preached that such deceit is acceptable if it is done to free oneself from enemies and continue to obey the " heavenly father . "
Barlow then asked Steed if he would disobey the laws of man if the prophet requested him to do so .
" I would , " Steed replied .
Warren Jeffs rose slowly and looked straight ahead as the court clerk read the verdict .
Count one : " guilty . "
Count two : " guilty . "
Jeffs did not move .
His expression never betrayed whatever thoughts passed through his mind .
His supporters , who occupied the back row of Judge Shumate 's courtroom , remained silent .
Across the courtroom , Elissa Wall wept quietly .
Allen Steed was not present .
But he will be back in court soon .
Steed 's shaky testimony led prosecutors to charge him the next day with one count of rape .
There was no visible reaction to the verdict in Colorado City .
Children rode their bikes and played on trampolines while women went shopping at the local market and picked wild peas .
The few stores in town were open .
Life in the nation 's largest polygamist community , at least for the time being , went on as if nothing had happened .
And , perhaps , nothing really has .
The FLDS has long expected to come under criminal fire for conducting underage marriages .
The faithful , according to exhibits presented in the trial , see the conviction of Warren Jeffs as nothing more than another test of religious beliefs that have been under attack by civil authorities for more than 150 years .
Jeffs began moving many FLDS members out of Hildale and Colorado City several years ago to more secure compounds in South Dakota , Texas , Colorado , Canada , Mexico , and other unknown locations .
Former FLDS members believe a massive temple under construction on a sprawling ranch near El Dorado , Texas , is the new FLDS headquarters .
Benjamin Bistline , the FLDS historian who still lives near Colorado City , says these remote areas outside Arizona and Utah are the most likely places for underage marriages to occur in the future .
" They have total control at the compounds , " Bistline says .
" People can't get out , and no one can get in . "
There 's no doubt in Bistline 's mind that the FLDS will not only continue polygamy but will continue the practice of adult males marrying young girls .
Like in the Hercules parable , the government may have cut off the head of the Hydra by convicting Jeffs  authorities certainly maintain publicly that they have  but more heads will grow back .
The only way to stop polygamous practices , Bistline says , " is to arrest [ FLDS adherents ] and put them all in jail . "
He is saying that attacking the abuses of polygamy on a piecemeal basis will be relatively easy for the FLDS absorb .
The FLDS views the battle over polygamy in celestial terms and appears willing and capable of withstanding the occasional legal attack by law enforcement .
Experts believe there is no way that FLDS faithful will abandon the practice of the prophet selecting which girls and women will marry which men , and when .
The faithful believe it is his divine right to place even underage girls in such marriages , despite what civilian law dictates .
" We can not shirk , leave it , or turn it aside for even a moment  without [ an ] element [ of ] cowardliness growing in our souls , " Sam Barlow , son of the late prophet John Y. Barlow , told FLDS priesthood members in a 2002 sermon as it became clear that Utah and Arizona were conducting criminal investigations into underage marriages .
Sam Barlow urged fellow priesthood members to be prepared for criminal charges .
" Brethren , if you are the person that gets targeted , let 's get close to the Lord , let 's be united , stand together , and you be the one that takes a hit without flinching . "
In court the other day , Warren Steed Jeffs did not flinch .

It was the climax of George W. Bush 's video introduction at the Republican convention : the moment at Yankee Stadium during the 2001 World Series when he threw a pitch all the way to home plate .
The video ended , and the conventioneers cheered as Mr. Bush strode onto a stage shaped like a pitcher 's mound .
Well , live by the pitch , die by the pitch .
When you campaign as the man on the mound , the great leader whose arm rescues Americans in their moment of need , they expect you to deal with a hurricane , too .
Mr. Bush made a lot of mistakes last week , but most of his critics are making an even bigger one now by obsessing about what he said and did .
We can learn more by listening to men like Jim Judkins , particularly when he explains the Magic Marker method of disaster preparedness .
Mr. Judkins is one of the officials in charge of evacuating the Hampton Roads region around Newport News , Va .
These coastal communities , unlike New Orleans , are not below sea level , but they 're much better prepared for a hurricane .
Officials have plans to run school buses and borrow other buses to evacuate those without cars , and they keep registries of the people who need special help .
